Controlling symptoms of breathing problems can decrease time lost from work or school.This medication must be used regularly to be effective.

{"seq_id": "c5ab63e3-218b-4e4d-a11e-c9615d9e2b56", "title": "Variants of Coronavirus", "text": "【0】Variants of Coronavirus\nWhat Is a COVID-19 Variant?\n---------------------------\n\n【1】Viruses are always changing, and that can cause a new variant, or strain, of a virus to form. A variant usually doesn't affect how the virus works. But sometimes they make it act in different ways.\n\n【2】Scientists around the world are tracking changes in the virus that causes COVID-19. Their research is helping experts understand whether certain COVID-19 variants spread faster than others, how they might affect your health, and how effective different vaccines might be against them.\n\n【3】How Many Coronaviruses Are There?\n---------------------------------\n\n【4】Coronaviruses didn't just pop up recently. They're a large family of viruses that have been around for a long time. Many of them can cause a variety of illnesses, from a mild cough to severe respiratory illnesses.\n\n【5】The new (or “novel”) coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is one of several known to infect humans. It's probably been around for some time in animals. Sometimes, a virus in animals crosses over into people. That's what scientists think happened here. So this virus isn't new to the world, but it is new to humans. When scientists found out that it was making people sick in 2019, they named it as a novel coronavirus. Experts call these strains SARS-CoV-2.\n\n【6】How Do Variants Happen?\n-----------------------\n\n【7】Coronaviruses have all their genetic material in something called RNA (ribonucleic acid). RNA has some similarities to DNA, but they aren't the same.\n\n【8】When viruses infect you, they attach to your cells, get inside them, and make copies of their RNA, which helps them spread. If there's a copying mistake, the RNA gets changed. Scientists call those changes mutations.\n\n【9】These changes happen randomly and by accident. It's a normal part of what happens to viruses as they multiply and spread.\n\n【10】Because the changes are random, they may make little to no difference in a person's health. Other times, they may cause disease. For example, one reason you need a flu shot every year is because influenza viruses change from year to year. This year's flu virus probably isn't the exact same one that circulated last year.\n\n【11】If a virus has a random change that makes it easier to infect people and it spreads, that variant will become more common.\n\n【12】The bottom line is that all viruses, including coronaviruses, can change over time, and there have been several variants already that have contributed to the pandemic. As of May 2022, the CDC only lists one as a Variant of Concern (VOC) and that is the Omicron variant.\n\n【13】What Is the Omicron Variant?\n----------------------------\n\n【14】The Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) was first detected in specimens collected on Nov. 11, 2021, in Botswana. Experts in South Africa first reported the Omicron variant to the World Health Organization (WHO) on Nov. 24, 2021. They discovered the variant after COVID-19 infections suddenly began to go up.\n\n【15】The WHO grouped Omicron as a VOC. This category means the variant might have higher transmissibility, cause more intense disease, and may be less likely to respond to vaccines or treatments. \n\n【16】The Omicron variant is now the dominant strain in the U.S.\n\n【17】Experts are keeping a close eye on how the variant spreads or develops. So, far, the Omicron variant has been found to carry a higher risk of reinfection compared to other variants and while it can still be deadly, most infections are not as serious.\n\n【18】Breakthrough infections are possible with the Omicron variant even if you’re fully vaccinated. However, COVID-19 vaccines and boosters are still effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalizations, and death.\n\n【19】Current PCR tests for COVID-19 can effectively find Omicron cases. Experts found that one specific PCR test doesn't identify one of the three target genes (called the S gene dropout) in people infected with Omicron. Because of this, these tests can specifically mark positive Omicron cases and, because of that, can detect this variant faster than with previous surges.\n\n【20】In the meantime, experts recommend protecting yourself by getting the vaccine or a booster if you’re eligible for it. Wear a mask and maintain social distance if the COVID-19 community level is high or if you prefer to be masked.  Also wear a mask if you or a family member are at high risk for severe COVID-19 disease even if the community level is at medium.\n\n【21】If you test positive for COVID or if you’ve come in close contact with someone who has it, follow the CDC guidelines for quarantine and isolation. Call your doctor if you notice symptoms.\n\n【22】**Omicron “stealth” variant (BA.2)**: Scientists call it Omicron BA.2 as opposed to the original Omicron variant, BA.1. At first, scientists thought BA.2 wasn’t as contagious as BA.1 and would soon fade away. That didn’t happen, and starting in January 2022, BA.2 appeared to be at least as easy to transmit as BA.1.\n\n【23】As of the end of February 2022, BA.2 showed signs of spreading more easily than other variants, though it didn’t seem to cause more serious symptoms. The World Health Organization has said that BA.2 is a “variant of concern.”\n\n【24】The best protection is still the coronavirus vaccine. Current vaccines and boosters seem to work well against BA.2, protecting against initial infection as well as against serious illness if you do get infected.\n\n【25】**Omicron subvariant BA.2.12.1**: As of early May 2022, it made up almost 43% of COVID-19 infections in the U.S. Some early research suggests it’s spreading faster than other Omicron subvariants. The CDC is looking into how it spreads and how well available treatments and the COVID vaccine work against it.\n\n【26】**Omicron variants BA.4 and BA.5.** These were first spotted in South Africa. There, they’ve “rapidly replaced” BA.2, according to early research. As of May 2022, the CDC listed BA.4 and BA.5 as variants of concern.\n\n【27】Earlier Coronavirus Variants\n----------------------------\n\n【28】**Alpha (B.1.1.7).** In late 2020, experts noted gene mutations in COVID-19 cases seen in people in southeastern England. This variant has since been reported in other countries, including the U.S. Scientists estimate that these mutations could make the virus up to 70% more transmissible, meaning it could spread more easily. Some research has linked this variant to a higher risk of death, but the evidence isn't strong.\n\n【29】The mutation on the Alpha variant is on the spike protein, which helps the virus infect its host. This is what COVID-19 vaccines target. These vaccines make antibodies against many parts of the spike protein, so it's unlikely that a single new mutation in the Alpha variant will make the vaccine less effective.\n\n【30】**Beta (B.1.351).** This variant was first found in other countries, including South Africa and Nigeria. The Beta variant appears to spread more easily than the original virus but doesn't seem to cause worse illness.\n\n【31】**Gamma (P.1).** In January 2021, experts spotted this COVID-19 variant in people from Brazil who'd traveled to Japan. By the end of that month, it was showing up in the U.S.\n\n【32】The Gamma variant appears to be more contagious than earlier strains of the virus. And it may be able to infect people who've already had COVID-19. A report from Brazil confirms that a 29-year-old woman came down with this variant after an earlier coronavirus infection a few months before.   \n\n【33】Some early research suggests that the variant's changes might help it evade antibodies (made by your immune system after an infection or a vaccine) that fight the coronavirus. A lab study shows that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine can neutralize the fast-spreading Brazil strain. But more research is needed.\n\n【34】**Delta (B.1.617.2).** This variant was spotted in India in December 2020. It caused a huge surge in cases in mid-April 2021, quickly spreading across the globe. \n\n【35】By March 2022 its presence had diminished considerably due to the prevalence of Omicron And the WHO had downgraded it from a VOC to a VBM in April. It is no longer considered a threat to public health in the U.S.\n\n【36】Research suggests that changes to the spike protein made the Delta variant up to 50% more transmissible than previous COVID-19 variants.\n\n【37】**Mu (B.1.621).** Experts first spotted this COVID-19 variant (pronounced m'yoo) in Colombia in January 2021. Since then, countries in South America and Europe have reported outbreaks of Mu.\n\n【38】In the U.S., the CDC says Mu reached a peak in June 2021, when it made up less than 5% of variants going around the country. As of early September, it had been steadily declining.  \n\n【39】**R.1.** Scientists first detected R.1 in a number of countries, including Japan. There was an outbreak at a Kentucky nursing home in March 2021, when an unvaccinated health care worker passed it to about 45 other staff and residents.\n\n【40】The WHO labeled it a “variant under monitoring” in April 2021, meaning some of its characteristics may pose a future risk to humans.\n\n【41】As of October 2021, the CDC hadn't labeled R.1 as a variant of concern or interest.\n\n【42】**Epsilon**, **Theta**, and **Zeta** were at one point listed as variants of interest and were downgraded by the WHO. They are still being monitored.\n\n【43】The First Variants\n------------------\n\n【44】Earlier in 2020, when the pandemic was new, you might have heard that there was more than one strain of the new coronavirus. Is it true? The answer appeared to be yes.\n\n【45】The theory about different variants of the new coronavirus came from a study in China. Researchers were studying changes in coronavirus RNA over time to figure out how various coronaviruses are related to each other. They looked at 103 samples of the new coronavirus collected from people, and they looked at coronaviruses from animals. It turned out that the coronaviruses found in humans weren't all the same.\n\n【46】There were two types, which the researchers called “L” and “S.” They're very similar, with slight differences in two places. It looks like the S type came first. But the scientists say the L type was more common early in the outbreak.\n\n【47】What to Expect\n--------------\n\n【48】The virus that causes COVID-19 will probably keep changing. Experts may find new variants. It's impossible to predict how those virus changes might affect what happens. But change is just what viruses do.\n\n【49】NEWSLETTER\n\n【50】Stay Up-to-Date on COVID-19\n\n【51】Sign up for the latest coronavirus news.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "fa336156-8d0b-4760-a963-c557ff86bf4b", "title": "High Blood Pressure Prevention", "text": "【0】High Blood Pressure Prevention\nAbout 1 in every 4 American adults has high blood pressure, also called hypertension, which is a major risk factor for heart and kidney diseases, stroke, and heart failure. High blood pressure is especially dangerous because it often gives no warning signs or symptoms. Fortunately, you can find out if you have high blood pressure by having your blood pressure checked regularly. If it is high, you can take steps to lower it. Just as important, if your blood pressure is normal, you can learn how to keep it from rising.\n\n【1】How Can I Prevent High Blood Pressure?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【2】You can prevent high blood pressure by:\n\n【3】*   **Maintaining a** **healthy weight****.** Being overweight can make you two to six times more likely to develop high blood pressure than if you are at your desirable weight. Even small amounts of weight loss can make a big difference in helping to prevent and treat high blood pressure.\n*   **Getting regular** **exercise****:** People who are physically active have a lower risk of getting high blood pressure -- 20% to 50% lower -- than people who are not active. You don't have to be a marathon runner to benefit from physical activity. Even light activities, if done daily, can help lower your risk.\n*   **Reducing salt intake:** Often, when people with high blood pressure cut back on salt, their blood pressure falls. Cutting back on salt also prevents blood pressure from rising.\n*   **Drinking alcohol in moderation, if at all:** Drinking too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure. To help prevent high blood pressure, limit how much alcohol you drink to no more than two drinks a day. The \"Dietary Guidelines for Americans\" recommends that for overall health, women should limit their alcohol to no more than one drink a day.\n*   **Reduce stress****:** Stress can make blood pressure go up, and over time may contribute to the cause of high blood pressure. There are many steps you can take to reduce your stress. The article on easing stress will get you started.\n\n【4】Other nutrients may also help prevent high blood pressure. Here's a roundup of the research:\n\n【5】*   **Potassium****.** Eating foods rich in potassium will help protect some people from developing high blood pressure. You probably can get enough potassium from your diet, so a supplement isn't necessary (and could be dangerous without a doctor's oversight). Many fruits, vegetables, dairy foods, and fish are good sources of potassium.\n*   **Calcium****.** Populations with low calcium intakes have high rates of high blood pressure. However, it has not been proven that taking calcium tablets will prevent high blood pressure. But it is important to be sure to get at least the recommended amount of calcium -- 1,000 milligrams per day for adults 19 to 50 years old and 1,200 mg for those over 50 (pregnant and breastfeeding women also need more) -- from the foods you eat. Dairy foods like low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese are good sources of calcium. Low-fat and nonfat dairy products have even more calcium than the high-fat types.\n*   **Magnesium****.** A diet low in magnesium may make your blood pressure rise. But doctors don't recommend taking extra magnesium to help prevent high blood pressure -- the amount you get in a healthy diet is enough. Magnesium is found in whole grains, green leafy vegetables, nuts, seeds, and dry peas and beans.\n*   **Fish oils.** A type of fat called \"omega-3 fatty acids\" is found in fatty fish like mackerel and salmon. Large amounts of fish oils may help reduce high blood pressure, but their role in prevention is unclear. Taking fish oil pills is not routinely recommended, primarily because it is unclear whether supplements can make a difference; getting omega 3’s as part of a heart healthy diet is best. Most fish, if not fried or made with added fat, is low in saturated fat and calories and can be eaten often.\n*   **Garlic.** There has been some evidence to suggest garlic’s effect in lowering blood pressure, in addition to improving cholesterol and reducing some cancers. Further research is being conducted to fully assess garlic’s potential health benefits.\n\n【6】Always talk to your doctor before taking a dietary supplement or alternative herbal treatment.

{"seq_id": "d133a554-01fc-4655-a15e-2a8b5c3e4dcb", "title": "Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease", "text": "【0】What Is Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease?\n----------------------------------\n\n【1】Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a very rare disorder that causes the brain to break down.\n\n【2】Also called \"classic\" CJD, it worsens quickly. Most people die within a year of getting it.\n\n【3】The disease destroys brain cells. Seen through a microscope, it makes the brain look like a sponge.\n\n【4】Classic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is not the same as “mad cow disease,\" which only happens in cattle. It's also not linked to \"variant\" CJD, which comes from products made from cattle that had mad cow disease.\n\n【5】Causes\n------\n\n【6】There are three types of classic CJD. Each has a different cause:\n\n【7】**Sporadic:** This is the most common type. It's caused by harmful proteins in the body called prions. Prion proteins are a normal part of your body. But sometimes they can fold the wrong way as they form. This “misfolded” prion infects the brain and destroys brain cells. Scientists don’t know why this happens.\n\n【8】**Familial:** This happens in people who inherit a bad gene from a parent. Only 10% to 15% of CJD cases each year are familial.\n\n【9】**Acquired:** The rarest form, It happens when someone comes into contact with a medical instrument (like a scalpel), organ (by transplantation), or growth hormone that’s infected with CJD. It makes up less than 1% of classic CJD cases.\n\n【10】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【11】The symptoms start and worsen very quickly. People with CJD often have signs of dementia, including:\n\n【12】*   Confusion\n*   Trouble walking\n*   Jerky muscle movements or twitching\n*   Personality changes\n*   Trouble with memory and judgment\n*   Vision problems\n\n【13】Sometimes people with it have trouble sleeping or become depressed. In later stages of the disease, they often lose the ability to speak or move. They may also get pneumonia or other infections, or slip into a coma.\n\n【14】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【15】There is no single test for CJD. Doctors diagnose it from your symptoms. One sign of the disease is how fast it gets worse.\n\n【16】A few tests doctors can use include:\n\n【17】**Magnetic resonance imaging** **(MRI).** This brain scan puts together detailed images. Doctors use these images to see changes in the brain over time.\n\n【18】**Electroencephalogram (****EEG****).** This is another type of test using surface electrodes that measures the electrical activity in the brain.\n\n【19】**Lumbar puncture** **(****spinal tap****).** Doctors use a long, very thin needle to draw some of the fluid out of the spinal column to test for certain proteins.\n\n【20】The only way to know for sure someone has CJD is by taking a sample (called a biopsy) of their brain tissue, or by autopsy. Doctors don’t usually biopsy brain tissue, because it’s risky, both for the patient and the doctor. It’s hard to target which tissue in the brain is infected, so doing a biopsy may not give helpful information. And it puts the doctor at risk of getting the disease.\n\n【21】Since a positive diagnosis doesn't help someone with CJD, doctors often confirm cases only after someone dies of it.\n\n【22】Treatment\n---------\n\n【23】There are no treatments for CJD. Researchers have tested several drugs, but none have been able to slow or stop the disease.\n\n【24】Doctors can prescribe pain medicine for the symptoms. Muscle relaxers or anti-seizure drugs can help with stiffness. People with CJD need full-time care once the disease is in its late stage.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "b7206489-4f9a-4f7d-af00-11520efc9a31", "title": "What Is Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis?", "text": "【0】What Is Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis?\nIf a child, or a teen younger than 16, has joint inflammation and stiffness for more than 6 weeks, it may be juvenile idiopathic arthritis, formerly called juvenile idiopathic arthritis. \n\n【1】The inflammation can cause redness, swelling, warmth, and soreness in the joints. But some children who have it might not complain about the joint pain.\n\n【2】The condition can affect any joint, and it may limit how well that joint works.\n\n【3】Most children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis recover fully. With the right treatment, they’re likely to do well and live a normal life.\n\n【4】Causes\n------\n\n【5】Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is an autoimmune disorder. This means that the immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues. That causes the inflammation.\n\n【6】Researchers don't know exactly why it happens. But they think it's a two-step process. First, something in a child’s genes makes them more likely to get it. Then something else, like a virus, triggers the arthritis itself.\n\n【7】How Is It Different From Adult Rheumatoid Arthritis?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】Adults who have it usually have symptoms all their lives. But studies show that by adulthood, 70% of children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis outgrow it. They don’t have symptoms anymore. \n\n【9】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【10】Besides joint pain, it may cause chronic fever and anemia, which is a shortage of red blood cells. It can also affect the heart, lungs, eyes, and nervous system.\n\n【11】Flare-ups, times when it gets worse, can last for several weeks. Later on, symptoms may lessen. They include:\n\n【12】*   Fevers of 103 F or higher\n*   Pink rash that comes and goes\n*   Eye inflammation\n*   Joint pain or stiffness\n*   Limping\n*   Swelling in joints\n*   Being less active\n*   Trouble with movements of hands or fingers, affecting things like handwriting or coloring\n*   Problems with bone development and growth\n\n【13】Different Types of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】There are three kinds. Each type is based on the number of joints involved, the symptoms, and certain antibodies that may be in the blood.\n\n【15】1.  **Four or fewer joints are involved.** Doctors call this pauciarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis.\n\n【16】It’s the most common form. About half of all children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis have this type.\n\n【17】It usually affects large joints like the knees. Girls under age 8 are most likely to get it.\n\n【18】Some children with this type have special proteins in the blood called antinuclear antibodies. They are more likely to get eye diseases like iritis, which is inflammation of the iris, or colored part of the eye. They can also get uveitis, which is inflammation of the inner eye. These children need regular eye exams by an ophthalmologist, a doctor who specializes in eye diseases.\n\n【19】Lots of children with this condition will outgrow it by adulthood. Still, eye problems can continue, and joint symptoms may come back.\n\n【20】1.  **Five or more joints are involved.** You may hear this called polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. \n\n【21】About 30% of all children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis have this type. It usually affects the small joints, like those in the hands and feet, but it can sometimes involve the large joints.\n\n【22】This type of juvenile idiopathic arthritis is usually symmetrical. That means it affects the same joints on both sides of the body.\n\n【23】Some children who have this have an immune system chemical called rheumatoid factor in their blood. They often have a more severe form of the condition.\n\n【24】1.  **It affects much of the body.** Doctors may call this form “systemic.”\n\n【25】Signs of this include joint swelling, fever, and a light pink rash. It may involve the heart, liver, spleen, and lymph nodes.\n\n【26】A small percentage of children who have it develop arthritis in their joints. They may have severe arthritis that lasts into adulthood.\n\n【27】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【28】Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is often hard to diagnose. Sometimes children who have it do not complain of pain. In fact, parents may not be aware of symptoms.\n\n【29】Some symptoms are similar to other serious conditions like infections, cancer, bone disorders, Lyme disease, and lupus.\n\n【30】If a doctor thinks a child may have juvenile idiopathic arthritis, they will ask about symptoms and the family’s medical history. They will give the child a physical exam to look for joint swelling, rashes, signs of internal organ inflammation, and eye problems. They may also take samples of the child’s blood and joint fluid, and use X-rays or other tests.\n\n【31】Treatment\n---------\n\n【32】Treatment usually includes medications along with exercise. The goals are to:\n\n【33】*   Stop inflammation\n*   Ease pain and swelling\n*   Strengthen joints and help them move better\n*   Prevent joint damage and other complications\n\n【34】Medications\n-----------\n\n【35】Medications for juvenile idiopathic arthritis include:\n\n【36】**NSAIDS (Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs)**\n\n【37】The medicines can curb pain, fever, and inflammation.\n\n【38】They come as a liquid or a pill. People usually take them from one to 4 times a day. Some common NSAIDs are aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, and tolmetin.\n\n【39】While NSAIDs ease pain and inflammation, they also have side effects. These include stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, headache, and anemia. Sometimes your doctor will give you another stomach\\-protecting medication to take with the NSAIDs. This will make stomach bleeding less likely.\n\n【40】If you child does not respond well to NSAIDS, the doctor may prescribe a new drug called Xatmep. Xatmep is the first ready-to-use oral solution formulation of methotrexate to be approved for use in children with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. An aggressive therapy, this medicine helps reduce further joint damage and helps preserve joint function. Side effects can include dizziness, fatigue, chills and fever.\n\n【41】**Meds That Stop the Condition From Getting Worse**\n\n【42】Your doctor may prescribe “DMARDs,” which stands for Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs. They also help with joint stiffness, pain, and swelling. Examples include hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), methotrexate, and sulfasalazine (Azulfidine).\n\n【43】It may take about 3 to 6 months for these medicines to work.\n\n【44】Because these are strong drugs, your child will need frequent tests to check for side effects. They can include anemia, low blood count, and kidney and liver problems. Other possible problems could be stomach aches, diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, headaches, rashes, loss of appetite, and weakness.\n\n【45】**“Biologic” Drugs for Your Immune System**\n\n【46】These drugs are genetically engineered to work on the immune system. They include adalimumab (Humira), adalimumab-atto (Amjevita), a biosimilar to Humira, anakinra (Kineret), etanercept (Enbrel), etanercept\\-szzs (Ereizi), a biosimilar to Enbrel, infliximab (Remicade), and infliximab-dyyb (Inflectra), a biosimilar to Remicade.\n\n【47】If you take them, you are more likely to get an infection, including serious diseases like tuberculosis. Some biologics are only approved by the FDA for use in adults. Check with your doctor about which ones are appropriate for children.\n\n【48】**If You Need Corticosteroids**\n\n【49】These are strong, anti-inflammatory drugs. Doctors usually prescribe them only if other treatments don’t work, or if the condition is severe.\n\n【50】This type of steroid isn’t the kind that bulks up your muscles.\n\n【51】Corticosteroids come in pills or liquids, and are usually prescribed for short periods of time and in low dosages. Serious side effects can happen if they’re taken too long. These include stunted growth, ulcers, mood swings, weight gain, \"moon face,\" muscle weakness, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, cataracts, and infections.\n\n【52】Examples of steroids include dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, prednisolone, and prednisone.\n\n【53】Exercise\n--------\n\n【54】Exercise and physical activity are important for children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Movement brings less pain, builds strength, and keeps joints moving well.\n\n【55】With the help of physical and occupational therapists, children learn simple ways to do everyday things. Therapists teach them exercises to improve their flexibility and strength.\n\n【56】It can help to use hot and cold treatments. For instance, a warm compress can loosen up a stiff muscle and an ice pack often reduces swelling and inflammation.\n\n【57】Therapists can also make splints for children to correctly position their joints and reduce pain. They can be used on knees, wrists, and fingers, as well as at night during sleep.\n\n【58】If your child has juvenile idiopathic arthritis, encourage them to get out there and be active. Avoid contact sports and instead go for things that are not stressful on the joints, like swimming.\n\n【59】Complications\n-------------\n\n【60】Eye problems are linked to some forms of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, so keep up with your child’s eye tests.\n\n【61】The condition can also cause problems with oral health if it affects the jaw and makes it hard to brush and floss teeth. Dentists can recommend special toothbrushes and floss to help children take care of their mouths.\n\n【62】Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) or jaw pain sometimes happens with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Certain exercises can help with jaw pain and stiffness. If the lower jaw doesn’t develop correctly, it can cause an overbite. An orthodontist can usually fix this. In some cases, surgery may be needed.\n\n【63】You may also want to check with your child’s doctor about their weight. Some children with the condition may need more calories. Others gain too much weight because they have problems being active, or because of side effects from medication. Extra weight is hard on the joints.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "d2bb3018-b16a-45c3-adb8-682a3570f90e", "title": "Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)", "text": "【0】Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)\nWhat Is Restless Legs Syndrome?\n-------------------------------\n\n【1】Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a nervous system disorder that causes an overpowering urge to move your legs. It’s also known as Willis-Ekbom disease.\n\n【2】Doctors consider it a sleep disorder because it usually happens or gets worse while you’re at rest. You might have trouble sleeping or sitting for a long time, such as in a theater or a car. It may get worse if you don’t get treatment. Over time, a lack of sleep can cause problems at work or home.\n\n【3】Restless legs syndrome affects up to 10% of people in the U.S. Anyone can get it, but it’s more common in women, and middle-aged people are more likely to have severe symptoms.\n\n【4】Sometimes, doctors don’t recognize RLS, especially if symptoms are mild or don’t happen often. But once it’s diagnosed, treatment can often stop it.\n\n【5】Who Gets Restless Legs Syndrome?\n--------------------------------\n\n【6】Experts estimate that up to 7% to 10% of people in the U.S. may have restless legs syndrome, also called RLS. About 2% to 3% of them have moderate to severe symptoms that affect their quality of life. Also:\n\n【7】*   More women than men get it. Doctors don't know why that is.\n*   Most people with severe RLS are middle-aged or older.\n*   While children can get RLS, it's rarer than in adults. Roughly 2% of school-age children may have RLS, and it may be more likely if they have a parent with RLS.\n\n【8】Restless Legs Syndrome Symptoms\n-------------------------------\n\n【9】People with restless legs syndrome have unusual feelings in their legs (like itching, crawling, pulling, aching, throbbing, or pins and needles) and a powerful urge to move their legs to make the sensations go away. The condition can also happen in other areas like the arms, chest, or head. The feelings usually happen on both sides of the body. They can also happen on only one side, or they might start on one side and then move to the other.\n\n【10】RLS symptoms range from mild to unbearable. They might come and go, and the intensity can vary between episodes. They’re generally worse in the evening and at night.\n\n【11】Symptoms almost always go away in the early morning, so people who have RLS can often sleep well then.\n\n【12】For some people, symptoms may cause severe nightly sleep disruption that can impair their quality of life.\n\n【13】Restless Legs Syndrome Causes\n-----------------------------\n\n【14】Doctors don’t know what causes most cases of restless legs syndrome, but your genes might play a role. Nearly half of the people with RLS also have a family member with the condition.\n\n【15】It might also be tied to:\n\n【16】*   **Chronic diseases.** Certain long-term medical conditions include RLS symptoms, including iron deficiency, Parkinson’s disease, kidney failure or renal disease, diabetes, and peripheral neuropathy. Damage to the spinal cord may also make RLS more likely.\n*   **Medications.** Some drugs might make symptoms worse, including anti-nausea meds, antipsychotics, some antidepressants, and cold and allergy medications that have antihistamines.\n*   **Pregnancy.** Some women have RLS during pregnancy, especially in the last trimester. Symptoms usually go away within a month after delivery.\n*   **Lifestyle.** A lack of sleep or another sleep disorder like apnea can trigger symptoms or make them worse. So can alcohol, tobacco, and caffeine use.\n\n【17】Restless Legs Syndrome Diagnosis\n--------------------------------\n\n【18】There’s no medical test for RLS. Your doctor might want to talk to your sleep partner about what they’ve noticed.\n\n【19】The five basic criteria for a diagnosis of RLS are:\n\n【20】*   An overwhelming urge to move your legs, especially along with uncomfortable or unusual feelings\n*   An urge that starts or gets worse while you’re at rest\n*   An urge that goes away, either partly or totally, when you move\n*   An urge that starts or gets worse in the evening\n*   Another condition, such as leg cramps, arthritis, or muscle pains, isn’t causing it.\n\n【21】Your doctor may use lab tests to rule out other conditions. A neurological exam can check for nerve damage or blood vessel problems. A sleep study called polysomnography can tell them if you have other sleep disorders that might cause RLS.\n\n【22】Restless Legs Syndrome Treatment\n--------------------------------\n\n【23】Although there’s no cure for restless legs syndrome itself, treatments can help control it so you can get a good night’s sleep.\n\n【24】If another condition is causing your restless legs, such as an iron deficiency, your doctor will treat it.\n\n【25】Treatment for RLS itself will target your symptoms. If your RLS is mild or moderate, some small changes to your everyday life might help: getting regular exercise; following a sleep schedule; and avoiding caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco.\n\n【26】Other ways to treat RLS without drugs include:\n\n【27】*   Leg massages\n*   Hot baths\n*   Heating pads or ice packs on your legs\n\n【28】Medications help some people. But a drug that eases symptoms in one person may make them worse in another, or a drug that works for a while may stop working.\n\n【29】Drugs to treat RLS include:\n\n【30】*   Dopaminergic drugs, which act on the neurotransmitter dopamine in your brain. The FDA has approved pramipexole (Mirapex), ropinirole (Requip), and rotigotine (Neupro) for moderate to severe RLS.\n*   The Parkinson's disease drug carbidopa/levodopa (Sinemet) occasionally is prescribed\n*   Benzodiazepines, a type of sedative, may help with sleep, but they can cause daytime drowsiness.\n*   Narcotic pain relievers\n*   Anticonvulsant or anti-seizure drugs such as carbamazepine (Tegretol), gabapentin (Neurontin), gabapentin enacarbil (Horizant), and pregabalin (Lyrica)\n\n【31】Restless Legs Syndrome Prognosis\n--------------------------------\n\n【32】Restless legs syndrome is a lifelong condition that might get worse with age. But some people go into remission and don’t have symptoms for days to years.\n\n【33】Keep your doctor updated on how you’re doing. If you start to feel worse, they might suggest lifestyle changes or medications.\n\n【34】It can help to talk to other people who know what you’re going through, whether it’s a family member who has RLS or a support group.\n\n【35】Does Restless Legs Syndrome Ever Go Away by Itself?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【36】In some cases, restless legs syndrome can disappear on its own. But this is rare. Instead, for most people, symptoms get worse over time.\n\n【37】For people with RLS symptoms caused by a medical condition, treatment of that condition can improve their RLS.  \n \n\n【38】When Should I See a Doctor About Restless Legs Syndrome?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【39】You should see a doctor to confirm the diagnosis of RLS and to exclude other conditions that may resemble RLS. The doctor can treat problems linked to RLS, like iron deficiency.\n\n【40】If you have RLS, you should also see a doctor if you are:\n\n【41】*   Losing sleep often\n*   Feeling depressed or anxious\n*   Having trouble concentrating\n\n【42】You don't have to wait until one of these things happens. If you just want to feel better, see your doctor.  \n \n\n【43】Can Restless Legs Syndrome Turn Into Something More Serious?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【44】Most people with restless legs syndrome have the \"idiopathic\" form, meaning there's no known cause. For them, there is no risk of RLS becoming something more serious, like Parkinson's disease.\n\n【45】Restless legs syndrome can get worse in people with other medical conditions if they don't get those conditions treated.\n\n【46】How Can I Get a Good Night's Sleep Despite Restless Legs Syndrome?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【47】Experts agree that simply changing your behavior can often help you sleep if you have restless legs syndrome. For people with mild to moderate RLS, these steps can reduce or prevent symptoms:\n\n【48】*   Cut down on caffeine.\n*   If you drink alcohol, cut back.\n*   Stop smoking, or at least cut back.\n*   Go to bed and get up at the same time each day, including weekends.\n*   Exercise regularly, but moderately (heavy exercise can worsen symptoms).\n*   Apply heat or ice, or soak in a hot bath.  \n     \n\n【49】What Else Can I Do to Help With Restless Legs Syndrome?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【50】 If you have moderate to severe RLS, it's important to find ways to handle any stress you feel from it. Here are a few ways to take control:\n\n【51】*   Work with your doctor to keep your symptoms under control.\n*   Join a support group. The Restless Legs Syndrome Foundation can get you started. \n*   If you feel overwhelmed by RLS, talk with someone who treats mental health, like a psychologist or psychiatrist. Depression and anxiety sometimes come with restless legs syndrome, but the exact link isn't clear.  \n     \n\n【52】What Is the Connection Between Iron and Restless Legs Syndrome?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【53】Low levels of iron may be a factor in some people. Getting more iron from food may help those people. Food sources of iron include lean meat, seafood, nuts, beans, vegetables, and iron-fortified grain products such as breakfast cereals. Your doctor can check your blood iron level and see if it's too low. \n\n【54】Even in people who are not anemic and have normal iron levels, iron levels may be involved.  Some research shows that there can be lower iron levels in some brain regions in people with RLS, although their iron level is normal. So doctors may prescribe iron supplements even if a person's iron levels are within a normal range. But too much iron can lead to liver damage and other health problems.  \n \n\n【55】What Is the Link Between Restless Legs Syndrome and Periodic Limb Movement Disorder?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【56】Experts estimate that about 80% of people with restless legs syndrome also have periodic limb movement disorder, or PLMD. In PLMD, the arms or legs twitch or jerk during the night. The movements disturb sleep and can cause chronic sleepiness.\n\n【57】Many people have periodic limb movement disorder by itself and will never get restless legs syndrome. If you think you may have PLMD, see your doctor.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

It has different systems that need the right inputs and outputs. It’s very concrete and logical.\n\n【5】TCM, on the other hand, doesn’t focus on science and medicine. Instead, it’s based on balance, harmony, and energy. There are two central ideas behind TCM:\n\n【6】**Qi:** This is also called life energy or vital energy. The belief is that it runs throughout your body. It’s always on the move and constantly changes. TCM treatments often focus on ways to promote and maintain the flow of qi.\n\n【7】**Yin and Yang:** These are opposites that describe the qualities of qi.\n\n【8】*   Yin: night , dark, cold, feminine, negative\n*   Yang: day, light, warm , positive, male\n\n【9】The belief is that everything in life has a little bit of its opposite, too, and balance is the key. For example, a drug from your doctor might heal disease. But it’s dangerous if you take too much of it.\n\n【10】According to TCM, these ideas play out in our bodies. When you balance the yin and yang of Qi, you feel healthy and well. If they’re out of whack, you feel sick. TCM aims to create harmony and a healthy flow of qi.\n\n【11】What Kind of Practices Does TCM Use?\n------------------------------------\n\n【12】What Kind of Practices Does TCM Use?\n\n【13】Several. They include:\n\n【14】*   Acupuncture: very fine needles placed gently in the skin\n*   Cupping: heated cups that create suction on your skin\n*   Herbs: teas, powders, and capsules made mostly from plants\n*   Meditation: a way to sit quietly and calm your mind\n*   Moxibustion: dried herbs burned near the skin\n*   Tai chi: exercise with slow movements and focus on the breath\n\n【15】Is It Safe?\n-----------\n\n【16】Experts believe it’s safe, if you go to someone who knows what they're doing. This is especially true of acupuncture, tai chi, cupping, and moxibustion.\n\n【17】Herbs can be a little trickier. They don’t go through the same FDA process as drugs. That means there’s not as much research on them, and it can be hard to know exactly what’s in them. Plus, herbs can have side effects or impact other medicine you’re taking. Again, it’s important to go to someone who really understands their practice. And always check with your doctor first.\n\n【18】Does It Work?\n-------------\n\n【19】TCM is an approach that covers a lot of ground, and results vary. The practices haven’t been studied in the same way as Western medicine. More research has been done on herbs and acupuncture than other treatments. But studies show a lot of promise:\n\n【20】*   Acupuncture is commonly accepted as a treatment for a number of conditions, including pain relief and limiting side effects from chemotherapy.\n*   A number of herbs used in TCM are also used at well-respected, Western medicine clinics to treat anything from trouble sleeping to arthritis to menopause.\n*   Tai chi seems to improve balance in people with Parkinson’s disease.\n*   Cupping may help relieve pain from shingles.\n\n【21】Who Should Use It?\n------------------\n\n【22】That’s a personal decision. People use TCM for anything from carpal tunnel syndrome to lowering stress. Sometimes they use it along with Western medicine. It may be a good choice if you:\n\n【23】*   Have a lot of different symptoms with no clear cause\n*   Need to treat side effects from drugs\n*   Have tried Western medicine but didn’t get results\n*   Want to prevent illness\n\n【24】Who Should Avoid TCM?\n---------------------\n\n【25】In general, doctors suggest you don’t use it to totally replace Western medicine, especially if you have a serious condition like cancer or liver disease.\n\n【26】They also urge caution, especially with herbs, if you’re:\n\n【27】*   Elderly\n*   Pregnant or breastfeeding\n*   Scheduled for surgery (some herbs could lead to bleeding problems or prevent drugs used during surgery from working)\n*   Taking other medicine as well\n*   Treating a child\n\n【28】What Do Traditional Doctors Think of TCM?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【29】They want to see proof that something is safe and works well before they suggest you try it. That often makes it hard for them to recommend TCM. But on the whole, research and interest in TCM is on the rise.\n\n【30】You can also find many leading health care centers, like the Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, and Johns Hopkins offering TCM practices such as acupuncture and herbal treatments.\n\n【31】How Do I Find Someone Who Practices TCM?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【32】Your best bet is to find someone certified by the Accreditation Committee for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine (ACAOM). They accredit schools that teach TCM, and you can check their website to find someone.\n\n【33】Another option is to get in touch with a school of Oriental medicine. They can sometimes refer you to their alumni.\n\n【34】Check with your family and friends as well -- just do your research to make sure you go to someone you can trust.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Also, avoid sunlight (including sunlight through windows) on your skin or lips for at least 8 hours after taking methoxsalen. This will prevent the body from getting too much UVA rays which could lead to sunburns. If you cannot avoid sunlight, wear protective clothing (such as hat, gloves, long-sleeved shirt, pants) and/or sunscreen which blocks out UVA light. Consult your doctor or pharmacist for information on which sunscreen to use. Do not apply the sunscreen to areas of the skin affected by psoriasis until after the UVA light treatment.\n\n【15】During the UVA light treatment, follow all instructions given by the healthcare professional. After the UVA light treatment, do not sunbathe for at least 48 hours. Doing so may increase the risk of severe burns.

{"seq_id": "37c51d94-7fbc-4fb3-887e-62c8ff03dd12", "title": "What Are the Complications of Celiac Disease?", "text": "【0】What Are the Complications of Celiac Disease?\nWhen you have celiac disease, your body has a major problem with gluten. For reasons that scientists don’t completely understand, gluten makes your immune system attack the lining of the small intestine if you have this condition. This causes serious damage and problems that can go beyond the digestive system.\n\n【1】To prevent that, you need to be on a gluten\\-free diet. Once gluten is out of the picture, your small intestine will start to heal.\n\n【2】But because celiac disease is so hard to diagnose, people can have it for years. This long-term damage to the small intestine may start to affect other parts of the body.\n\n【3】Many of these problems will go away with a gluten-free diet. Your recovery time will depend on how long you’ve been dealing with the complications. But depending how much damage has been done, infertility and bone weakness often don’t reverse.\n\n【4】If Celiac Disease Goes Untreated\n--------------------------------\n\n【5】These problems could happen:\n\n【6】**Lactose intolerance****.** The small intestine digests lactose, which is the sugar naturally found in milk. If your small intestine doesn’t work right because of celiac disease, you might become lactose intolerant.\n\n【7】**Vitamin and mineral deficiencies.** When the small intestine is damaged, it can’t absorb vitamins and minerals. People with untreated celiac disease often are low in these:\n\n【8】*   Iron\n*   Calcium\n*   Zinc\n*   Magnesium\n*   Folate\n*   Niacin\n*   Riboflavin\n*   Vitamin B-12\n*   Vitamin D\n\n【9】**Osteopenia** **and** **osteoporosis**. When your body lacks calcium, your bones can become brittle. If your small intestine doesn’t heal and you continue to miss out on it, you might develop osteopenia (low bone density) and then osteoporosis, where your bones are weaker.\n\n【10】**Iron deficiency** **anemia**. Your body needs iron to make red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body. If you don’t have enough iron and your blood doesn’t have enough oxygen, this can make you tired and short of breath.\n\n【11】Other Problems Linked to Celiac Disease\n---------------------------------------\n\n【12】Researchers also have found connections between celiac and these conditions:\n\n【13】**Lymphoma****.** Celiac disease is an immune system condition, and lymphocytes are part of the immune system, so it’s possible that a condition like celiac disease could cause cancer in those cells. Keep in mind that not everyone with celiac disease will get lymphoma. You may be more likely to get this cancer if you find out you have the condition later in life and have more damage to your intestines.\n\n【14】**Fertility** **problems.** Women with uncontrolled celiac disease can have a hard time getting pregnant, and they may be more likely to miscarry.\n\n【15】**Nervous system** **disorders**. People with celiac disease are more likely to have nerve problems (neuropathy) and problems with controlling their movement (ataxia). Lack of vitamins and minerals might cause this. Or it could be that they also have another immune system problem.\n\n【16】The small intestine is in constant communication with other parts of the body. Many people with celiac disease also have liver, gall bladder, and pancreas conditions. Those with untreated or undiagnosed celiac disease might have anxiety and/or depression. But it’s not clear if celiac disease or something else causes those problems.\n\n【17】Complications in Children\n-------------------------\n\n【18】A child who has celiac disease that a doctor hasn’t yet found might be small and underweight. They might have weak tooth enamel and a condition called intussusception, which causes the intestines to fold in on themselves. There’s also a chance of delayed puberty. So the sooner your child is diagnosed and gets on a gluten-free diet, the better.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "7f23785b-29ae-409b-beaf-011ba01844ac", "title": "Contact Dermatitis: Facts About Skin Rashes", "text": "【0】Contact Dermatitis: Facts About Skin Rashes\nContact dermatitis is a rash that crops up on your skin when you touch or have a reaction to a certain substance. It’s red, itchy, and uncomfortable, but it’s not life-threatening.\n\n【1】The rash could be caused by an allergy or because the protective layer of your skin got damaged. Other names for it include allergic contact dermatitis and irritant contact dermatitis.\n\n【2】Contact Dermatitis Symptoms\n---------------------------\n\n【3】Allergic Contact Dermatitis on Arm. This example of allergic contact dermatitis is a reaction to a henna tattoo on the arm, after ten days. Contact dermatitis is a type of eczema caused either by a toxic reaction to some substance or by an allergic reaction. The rash will generally clear up on its own if you can avoid contact with the what triggered it in the first place.\n\n【4】Symptoms of a contact allergy usually show up near where you touched the thing you're allergic to.\n\n【5】 You’ll notice your skin may be:\n\n【6】*   Red\n    \n*   Itchy\n    \n*   Dry, cracked, or scaly\n    \n*   Covered in bumps or blisters. Blistering is rare. If you see blisters, contact your doctor.\n    \n*   Swollen\n    \n*   Burning\n    \n*   Tender\n    \n\n【7】Irritant contact dermatitis (skin damage) tends to burn and be more painful than itchy.\n\n【8】When something is irritating or damaging your skin, you'll probably see a rash right away. With an allergy, it may be a day or two before the rash shows up.\n\n【9】Many of the symptoms can be the same. In both cases, your skin may blister, or you may get a raised red rash. Your skin will itch and maybe burn.\n\n【10】Allergic contact dermatitis. This is reaction by your skin after coming into contact to some substance that you are allergic to. It is usually a rash that can be red and itchy and sometimes blister.\n\n【11】Contact Dermatitis Causes\n-------------------------\n\n【12】If it's caused by an allergy, your immune system is involved. After you touch something, it mistakenly thinks your body is under attack. It springs into action, making antibodies to fight the invader. A chain of events causes a release of chemicals, including histamine. That's what causes the allergic reaction -- in this case, an itchy rash. It's called allergic contact dermatitis.\n\n【13】Usually, you won't get a rash the first time your skin touches something you're allergic to. But that touch sensitizes your skin, and you could have a reaction the next time. If you get an allergic rash, chances are you've touched that trigger before and just didn't know it. \n\n【14】Allergic contact dermatitis causes include:\n\n【15】*   Poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac\n    \n*   Hair dyes or straighteners\n    \n*   Nickel, a metal found in jewelry and belt buckles\n    \n*   Leather (specifically, chemicals used in tanning leather)\n    \n*   Latex rubber\n    \n*   Citrus fruit, especially the peel\n    \n*   Fragrances in soaps, shampoos, lotions, perfumes, and cosmetics\n    \n*   Some medications you put on your skin\n    \n\n【16】Some rashes look like an allergic reaction but really aren't because your immune system wasn't involved.\n\n【17】Instead, you touched something that took away the surface oils shielding your skin. The longer that thing stayed on your skin, the worse the reaction. It's called irritant contact dermatitis.\n\n【18】Things that can cause irritant contact dermatitis include:\n\n【19】*   Acids\n    \n*   Some drain cleaners\n    \n*   Urine, saliva, or other body fluids\n    \n*   Certain plants, such as poinsettias and peppers\n    \n*   Hair dyes\n    \n*   Nail polish remover \n    \n*   Paints and varnishes\n    \n*   Harsh soaps or detergents\n    \n*   Resins, plastics, and epoxies\n    \n\n【20】If you have eczema, you're more likely to get this kind of rash.\n\n【21】Another less common form of contact dermatitis is photocontact dermatitis. This is a rash that can form when you use certain products, such as sunscreen, on your skin and then spend time in the sun. The combination of the sun and the allergen or irritant on your skin causes a reaction.\n\n【22】Contact Dermatitis Treatment and Home Remedies\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【23】Depending on how bad your symptoms are, you may be able to treat your contact dermatitis at home, or you may need to see your doctor.\n\n【24】To help soothe your skin, you can try these home remedies:\n\n【25】*   Wash your skin with mild soap and cool water right away.\n    \n*   Remove or avoid the allergen or irritant that caused the rash.\n    \n*   Apply hydrocortisone cream over small areas.\n    \n*   For blisters, use a cold moist compress for 30 minutes, three times a day.\n    \n*   Put moisturizers on damaged skin several times a day to help restore the protective layer.\n    \n*   Take an oral histamine for itching.\n    \n\n【26】Don't use an antihistamine lotion unless your doctor suggests it, because it could cause skin irritation or an allergic reaction, too.\n\n【27】When to Contact Your Doctor About Contact Dermatitis\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【28】Call your doctor if your rash is:\n\n【29】*   Painful \n    \n*   Keeps you from sleeping or distracts you during the day\n    \n*   Sudden \n    \n*   Spreads over a large part of your body\n    \n*   On your face or genitals\n    \n*   Not better after a couple of days\n    \n*   Oozing or infected\n    \n*   Affecting your eyes, nose, or lungs\n    \n\n【30】Your doctor will take a look and ask you questions to help figure out what's going on.\n\n【31】Depending on how severe it is, they may prescribe:\n\n【32】*    Steroid pills, creams,  or ointment\n    \n*   Antihistamines \n    \n*   Immunosuppressive medications for severe cases\n    \n\n【33】Your doctor can do skin tests to determine what you are allergic to.\n\n【34】If you can't avoid what's bothering your skin, talk to your doctor about wearing gloves or using creams to keep it safe.\n\n【35】Contact Dermatitis Prevention\n-----------------------------\n\n【36】The best way to avoid getting contact dermatitis is to know what makes you break out and stay away from it.

{"seq_id": "5995c2c7-c8e3-4162-bceb-7b965c266c83", "title": "Causes of Bipolar Disorder", "text": "【0】Causes of Bipolar Disorder\nDoctors don't completely understand the causes of bipolar disorder. But they've gained a greater understanding in recent years of the bipolar spectrum, which includes the elated highs of mania to the lows of major depression, along with various mood states between these two extremes.\n\n【1】Bipolar disorder seems to often run in families and there appears to be a genetic part to this mood disorder. There is also growing evidence that environment and lifestyle issues have an effect on the disorder's severity. Stressful life events -- or alcohol or drug abuse -- can make bipolar disorder more difficult to treat.\n\n【2】The Brain and Bipolar Disorder\n------------------------------\n\n【3】Experts believe bipolar disorder is partly caused by an underlying problem with specific brain circuits and the functioning of brain chemicals called neurotransmitters.\n\n【4】Three brain chemicals -- norepinephrine (noradrenaline), serotonin, and dopamine -- are involved in both brain and bodily functions. Norepinephrine and serotonin have been consistently linked to psychiatric mood disorders such as depression and bipolar disorder. Nerve pathways within areas of the brain that regulate pleasure and emotional reward are regulated by dopamine. Disruption of circuits that communicate using dopamine in other brain areas appears connected to psychosis and schizophrenia, a severe mental disorder characterized by distortions in reality and illogical thought patterns and behaviors.\n\n【5】The brain chemical serotonin is connected to many body functions such as sleep, wakefulness, eating, sexual activity, impulsivity, learning, and memory. Researchers believe that abnormal functioning of brain circuits that involve serotonin as a chemical messenger contribute to mood disorders (depression and bipolar disorder).\n\n【6】Is Bipolar Disorder Genetic?\n----------------------------\n\n【7】Many studies of bipolar patients and their relatives have shown that bipolar disorder sometimes runs in families. Perhaps the most convincing data come from twin studies. In studies of identical twins, scientists report that if one identical twin has bipolar disorder, the other twin has a greater chance of developing bipolar disorder than another sibling in the family. Researchers conclude that the lifetime chance of an identical twin (of a bipolar twin) to also develop bipolar disorder is about 40% to 70%.\n\n【8】In more studies at Johns Hopkins University, researchers interviewed all first-degree relatives of patients with bipolar I and bipolar II disorder and concluded that bipolar II disorder was the most common affective disorder in both family sets. The researchers found that 40% of the 47 first-degree relatives of the bipolar II patients also had bipolar II disorder; 22% of the 219 first-degree relatives of the bipolar I patients had bipolar II disorder. However, among patients with bipolar II, researchers found only one relative with bipolar I disorder. They concluded that bipolar II is the most prevalent diagnosis of relatives in both bipolar I and bipolar II families.\n\n【9】Studies at Stanford University that explored the genetic connection of bipolar disorder found that children with one biological parent with bipolar I or bipolar II disorder have an increased likelihood of getting bipolar disorder. In this study, researchers reported that 51% of the bipolar offspring had a psychiatric disorder, most commonly major depression, dysthymia (low-grade, chronic depression), bipolar disorder, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Interestingly, the bipolar parents in the study who had a childhood history of ADHD were more likely to have children with bipolar disorder rather than ADHD.\n\n【10】In other findings, researchers report that first-degree relatives of a person diagnosed with bipolar I or II disorder are at an increased risk for major depression when compared to first-degree relatives of those with no history of bipolar disorder. Scientific findings also show that the lifetime risk of affective disorders in relatives with family members who have bipolar disorder increases, depending on the number of diagnosed relatives.\n\n【11】What Role Does Environment and Lifestyle Play in Bipolar Disorder?\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】Along with a genetic link to bipolar disorder, research shows that children of bipolar parents are often surrounded by significant environmental stressors. That may include living with a parent who has a tendency toward mood swings, alcohol or substance abuse, financial and sexual indiscretions, and hospitalizations. Although most children of a bipolar parent will not develop bipolar disorder, some children of bipolar parents may develop a different psychiatric disorder such as ADHD, major depression, schizophrenia, or substance abuse.\n\n【13】Environmental stressors also play a role in triggering bipolar episodes in those who are genetically predisposed. For example, children growing up in bipolar families may live with a parent who lacks control of moods or emotions. Some children may live with constant verbal or even physical abuse if the bipolar parent is not medicated or is using alcohol or drugs.\n\n【14】Can Lack of Sleep Worsen the Symptoms of Bipolar Disorder?\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Some findings show that people with bipolar disorder have a genetic predisposition to sleep\\-wake cycle problems that may trigger symptoms of depression and mania.\n\n【16】The problem for those with bipolar disorder, however, is that sleep loss may lead to a mood episode such as mania (elation) in some patients. Worrying about losing sleep can increase anxiety, thus worsening the bipolar mood disorder altogether. Once a sleep-deprived person with bipolar disorder goes into the manic state, the need for sleep decreases even more.\n\n【17】In one study, researchers interviewed 39 bipolar patients with primarily manic or depressed episodes to determine the presence of social rhythm disruptions during the two months prior to the onset of the mood. (A social rhythm disruption is a disturbance in daily routines such as sleeping, eating, exercising, or interacting with other people, which in turn could affect patterns of brain activity tied to mood regulation.)\n\n【18】When comparing the results with volunteers in the control group, researchers concluded that most people with bipolar disorder experience at least one social rhythm disruption prior to a major mood episode. In addition, the researchers found that social rhythm disruption affected more bipolar patients with mania than the patients with depression. Their findings concluded that 65% of the patients with bipolar disorder had at least one disruption in their daily rhythm in the eight weeks before the onset of a manic episode.\n\n【19】Talk to your doctor if you have difficulty falling asleep or maintaining sleep. There are several non-addictive sleep medicines available that can help resolve sleep problems. Also, cognitive behavioral therapy has been shown to be a helpful treatment for patients with bipolar disorder who have poor sleep or anxiety and fears about poor sleep.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

It is used to treat certain stomach and esophagus problems (such as acid reflux, ulcers). It is also used to prevent stomach bleeding in very ill patients.Omeprazole works by decreasing the amount of acid your stomach makes. It belongs to a class of drugs known as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Sodium bicarbonate is an antacid that reduces stomach acid and helps omeprazole to work better. This medication relieves symptoms such as heartburn , difficulty swallowing, and cough . It helps heal acid damage to the stomach and esophagus, helps prevent ulcers, and may help prevent cancer of the esophagus.If you are self-treating with this medication, over-the-counter omeprazole/sodium bicarbonate products are used to treat frequent heartburn (occurring 2 or more days a week). Since it may take 1 to 4 days to have full effect, these products do not relieve heartburn right away.For over-the-counter products, carefully read the package instructions to make sure the product is right for you. Check the ingredients on the label even if you have used the product before. The manufacturer may have changed the ingredients. Also, products with similar brand names may contain different ingredients meant for different purposes. Taking the wrong product could harm you.\n\n【2】### How to use Zegerid\n\n【3】Read the Medication Guide provided by your pharmacist before you start taking this medication and each time you get a refill. If you have any questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【4】Take this medication by mouth as directed by your doctor, usually once daily on an empty stomach , at least 1 hour before a meal. If you are self-treating, follow all directions on the product package. Dosage and length of treatment are based on your medical condition and response to treatment. In children, the dosage is also based on weight . Do not increase your dose or take this drug more often than directed. If you have any questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【5】If you are taking the capsule, swallow it whole with a full glass of water (8 ounces/240 milliliters). Do not use other liquids. Do not open the capsule or sprinkle the contents into food.\n\n【6】If you are using the powder packet, empty the contents into a small cup with 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 milliliters) of water. Do not use any other liquids or foods. Stir well and drink the entire mixture right away. To make sure you take the entire dose, add more water to the cup and drink all of it.\n\n【7】If you are using the suspension, shake the bottle well before each dose. Carefully measure the dose using a special measuring device/spoon. Do not use a household spoon because you may not get the correct dose.\n\n【8】If you are giving the powder or suspension through a tube into the stomach (nasogastric or gastric tube), ask your health care professional for detailed instructions on how to properly give it. For patients receiving continuous tube feedings, the tube feeding should be stopped for 3 hours before and 1 hour after giving this medication.\n\n【9】Do not substitute the capsules, the powder packets, or the suspension for each other, unless approved by your doctor, because they contain different amounts of sodium bicarbonate . Also, do not substitute one strength of the same dosage form for another strength (such as taking two 20-milligram capsules instead of one 40-milligram capsule). Doing so may give you too much sodium bicarbonate and increase your risk of side effects (such as swelling of the hands/feet).\n\n【10】If you are also taking sucralfate, take this medication at least 30 minutes before sucralfate.\n\n【11】Use this medication regularly to get the most benefit from it.

Many heart drugs like quinidine (antiarrhythmics) are very effective, but they can rarely cause new serious (possibly fatal) irregular heartbeats.\n\n【2】**Warnings:**\n\n【3】Before taking this drug for treatment of an irregular heartbeat, you should discuss your risks and benefits of treatment with your doctor or pharmacist . This drug should be used only in carefully selected patients. Many heart drugs like quinidine (antiarrhythmics) are very effective, but they can rarely cause new serious (possibly fatal) irregular heartbeats.\n\n【4】... Show More\n\n【5】Uses\n----\n\n【6】This medication is used to treat or prevent many types of irregular heartbeats ( heart arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation ). Quinidine can greatly improve your ability to perform normal activities by decreasing the number of irregular heartbeats you have. However, it may not stop all your irregular heartbeats completely. It works by blocking abnormal heartbeat signals.Before and while you are using quinidine, your doctor may prescribe other medications (such as \" blood thinners \"/ anticoagulants such as warfarin , beta blockers such as metoprolol ) to shrink any blood clots in the heart and to slow your pulse .\n\n【7】### How to use Quinidine Sulfate\n\n【8】Before starting this drug, the manufacturer recommends that you take a test dose (usually a smaller amount than your regular dose) to determine whether you are allergic to it. Consult your doctor or pharmacist for details.\n\n【9】Take this medication by mouth with or without food with a full glass of liquid (8 ounces/240 milliliters) as directed by your doctor. This medication is best taken on an empty stomach , but taking it with food may help decrease stomach upset. Do not lie down for at least 10 minutes after taking this medication.\n\n【10】Do not crush or chew extended-release tablets.

{"seq_id": "e8ff6969-c740-4368-b4a7-2c86723cc10d", "title": "Adult Immunizations: What You Need", "text": "【0】Adult Immunizations: What You Need\nBecoming an adult means leaving behind the trappings of our youth, but immunizations are not necessarily one of them. Many of the vaccinations we had as children need to be repeated as adults to maintain proper immunity. And just as adulthood brings a new set of responsibilities, being an adult can also require a new set of immunizations.\n\n【1】Why Do You Need Adult Immunizations?\n------------------------------------\n\n【2】Many of the vaccines we received as children to create immunities to infectious diseases last a lifetime, but not all of them. For example, tetanus and diphtheria vaccines need to be updated with a new vaccine and then with booster shots every 10 years to maintain immunity. There are other reasons why adult immunizations may be necessary:\n\n【3】*   Some adults never received immunizations as children.\n*   Vaccine recommendations and vaccines change over the years. Certain vaccines may not have been available when some adults were children.\n*   Immunity can fade over time.\n*   As we age, we become more susceptible to serious disease caused by common infections like the flu.\n*   As an adult, we may work in the health care field or other profession that puts us at risk for contact with infectious diseases.\n\n【4】Which Adult Immunizations Do You Need?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【5】There have been several updates in adult vaccine recommendations since the last set of guidelines were released. One of the most notable: the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine be given to all amae and females aged 13 to 26.  Vaccination is also recommended for males through age 26 who have sex with men and for those whose immune system may be compromised. Other significant changes include:\n\n【6】*   The ACIP now suggests that adults without evidence of prior immunity to chickenpox receive the varicella vaccine. Special consideration should be given to:\n    *   Those at high risk for infection or transmission, such as health care workers and teachers\n    *   Those who are in close contact with people at high risk of infection\n    *   Family and others who come in contact with people with compromised immune systems\n*   Shingles can be a very painful and debilitating disease. People 50 and older and people without evidence of immunity who are known to be at risk of exposure should be vaccinated against shingles.\n*   The ACIP also recommends one or more doses of the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine (MMR) be administered to adults in certain age groups and with certain risk factors. Adults born before 1957 can be considered immune to measles and mumps.\n*   Hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for adults seeking protection from hepatitis B exposure. Any adult working in high-risk environments like STD clinics or drug rehab centers, should be vaccinated for hepatitis B. Health care workers, public safety workers, household contacts, and sexual partners of persons with chronic hepatitis B should also receive the hepatitis B vaccine.\n*   Pneumococcal vaccines - there are 2 types of pneumococcal vaccines in the U.S.: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV13, PCV15, and PCV20) and Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23). Adults aged 19-64 should get a pneumonia vaccine if they have certain medical conditions or if they smoke. All adults 65 years or older should be vaccinated. Your doctor will be able to tell you which vaccine is best for you and what the dosing procedure should be.\n*   The ACIP recommends that everyone aged 6 and older get a COVID-19 vaccination. These may be combined with other routine vaccines in the same doctor's visit. You're not fully vaccinated until 2 weeks after a single-dose shot or the second dose of a two-dose series. Those who are fully vaccinated can go back to activities they did before the pandemic and don't have to wear a mask or practice social distancing unless rules or laws require it.\n\n【7】Adult Immunizations and Pregnancy\n---------------------------------\n\n【8】If you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, it is important that you make sure your adult immunizations are current. A child's first set of immunities is often passed on from the mother, and more importantly, contracting certain infectious diseases -- such as rubella -- while pregnant greatly increases a child's risk of birth defects.\n\n【9】The benefits of vaccinating pregnant women usually outweighs the risks of the vaccine, says the CDC. Risks to a developing fetus from a vaccine are largely theoretical, while risks to a fetus from an infectious disease contracted by the mother are well documented.\n\n【10】All women who are pregnant need to talk with their doctor about getting a flu shot and about getting the Tdap vaccine. The Tdap vaccine provides protection against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis and should be given during the third trimester of each pregnancy.\n\n【11】If you are pregnant or trying to become pregnant, talk to your health care provider before being vaccinated with a live virus vaccine, such as chickenpox, measles, or the LAIV flu vaccine. If possible, avoid live virus vaccinations during pregnancy or right before pregnancy since live virus vaccines can increase the risk of transmitting the disease to the fetus.

It’ll help protect you from severe illness if you do get COVID-19.\n\n【1】A CDC analysis looked at nearly 2,500 pregnant people who took an mRNA (Pfizer or Moderna) vaccine before the 20-week mark in their pregnancy. The study showed post-COVID-19 vaccination miscarriage rates were around 13%, similar to the expected rate of 11-16% in the general population.\n\n【2】There were no negative pregnancy-related outcomes in previous clinical trials that used the same vaccine technology as used in the Johnson & Johnson/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. The vector vaccine platform didn’t cause any harmful side effects during any trimesters of pregnancy or to the baby after birth.\n\n【3】Similarly, other data from three CDC safety monitoring systems suggests that vaccines are safe for people who’ve gotten vaccinated later in pregnancy.\n\n【4】The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) also recommend that all pregnant people be vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\n【5】Can Those Who Breastfeed Get the COVID-19 Vaccine?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【6】The CDC recommends those who are breastfeeding get the COVID-19 vaccine. But there haven’t been any clinical trials in the U.S. for those who breastfeed and take the vaccine. Due to this, there is limited information on the:\n\n【7】*   Safety of the COVID-19 vaccine in those who breastfeed\n*   Side effects of the vaccine on the baby who breastfeeds\n*   Side effects on milk production or flow after the vaccine\n\n【8】But we do know that the vaccine works to ward off severe COVID-19 illness in people who breastfeed. Some studies show that those who breastfeed after the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine have antibodies in their breast milk. This could potentially protect their babies. More research is needed to know exactly how the antibodies may help your baby.\n\n【9】Is COVID-19 Transmitted Through Breast Milk?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【10】Breast milk is not likely to spread COVID-19 to babies. While you’re not likely to spread the virus to your baby through breast milk, it’s still important to get vaccinated to keep you and your newborn safe.\n\n【11】Can the COVID-19 Vaccine Affect Fertility?\n------------------------------------------\n\n【12】The COVID-19 vaccine won’t affect your fertility. People who are trying to get pregnant should still get the vaccine. There’s no reason to delay pregnancy after you’ve taken the vaccine.\n\n【13】False claims on social media stated that the spike protein on COVID-19 was the same as another spike protein (syncitin-1) that’s involved in the attachment and growth of your placenta during pregnancy. This misleading report suggested that the COVID-19 vaccine could affect your ability to reproduce. But these two spike proteins are not the same, and the COVID-19 vaccine won’t affect your chances of a successful pregnancy.\n\n【14】In one study with the Pfizer vaccine, 23 women volunteered to become pregnant. Only one woman had a pregnancy loss, but she had not received the COVID-19 vaccine. Instead, she’d received a placebo. All other women who had the vaccine had successful pregnancies.\n\n【15】What Are the Risks?\n-------------------\n\n【16】Compared to those not expecting, pregnant and recently pregnant people are at a higher risk for severe illness from the COVID-19 virus, but the risk is still low. This may include sickness that requires hospitalization, intensive care, the need for a ventilator or special equipment to breathe properly, or illness that results in death.\n\n【17】Pregnant people who have COVID-19 are also more likely to have a preterm birth and may have a higher risk of other adverse pregnancy outcomes, compared to pregnant people without COVID-19.\n\n【18】With the highly contagious Delta variant, it’s important for pregnant or recently pregnant people to get the COVID-19 vaccine. The severe side effects of COVID-19 in pregnant people outweigh any potential risks of the vaccine.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

It contains 2 medications : cabotegravir and rilpivirine. It helps to decrease the amount of HIV in your body so your immune system can work better. This lowers your chance of getting HIV complications (such as new infections, cancer ) and improves your quality of life. Cabotegravir is an integrase inhibitor while rilpivirine is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). Both drugs block the virus from growing and infecting more cells.Cabotegravir/rilpivirine is not a cure for HIV infection. To decrease your risk of spreading HIV disease to others, continue to take all HIV medications exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Use an effective barrier method (latex or polyurethane condoms /dental dams) during sexual activity as directed by your doctor. Do not share personal items (such as needles/syringes, toothbrushes , and razors) that may have contacted blood or other body fluids. Consult your doctor or pharmacist for more details.\n\n【2】### How to use Rilpivirine ER 600 Mg/2 Ml (300 Mg/Ml) IM Suspension, Extended Release Antiviral-HIV (Antiretroviral) Nonnucleoside RT Inhibitor\n\n【3】Read the Patient Information Leaflet if available from your pharmacist before you start using cabotegravir/rilpivirine and each time you get a refill.

{"seq_id": "2ead9d0f-7334-4461-832e-4c50094d9a43", "title": "What Is Ayurveda?", "text": "【0】What Is Ayurveda?\nAyurvedic medicine (“Ayurveda” for short) is one of the world's oldest holistic (“whole-body”) healing systems. It was developed more than 3,000 years ago in India.\n\n【1】It’s based on the belief that health and wellness depend on a delicate balance between the mind, body, and spirit. Its main goal is to promote good health, not fight disease. But treatments may be geared toward specific health problems.\n\n【2】In the United States, it’s considered a form of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM).\n\n【3】Ayurveda and Your Life Energy\n-----------------------------\n\n【4】Students of CAM therapy believe that everything in the universe – dead or alive – is connected. If your mind, body, and spirit are in harmony with the universe, you have good health. When something disrupts this balance, you get sick. Among the things that can upset this balance are genetic or birth defects, injuries, climate and seasonal change, age, and your emotions.\n\n【5】Those who practice Ayurveda believe every person is made of five basic elements found in the universe: space, air, fire, water, and earth.\n\n【6】These combine in the human body to form three life forces or energies, called doshas. They control how your body works. They are Vata dosha (space and air); Pitta dosha (fire and water); and Kapha dosha (water and earth).\n\n【7】Everyone inherits a unique mix of the three doshas. But one is usually stronger than the others. Each one controls a different body function. It’s believed that your chances of getting sick -- and the health issues you develop -- are linked to the balance of your doshas.\n\n【8】Vata Dosha\n----------\n\n【9】Those who practice Ayurveda believe this is the most powerful of all three doshas. It controls very basic body functions, like how cells divide. It also controls your mind, breathing, blood flow, heart function, and ability to get rid of waste through your intestines. Things that can disrupt it include eating again too soon after a meal, fear, grief, and staying up too late.\n\n【10】If vata dosha is your main life force, you’re thought to be more likely to develop conditions like anxiety, asthma, heart disease, skin problems, and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n【11】Pitta Dosha\n-----------\n\n【12】This energy controls your digestion, metabolism (how well you break down foods), and certain hormones that are linked to your appetite.\n\n【13】Things that can disrupt it are eating sour or spicy foods and spending too much time in the sun.\n\n【14】If it’s your main life force, you’re thought to be more likely to develop conditions like Crohn’s disease, heart disease, high blood pressure, and infections.\n\n【15】Kapha Dosha\n-----------\n\n【16】This life force controls muscle growth, body strength and stability, weight, and your immune system.\n\n【17】You can disrupt it by sleeping during the day, eating too many sweet foods, and eating or drinking things that contain too much salt or water.\n\n【18】If it’s your main life energy, practitioners believe you may develop asthma and other breathing disorders, cancer, diabetes, nausea after eating, and obesity.\n\n【19】Ayurvedic Treatment\n-------------------\n\n【20】An Ayurvedic practitioner will create a treatment plan specifically designed for you. They’ll take into account your unique physical and emotional makeup, your primary life force, and the balance between all three of these elements.\n\n【21】The goal of treatment is to cleanse your body of undigested food, which can stay in your body and lead to illness. The cleansing process—called “panchakarma”— is designed to reduce your symptoms and restore harmony and balance.\n\n【22】To achieve this, an Ayurvedic practitioner might rely on blood purification, massage, medical oils, herbs, and enemas or laxatives.\n\n【23】Does It Work?\n-------------\n\n【24】There are a few state-approved Ayurvedic schools in the U.S. But there’s no national standard training or certification program for those who practice this alternative therapy.\n\n【25】The FDA doesn’t review or approve Ayurvedic products. In fact, it’s banned certain ones from entering the country since 2007. What’s more, the agency has warned that 1 in 5 Ayurvedic medicines contain toxic metals, like lead, mercury, and arsenic. These heavy metals can cause life-threatening illness, especially in children.\n\n【26】Always talk to your doctor before you try Ayurveda or any other alternative medical treatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

But they may be having something else: a reaction called food intolerance.\n\n【1】What's the difference?\n\n【2】A **food allergy** is caused by your immune system reacting to the food when it doesn't need to.\n\n【3】With a **food intolerance**, your immune system isn't responsible. Most of the time it's a problem with digesting the food.\n\n【4】For example, being allergic to milk is different from not being able to digest it properly because of lactose intolerance.\n\n【5】Some people come from families where allergies are common -- not necessarily food allergies, but perhaps hay fever, asthma, or hives. When both of your parents have allergies, you're more likely to have food allergies than if only one parent has allergies.\n\n【6】If you think you have a food allergy, see a doctor to confirm what's triggering it and get help managing and treating it. Sometimes allergic reactions to food can be severe, even life-threatening.\n\n【7】How Food Allergies Work\n-----------------------\n\n【8】Food allergies involve two parts of your immune system. One is immunoglobulin E (IgE), a type of protein called an antibody that moves through the blood. The other is mast cells, which you have in all body tissues but especially in places like your nose, throat, lungs, skin, and digestive tract.\n\n【9】The first time you eat a food you're allergic to, certain cells make a lot of IgE for the part of the food that triggers your allergy, called an allergen. The IgE gets released and attaches to the surface of mast cells. You won't have a reaction yet, but now you're set up for one.\n\n【10】The next time you eat that food, the allergen interacts with that IgE and triggers the mast cells to release chemicals such as histamine. Depending on the tissue they're in, these chemicals will cause various symptoms. And since some food allergens aren't broken down by the heat of cooking or by stomach acids or enzymes that digest food, they can cross into your bloodstream. From there, they can travel and cause allergic reactions throughout your body.\n\n【11】The digestion process affects the timing and the location. You may feel itching in your mouth. Then you may have symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, or belly pain. Food allergens in your blood can cause a drop in blood pressure. As they reach your skin, they can trigger hives or eczema. In the lungs, they may cause wheezing. All of this takes place within a few minutes to an hour.\n\n【12】Which Food Allergies Are Most Common?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【13】In adults, they include:\n\n【14】*   Peanuts\n*   Tree nuts, such as walnuts\n*   Shellfish, including shrimp, crayfish, lobster, and crab\n\n【15】For children, the food allergens that most often cause problems are:\n\n【16】*   Eggs\n*   Milk\n*   Peanuts\n\n【17】Adults usually don't lose their allergies, but children do sometimes. Kids are more likely to outgrow allergies to milk, eggs, and soy than to peanuts, fish, and shrimp.\n\n【18】The foods that you'll react to are often those that you eat regularly. In Japan, for example, you'll find rice allergy. In Scandinavia, codfish allergy is common.\n\n【19】Cross Reactivity and Oral Allergy Syndrome\n------------------------------------------\n\n【20】When you have a life-threatening allergic reaction to a certain food, your doctor will probably recommend that you avoid similar foods, too. For example, if you react to shrimp, you're probably allergic to other shellfish like crab, lobster, and crayfish. This is called cross-reactivity.\n\n【21】Another example of cross-reactivity is oral allergy syndrome. It happens in people who are highly sensitive to ragweed. During ragweed season, when they try to eat melons, especially cantaloupe, their mouths may itch. Similarly, people who have severe birch pollen allergy may also react to apple peels.\n\n【22】Exercise-Induced Food Allergy\n-----------------------------\n\n【23】At least one type of food allergy needs more than simply eating the allergen to cause a reaction. If you have exercise-induced food allergy, you won't have a reaction unless you then do something physically active. As your body temperature goes up, you'll begin to itch, get lightheaded, and could have hives or even anaphylaxis.\n\n【24】Fortunately, the cure is simple: Don't eat that food for a couple of hours before you work out.\n\n【25】Is It Really a Food Allergy?\n----------------------------\n\n【26】A differential diagnosis is the process of telling the difference between a food allergy, a food intolerance, and other illnesses. When you go to the doctor's office and say, \"I think I have a food allergy,\" they have to consider a list of other things that could cause similar symptoms and be confused with a food allergy. These include:\n\n【27】*   Food poisoning\n*   Histamine toxicity\n*   Food additives, including sulfites, MSG, and dyes\n*   Lactose intolerance\n*   Gluten intolerance\n*   Other diseases\n*   Psychological triggers\n\n【28】Foods can get contaminated with bacteria and toxins. Tainted meat sometimes mimics a food allergy when it's really a type of food poisoning.\n\n【29】Histamine can reach high levels in cheese, some wines, and in certain kinds of fish, especially tuna and mackerel, if it hasn't been refrigerated properly. When you eat foods with a lot of histamine, you could have a reaction that looks like an allergic reaction. It's called histamine toxicity.\n\n【30】Sulfites are made naturally during the fermentation of wine, and they're added to other foods to enhance crispness or prevent mold growth. High concentrations of sulfites can pose problems for people with severe asthma. They give off a gas called sulfur dioxide, which the person breathes in while they're eating the food. This irritates their lungs and can trigger an asthma attack. That's why the FDA banned sulfites as spray-on preservatives for fresh fruits and vegetables. But sulfites are still used in some foods.\n\n【31】Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is naturally in foods including tomatoes, cheese, and mushrooms. It's added to others to boost flavor. When eaten in large amounts, it can cause flushing, warmth, headache, pressure in your face, chest pain, or feelings of detachment.\n\n【32】Yellow dye number 5 can cause hives, although that's rare.\n\n【33】Lactose intolerance, the most common food intolerance, affects at least 1 out of 10 people. Lactase is an enzyme in the lining of the gut. It breaks down lactose, a type of sugar in milk and other dairy products. If you don't have enough lactase, you can't digest lactose. Instead, bacteria eat the lactose, which creates gas, and you can get bloating, stomach pain, and diarrhea. Your doctor can measure your body's response to lactose by testing blood samples.\n\n【34】Gluten intolerance is not the same as celiac disease. Celiac disease is caused by an abnormal immune response to gluten, a protein found in wheat and some other grains. Gluten intolerance, on the other hand, involves how the digestive system handles gluten. Both of these are different from food allergies.\n\n【35】Several other diseases share symptoms with food allergies, including ulcers and digestive system cancers. These can lead to vomiting, diarrhea, or cramping pain that gets worse when you eat.\n\n【36】Some people may have a food intolerance with a psychological trigger. An unpleasant event, often during childhood, that's tied to eating a particular food can bring on a rush of unpleasant sensations when you eat that food later, even as an adult.\n\n【37】Diagnosing Food Allergies\n-------------------------\n\n【38】First, the doctor asks detailed questions like:\n\n【39】*   Did the reaction come on quickly, within an hour of eating the food?\n*   Did anyone else get sick?\n*   How much did you eat before the reaction started?\n*   How was the food prepared?\n*   Did you eat anything else at the same time?\n*   Did you take an antihistamine or do something else? Did it help?\n*   Does this always happen when you eat that food?\n\n【40】These help the doctor understand what's going on and could point to another explanation. For example, if you ate fish contaminated with histamine, everyone who ate that same fish would have gotten sick, too. Some people will have a violent allergic reaction only to raw or undercooked fish because heat destroys the allergens they're sensitive to. Or other foods in the meal can delay digestion so the allergic reaction starts later.\n\n【41】Your doctor may ask you to keep a food diary, a record of each meal and any reaction you have. This gives more detail for you both to look for patterns. You may find that the severity of your reaction is related to the amount of food that you ate.\n\n【42】The next step might be an elimination diet, which you do with the help of your doctor. You start by not eating a suspect food, like eggs. If your symptoms go away, that strongly suggests an allergy. Then you try eating that food again to see if the symptoms come back, which confirms the diagnosis. But you can't do an elimination diet if your reactions are severe (because you wouldn't want to trigger it) or you don't have them often.\n\n【43】Tests for Food Allergies\n------------------------\n\n【44】If your doctor thinks a specific food allergy is likely, you may get tests to measure your allergic response.\n\n【45】One of these is a scratch puncture test. The doctor or technician puts a drop of a solution made with the food on your forearm or back. Then they'll prick your skin with a needle through the drop and watch for swelling or redness.\n\n【46】Skin tests are quick, simple, and relatively safe. But experts don't recommend making a diagnosis based on a skin test alone. Your skin test may show an allergy to a food without you having allergic reactions when eating that food. So your doctor will diagnose a food allergy only when you have a positive skin test and a history of reactions to the same food.\n\n【47】If you're extremely allergic and have severe reactions, skin testing could be dangerous. It also can't be done if you have severe eczema. Instead, your doctor can use blood tests such as RAST and ELISA that measure the amount of food-specific IgE. These tests may cost more, and results take longer. Again, a positive result doesn't necessarily mean you have a food allergy.\n\n【48】A food challenge, or feeding test, is another way to confirm or rule out an allergy. It's done with your doctor there. You eat small servings of food every 15-30 minutes that have increasing amounts of the suspected allergen in them until you either have a reaction or eat a meal-sized portion.\n\n【49】In a \"double-blind\" test, neither you or your doctor know if what you're eating has the allergen in it. This type of testing is actually most common when the doctor believes that your reaction is _not_ from a specific food. The test can provide evidence to look elsewhere to find the real cause of the reaction.\n\n【50】Of course, people with severe reactions can't do food challenges, and it's hard to test more than one food allergy at the same time. It's also expensive because it takes a lot of time.\n\n【51】Unproven Ways to Diagnose Food Allergies\n----------------------------------------\n\n【52】Some techniques can't effectively identify food allergies. These include:\n\n【53】**Cytotoxicity testing.** A food allergen is added to your blood sample. A technician then checks the sample under the microscope to see if white cells in the blood \"die.\"\n\n【54】**Sublingual or subcutaneous provocative challenge**. It's similar to a skin test, but the sample of food allergen goes under your tongue or gets injected under your skin.\n\n【55】**Immune complex assay**. This blood test looks for groups of certain antibodies bound to the food allergen. But these clusters normally form as part of food digestion, and everyone, if tested with a sensitive enough measurement, has them.\n\n【56】**IgG subclass assay**. This blood test looks specifically for certain kinds of IgG antibodies, but they're part of a normal immune response.\n\n【57】Treatment for Food Allergies\n----------------------------\n\n【58】The main way to deal with food allergies is to avoid them. For highly allergic people, even tiny amounts of an allergen (as little as 1/44,000 of a peanut kernel) can trigger a reaction. Less-sensitive people may be able to have small amounts of a food that they're allergic to.\n\n【59】Once you've identified the food, you have to stop eating it. That may mean reading long, detailed ingredient lists because many allergy-triggering foods are in things you wouldn't expect to find them in. Peanuts, for example, may be included for protein, and eggs are in some salad dressings. At restaurants, you might have to ask about the ingredients that are in specific dishes or in the kitchen.\n\n【60】Even people who are very careful can make a mistake, so if you have severe food allergies, you must be prepared to treat an accidental exposure. If you've had anaphylactic reactions to a food, you should wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace. And you should carry two auto-injectors of epinephrine (Auvi-Q, EpiPen, Symjepi) and be ready to use them if you think a reaction is starting. Mild symptoms such as tingling in your mouth and throat or an upset stomach might not be an allergic reaction, but you should still give yourself an injection. It won't hurt, and it could save your life. Then call 911 or get a ride to the emergency room.\n\n【61】Parents and caregivers should protect children from their trigger foods and know what to do if the child eats one. Schools should have plans in place to address any related emergency. Children aged 4 to 17 with a severe peanut allergy could benefit from the newly approved drug Palforzia, which may help lessen a severe reaction, although they should still avoid peanuts.\n\n【62】Medications can help relieve food allergy symptoms that aren't part of an anaphylactic reaction:\n\n【63】*   Antihistamines for digestive issues, hives, and sneezing and a runny nose\n*   Bronchodilators for tightened airways or asthma\\-like symptoms\n\n【64】But these won't prevent an allergic reaction if you take them before eating the food. No medication can. Putting a dilute solution of a food under your tongue about a half hour before you eat it as a way to \"neutralize\" your exposure doesn't work either.\n\n【65】Allergy pills and shots are being studied as a way to desensitize people to food allergens. You regularly get small amounts of food extracts over a long period of time to help your body build up a kind of tolerance. But researchers haven't yet proven that allergy shots work for food allergies.\n\n【66】New studies looking for by sing oral immunotherapy was able to induce remission of peanut allergy, in some young children. Research from the National Institutes of Health found that giving peanut oral immunotherapy to children ages 1to 3 who were highly allergic to peanuts  was able to safely desensitized most of them to peanuts, And it induced remission of peanut allergy in one-fifth of them.\n\n【67】Food Allergies in Infants and Children\n--------------------------------------\n\n【68】Milk and soy allergies are particularly common in infants and young children, probably because their immune and digestive systems are still developing. These allergies can appear within days to months of birth. They may not show up as hives and asthma, but rather lead to colic and perhaps blood in poop or poor growth.\n\n【69】Typically, the doctor sees a very unhappy colicky child who may not sleep well at night and diagnoses a food allergy partly by changing their diet, like switching from cow's milk to soy formula. This type of allergy tends to disappear within a few years.\n\n【70】Doctors recommend only breastfeeding infants for the first 4-6 months, if possible, for many reasons, but there's no proof that it prevents food allergies later in life. While some pregnant women may hope limiting their diets while they're pregnant or breastfeeding may help their children avoid allergies, the experts disagree and don't suggest it. Soy formula isn't a good way to prevent allergies either.\n\n【71】Issues Mistakenly Linked to Food Allergies\n------------------------------------------\n\n【72】Although some people think certain illnesses can be caused by food allergies, evidence doesn't back up such claims. Histamines in cheese or red wine, for example, can trigger migraines. But we can't say that food allergies actually _cause_ migraines. Rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis aren't made worse by foods. Food allergies don't cause \"allergic tension fatigue syndrome,\" where people get tired, nervous, and may have problems concentrating or headaches.\n\n【73】Cerebral allergy is a term that describes when mast cells are supposedly releasing their chemicals in the brain -- and nowhere else in the body -- causing trouble concentrating and headaches. Most doctors don't recognize cerebral allergy as a disorder.\n\n【74】Even when their surroundings are very clean, some people have many general complaints like problems concentrating, fatigue, or depression. Environmental illness may be the result of small amounts of allergens or toxins, but not food allergies.\n\n【75】Researchers have found that hyperactivity in children may be related to food additives, but only occasionally and only when the child has had a lot of them. A food allergy won't directly affect a child's behavior, although their symptoms might make them cranky and difficult, and allergy medications can make them sleepy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "ee16ca56-ae4a-466e-a73f-4d3ffbeac19a", "title": "16 Ways to Avoid Back Pain", "text": "【0】16 Ways to Avoid Back Pain\nIf you’ve been sidelined by a sore back, you’re not alone. Four out of five people experience back pain at some point, making it the second most common reason for visiting the doctor.\n\n【1】Back pain takes various forms, from a persistent dull ache to sudden sharp pain, and has many causes. Sometimes it results from a sprain, fracture, or other accidental injury. It can stem from a disease or medical condition, such as arthritis, fibromyalgia, or spinal stenosis (a narrowing of the spinal canal through which the spinal cord runs). Many people develop back pain in part because they’re overweight or sedentary.\n\n【2】The good news is that most lower back pain usually gets better within a few days or weeks, and surgery is rarely necessary. What’s more, simple self-help strategies such as these can be surprisingly effective at preventing back pain and keeping it from returning:\n\n【3】**1\\. Get more** **exercise****.** If your back is hurting, you may think the best way to get relief is to limit exercise and to rest. A day or two of rest may help, but more than that may not help the pain. Experts now know that regular physical activity can help ease inflammation and muscle tension.\n\n【4】Ask your doctor or health club trainer about back-strengthening exercises. Also, some forms of yoga and tai chi may help you learn proper posture and improve strength, balance, and flexibility.\n\n【5】**2\\. Watch your weight.** Extra pounds, especially in your midsection, can make back pain worse by shifting your center of gravity and putting strain on your lower back. Staying within 10 pounds of your ideal weight may help control back pain.\n\n【6】**3\\. If you smoke, stop.** Smoking restricts the flow of nutrient-containing blood to spinal discs, so smokers are especially vulnerable to back pain.\n\n【7】**4\\. Sleep well.** If you’re prone to back pain, talk with your doctor about the best sleeping position. Sleeping on your side with your knees pulled up slightly toward your chest is sometimes suggested. Prefer to sleep on your back? Put one pillow under your knees and another under your lower back. Sleeping on your stomach can be especially hard on your back. If you can’t sleep any other way, place a pillow under your hips.\n\n【8】People prefer different things in their mattresses. If it’s too soft, many people will have backaches. The same is true for a very hard mattress. Many experts recommend a medium-firm mattress for those with chronic backache. It may take some trial and error to find what works for you. A piece of plywood between the box spring and mattress will stiffen a soft bed. A thick mattress pad will help soften a mattress that is too hard.\n\n【9】**5\\. Pay attention to your posture.** First, check your posture by standing with your heels against a wall. Your calves, buttocks, shoulders, and the back of your head should touch the wall. You should be able to slip your hand behind the small of your back. Now, step forward and stand normally. If your posture changes, correct it right away.\n\n【10】**6\\. Start with your seat.** The best chair for preventing back pain is one with a straight back or low-back support. Keep your knees a bit higher than your hips while seated. Your chair back should be set at an angle of about 110 degrees and should cradle the small of your back comfortably. If necessary, use a wedge-shaped cushion or lumbar pad. Prop your feet on a stool if you need to. If you must stand for a prolonged period, keep your head up and your stomach pulled in. If possible, rest one foot on a stool or box about 6 inches high -- and switch feet every 5 to 15 minutes.\n\n【11】**7\\. Check your desk.** To avoid straining your neck and eyes, center your computer monitor in front of you, about an arm's length away. The top of the monitor should be about 2 to 3 inches above your eye level. If you wear bifocals, it may be more comfortable to lower your monitor slightly.\n\n【12】Type at the right height. A lot of people put their keyboard directly on their desk, so it's just below chest level. But typing at that height for a long time limits circulation and stresses the joints and nerves in your arms, shoulders, and wrists. That can cause numbness and pain in those areas, as well as your back. It can even lead to long-term problems like carpal tunnel syndrome.\n\n【13】If you can, use a keyboard tray that's beneath your desktop. Your keyboard should be slightly below your elbows.\n\n【14】**8\\. Lighten up on laptop use.** Your laptop may be easy to carry around, but if you use it a lot, put it on a desk and type on a separate keyboard and use a mouse.\n\n【15】Using a laptop on your lap for long periods causes you to bend your head forward. That puts pressure on the bones called vertebrae at the top of your neck, which can trigger headaches and pain in your back and neck.\n\n【16】If you need to use a laptop on your lap, make sure the monitor is about 6 inches below your gaze. That position helps lessen how much you have to bend your neck to see. You can prop the laptop on a book or tray if your lap is too low.\n\n【17】Another tip: Limit your laptop use to half an hour at a time.\n\n【18】**9\\. Try not to type on your phone.** It's OK to send an occasional text or email on your phone. But remember, when you type on your phone, you're bending your head and curving your spine. If you do that for more than a few minutes, it will put stress on the delicate vertebrae in your neck.\n\n【19】The solution is simple. Save longer messages for when you can sit down at a computer with a straight spine.\n\n【20】**10\\. Take a lot of breaks.** Every 10 minutes, take at least 20 seconds to stop typing and stand and stretch. And every 20 minutes, even if you took a break in between, stand and spend at least 2 minutes away from your computer.\n\n【21】This gets your blood pumping and loosens up tight muscles and stiff joints. It also gives your eyes a chance to readjust, which can prevent computer-related vision problems.\n\n【22】**11\\. Be careful how you lift.** Don’t bend over from the waist to lift heavy objects. Bend your knees and squat, pulling in your stomach muscles and holding the object close to your body as you stand up. Let your legs do the lifting, not your back. Don't twist your body while lifting. If you can, push rather than pull heavy objects. Pushing is easier on the back.\n\n【23】**12\\. Avoid high heels.** They can shift your center of gravity and strain your lower back. Stick to a one-inch heel. If you have to go higher, bring along a pair of low-heeled shoes and slip into them if you become uncomfortable.\n\n【24】**13\\. Stash the skinny jeans.** Clothing so tight that it interferes with bending, sitting, or walking can aggravate back pain.\n\n【25】**14\\. Lighten your wallet.** Sitting on an overstuffed wallet may cause discomfort and back pain. If you’re going to be sitting for a prolonged period -- while driving, for example, take your wallet out of your back pocket.\n\n【26】**15\\. Pick the right handbag or briefcase.** Buy a bag or briefcase with a wide, adjustable strap that’s long enough to reach over your head. A messenger bag (like the ones bike messengers wear) is made to wear this way. Having the strap on the opposite shoulder of the bag distributes the weight more evenly and helps keep your shoulders even and your back pain-free. When carrying a heavy bag or case without straps, switch hands frequently to avoid putting all the stress on one side of the body. To lighten the load, periodically purge bags, cases, backpacks, and other carriers of things you don't need.\n\n【27】**16\\. Forget about back braces.** Various back supports are available, from elastic bands to special corsets. They can be helpful after certain kinds of surgery, but there is not much evidence that they help treat chronic back pain.\n\n【28】Workers who do a lot of heavy lifting are often required to wear lumbar support belts. There is also no proof that these belts prevent back injury. One study even found that these belts made injuries more likely", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

It is used with other HIV medications to help control HIV infection. It helps to decrease the amount of HIV in your body so your immune system can work better. This lowers your chance of getting HIV complications (such as new infections, cancer ) and improves your quality of life. Abacavir and lamivudine both belong to a class of drugs known as nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).Abacavir/lamivudine is not a cure for HIV infection. To decrease your risk of spreading HIV disease to others, continue to take all HIV medications exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Use an effective barrier method (latex or polyurethane condoms /dental dams) during sexual activity as directed by your doctor. Do not share personal items (such as needles/syringes, toothbrushes , and razors) that may have contacted blood or other body fluids. Consult your doctor or pharmacist for more details.\n\n【9】### How to use Epzicom\n\n【10】Read the Medication Guide and Warning Card provided by your pharmacist before you start taking abacavir /lamivudine and each time you get a refill. Carry the Warning Card with you at all times. If you have any questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【11】Take this medication by mouth with or without food as directed by your doctor, usually once daily.\n\n【12】Because this combination product has fixed doses of abacavir and lamivudine, it should only be used if your doctor has determined that the doses of both medications in this product are right for you.\n\n【13】If you stop taking any medication containing abacavir even for a short time and then restart the drug, you have an increased chance of developing a very serious (possibly fatal) allergic reaction . Refill your medication before you run out. Do not stop treatment unless directed by your doctor. Before restarting any medication containing abacavir, consult your doctor or pharmacist, and be sure you have easy access to medical care.\n\n【14】It is very important to continue taking this medication (and other HIV medications) exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Do not skip any doses. Do not increase your dose, take this drug more often than prescribed, or stop taking it (or other HIV medicines) even for a short time unless directed to do so by your doctor. Skipping or changing your dose without approval from your doctor may cause the amount of virus to increase, make the infection more difficult to treat (resistant), or worsen side effects.\n\n【15】For the best effect, take this medication at evenly spaced times. To help you remember, take this medication at the same time every day.\n\n【16】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【17】See also Warning and How to Use sections.\n\n【18】Headache , nausea , diarrhea , dizziness , tiredness, or trouble sleeping may occur.

{"seq_id": "e78d2b0a-18fe-43c2-b8fc-f58385c54ea0", "title": "How Do You Catch HIV?", "text": "【0】How Do You Catch HIV?\nWe've come a long way from the days when people were so worried they might catch HIV that they avoided people with it altogether. Still, some people may not be sure exactly what's safe and what's not.\n\n【1】It's true that HIV is a virus, like a cold or the flu -- but it doesn't spread the same way. In fact, it's a lot harder to catch. You can only get it when certain fluids from someone who's infected get into your body.\n\n【2】So, how does that happen?\n\n【3】From a Hug?\n-----------\n\n【4】No. HIV is only spread through specific body fluids: blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid (secreted from penis before ejaculation), vaginal and rectal fluid, and breast milk. Hugging and shaking hands are safe.\n\n【5】From Kissing?\n-------------\n\n【6】It's possible, but it hardly ever happens. HIV isn't spread through saliva.\n\n【7】But if you kiss someone who's infected and has bleeding gums or sores, you could get the virus if you also have cuts or sores around or in your mouth -- because of the blood\\-to-blood contact.\n\n【8】From Someone's Cough or Sneeze?\n-------------------------------\n\n【9】No, the virus doesn't travel through air.\n\n【10】From Someone's Tears, Sweat, Vomit, or Pee?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【11】Not like that. Sweat and tears don't carry HIV. And even though they might have a trace of blood, there have been no reported cases of HIV from vomit or pee.\n\n【12】From Vaginal Sex?\n-----------------\n\n【13】Yes, and either partner can get it!\n\n【14】Women can get HIV through the tissue that lines their vagina and cervix. The virus can get into men through the opening of their penis or through a small cut or sore on it. Women are at higher risk if they are the one being penetrated.\n\n【15】Effective HIV drugs (antiretroviral therapy) will greatly reduce the chances that an HIV infected person can give HIV to their partner in this way. However, even when HIV drugs are used, use a condom to cut your chances of the virus passing between you, as well as getting any other sexually transmitted infections.\n\n【16】From Anal Sex?\n--------------\n\n【17】Yes. Either partner can get it from the other, but ther person being penetrated is at higher risk.\n\n【18】And while condoms work to protect you if they stay in place, they're more likely to break during anal sex.It is smart to use a condom-safe lubricant (that is not oil-based) to reduce friction and the risk of condoms breaking.\n\n【19】Again, effective antretroviral therapy in the HIV-infected partner will reduce the chances of passing HIV. However, condoms should be used to prevent HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.\n\n【20】From Oral Sex?\n--------------\n\n【21】It's much less likely than when you have anal or vaginal sex. Still, it can happen.\n\n【22】The person who ends up with semen or vaginal fluid in their mouth is at greater risk. Again, use a condom, latex barrier, or dental dam.\n\n【23】From a Toilet Seat or Water Fountain?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【24】No, for several reasons. First, there's not likely to be the right kind of body fluid on public surfaces. And if there were, the virus would probably die before you got to it; it can't live long outside a body. And it would still have to get through your skin or into you somehow.\n\n【25】From Drinking Out of the Same Glass?\n------------------------------------\n\n【26】That's not a problem. Sharing dishes, glasses, and eating utensils is safe. Remember, HIV isn't in saliva, and it dies quickly once it's outside the body.\n\n【27】From Eating Food Made by a Person With HIV?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【28】Probably not, even if there are traces of blood or another fluid in it. The virus can't survive the cooking process or your stomach acid.\n\n【29】Passing HIV through eating has happened only in rare cases, when children ate food that was already chewed by someone with the virus.\n\n【30】From Mosquitoes or Ticks?\n-------------------------\n\n【31】Nope, not through insects.\n\n【32】From Sharing Needles?\n---------------------\n\n【33】Yes, and it's not just the needles. Any of the supplies for preparing drugs for injection -- syringes, bottle caps, spoons, or containers -- could have the virus if someone with HIV used it first.\n\n【34】From a Tattoo or a Body Piercing?\n---------------------------------\n\n【35】In theory, yes, if the needles were used on someone with HIV before you and then not sterilized. But the CDC says no cases have been reported of someone getting the virus this way.\n\n【36】From a Blood Transfusion?\n-------------------------\n\n【37】Again, theoretically yes, but in the U.S., there's little risk. Careful testing makes sure that blood bank supplies are HIV-free.\n\n【38】From Touching an Open Wound on Someone Who Has HIV?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【39】Maybe. Body fluids like blood can pass through broken skin, wounds, or mucous membranes. But it's very rare.\n\n【40】If Someone With HIV Bites, Scratches, or Spits on You?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【41】It's _possible_ if a bite or scratch breaks your skin, but (yes, again) it's extremely rare. And if your skin doesn't break, there's no chance.\n\n【42】Getting spit on is unpleasant and messy, but not a danger as far as catching HIV.\n\n【43】From Your Mom (If You're a Baby)?\n---------------------------------\n\n【44】Women infected with HIV can pass the virus to their child during pregnancy or while they are giving birth, or through their breast milk. The chances are greatly reduced, however if the mother is taking effective HIV drugs (antiretroviral therapy) throughout their pregnancy, labor, and delivery.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "ff03ae33-a7a0-49ce-87c5-4b2fb4b03c07", "title": "Zubsolv Tablet, Sublingual - Uses, Side Effects, and More", "text": "【0】Zubsolv Tablet, Sublingual - Uses, Side Effects, and More\nHow to use Zubsolv Tablet, Sublingual\n-------------------------------------\n\n【1】Read the Medication Guide provided by your pharmacist before you start taking buprenorphine / naloxone and each time you get a refill. If you have any questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【2】There are different brands and forms of this medication available. Because different products may contain different amounts of buprenorphine and naloxone , do not change brands or dosage forms without consulting your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【3】Use this medication during your treatment maintenance period as directed by your doctor, usually once daily. Place the medication under your tongue for 5 to 10 minutes and let it dissolve completely. If you are prescribed more than one tablet each day, you may place all of the tablets under your tongue at once or place two tablets at a time under your tongue. Do not swallow or chew this medication. It will not work as well.\n\n【4】After the medication is fully dissolved, take a large sip of water and swish gently around your teeth and gums, and then swallow the water. This will help to prevent problems with your teeth . Do not brush your teeth for at least one hour after using this medication.\n\n【5】For most patients, buprenorphine alone is usually used for the first 2 days after you have stopped all other opioids . It is usually given in your doctor's office. Your doctor will then switch you to this combination buprenorphine/naloxone medication for maintenance treatment. The combination with naloxone works the same way as buprenorphine alone to prevent withdrawal symptoms. For some patients, this combination product may be used to start treatment (called induction). Follow your doctor's directions carefully.\n\n【6】The dosage is based on your medical condition and response to treatment. Do not increase your dose, take the medication more often, or take it for a longer time than prescribed. Properly stop the medication when so directed.\n\n【7】Use this medication regularly in order to get the most benefit from it. To help you remember, use it at the same time each day.\n\n【8】Buprenorphine/naloxone may cause withdrawal symptoms especially if you use it soon after using opioids such as heroin , morphine , or methadone . Follow your doctor's instructions for your treatment plan.\n\n【9】If you suddenly stop using this medication, you may have withdrawal symptoms (such as restlessness, watering eyes , runny nose , nausea , sweating , muscle aches). To help prevent withdrawal, your doctor may lower your dose slowly. Withdrawal is more likely if you have used this medication for a long time or in high doses. Tell your doctor or pharmacist right away if you have withdrawal.\n\n【10】Do not inject (\"shoot up\") buprenorphine/naloxone or inhale it through the nose (\"snort\"). Doing so is dangerous, and will likely cause severe withdrawal symptoms (see Side Effects section) due to the naloxone in this medication, especially if you have been using opioids such as heroin, morphine or methadone. Consult your doctor or pharmacist for more details.\n\n【11】Tell your doctor right away if you experience any withdrawal reactions.\n\n【12】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【13】Drowsiness, dizziness , constipation , or headache may occur. If any of these effects last or get worse, tell your doctor or pharmacist right away.\n\n【14】To prevent constipation , eat dietary fiber , drink enough water, and exercise . You may also need to take a laxative . Ask your pharmacist which type of laxative is right for you.\n\n【15】To reduce the risk of dizziness and lightheadedness , get up slowly when rising from a sitting or lying position.\n\n【16】Remember that this medication has been prescribed because your doctor has judged that the benefit to you is greater than the risk of side effects. Many people using this medication do not have serious side effects.\n\n【17】Severe (possibly fatal) breathing problems can occur if this medication is abused, injected, or mixed with other depressants (such as alcohol, benzodiazepines including diazepam , other opioids ).\n\n【18】Tell your doctor right away if you have any serious side effects, including: interrupted breathing during sleep ( sleep apnea ), mental/mood changes (such as agitation, confusion, hallucinations ), stomach / abdominal pain , tooth /gum pain, signs of your adrenal glands not working well (such as unusual tiredness, weight loss ).\n\n【19】Although this medication is used to prevent withdrawal reactions, it may rarely cause opioid withdrawal symptoms, including diarrhea , severe mental/mood changes (such as anxiety, irritability, trouble sleeping ), muscle stiffness or shakiness. This is more likely when you first start treatment or if you have been using long-acting opioids such as methadone . If such symptoms occur, notify your doctor or pharmacist right away.\n\n【20】Get medical help right away if you have any very serious side effects, including: fainting , fast/irregular heartbeat, severe dizziness, slow/shallow breathing, unusual drowsiness/difficulty waking up.\n\n【21】This drug may rarely cause serious liver disease . Get medical help right away if you have any symptoms of liver damage, including: nausea / vomiting that doesn't stop, dark urine , loss of appetite, yellowing eyes / skin , severe stomach /abdominal pain.\n\n【22】A very serious allergic reaction to this drug is rare. However, get medical help right away if you notice any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction , including: rash , itching /swelling (especially of the face/ tongue /throat), severe dizziness, trouble breathing .\n\n【23】This is not a complete list of possible side effects. If you notice other effects not listed above, contact your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【24】In the US - Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or at www.fda.gov/medwatch.\n\n【25】In Canada - Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to Health Canada at 1-866-234-2345.\n\n【26】Precautions\n-----------\n\n【27】Before taking this medication , tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are allergic to buprenorphine or naloxone ; or if you have any other allergies . This product may contain inactive ingredients, which can cause allergic reactions or other problems. Talk to your pharmacist for more details.\n\n【28】Before using this medication, tell your doctor or pharmacist your medical history, especially of: brain disorders (such as head injury , tumor, seizures ), breathing problems (such as asthma , sleep apnea , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \\- COPD ), liver disease , mental/ mood disorders (such as confusion, depression ), stomach /intestinal problems (such as blockage, constipation , diarrhea due to infection, paralytic ileus), difficulty urinating (such as due to enlarged prostate ).\n\n【29】This drug may make you dizzy or drowsy. Alcohol or marijuana ( cannabis ) can make you more dizzy or drowsy. Do not drive, use machinery, or do anything that needs alertness until you can do it safely. Avoid alcoholic beverages. Talk to your doctor if you are using marijuana (cannabis). Alcohol also increases your risk for breathing problems .\n\n【30】Buprenorphine may cause a condition that affects the heart rhythm (QT prolongation). QT prolongation can rarely cause serious (rarely fatal) fast/irregular heartbeat and other symptoms (such as severe dizziness , fainting ) that need medical attention right away.\n\n【31】The risk of QT prolongation may be increased if you have certain medical conditions or are taking other drugs that may cause QT prolongation. Before using buprenorphine, tell your doctor or pharmacist of all the drugs you take and if you have any of the following conditions: certain heart problems ( heart failure , slow heartbeat, QT prolongation in the EKG ), family history of certain heart problems (QT prolongation in the EKG , sudden cardiac death).\n\n【32】Low levels of potassium or magnesium in the blood may also increase your risk of QT prolongation. This risk may increase if you use certain drugs (such as diuretics /\" water pills \") or if you have conditions such as severe sweating , diarrhea , or vomiting . Talk to your doctor about using buprenorphine safely.\n\n【33】This medicine may contain aspartame. If you have phenylketonuria (PKU) or any other condition that requires you to restrict your intake of aspartame (or phenylalanine ), consult your doctor or pharmacist about using this drug safely.\n\n【34】Some people using this medication may have dental problems (such as tooth decay /loss, cavities , infection). Schedule a visit to the dentist soon after starting this medication and tell your dentist that you are using this medication. To help prevent dental problems, have regular dental exams and learn how to keep your teeth and gums healthy. If you have tooth or gum pain, tell your doctor and dentist right away.\n\n【35】Before having surgery, tell your doctor or dentist about all the products you use (including prescription drugs , nonprescription drugs, and herbal products).\n\n【36】Older adults may be more sensitive to the side effects of this drug, especially slow/shallow breathing, drowsiness, and QT prolongation (see above).\n\n【37】Before using this medication, women of childbearing age should talk with their doctor(s) about the risks and benefits. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or if you plan to become pregnant. During pregnancy, this medication should be used only when clearly needed. It may slightly increase the risk of birth defects if used during the first two months of pregnancy. Also, using it for a long time or in high doses near the expected delivery date may harm the unborn baby. To lessen the risk, use the smallest effective dose for the shortest possible time. Tell the doctor right away if you notice any symptoms in your newborn baby such as slow/shallow breathing, irritability, abnormal/nonstop crying, vomiting, or diarrhea .\n\n【38】Buprenorphine passes into breast milk. It is unknown if naloxone passes into breast milk. This product may rarely have undesirable effects on a nursing infant . Tell the doctor right away if your baby develops unusual sleepiness, difficulty feeding, or trouble breathing . Consult your doctor before breast-feeding.\n\n【39】Consult your pharmacist or physician.\n\n【40】Interactions\n------------\n\n【41】Drug interactions may change how your medications work or increase your risk for serious side effects. This document does not contain all possible drug interactions. Keep a list of all the products you use (including prescription/nonprescription drugs and herbal products) and share it with your doctor and pharmacist . Do not start, stop, or change the dosage of any medicines without your doctor's approval.\n\n【42】Some products that may interact with this medication include: certain pain medications (mixed opioid agonist-antagonists such as butorphanol, nalbuphine, pentazocine ), naltrexone , samidorphan.\n\n【43】The risk of serious side effects (such as slow/shallow breathing, severe drowsiness/ dizziness ) may be increased if this medication is used with other products that may also affect breathing or cause drowsiness. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other products such as alcohol, marijuana ( cannabis ), antihistamines (such as cetirizine , diphenhydramine ), drugs for sleep or anxiety (such as alprazolam , diazepam , zolpidem), muscle relaxants (such as carisoprodol , cyclobenzaprine ), and other opioid pain relievers (such as codeine, hydrocodone ).\n\n【44】Check the labels on all your medicines (such as allergy or cough \\-and-cold products) because they may contain ingredients that cause drowsiness. Ask your pharmacist about using those products safely.\n\n【45】Deaths have occurred when this medication has been misused by injecting it (\"shooting up\"), especially when used in combination with benzodiazepines (such as diazepam) or other depressants such as alcohol or additional opioids .\n\n【46】Does Zubsolv Tablet, Sublingual interact with other drugs you are taking?\n\n【47】Enter your medication into the WebMD interaction checker\n\n【48】   \n\n【49】Check Interaction\n\n【50】Overdose\n--------\n\n【51】If someone has overdosed and has serious symptoms such as passing out or trouble breathing , give them naloxone if available, then call 911.

{"seq_id": "603046f9-70f5-4240-907e-89a97e53ee6f", "title": "What Is HIV?", "text": "【0】What Is HIV?\nHIV is a virus that lives in human blood, sexual fluids, and breast milk. It weakens your immune system, so your body has a hard time fighting off common germs, viruses, fungi, and other invaders. It spreads mainly through unprotected sexual contact and sharing needles.\n\n【1】AIDS -- acquired immune deficiency syndrome -- is the condition that comes when your immune system stops working and you get sick because of HIV.\n\n【2】Who Gets It?\n------------\n\n【3】The infection spreads from person to person when certain body fluids are shared, usually during vaginal or anal sex, or when sharing drugs you inject. It can also be passed from dirty needles from tattoos and body piercing. It can be spread through oral sex, too, although the chance is small.\n\n【4】Mothers can pass HIV to their child during pregnancy or birth, when the baby is exposed to their infected blood, or in their breast milk. But in some areas of the developing world, it's safer for moms with HIV to breastfeed for a few months rather than to give a newborn formula with potentially contaminated water, especially if they are receiving treatment for HIV (see below).\n\n【5】HIV doesn't live in saliva, tears, pee, or sweat -- so it can't be spread by casual contact with these body fluids.\n\n【6】HIV is not as easy to get as other infectious diseases. The virus can't survive for long outside the human body; it dies quickly when the body fluid dries up. It's not spread by animals or insects. You won't find it on public surfaces like door handles or toilet seats.\n\n【7】All blood products used in the United States and Western Europe today are tested for HIV. Blood banks get rid of any donated blood that tests positive, so it never gets into the public supply. Someone who donates HIV-positive blood will be contacted so they can be tested by their doctor, and they won't be able to give blood again.\n\n【8】Where Is It Widespread?\n-----------------------\n\n【9】HIV is spread throughout the world, but Sub-Saharan Africa (the southern part) has the greatest number of people who are infected. The World Health Organization and the United Nations UNAIDS office estimate that more than a third of adults are infected with HIV in some areas of Africa. There are many cases of HIV in South and Southeastern Asia. The numbers of people who have HIV in Eastern Europe are growing because of injection drug use.\n\n【10】There are two main types of the virus: HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-2 is most commonly found in West Africa, although places in other parts of the world are seeing it, too. HIV tests usually look for both kinds.\n\n【11】Living With HIV and AIDS\n------------------------\n\n【12】The first documented AIDS case in the United States was in 1981 (in retrospect, some cases occurred earlier in the world). Since then, about 35 million people in the world have died from illnesses related to the disease. Millions of children have been orphaned because of it.\n\n【13】Now, combination drug treatments have turned HIV into a long-term infection that you can manage, even if HIV has progressed to AIDS. At the end of 2022, about 39 million people in the world were living with HIV, including about 2 million kids. About 30 million of these persons were receiving these life-saving treatments. When you work closely with your doctors and stick to your treatment plan, you can live a long time and expect a near normal life expectancy.\n\n【14】It can take HIV many years to damage your immune system enough to make you vulnerable to certain diseases, such as a form of skin cancer called Kaposi's sarcoma. These other \"opportunistic infections\" are signs that you have AIDS, since people with healthy immune systems rarely get them. However, the HIV treatments, if taken early, can prevent the progression to AIDS.\n\n【15】Because there are drugs you can take for it, some groups of people believe they don't have to be worried about HIV anymore, even though they're more likely to get the virus. But treatments don't change the fact that HIV is a potentially life-threatening illness.\n\n【16】HIV and AIDS medications can be expensive. Despite successful programs to treat people with HIV in resource-limited countries, many people in the world living with the virus and its complications still have a hard time getting the medicine they need.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "a2cbd512-8646-4033-af75-0f9b71a16c19", "title": "What Is Chordoma?", "text": "【0】What Is Chordoma?\nChordoma is a kind of cancer that grows in the bones of your skull and spine. It's very rare. Only 1 out of every 1 million people gets it. About 300 people are diagnosed with chordoma in the United States each year.\n\n【1】You can get it at any age -- even in childhood. But most people are diagnosed between ages 40 and 70. Men get it more often than women.\n\n【2】Chordomas can form anywhere in your back, neck, or skull. Many grow in the bottom of your spine or at the base of your skull. From there, they can spread to other organs, like your lungs. But they usually grow slowly.\n\n【3】Because they're close to important areas like the brain and spinal cord, they need to be treated very carefully.\n\n【4】Causes\n------\n\n【5】In the womb, a baby has a thin bar called a notochord that runs along their back. This bar supports the bones of the spine as they grow. The notochord disappears before the baby is born.\n\n【6】In a small number of people, some of the notochord cells are left behind in the spine and skull.\n\n【7】Doctors believe chordoma starts because of a change in the gene that carries instructions for making a protein that helps the spine form. This change causes notochord cells that are left in the brain or spinal cord to divide too quickly.\n\n【8】This change usually happens randomly -- no one in your family has to have chordoma for you to get it. But it can run in families in rare instances.\n\n【9】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【10】Chordomas can press on nerves in your spine or brain. This can cause pain, numbness, or weakness. Your symptoms depend on where the cancer is and how big it is.\n\n【11】Chordoma in the skull causes symptoms like:\n\n【12】*   Abnormal eye movements\n*   Changes to your voice or speech\n*   Double vision\n*   Headache\n*   Loss of feeling and movement in your face\n*   Neck pain\n*   Trouble swallowing\n\n【13】Chordoma of the spine causes symptoms like:\n\n【14】*   Loss of control over your bowels\n*   Lump in the lower part of your back\n*   Numbness, tingling, or weakness in your arms or legs\n*   Pain in your lower back\n*   Problems controlling your bladder\n\n【15】Sometimes, chordomas in the brain can block the flow of fluid there and in the spine. The fluid can build up and put pressure on the brain. This is called hydrocephalus.\n\n【16】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【17】Your doctor can do imaging tests to see where the cancer is inside your body and how big it's grown. These include:\n\n【18】*   X-ray: Low doses of radiation are used to make images of your brain or spinal cord.\n*   CT (computed tomography) scan: X-rays are taken from several different angles and put together to make detailed pictures of the affected area.\n*   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): Powerful magnets and radio waves are used to make pictures of organs and other structures inside your body.\n\n【19】A biopsy is the only test that can confirm you have chordoma. Your doctor will use a needle to take a small sample of cells from the tumor. A specialist will look at the cells under a microscope to see what kind of tumor you have.\n\n【20】Your doctor might also do a blood test, a CT scan of your lungs, or a bone scan to see if the tumor has spread.\n\n【21】Treatment\n---------\n\n【22】Your treatment will depend on:\n\n【23】*   Your age\n*   Your health\n*   Size of the tumor\n*   Where the tumor is\n\n【24】Often, doctors remove the tumor with surgery. Taking out as much of the tumor as possible and some of the tissue around it can stop it from coming back.\n\n【25】Sometimes surgeons can't remove the whole tumor because they might damage healthy cells in your brain or spine. Radiation -- high energy X-rays -- can kill any cancer cells that are left behind after surgery. This lowers the chance that the cancer will return.\n\n【26】Still, chordoma often comes back after treatment. During the first year after your surgery, your doctor will check you with an MRI about once every 3 months to make sure it hasn't. If it does come back, you might need another surgery.\n\n【27】Researchers are studying several new treatments for chordoma. They test these in clinical trials to see if they're safe and if they work. These are often a way for people to try a new therapy that isn't available to everyone. Your doctor can tell you if there's a trial that might be a good fit for you.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

The symptoms of the disease can look a lot like those of many other conditions, including:\n\n【2】*   Infections\n*   Taking medications that don’t work well together\n*   Small strokes\n*   Depression\n*   Low blood sugar\n*   Thyroid problems\n*   Brain tumors\n*   Parkinson’s disease\n\n【3】The doctor will test you or your loved one to see if you really have Alzheimer’s. They’ll start with a physical exam and tests of your mental status, including:\n\n【4】*   Memory\n*   Verbal skills\n*   Problem-solving\n*   Thinking skills\n*   Mood\n\n【5】They might also ask other family members about any signs they’ve noticed.\n\n【6】Doctors can use imaging tests of the brain to decide if someone has Alzheimer’s or another problem.\n\n【7】*   Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures of the brain. The scan can show if someone has had strokes or tumors that might cause the symptoms.\n*   Positron emission tomography (PET) is a scan that uses tracers such as flortaucipir (Tauvid) to show the plaques that build up in brains affected by Alzheimer’s. But Medicare and other insurance carriers usually don’t cover PET scans.\n*   Precivity AD test is a blood test that looks at the amounts of proteins such as beta amyloid and Apo E in blood. The presence or absence helps determine the probability of whether an imaging study (like a PET scan) can detect plaques in the brain and lead to an Alzheimer’s diagnosis.   \n\n【8】What’s the Treatment for Alzheimer's Disease?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【9】There’s no cure for Alzheimer’s disease. But there are medicines that seem to slow down its progress, especially in the early stages. Others can help with mood changes and other behavior problems.\n\n【10】*   **Aducanumab-avwa** **(****Aduhelm****)** and**lecanemab-irmb** **(****Leqembi)**. These therapies are human monoclonal antibodies that target the fundamental pathophysiology of the disease by reducing amyloid beta plaques in the brain. they are for use in those with early stages of Alzheimer’s and with confirmed presence of amyloid pathology. It may cause swelling or bleeding in the brain.\n*   **Donepezil** (**Aricept****),** **galantamine**(Razadyne, formerly known as Reminyl), and **rivastigmine** **(****Exelon****)**. They may improve how well the brain works in the early stages of Alzheimer’s and delay how fast symptoms get worse.\n*   **Memantine** **(****Namenda****)**. This drug keeps brain cells from using too much of a brain chemical called glutamate, which Alzheimer’s-damaged cells make too much of. The drug seems to protect against nerve damage and has fewer side effects than other drugs. It may keep moderate to severe symptoms from getting worse quickly. People who have moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease may take this drug along with donepezil, galantamine, or rivastigmine.\n*   **Memantine-Donepezil** (**Namzaric****).** This drug is a combination of donepezil and memantine. It’s meant for those with moderate to severe Alzheimer's.\n\n【11】Other Treatments\n----------------\n\n【12】Doctors prescribe a number of drugs to relieve specific Alzheimer’s symptoms:\n\n【13】*   To ease paranoia, confusion, hallucinations (seeing, hearing, or feeling things that aren’t there), and aggressive behavior, doctors may recommend antipsychotic drugs, such as haloperidol (Haldol), olanzapine (Zyprexa), and risperidone (Risperdal).\n*   Drugs such as fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), sertraline (Zoloft), and venlafaxine (Effexor), can help with depression.\n*   Sleep medications can fight insomnia.\n*   Anti-anxiety drugs, such as alprazolam (Xanax), buspirone (BuSpar), lorazepam (Ativan), and oxazepam (Serax) treat agitation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "954ab779-1383-411b-a2d9-4d127f0127ac", "title": "What Leads to Heart Failure?", "text": "【0】What Leads to Heart Failure?\nHeart failure can happen when your heart is too weak or too stiff to pump enough blood to the rest of your body. Some health conditions can affect how well your heart works and lead to heart failure.\n\n【1】Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)\n-----------------------------\n\n【2】CAD happens when a fatty substance called plaque builds up in your arteries (the blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood from your heart to the rest of your body). Over time, plaque hardens and your arteries get narrow. An artery clogged with plaque is like a clogged drainpipe -- less blood can squeeze through. This is called atherosclerosis.\n\n【3】Your heart has to pump harder to push blood through those narrow arteries, and it doesn't get the blood it needs to work as well as it should. Over time, this can make your heart so weak that it leads to heart failure.\n\n【4】Heart Attack\n------------\n\n【5】If you have CAD, a piece of the plaque that's built up in your arteries can break off. This can lead to a blood clot. If the clot gets lodged in one of the arteries bringing blood to your heart, it can block the blood flow and you could have a heart attack.\n\n【6】Without enough oxygen, the part of the heart that's blocked can die. This damage weakens your heart and can lead to heart failure.\n\n【7】High Blood Pressure\n-------------------\n\n【8】Blood pressure is the force of blood as your heart pumps it through your arteries. When the blood pushes against your artery walls with more force than usual, you have high blood pressure. This makes your heart work harder to push blood through your body, and that extra work makes your heart bigger and weaker. High blood pressure that's not managed well can double or triple your chances of heart failure.\n\n【9】Diabetes\n--------\n\n【10】The hormone insulin normally moves sugar from your bloodstream into your cells, where it's used for energy or stored for later. When you have diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin or doesn't use insulin well enough. This can leave too much sugar in your blood (high blood sugar).\n\n【11】High blood sugar damages arteries and weakens your heart. That can lead to heart failure. People who have diabetes are also more likely to have high blood pressure and atherosclerosis.\n\n【12】Sleep Apnea\n-----------\n\n【13】This is when your breathing pauses over and over again while you sleep. Each time you stop breathing, your brain jolts you awake to get it restarted. It may be linked to atrial fibrillation (a quivering or irregular heartbeat) and high blood pressure in your lungs, which can lead to heart failure.\n\n【14】Obesity\n-------\n\n【15】More than one-third of Americans are obese. That means the ratio of their weight to their height, known as body mass index or BMI, is 30 or higher.\n\n【16】Extra weight puts more strain on your heart. Being obese also makes you more likely to have diseases linked to heart failure, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or sleep apnea.\n\n【17】Heart Muscle Disease (Cardiomyopathy)\n-------------------------------------\n\n【18】This disease damages your heart muscle and makes it so weak it can't pump blood like it should. Cardiomyopathy can run in families, or it can be caused by coronary artery disease, a virus, or another condition.\n\n【19】Abnormal Heart Valves\n---------------------\n\n【20】Four valves control the flow of blood into and out of your heart. They keep blood from flowing backward. If you have heart valve disease, at least one of these valves doesn't work right. The problem can start when you're born, or it can be caused by something that damages your heart, like a heart attack or an infection.\n\n【21】When a valve doesn't open or shut the way it should, your heart has to work harder to pump blood. A valve problem that isn't treated can lead to heart failure.\n\n【22】Irregular Heart Rhythm (Arrhythmia)\n-----------------------------------\n\n【23】Your heart usually beats in a regular _lub-dub_ pattern. The upper chambers squeeze, and then the lower chambers squeeze. When you have an irregular heart rhythm, your heart beats too quickly, too slowly, or out of rhythm.\n\n【24】If your heart is off its beat for too long, it won't pump enough blood. This can eventually lead to heart failure.\n\n【25】Alcohol, Drugs, and Tobacco\n---------------------------\n\n【26】One or two drinks a day might be good for your heart, but more than that can lead to obesity, high blood pressure, and heart failure.\n\n【27】Drugs like cocaine, amphetamines, and ecstasy (MDMA) ramp up your heart rate and raise your blood pressure. Using these drugs can lead to a heart attack and eventually make your heart fail.\n\n【28】Smoking also damages your heart and raises your blood pressure. The chemicals in cigarette smoke keep your blood from carrying enough oxygen through your body. That makes your heart work harder. Smoking also narrows your blood vessels and makes your blood more likely to clot.\n\n【29】Medicines\n---------\n\n【30】Several drugs can lead to heart failure or make it worse, including:\n\n【31】*   Antidepressants -- citalopram (Celexa) and tricyclic antidepressants\n*   Antifungal drugs -- amphotericin B (Ambisome, Amphotec) and itraconazole (Sporanox, Onmel)\n*   Drugs that affect your appetite\n*   Asthma medicines -- albuterol (Proventil, Ventolin), bosentan, and epoprostenol\n*   Blood pressure medicines -- alpha-blockers and calcium channel blockers\n*   Chemotherapy drugs used to treat cancer\n*   Diabetes drugs -- metformin (Glucophage, Glumetza)\n*   Epilepsy drugs -- carbamazepine (Tegretol) and pregabalin (Lyrica)\n*   Heart rhythm drugs\n*   Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pain relievers (NSAIDs)\n*   Migraine medicines -- ergotamine and methysergide\n*   Medication used to treat Parkinson's disease", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "1ef6972e-5dc6-4418-80b8-16e1a17b92e5", "title": "What Is Homeopathy?", "text": "【0】What Is Homeopathy?\nHomeopathy is a medical system based on the belief that the body can cure itself. Those who practice it use tiny amounts of natural substances, like plants and minerals. They believe these stimulate the healing process.\n\n【1】It was developed in the late 1700s in Germany. It’s common in many European countries, but it’s not quite as popular in the United States.\n\n【2】How Does It Work?\n-----------------\n\n【3】A basic belief behind homeopathy is “like cures like.” In other words, something that brings on symptoms in a healthy person can -- in a very small dose -- treat an illness with similar symptoms. This is meant to trigger the body’s natural defenses.\n\n【4】For example, red onion makes your eyes water. That’s why it’s used in homeopathic remedies for allergies. Treatments for other ailments are made from poison ivy, white arsenic, crushed whole bees, and an herb called arnica.\n\n【5】Homeopathic doctors (who also are called “homeopaths”) weaken these ingredients by adding water or alcohol. Then they shake the mixture as part of a process called “potentization.” They believe this step transfers the healing essence. Homeopaths also believe that the lower the dose, the more powerful the medicine. In fact, many of these remedies no longer contain any molecules of the original substance. They come in a variety of forms, like sugar pellets, liquid drops, creams, gels, and tablets.\n\n【6】During your appointment, a homeopath will ask a number of questions about your mental, emotional, and physical health. They’ll prescribe the remedy that best matches all of your symptoms. Then they’ll tailor the treatment for you.\n\n【7】You can also buy over-the-counter homeopathic remedies at drugstores and health food stores. The dosage and quality of these products depend on the manufacturer.\n\n【8】What Conditions Does Homeopathy Treat?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【9】It’s used for a wide variety of health issues, including some chronic illnesses:\n\n【10】*   Allergies\n*   Migraines\n*   Depression\n*   Chronic fatigue syndrome\n*   Rheumatoid arthritis\n*   Irritable bowel syndrome\n*   Premenstrual syndrome\n\n【11】It can also be used for minor issues like bruises, scrapes, toothaches, headaches, nausea, coughs, and colds.\n\n【12】Don’t use homeopathic medicine for life-threatening illnesses, like asthma, cancer, and heart disease, or in emergencies. You should also avoid using it in place of vaccines. Some homeopathic products called “nosodes” are marketed as an alternative for vaccines, but there’s no research to prove they’re effective.\n\n【13】Does It Work?\n-------------\n\n【14】Research is mixed. Some studies show that homeopathic remedies are helpful, while others don’t. Critics chalk up the benefits to the placebo effect. That’s when symptoms improve because you believe the treatment is working -- not because it really is. This can trigger the brain to release chemicals that briefly relieve the pain or other symptoms.\n\n【15】Doctors are divided because some of the theories behind homeopathy don’t line up with the principles of chemistry and physics. Scientists argue that a medicine with no active ingredient shouldn’t have an effect on the body.\n\n【16】What Are the Risks?\n-------------------\n\n【17】The FDA oversees homeopathic remedies. But it doesn’t check to see if they’re safe or effective. In general, most are so watered down that they don’t cause any side effects. But there are exceptions. Homeopathic medicines can contain a large amount of an active ingredient, like a heavy metal, that can be dangerous.\n\n【18】Case in point: In 2016, the FDA issued a warning against using homeopathic teething tablets and gels because of possible health risks to infants and children.\n\n【19】If you’re thinking about trying these alternative treatments, talk to your doctor. They can make sure they’re safe and won’t interact with any other medications you’re taking.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "4c227097-2cf8-49dc-ab45-fbfe42993eab", "title": "Colorectal Cancer", "text": "【0】What Is Colorectal Cancer?\n--------------------------\n\n【1】Colorectal cancer, sometimes called colon cancer, starts when cells that line your colon or rectum grow out of control. It’s the third leading cause of cancer deaths among American men and women.\n\n【2】In the U.S., about 72% of colorectal cancer cases start in the colon and 28% in the rectum.\n\n【3】The colon is also called the large intestine, which is part of your digestive system. It absorbs water and nutrients from food after it moves through your stomach and small intestine. Solid waste (poop or stool) is stored in your colon before moving to the rectum. This 8-inch tube holds the waste until it leaves your body through the anus.\n\n【4】Most colorectal cancers are \"silent\" tumors. They grow slowly, and you may not notice any symptoms until they’re large. But you can take some steps to prevent colorectal cancer, and you can cure it if you find it early. It’s important to have regular screening exams to spot cancer or precancerous areas, especially if you have a high risk of getting it.\n\n【5】Types of Colorectal Cancer\n--------------------------\n\n【6】There are several types of colorectal cancer, based on where it starts.\n\n【7】*   **Adenocarcinoma****.** This is the most common kind, making up 96% of cases. It starts in cells that make mucus for your colon and rectum.\n*   **Carcinoid tumor.** This begins in cells that make hormones.\n*   **Gastrointestinal stromal tumor.** This forms in cells in the wall of your colon that tell your gastrointestinal muscles to move food or liquid along.\n*   **Lymphoma****.** This is cancer of your immune system cells.\n*   **Sarcoma****.** This starts in connective tissues like blood vessels or muscle layers.\n\n【8】Colorectal Cancer Causes\n------------------------\n\n【9】Nearly all colon and rectal cancers begin as a polyp, a growth on the inner surface of your colon. Polyps themselves usually aren’t cancer.\n\n【10】The most common types of polyps in your colon and rectum include:\n\n【11】*   **Hyperplastic and inflammatory polyps.** These usually don’t carry a chance of cancer. But large hyperplastic polyps, especially on the right side of your colon, can be a problem. Your doctor will want to remove them.\n*   **Adenomas or adenomatous polyps.** These are precancerous. If you leave them alone, they could turn into colon cancer.\n\n【12】Colorectal cancer may also start in an area of abnormal cells, called dysplasia, in the lining of your colon or rectum.\n\n【13】Colorectal Cancer Risk Factors\n------------------------------\n\n【14】Anyone can get colorectal cancer. It’s most common among African Americans and people over age 50.\n\n【15】The lifetime chance of developing colorectal cancer is 1 in 22 for men and 1 in 24 for women.\n\n【16】Things that can raise your chances of getting it include:\n\n【17】*   A personal or family history of colorectal cancer or polyps\n*   A diet with a lot of red and processed meats\n*   Inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis\n*   Conditions passed down through your family, such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC)\n*   Obesity\n*   Smoking\n*   Lack of activity\n*   Heavy alcohol use\n*   Type 2 diabetes\n*   Breast cancer\n*   Ovarian or uterine cancer diagnosed before age 50\n\n【18】Polyps might be more likely to contain cancer or carry a higher chance of cancer if:\n\n【19】*   They’re larger than 1 centimeter\n*   You have more than two\n*   They show signs of dysplasia\n\n【20】Colorectal Cancer Symptoms\n--------------------------\n\n【21】You might not notice any signs of colorectal cancer. When you have them, they can include:\n\n【22】*   A change in your bowel habits that doesn’t go away, such as constipation or diarrhea\n*   A feeling that your bowel hasn’t emptied all the way after you poop\n*   Bleeding from your rectum\n*   Blood on or in your poop\n*   Poop that’s narrower or thinner than usual\n*   Belly discomfort\n*   Stomach cramps\n*   Weight loss with no clear cause\n*   An unusually low number of red blood cells (anemia)\n*   Weakness or fatigue\n*   A lump in your belly or rectum\n\n【23】Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis\n---------------------------\n\n【24】Your doctor may give you a physical exam and feel your belly for any swollen organs or masses. They might also order one or more of these tests to spot polyps or colorectal cancer:\n\n【25】*   **Rectal exam.** Your doctor can use their fingers to feel for growths.\n*   **Colonoscopy.** This is the standard screening test that experts recommend. Your doctor uses a thin, flexible tube called a colonoscope to look at your entire colon and rectum.\n*   **Sigmoidoscopy****.** Your doctor looks at your rectum and the last part of your colon.\n*   **Biopsy****.** Your doctor may take out a bit of tissue during a colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy and send it to a lab for testing. They can also use a needle to take a sample, with a CT scan or ultrasound to guide them. Complications are rare, but you may have some bleeding or discomfort.\n*   **Stool DNA**. This test looks for certain gene changes that might be a sign of colon cancer.\n*   **CT colonography.** This is a special X-ray (also called a virtual colonoscopy) of your entire colon. It takes less time and is less invasive than other tests. But if it shows a polyp, you’ll still need a colonoscopy.\n*   **Barium enema X-ray.** This is a type of X-ray that involves putting dye in your colon. It can find trouble spots that might mean you need a colonoscopy.\n*   **Other imaging tests.** MRI or ultrasound can give your doctor a better look at your organs.\n\n【26】Tumors may bleed in amounts so small that only special tests can find it. This is called occult bleeding, meaning you probably can’t see it with the naked eye. These tests can look for blood in your poop:\n\n【27】*   **Fecal immunochemical test (FIT).** This reacts to part of human hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells. You can do the test at home and mail a sample of poop to a lab.\n*   **Guaiac-based fecal occult blood tests (gFOBT)**. This uses a chemical to look for blood. You can do it at home and mail in a card with a sample of poop on it.\n\n【28】If either of these tests finds blood, your doctor will probably recommend a colonoscopy.\n\n【29】Colorectal Polyps\n-----------------\n\n【30】If a test finds a polyp, your doctor will take it out and send it to a laboratory. A specialist will look at it under a microscope. Your doctor will discuss the results with you. They will recommend next steps, including when to have another colonoscopy.\n\n【31】Colorectal Cancer Stages\n------------------------\n\n【32】If you have colorectal cancer, tests can tell your doctor whether it has grown or spread. This process is called staging. The stages of colorectal cancer are:\n\n【33】*   **Stage 0.** The cancer hasn’t gone past the inner layer of your colon or rectum. This is also called cancer in situ.\n*   **Stage I.** The cancer has grown into the muscles of your colon or rectum.\n*   **Stage IIA.** It’s spread through the colon or rectum wall.\n*   **Stage IIB.** It’s grown into the lining of your abdomen (peritoneum).\n*   **Stage IIC.** The cancer has spread through your colon or rectum wall and into nearby tissues.\n*   **Stage IIIA.** It’s spread to three or fewer lymph nodes or to tissues around your colon or rectum.\n*   **Stage IIIB.** It’s grown through the wall of your bowel or into nearby organs. It’s also spread to three or fewer lymph nodes or to tissues around your colon or rectum.\n*   **Stage IIIC.** The cancer has spread to four or more lymph nodes.\n*   **Stage IVA.** Cancer has spread to one part of your body that’s farther away, like your liver or lungs.\n*   **Stage IVB.** It’s spread to more than one part of your body.\n*   **Stage IVC.** Cancer has grown in the lining of your abdomen and possibly to lymph nodes or organs that are farther away.\n\n【34】Colorectal Cancer Treatment\n---------------------------\n\n【35】Treatment will depend on several things. You and your doctor should consider:\n\n【36】*   The stage of the disease\n*   How well certain treatments will work for you\n*   Your overall health\n*   The risks and side effects\n*   How much the treatment costs\n*   The option you’d prefer\n\n【37】You might have one or more of these treatments:\n\n【38】**Surgery**\n\n【39】Your doctor can take out polyps and small tumors that haven’t spread during a colonoscopy or through a laparoscopy, in which they put special tools and cameras into your belly through small cuts. If the cancer has spread, you might have surgery to remove part of your colon (partial colectomy).\n\n【40】If cancer has spread to your liver and nowhere else, surgery is your best chance for a cure. But it’s not an option for everyone. Your doctor must be able to take out all the cancer. And you need enough healthy tissue left over for your liver to still work. If your tumor is very large, you might have chemotherapy to help shrink it before surgery.\n\n【41】Procedures called ablation and embolization can also treat cancer that has spread to the liver. They can destroy tumors without removing them. Sometimes, doctors use high-energy radio waves or electromagnetic microwaves to kill cancer cells. Or they may inject the tumor with alcohol or freeze it with a metal probe. With embolization, a substance blocks blood flow to the tumor.\n\n【42】**Radiation therapy**\n\n【43】Radiation therapy uses high-energy X-rays, electron beams, or chemical agents called radioactive isotopes to attack cancer. The radiation is aimed directly at the tumor. It damages chromosomes in cancer cells so they can't multiply.\n\n【44】**External radiation therapy** is the most common form for people with colorectal cancer. A machine aims a beam of radiation at your tumor. It's painless.\n\n【45】Before treatment begins, a team of specialists, including a radiation oncologist, will use measurements from scans to find the exact spot to aim the radiation. They'll tattoo small dots on your body to show where to target the beam. This ensures that they get the same location at every treatment.\n\n【46】You'll need to be still during the procedure, but it lasts only a few minutes. You may have five treatments a week for several weeks, and sometimes, you'll be treated a few times a day for several weeks.\n\n【47】There are many kinds of external beam radiation. These include 2D, 3D conformal, IMRT, IGRT, and proton beam therapy.\n\n【48】Radiation can also be **internal.** Interstitial radiation therapy (also known as brachytherapy) uses a tube to place small pellets, or seeds, of radioactive material directly into your tumor. After 15 minutes, they're taken out. You may have up to two treatments a week for 2 weeks.\n\n【49】**Endocavitary radiation therapy** is often used for rectal cancer**.** A device called a proctoscope is placed in your anus to carry radiation directly to the tumor. It stays there a few minutes and then is taken out. You'll probably have four treatments, each about 2 weeks apart.\n\n【50】Side effects tend to be specific to the area of your body that gets the radiation. Talk to your doctor about what you can expect.\n\n【51】You may have:\n\n【52】*   Blood in your stool\n*   Lack of energy\n*   Leaky bowels\n*   Pain and burning on your skin where beams were aimed\n*   Pain during bowel movements\n*   Pain when you pee\n*   Problems having sex\n\n【53】Most side effects should get better a few weeks after treatment ends, but some may not go away. Medications and other treatments may help.\n\n【54】**Radiofrequency ablation**\n\n【55】This kills cancer cells using a probe with electrodes.\n\n【56】**Chemotherapy**\n\n【57】Chemo drugs destroy cancer cells or stop them from spreading. You can take the medicines in pill form or through an IV. You can also get them in a blood vessel close to your tumor. There are many types of these drugs. Some work better together, so you may take two or more at the same time. You usually get the treatment for 2 or 4 weeks and then take a break.\n\n【58】You might have chemo after surgery to kill any cancer cells left behind. Or you could have it before an operation to make a tumor smaller and easier to remove. Chemo may help treat cancer pain too. And it's often the best way to slow the spread of the disease.\n\n【59】The downside is that the drugs can attack healthy cells as well as cancerous ones. This can cause side effects like hair loss, vomiting, and mouth sores. You may also feel very tired and get sick easily. But these problems usually get better when your treatment is over.\n\n【60】**Immunotherapy**\n\n【61】Immunotherapy, a type of biological therapy, uses your body's immune system to fight cancer. It includes:\n\n【62】*   **Biological response modifiers**. These trigger the immune system to indirectly affect tumors. Biological response modifiers include cytokines (chemicals produced by cells to instruct other cells) such as interferons and interleukins. This strategy involves giving larger amounts of these substances by injection or infusion in the hope of stimulating the cells of the immune system to act more effectively.\n*   **Colony-stimulating factors.** These things signal your body to make bone marrow cells (the soft, sponge-like material inside bones), which include both red and white blood cells and platelets. White blood cells fight infection; red blood cells carry oxygen to and carbon dioxide from organs and tissues; platelets are cell fragments that help the blood clot. Often, other cancer treatments cause decreases in these cells. Thus, colony-stimulating factors don’t directly affect tumors, but they can help support your immune system during cancer treatment.\n*   **Monoclonal antibodies**. These lab-made things find and bind to cancer cells wherever they are in the body. They can be used to see where the tumor is in the body (detection of cancer) and call in other immune system cells to destroy them, or as therapy to deliver drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to a tumor. Monoclonal antibodies for colorectal cancer include bevacizumab (Avastin), cetuximab (Erbitux), panitumumab (Vectibix), and ramucirumab (Cyramza).\n*   **Immune checkpoint inhibitors**. These are drugs that take the “brakes” off of checkpoint proteins in the immune system, which helps these proteins recognize and attack cancer cells. They include ipilimumab (Yervoy), pembrolizumab, (Keytruda), and nivolumab (Opdivo).\n*   **Tumor vaccines**. Researchers are developing vaccines that may encourage the immune system to better recognize cancer cells. In theory, they would work in a similar way as vaccines for measles, mumps, and other infections. The difference in cancer treatment is that vaccines are used _after_ someone has cancer, rather than to prevent the disease. There are also ongoing studies involving possible vaccines to prevent breast and prostate cancers.\n\n【63】Like other forms of cancer treatment, immunotherapy may have a number of side effects. They can vary widely from person to person. Biologic response modifiers may cause flu-like symptoms, including fever, chills, nausea, and loss of appetite. In addition, rashes or swelling may develop at the injection site, and blood pressure may fall. Fatigue is another common side effect.\n\n【64】Colony-stimulating factors might cause bone pain, fatigue, fever, and loss of appetite.\n\n【65】The side effects of monoclonal antibodies vary. They may include serious allergic reactions. Rashes are common and may be a severe side effect of Erbitux or Vectibix. They usually mean that these drugs are working.\n\n【66】Bleeding, blood clotting, or bowel perforation may be side effects of Avastin or Cyramza.\n\n【67】Vaccines can cause muscle aches and low-grade fever.\n\n【68】Immune checkpoint inhibitors can have serious side effects. One concern is that they can allow the immune system to attack normal organs in the body. More common side effects include fatigue, cough, loss of appetite, and rash.\n\n【69】**Targeted therapy**\n\n【70】This uses drugs that focus on specific things in cancer cells, like genes or proteins, to kill them or keep them from growing.\n\n【71】Some come in pill form. You get others in your vein (IV) at a hospital, doctor’s office, or clinic. Most are given along with standard chemo medicines.\n\n【72】Medications used as targeted therapies for colorectal cancer include:\n\n【73】*   Aflibercept (Zaltrap)\n*   Bevacizumab (Avastin)\n*   Cetuximab (Erbitux)\n*   Panitumumab (Vectibix)\n*   Ramucirumab (Cyramza)\n\n【74】Targeted therapies can cause serious side effects. Some of the most common are:\n\n【75】*   Diarrhea\n*   Blood clots\n*   Bleeding in the GI tract\n*   Allergic reactions\n*   Liver diseases like hepatitis and skin rash or peeling\n\n【76】**Palliative (supportive) care**\n\n【77】This doesn’t try to cure cancer. Its goal is to help you feel better. It also provides support for your family and caregivers. And it can help you make decisions about the kind of care you want in the months and years ahead.\n\n【78】Ask your doctor about palliative care as soon as you find out that you have cancer. Your care team can prescribe meds to ease pain and side effects. Palliative care can also ease depression and may help you live longer.\n\n【79】Colorectal Cancer Follow-Up Care\n--------------------------------\n\n【80】After you’ve finished your treatments for colorectal cancer, follow-up care is very important. Regular checkups can help find any changes in your health, and if the cancer comes back (or “recurs”), it can be treated as soon as possible.\n\n【81】**Ongoing care**\n\n【82】You may need to see many different doctors during the months and years after you finish treatment. Your oncologist will usually start out as your main contact. They’ll give you a schedule for screenings and tests.\n\n【83】They may ask your primary care doctor to take over your care at some point. Be sure you have a summary of your cancer treatment that includes:\n\n【84】*   Your follow-up plan from your oncologist\n*   Names and doses of all your chemotherapy drugs or other medicines\n*   The dates and specifics of your diagnosis (including cancer stage and other details)\n*   Any side effects or complications of treatment\n*   Types and dates of all surgeries and locations where they were done\n*   Dates and amounts of radiation and where it was done\n*   Contact info for all of your doctors\n\n【85】Bring this summary with you for all your appointments, since you may not always see the same doctor.\n\n【86】Ask your doctor any questions you may have about your day-to-day life, such as whether it would help to make changes in your diet or exercise habits.\n\n【87】Tell them about any supplements you take, even “natural” products or vitamins and minerals. That way, your doctor can check on anything that might have side effects or interact with your medicines.\n\n【88】If you feel down or anxious, tell your doctor that, too. They may be able to recommend a counselor or a support group.\n\n【89】**Follow-up tests**\n\n【90】What types of screenings you have and how often you get them will depend on the type and stage of cancer you had and the treatments you got. You'll probably need check-ups three to four times a year during the first 2 or 3 years after treatment and one or two times a year after that. These might include:\n\n【91】*   A physical exam\n*   Colonoscopy, usually 6 months to 1 year after surgery. Your doctor can tell you how often you'll need one.\n*   CT scans of your chest, abdomen, and possibly pelvis every 6 to 12 months for the first 3 years\n*   CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) blood test every 3 to 6 months for 5 years. High levels of CEA protein in the blood may mean cancer cells have spread.\n\n【92】**When to call your doctor**\n\n【93】Call your doctor right away if you have:\n\n【94】*   Belly pain, weight loss, or blood in your stool\n*   Fatigue that gets in the way of your daily life\n*   Problems with your bowel movements, bladder, or sexual function\n*   Mental changes like trouble concentrating, anxiety, depression, or memory loss\n*   Trouble sleeping\n*   Changes in your family medical history, like relatives who've recently been diagnosed with cancer\n\n【95】Colorectal Cancer Prevention\n----------------------------\n\n【96】A healthy tobacco-free lifestyle is the first step in preventing cancer of any kind.\n\n【97】Experts recommend that as an initial step toward the prevention of colorectal cancer, people should exercise and eat healthily. The American Cancer Society says adults should get 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of high-intensity exercise (or a combination of these) each week.\n\n【98】The National Cancer Institute recommends a low-fat, high-fiber diet that includes at least 2 1/2 cups of fruits and vegetables each day. Cut back on red meat and other high-fat foods, such as eggs and many dairy products. You can get the protein you need from low-fat dairy products (also a good source of calcium), nuts, beans, lentils, and soybean products. Avoid overcooking or barbecuing meats and fish.\n\n【99】Some experts suggest that aspirin may stop colorectal cancer cells from multiplying. In addition, other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, such as Aleve and Motrin) may reduce the size of polyps and, therefore, the risk of colon cancer. This theory has not been well established, and the proper dosage is unclear. Also, NSAIDs may raise your odds of serious complications, such as stomach bleeding, heart attacks, and strokes. If you’re at high risk of colon cancer, don’t start taking aspirin or other NSAIDs until you discuss it with your doctor.\n\n【100】Women who have gone through menopause and who take hormone replacement therapy that includes both estrogen and progesterone may be less likely to get colon cancer. But if they do, it may be more advanced when it’s found. Hormone replacement therapy also raises the risk of other cancers. Talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits.\n\n【101】Screening for colorectal cancer is crucial. The American Cancer Society and the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends that people get regular screening exams from ages 45 to 75 if they have an average chance of getting colorectal cancer. This means that you don’t have symptoms and that neither you nor a close family member has had colorectal polyps, cancer, or inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n【102】The guidelines include at least one of these tests:\n\n【103】*   Tests for blood in your poop once a year\n*   Stool DNA tests every 3 years\n*   Flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years\n*   CT colonography (virtual colonoscopy) every 5 years\n*   Colonoscopy every 10 years\n\n【104】Talk to your doctor if you have one or more of the colorectal cancer risk factors. You might need to start screenings at a younger age, get tested more often, or have specific kinds of tests.\n\n【105】If you’re 76 through 85, talk to your doctor about whether you should be tested. The American Cancer Society doesn’t recommend testing for people older than 85.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

Avoid re-applying lindane for a few months after use.\n\n【10】... Show More\n\n【11】Uses\n----\n\n【12】This medication is used to treat head and crab (pubic) lice . Lice are tiny insects that lay eggs (nits) on hair shafts. Lice can easily spread to those in close contact with you. Lindane works by killing the lice and nits. An infection with lice is also called an infestation. This drug should not be used to prevent lice infestation or re-infestation.\n\n【13】### How to use Lindane Shampoo\n\n【14】Read the Medication Guide provided by your pharmacist before you start using lindane. If you have any questions, consult your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【15】This drug can be poisonous if used incorrectly. Do not take this drug by mouth , and avoid contact with your eyes , nose, or mouth . If lindane gets in these areas, rinse with water immediately and get medical help right away if a burning feeling remains. Do not use if there is skin irritation (such as open wounds, rash , cuts, or sores) on the area to be treated unless directed to do so by your doctor. Do not apply any oil-based hair products (such as oil treatments or oil-based hair dressings/conditioners) immediately before or after using lindane. If you are currently using any of these products, they must be washed off before you apply lindane. Oil-based products may increase the absorption of lindane, increasing the risk of side effects.\n\n【16】Wash your hair with your regular shampoo (without conditioner) and dry it well. Wait at least 1 hour after drying your hair before using lindane shampoo.\n\n【17】Most adults require only 1 ounce (30 milliliters), but those with longer and thicker hair should use no more than 2 ounces (60 milliliters).\n\n【18】Shake the bottle well before use. For application, use gloves made of nitrile, latex with neoprene, or sheer vinyl to avoid unnecessary contact with your skin . Do not use natural latex gloves because more lindane can penetrate that type of glove. Apply a small amount of lindane to lightly coat your hair and scalp as directed by your doctor. Work thoroughly (do not lather) through dry hair . Do not add water. Make sure to include the fine hairs along your neck and behind your ears. Leave lindane in your hair for exactly 4 minutes (use a timer or clock). Do not cover your hair with anything (such as a shower cap or towel). After 4 minutes, add a small amount of warm (not hot) water, rub until a lather forms, then immediately rinse away all lather. Try to keep lindane from touching other parts of your body. Do not re-apply. Dry your hair with a towel, then use the special nit comb or tweezers to remove the nits. It is best to have someone else do this for you to make sure all the nits are removed. They should wear gloves while removing the nits.\n\n【19】Close the bottle with any remaining lindane and throw it away out of reach from children and pets. Wash your hands well after treatment.\n\n【20】If an infant or young child is prescribed lindane, watch the child carefully while the lindane shampoo is in the hair to make sure the child does not touch the hair then put the hands in the mouth .\n\n【21】If you are putting lindane shampoo on someone else, use gloves as directed above. Wash your hands well afterwards.\n\n【22】The easiest way to tell if you have lice is to look for small gray-white nits fixed to the hair shafts. Symptoms of lice include an intense itching , mostly on the scalp, but also possibly on the eyebrows, eyelashes, beard, or groin. Itching may continue even after treatment with lindane shampoo. Even if the lindane kills all the lice, the dead lice can still make you itch for a long time after treatment. Ask your doctor about other medications that may be used to soothe the itching.\n\n【23】Tell your doctor if your condition lasts or gets worse 1-2 weeks after treatment.\n\n【24】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【25】See also Warning section.\n\n【26】Stinging, burning, or redness of the skin may occur. If any of these effects last or get worse, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly.\n\n【27】Remember that this medication has been prescribed because your doctor has judged that the benefit to you is greater than the risk of side effects. Many people using this medication do not have serious side effects.\n\n【28】Tell your doctor right away if you have any serious side effects, including: vomiting , dizziness , drowsiness, seizures .\n\n【29】A very serious allergic reaction to this drug is rare. However, get medical help right away if you notice any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction , including: rash , itching /swelling (especially of the face/ tongue /throat), severe dizziness, trouble breathing .\n\n【30】This is not a complete list of possible side effects. If you notice other effects not listed above, contact your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【31】In the US - Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or at www.fda.gov/medwatch.\n\n【32】In Canada - Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects.

{"seq_id": "08ecbc3f-4e32-479a-806d-397e3e80acf9", "title": "Complications Coronavirus Can Cause", "text": "【0】Complications Coronavirus Can Cause\nIf you have COVID-19, your symptoms may be relatively mild and manageable at home. That’s true for most people. But if you’re older or have another illness such as diabetes or heart disease, you’re more at risk for the serious form of COVID-19.\n\n【1】Some people -- about 1 in 6 -- will have complications, including some that are life-threatening. Many of these complications may be caused by a condition known as cytokine release syndrome or a cytokine storm. This is when an infection triggers your immune system to flood your bloodstream with inflammatory proteins called cytokines. They can kill tissue and damage your organs, including your lungs, heart, and kidneys.\n\n【2】COVID-19 complications may include the following.\n\n【3】Acute Respiratory Failure\n-------------------------\n\n【4】When you have acute respiratory failure, your lungs might not pump enough oxygen into your blood or might not take enough carbon dioxide out. Both of these problems can happen at the same time.\n\n【5】Acute respiratory failure has been the leading cause of death for those who have died of COVID-19.\n\n【6】Pneumonia\n---------\n\n【7】Some who catch the new coronavirus get severe pneumonia in both lungs. COVID-19 pneumonia is a serious illness that can be deadly. When you have pneumonia, the air sacs in your lungs become inflamed, making it harder to breathe.\n\n【8】Images of very ill COVID-19 patients’ lungs show them filled with fluid, pus, and cell debris. In those cases, patients’ bodies weren’t able to transfer oxygen to the blood to keep their systems working properly.\n\n【9】Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)\n------------------------------------------\n\n【10】 Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was one of the most common complications of COVID-19.\n\n【11】With ARDS, the lungs are so severely damaged that fluid begins to leak into them. As a result, the body has trouble getting oxygen into the bloodstream. You may need mechanical help to breathe -- such as a ventilator -- until your lungs recover.\n\n【12】Acute Liver Injury\n------------------\n\n【13】Most seriously ill patients run the greatest risk of liver damage. It's unclear whether the virus harms the liver or if it happens for another reason,  but besides the lungs, the liver usually suffers the biggest injuries from COVID-19.\n\n【14】Acute liver injury and liver failure are life-threatening complications. (“Acute” means it happens suddenly.)\n\n【15】Acute Cardiac Injury\n--------------------\n\n【16】Many hospitalized with COVID-19 have developed heart problems, including arrhythmias and high levels of other cardiac ailments. But it’s not clear whether the virus itself affected patients’ hearts, or if the damage happened simply because the illness caused such stress on their bodies overall.\n\n【17】COVID-19 also may cause cardiac problems that last long after people have recovered from the coronavirus infection. \n\n【18】Secondary Infection\n-------------------\n\n【19】A secondary infection means that you get an infection unrelated to the first problem you had. In this case, it means someone with COVID-19 gets infected with something else.\n\n【20】Sometimes, a person fighting off, ­or recovering from, a virus gets infected by bacteria. Strep and staph are common culprits. This can be serious enough to raise the risk of death.\n\n【21】Acute Kidney Injury\n-------------------\n\n【22】This is not a common complication, but if it happens, it’s serious. If your kidneys stop working properly, doctors will start treatment to stop the damage. You might get dialysis (in which a machine filters your blood) until your kidneys get back to working normally. But sometimes, the damage doesn’t heal and people get chronic kidney disease, which would need to be managed long-term.\n\n【23】Septic Shock\n------------\n\n【24】Sepsis happens when your body’s reaction to an infection misfires. The chemicals released into your bloodstream to battle the illness don’t trigger the right response, and instead your organs are damaged. If the process isn’t stopped, you can go into what’s called septic shock. If your blood pressure drops too much, septic shock can be fatal.\n\n【25】Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation\n--------------------------------------\n\n【26】When you have disseminated intravascular coagulation, or DIC, the body’s blood-clotting response doesn’t work right. Abnormal clots form, which can lead to internal bleeding or organ failure.\n\n【27】DIC is not uncommon among those who have died or COVID.\n\n【28】Blood Clots\n-----------\n\n【29】A condition called disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) causes your body’s blood-clotting response to work differently than it should. Unusual clots form, which can lead to internal bleeding or organ failure and death.\n\n【30】Those hospitalized with COVID have been found to be more likely to develop clots than those hospitalized with the flu. Some were in patients’ legs (deep vein thrombosis or DVT), lungs (pulmonary embolism or PE), or arteries. But none of the patients had DIC.\n\n【31】COVID-19-associated coagulopathy (CAC) is a life-threatening condition caused by the virus. It’s marked by different protein levels in your blood than the ones caused by DIC.\n\n【32】Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【33】A number of children and teens have been hospitalized with a condition called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) or pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome (PMIS) It is linked to the new coronavirus. Symptoms include fever, belly pain, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, headache, and confusion. They’re similar to those of toxic shock syndrome or Kawasaki disease, which causes inflamed blood vessels in children.\n\n【34】Chronic Fatigue\n---------------\n\n【35】Some people who’ve had COVID-19 develop a condition similar to chronic fatigue syndrome. They may have a brain fog, severe fatigue, pain, trouble thinking, or dizziness.\n\n【36】Rhabdomyolysis\n--------------\n\n【37】This is an extremely rare condition, but it’s one COVID-19 researchers are watching. In rhabdomyolysis, your muscles break down and tissue dies. As cells fall apart, a protein called myoglobin floods your bloodstream. If your kidneys can’t flush it out of your blood quickly enough, it can overwhelm them and cause death.\n\n【38】NEWSLETTER\n\n【39】Stay Up-to-Date on COVID-19\n\n【40】Sign up for the latest coronavirus news.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

{"seq_id": "7cd6a351-b445-47f5-bb42-b1da74783f7a", "title": "What Is Primary Biliary Cholangitis?", "text": "【0】What Is Primary Biliary Cholangitis?\nPrimary biliary cholangitis is a disease that damages the bile ducts in your liver. Your doctor may also call it PBC. It used to be called primary biliary cirrhosis.\n\n【1】These ducts have an important job. They carry a fluid called bile, which plays a key role in digestion, away from your liver. Bile is what helps your body absorb fats, cholesterol, and even some vitamins. It also helps get rid of worn-out red blood cells and other things your body doesn't need.\n\n【2】When bile ducts don’t work the way they should, those substances stay in your liver. The bile backs up, and your liver gets inflamed and maybe even scarred. Over time, the scar tissue replaces healthy liver tissue, and the organ doesn’t work the way it should.\n\n【3】This is usually a slow and gradual process. Your liver does OK for a while. And you’ll take medications to help it work better and manage your symptoms. But the disease can worsen over a few months or many years. One day, you may need a liver transplant.\n\n【4】What Causes It?\n---------------\n\n【5】Doctors aren't totally sure. It isn’t passed down from parents to children, but there does seem to be a family link. It’s more common if you have a parent, brother, or sister who has it. Most people who get it are women, and most are in their 40s and 50s.\n\n【6】The disease may be linked to immune system problems like thyroid trouble, pernicious anemia, or scleroderma. Things from outside your body -- smoking, chemicals, or infections -- can also trigger the disease.\n\n【7】What Are the Symptoms?\n----------------------\n\n【8】Early on, you might not notice any at all. You can live for many years without problems. Later, you might feel tired or have itchy skin or dry eyes and mouth.\n\n【9】As the disease gets worse, you might notice:\n\n【10】*   Yellow skin and eyes (jaundice)\n*   Swollen feet and ankles\n*   Pain and swelling in your abdomen\n*   Bone, muscle, or joint pain\n*   Darkened skin\n\n【11】How Is It Diagnosed?\n--------------------\n\n【12】If you have any of these symptoms, your doctor might suggest blood tests. They’ll tell them how well your liver works and if you have any immune system issues. They may also want you to have imaging tests like an ultrasound, CT scan, MRI, or endoscopy (ERCP). These provide a more detailed look at your liver and the area around it. They may also suggest a liver biopsy. They’ll remove a small piece of liver tissue and examine it in the lab to look for damage or disease.\n\n【13】How Is It Treated?\n------------------\n\n【14】There's no cure, but medications can slow down the disease. The most common drug is ursodiol (ursodeoxycholic acid), which helps move bile through your liver. Another drug, obeticholic acid (Ocaliva), can be used with ursodiol or alone to treat PBC. There are also newer drugs to treat symptoms like itching and fatigue.\n\n【15】Your doctor may suggest you make some changes in your daily life. If you drink alcohol, stop. It puts a strain on your liver. Choose low-sodium foods and exercise regularly to ease your symptoms.\n\n【16】When medications no longer help, a liver transplant may be an option.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}
{"seq_id": "c215d6fb-5e89-4f8c-a031-73f8d017919f", "title": "Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Symptoms and Complications", "text": "【0】Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Symptoms and Complications\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) symptoms are different for each person who has this long-term disease.\n\n【1】Some people have long periods with few or no symptoms. Others feel it for months at a time in an uptick of disease activity called a flare.\n\n【2】Most people have lasting problems with episodes of more severe disease. New and earlier treatment is changing the overall picture, though. More people are having low disease activity or even remission.\n\n【3】RA Symptoms in Your Joints\n--------------------------\n\n【4】RA almost always affects your joints. It may take a few weeks or months for the first signs to show. The inflammation it causes often leads to these three hallmark symptoms:\n\n【5】*   **Pain.**Inflammation inside a joint makes it hurt whether you’re moving it or not. Over time, it causes damage and pain.\n*   **Swelling.** Fluid in the joint makes it puffy and tender.\n*   **Tenderness.** It hurts when you move or push on a joint.\n\n【6】Other RA symptoms include:\n\n【7】*   **Stiffness.** The joint is harder to use and doesn't move as well as it should. It’s especially common in the morning. Although many people with other forms of arthritis have stiff joints in the morning, it takes people with rheumatoid arthritis more than an hour (sometimes several hours) before their joints feel loose.\n*   **Redness and warmth.** The joints may be warmer and have color changes related to the inflammation.\n\n【8】What Joints Does RA Affect?\n---------------------------\n\n【9】RA usually starts in your hands. The most common affected areas on your body are:\n\n【10】*   Elbows\n*   Wrists\n*   The knuckle where each finger meets your hand (metacarpophalangeal, or MCP, joint)\n*   The first joint in your fingers (proximal interphalangeal, PIP, joint)\n*   Ankle\n\n【11】But RA can appear anywhere on your body, including:\n\n【12】*   Toes\n*   Hips\n*   Jaw\n*   Knees\n*   Neck\n*   Shoulders\n*   Finger joint closest to the thumbnail\n\n【13】Your symptoms usually are symmetrical, meaning that they show up in the same joints on both sides of your body.\n\n【14】It doesn’t happen often, but RA can also affect joints in your voice box called the cricoarytenoid joints. It can make your voice hoarse. Rarely, you may lose your voice.\n\n【15】Whole-Body Symptoms\n-------------------\n\n【16】Rheumatoid arthritis symptoms can also go beyond your joints. You could feel:\n\n【17】*   Fatigue\n*   Muscle aches\n*   Poor appetite\n*   Bad all over (your doctor may call this malaise)\n*   Depression\n\n【18】Extreme fatigue could be a sign of anemia, a lack of healthy red blood cells. Your doctor will test for this as part of your RA diagnosis.\n\n【19】Depression could also cause some of these symptoms. A long-term disease like RA can be challenging to live with. Talk to your doctor if you feel sad or down.\n\n【20】Symptoms That Affect Your Skin\n------------------------------\n\n【21】Some people with RA get rheumatoid nodules. These are bumps under the skin. Most of the time, they aren’t painful, and they move easily when you touch them. About one in four people with RA get these skin bumps.\n\n【22】They usually happen on your elbows, but they might show up on other bony areas like:\n\n【23】*   The underside of your forearm\n*   The back of your head\n*   The base of your spine\n*   Your Achilles tendon\n*   Tendons in your hand\n\n【24】What RA Does to Your Heart and Lungs\n------------------------------------\n\n【25】RA can affect more than just your joints. Complications can involve your organs, blood vessels, and bones.\n\n【26】RA can damage your lungs or inflame the lining around them. This causes chest pain that worsens with breathing, called pleurisy. Lung problems are the most common symptoms of RA outside the joints. This may not cause symptoms, or you might notice shortness of breath. Your doctor can treat it with drugs that ease the inflammation in your lungs.\n\n【27】Severe inflammation from RA in your lungs can make the tissue stiff, thickened, and scarred. This is pulmonary fibrosis, a hard-to-treat condition that makes it tough to breathe.\n\n【28】Likewise, RA can inflame the lining around your heart (called pericarditis) or your heart muscle (called myocarditis). You probably wouldn’t notice symptoms from that. There’s a chance you could feel shortness of breath or sharp, stabbing chest pain. If you do, call your doctor. It can also raise your odds of heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke.\n\n【29】When RA gets into the cartilage that connects your ribs to your sternum, it can feel like you’re having a heart attack. This is known as chest wall pain.\n\n【30】RA and Your Eyes\n----------------\n\n【31】The most common vision\\-related complications include:\n\n【32】*   **Cataracts****,** a clouding of the lens in your eye that affects your vision\n*   **Dry eye****syndrome.** Whether it’s because of medications or damage to your tear glands, your eyes can’t make a healthy tear film.\n*   **Scleritis****,** inflammation and redness in the white part of your eye\n\n【33】Other Body Parts RA Can Affect\n------------------------------\n\n【34】*   **Bones.** The chemicals that cause inflammation can also take a bite out of your bones. It often affects your hips and spine. Sometimes, it’s a byproduct of years of treating RA with steroids.\n*   **Liver** **and** **kidneys****.** It’s rare for RA to affect these organs. But the drugs that treat it can. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be bad for both. Cyclosporine may cause kidney disease. Methotrexate can damage your liver.\n*   **Immune system****.** The medications you take can slow it down. This makes you more likely to get infections.\n*   **Mucous membranes.** You might be more likely to get a condition called Sjogren’s syndrome that dries out moist places in your body like your eyes, your mouth, and inside your nose.\n*   **Muscles.** When inflammation stops you from moving your joints, the attached muscles can get weak. Or you could get a condition called myositis that weakens them. The medications you take for RA can also be to blame.\n*   **Nerves.** RA causes symptoms that range from numbness and tingling to paralysis. It can result from joint damage that RA causes, the disease process itself, or medications that treat it.\n*   **Blood vessels.** RA can cause inflammation of your blood vessels. It can show up as spots on the skin or can cause ulcers in more severe cases.\n\n【35】Track Your Symptoms\n-------------------\n\n【36】RA affects everyone differently. Some people have mild RA. Others have severe cases with joint damage.\n\n【37】Many people with RA have symptoms on most days. Some days may be better than others.\n\n【38】It’s rare, but some people have symptoms only from time to time. They may have months between these flares.\n\n【39】Keeping track of your symptoms may help you better see how your disease is changing or not. You can use pen and paper or apps to record such things as when you have symptoms and for how long, how intense they are, and what things make them worse or better. Remember to take your symptom diary every time you visit your doctor or rheumatologist.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

The body needs some cholesterol in order to work. But too much cholesterol can increase your risk of developing heart disease. Many things contribute to high cholesterol, some of which you can control and others you can't.\n\n【1】Uncontrollable High Cholesterol Risk Factors\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【2】*   Gender: After menopause, a woman's LDL cholesterol level (\"bad\" cholesterol) goes up, as does their risk for heart disease.\n*   Age: Your risk may increase as you get older. Men 45 or older and women 55 or older have a higher risk of high cholesterol and heart disease.\n*   Family history: Your risk of high cholesterol may increase if a father or brother had high cholesterol or early heart disease (before age 55) or a mother or sister had early heart disease (before age 65). You can also inherit a genetic condition called familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), which causes high LDL levels starting at a young age. It’s rare, but left untreated, it can worsen over time. Talk to your doctor about whether to get a test for FH. \n\n【3】Controllable Risk Factors for High Cholesterol Include:\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】*   Diet: The trans fats, saturated fat, sugar, and (to a lesser extent) cholesterol in the food you eat raise total and LDL cholesterol levels.\n*   Weight: Being overweight can make your LDL cholesterol level go up and your HDL level go down. High blood pressure can be a sign that your weight is going up.\n*   Physical activity/exercise: Increased physical activity helps to lower LDL cholesterol and raise HDL cholesterol (the \"good\" cholesterol) levels. It also helps you lose weight.\n*   Smoking: Smoking damages your blood vessels, which makes them more likely to collect fatty deposits. It also lowers HDL, or “good” cholesterol levels. You can ask your doctor or look online for ways to help you quit. The CDC smoking website is a good place to start.  \n*   Type 2 diabetes: Studies show type 2 diabetes can lower “good” cholesterol (HDL) levels and raise triglycerides, another type of cholesterol.  Poor diet and lack of physical exercise are two of the prime drivers of the disease.\n*   High blood pressure: While high blood pressure does not cause high cholesterol, it often shows up in people who have it. That’s because they can share many of the same risk factors like a lack of exercise, unhealthy diet, aging, and obesity. And both conditions are risk factors for heart disease, which causes the most deaths from high cholesterol.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

It usually begins in your late teens or early 20s. More women have it than men. There's no known cause, but it's believed to be a combination of the way your brain is built and the things you experience in life.\n\n【1】For example, you may be prone to have it based on genes passed down through your family. But then, something might happen that can trigger it, such as being abused or neglected.\n\n【2】When you have BPD, you have a hard time controlling your emotions. This can cause you to:\n\n【3】*   Take unnecessary risks\n*   Have intense mood swings\n*   Have bouts of anger, depression, or anxiety\n\n【4】You may find it difficult to:\n\n【5】*   Manage daily tasks at home\n*   Perform at work\n*   Maintain relationships\n\n【6】This can lead to things like divorce, separation from family and friends, and serious financial issues.\n\n【7】BPD isn't an isolated issue. If you have it, you are more likely to have other mental health challenges. You may experience anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and thoughts of suicide.

{"seq_id": "1ba7c5d2-50dc-4a82-a8bb-cd51eea58705", "title": "Coronavirus Testing", "text": "【0】If you don't feel well, you may wonder if you have COVID-19. Tests can tell whether you have it now. Antibody testing can show if you had it already.\n\n【1】Who Should Get Tested?\n----------------------\n\n【2】The CDC has offered the following recommendations for who should consider being tested:\n\n【3】*   People who have symptoms of COVID-19\n*   People who've had close contact with someone who is known or suspected to have COVID (test at least 5 days after the contact)\n*   All people traveling internationally must follow their destination's testing requirements before travel.\n\n【4】If you know or suspect you have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, you should get tested.\n\n【5】Types of Coronavirus Testing\n----------------------------\n\n【6】The CDC recommends a COVID-19 test called a nasopharyngeal swab for coronavirus. A special 6-inch cotton swab is inserted up each of your nostrils and moved around for about 15 seconds. It won’t hurt, but it might be uncomfortable. The material from inside your nose will show whether you are negative or positive.\n\n【7】Home self-testing is available and you can get your results in 15 minutes or less. Depending on the reason behind your testing, you may need official lab results which are done by a medical professional. The results are analyzed by a laboratory. \n\n【8】COVID-19 tests include swabs of:\n\n【9】*   Your mouth and throat (oropharyngeal)\n*   The middle of your nostrils (nasal mid-turbinate)\n*   The front of your nostrils (anterior nares)\n\n【10】If you have a cough with mucus, called a “wet” or “productive” cough, your doctor might want to test some of what you can cough up.\n\n【11】Testing can take place in medical clinics, hospitals, or private laboratories. Each state has several public health labs that do testing. For information about testing in your state, online at the CDC.\n\n【12】 “Serology” tests look for antibodies. Your body makes them when you've had an infection. These COVID-19 tests spot two types of antibodies:\n\n【13】*   IgM, which your body makes for about 2 weeks before the levels drop\n*   IgG, which your body makes more slowly (within about 4 weeks) but which usually last longer\n\n【14】A swab or spit test can tell only if you have the virus in your body at that moment. But a blood test shows whether you've ever been infected with the virus, even if you didn't have symptoms. This is important in researchers' efforts to learn how widespread COVID-19 is.\n\n【15】**Drive-through coronavirus testing**\n\n【16】Some hospitals and agencies continue to have centers where you can get a COVID-19 test without getting out of your car. You may need to register online or by phone, or you might need a doctor's order first. Be sure to check before you go.\n\n【17】Testing for COVID-19, Flu, and RSV\n----------------------------------\n\n【18】The FDA has approved several at-home tests. They include rapid tests where you get your results at home within minutes as well as home collection kits which are then sent to a lab for analysis.\n\n【19】You'll collect your own sample through an at-home nasal swab. Then, you'll send the sample to Labcorp, where they'll do tests. Your results will be available through an online portal. A health care provider will also reach out if you have a positive or invalid test.\n\n【20】You can buy the at-home test online or in stores with no prescription. The collection process is slightly different based on your age:\n\n【21】*   Those 18 years and older can collect their own sample.\n*   People 14-17 years old must have adult supervision when they're getting a sample.\n*   Children 2 years and older must have an adult help them collect a sample.\n\n【22】How to Get Tested\n-----------------\n\n【23】The FDA has approved several other at-home tests. They include home collection kits which are then sent to a lab for analysis, as well as rapid tests where you get your results at home within minutes. \n\n【24】If you have a health care plan, you can get an at-home FDA-authorized COVID-19 test from some pharmacies or stores for free. If your pharmacy or store isn't set up for the free tests, you may have to pay upfront. Make sure you keep your receipt. Your insurance will reimburse you up to $12 per test.\n\n【25】If you don't have insurance, you can still get a free test. The government has set up a website to send tests if you request them. You can use this website whether or not you have insurance. You can also get free at-home tests from some community health centers or health clinics. Check the CDC's website.\n\n【26】Some of the available rapid tests include:\n\n【27】*   BinaxNOW. The antigen test can be purchased online or at drugstores. You receive results within 15 minutes.\n*   Ellume. This antigen costs about $30. It also uses an app to guide you through the process using a nasal swab, and results are known within 15 minutes.\n*   QuickVue. Also an over-the-counter antigen test, you get two tests between $18 and $30. After you swab, you put the swab in a solution and wait 10 minutes. You then put a paper strip in the solution. It changes color to indicate positive or negative.\n*   Cue. This is a molecular COVID-19 test and should be available without a prescription.\n*   Lucira Health's “All-In-One.” Costing between $64-$75, it requires a prescription. You collect a sample through a nasal swab that you put in a vial of solution. You then put the vial into a portable, battery-operated device. Within 30 minutes, a light on the device indicates negative or positive. \n\n【28】At-home saliva tests are available where you spit into a vial and mail it to a lab.\n\n【29】Free, in-person COVID-19 testing is available in most communities. Some locations require an appointment while others are drive-up. Antibody testing usually requires an appointment.\n\n【30】Most locations are listed online, but you can also call your doctor, your local hospital, the health department, or an urgent care center about testing locations near you. If you think it's an emergency, call 911. Whoever you call, you'll need to tell them about your symptoms over the phone or during an online visit. They may ask you some of these questions:\n\n【31】*   Do you have a fever or cough?\n*   Do you have shortness of breath?\n*   Have you been in close contact (within 6 feet) with someone who has COVID-19?\n*   Has someone with COVID-19 coughed or sneezed on you?\n*   Have you traveled recently?\n*   Did a health official tell you that you've come in contact with COVID-19?\n\n【32】In April 2022, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for a new type of COVID-19 test called the InspectIR COVID-19 Breathalyzer. It looks for signs of the virus in breath samples. A trained expert can give you this test in less than 3 minutes.\n\n【33】The test uses something called “gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). With this, it can find chemical mixtures and identify compounds that are related to the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\n【34】In studies, experts found that the breathalyzer for COVID-19 accurately found 91.2 percent of all positive cases and correctly picked up on 99.3 percent on all negative cases.\n\n【35】You can't get a COVID-19 breath test at home. They're only available in doctor's offices, hospitals, and mobile testing sites.\n\n【36】How Long Do Test Results Take?\n------------------------------\n\n【37】Rapid test results take about 15 minutes. It may take a lab about 24 hours to run your test. But you might not get your results for several days based on possible backlogs in the lab. Future tests might be faster.\n\n【38】What Happens After I Get Tested?\n--------------------------------\n\n【39】A positive COVID-19 test means you currently have or recently had the virus. Monitor your symptoms and get medical help right away if you have trouble breathing, confusion, or bluish lips or face.\n\n【40】Take steps to avoid spreading the virus:\n\n【41】*   Stay home, except to get medical care.\n*   Stay away from other people in your home.\n*   Wear a mask when you are around others in the house\n*   Don't share dishes, cups, eating utensils, or linens with others.\n*   Cover your coughs and sneezes. Wash your hands often.\n*   Clean and disinfect common surfaces like phones, doorknobs, or counters regularly.\n\n【42】If your test is positive and you have COVID-19 symptoms, you should isolate yourself until you meet all these criteria:\n\n【43】*   It's been at least 5 days since your symptoms began.\n*   Your symptoms have improved.\n*   You haven't had a fever for at least 24 hours, without using any fever-reducing medication.\n*   Keep wearing a mask around others for another 5 days.\n\n【44】If you tested positive but didn't have symptoms, isolate yourself for 5 days. If you still have no symptoms, you can leave your house, but keep wearing your mask around others for 5 more days.\n\n【45】There usually is no need to be retested if you have been in isolation for 10 to 14 days if your symptoms were mild. If you had a moderate or severe case of COVID-19, you'll need to isolate for longer.\n\n【46】If your COVID-19 test is negative, you probably didn't have the virus at the time of the test. But you can still get sick later. Follow distancing guidelines, and wash your hands often.\n\n【47】There's a very small chance that your COVID-19 test results could be wrong. This is called a false positive or false negative. Your doctor or health care professional will help you decide what to do based on your symptoms and health history.\n\n【48】When Is It an Emergency?\n------------------------\n\n【49】If you can't get tested, you may still need medical help. Call your doctor if you don't feel well or have a high fever or a cough. Call 911 if you have:\n\n【50】*   Trouble breathing\n*   Pain or pressure in your chest\n*   Confusion\n*   Trouble staying alert\n*   A blue tint to your lips or face", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}

It is used by certain overweight people, such as those who are obese or have weight \\-related medical problems. Taking orlistat can also help keep you from gaining back weight you have lost. Losing weight and keeping it off can lessen the many health risks that come with obesity , including heart disease , diabetes , high blood pressure , and a shorter life.Dietary fats need to be broken down into smaller pieces before the body can absorb them. Orlistat works by blocking the enzyme that breaks down fats in your diet. This undigested fat then passes out of your body in your bowel movement . Orlistat does not block the absorption of calories from sugar and other non-fat foods, so you still need to restrict your total intake of calories.\n\n【2】### How to use Xenical\n\n【3】If you are taking the over-the-counter product to self-treat, read all directions on the product package before taking this medication .\n\n【4】If your doctor has prescribed this medication, read the Patient Information Leaflet if available from your pharmacist before you start taking orlistat and each time you get a refill. Take this medication as directed by your doctor, by mouth with liquid sometime during each meal that contains fat or within 1 hour after the meal, usually 3 times daily. If you miss a meal or your meal contains no fat, skip that dose of the medication. To decrease the chance of unpleasant side effects, it is very important that no more than 30% of the calories in your diet come from fat. Your daily intake of fat, protein, and carbohydrates should be evenly spread over 3 main meals.\n\n【5】Do not increase your dose or use this drug more often or for longer than prescribed. Your condition will not improve any faster, and your risk of side effects will increase.\n\n【6】Because this drug can interfere with the absorption of certain vitamins (fat-soluble vitamins including A, D, E, K), a daily multivitamin supplement containing these nutrients is recommended. Take the multivitamin at least 2 hours before or 2 hours after taking orlistat (such as at bedtime ).\n\n【7】If you take cyclosporine , take it at least 3 hours before or after orlistat to make sure the full dose of cyclosporine is absorbed into your bloodstream. If you take levothyroxine , take it at least 4 hours before or after orlistat.\n\n【8】You should see some weight loss within 2 weeks after you start orlistat. Tell your doctor if your condition does not improve or if it worsens.\n\n【9】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【10】Changes in your bowel function often occur because of the unabsorbed fat . Fatty/oily stool, oily spotting, intestinal gas with discharge, a feeling of needing to have a bowel movement right away, increased number of bowel movements , or poor bowel control may occur. These side effects may get worse if you eat more fat than you should. If these effects last or get worse, notify your doctor promptly.\n\n【11】If your doctor has directed you to use this medication , remember that your doctor has judged that the benefit to you is greater than the risk of side effects. Many people using this medication do not have serious side effects.\n\n【12】Stop taking this medication and tell your doctor right away if you have any serious side effects, including: symptoms of liver disease (such as nausea / vomiting that doesn't stop, severe stomach / abdominal pain , dark urine , yellowing eyes / skin ), symptoms of kidney stones (such as back pain, pain when urinating, pink/bloody urine).\n\n【13】A very serious allergic reaction to this drug is rare.
