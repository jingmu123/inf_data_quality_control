Polio is a virus that affects mainly young children. It is usually spread by person-to-person contact. It can also be spread by eating/drinking contaminated food or water. Most people who get infected with polio have mild or no symptoms. However, some infections can be very serious and can cause inability to move ( paralysis ) in part of the body, such as the arms, legs, or breathing muscles. There is no cure for polio infection, but it can be prevented by vaccination. This vaccine works by increasing the body's natural defense ( immunity ) against the polio virus.Polio vaccine is usually given to infants and children as part of routine immunization . It may also be given to adults who haven't been immunized or who may be at increased risk for polio infection, for example by travel to countries where polio is common. Vaccines may not fully protect everyone who receives them.\n\n【2】### How to use IPOL Vial\n\n【3】Read all vaccine information available from your health care professional before receiving the vaccine .

They make it hard for your child’s body to remove waste products as they digest proteins. They are inherited diseases -- you pass them down to your child.\n\n【1】In most cases, you can manage them with diet and medications.\n\n【2】When your baby eats protein, their body breaks it down into amino acids and uses what they need. What they don’t need is further broken down into waste products that their body removes.\n\n【3】This happens in a process called the urea cycle. Your baby’s liver makes things called enzymes that turn waste nitrogen into urea. The urea leaves their body in their urine.\n\n【4】If your child has a urea cycle disorder, their liver can’t make one of the enzymes the cycle needs. When their body can’t remove nitrogen, ammonia forms and collects in their blood. It’s toxic and can cause brain damage or put them in a coma. It can even be fatal if you don’t treat it quickly.\n\n【5】Who Gets Them?\n--------------\n\n【6】UCDs affect about 1 in 35,000 newborns.\n\n【7】There are eight types. They’re named after what’s missing from the urea cycle. You’ll also hear doctors call them by their initials:\n\n【8】*   ARG1 deficiency -- Arginase\n*   ASL deficiency -- Argininosuccinate lyase\n*   ASS1 deficiency -- Argininosuccinate synthase 1\n*   Citrin deficiency -- Citrin\n*   CPSI deficiency -- Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I\n*   NAGS deficiency -- N-acetylglutamate synthase\n*   ORNT1 deficiency -- Ornithine translocase\n*   OTC deficiency -- Ornithine transcarbamylase\n\n【9】Parents pass these diseases down to their children through defective genes. We all inherit two copies of our genes, one from each parent. With most UCDs, you must get a defective gene from both parents to get the disease. The genes tell your child’s body how to break down protein.\n\n【10】One UCD, called ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency, is what doctors call a sex-linked disorder. Mothers carry the gene on their X chromosome, and they mostly pass it to their sons.\n\n【11】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【12】UCDs fall into two groups:\n\n【13】**Complete UCD:** This means your baby has a severe or total lack of the enzyme. You’ll notice symptoms in the first couple of days:\n\n【14】*   Fussy\n*   Sleepy or sluggish\n*   Can’t feed\n*   Vomits\n*   Low body temperature\n*   Problems with posture\n*   Seizures\n*   Fast breathing that becomes slow\n*   Coma\n\n【15】**Partial UCD:** Your baby can make some of the enzyme, but not as much as they need. You may not spot symptoms for months or even years.\n\n【16】A buildup of ammonia (you may hear the doctor call it hyperammonemia) can happen from illness, injury, stress, or quick weight loss.\n\n【17】Symptoms are usually less severe than in babies with complete UCD. They include:\n\n【18】*   Avoiding foods high in protein or a dislike of meat\n*   Loss of appetite\n*   Nausea or vomiting\n*   Behavior problems, including hyperactivity\n*   Mental problems (confusion, delusions, hallucinations, psychosis)\n\n【19】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【20】Most newborns in the U.S. are tested for ASS1 and ASL, but how well the tests work is different in each state. Many states test for arginase and citrin deficiencies. A handful also test for OTC and CPS1 deficiencies.\n\n【21】If your baby starts to show symptoms after you get home, the doctor will do a physical exam. They’ll ask about your family history and do tests. They’ll look for ammonia in your child’s blood and amino acid in their blood and urine. The doctor can take a tiny piece of their liver through a process called biopsy. They’ll test it for enzymes. Genetic tests will usually confirm the diagnosis.\n\n【22】Treatment\n---------\n\n【23】UCDs are life-threatening. Don’t wait to get treatment.\n\n【24】A team of health professionals will care for your child. They will first do these three treatments at the same time:\n\n【25】*   Dialysis to remove ammonia from their blood\n*   Feeding them supplements of sugars, fats, and amino acids\n*   Medicines to remove extra nitrogen\n\n【26】Long-term treatment can manage UCD symptoms. Your child will need frequent blood tests throughout their life to check ammonia levels. Stresses on their body -- like illness, injury, or surgery -- can cause their levels to rise. During those times, you’ll need to give them extra calories so their body has plenty of fuel.\n\n【27】Long-term treatment will include:\n\n【28】*   A low protein, high-calorie diet\n*   Medications to remove nitrogen\n*   Supplements of amino acids\n*   Drinking plenty of water\n\n【29】A liver transplant can reverse the symptoms of a urea cycle disorder.\n\n【30】Outlook\n-------\n\n【31】There’s no cure for UCDs. Your child’s long-term health depends on which UCD they have, how severe it is, how early it was diagnosed, and how closely you follow the treatment plan.\n\n【32】If your child doesn’t follow the special diet or they have frequent stress\\-induced symptoms, repeated brain swelling can lead to irreversible brain damage. If they’re diagnosed early and follow their diet, they can live a normal life.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:38:19", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:38:48", "cost": 29.157}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:08", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:38:48", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:38:19"}

Nearly 6 million Americans live with it. But there are simple steps you can take to lower your odds of getting it. \n\n【1】What Is Heart Failure?\n----------------------\n\n【2】You get heart failure when your heart can't pump enough blood and oxygen to your muscles and organs. Doctors haven't found a cure, but many people with heart failure live active lives.\n\n【3】Heart failure usually doesn't sneak up on people. It develops over time and for a number of reasons. It's important to know if you're more likely to get it so you can take the steps to prevent it.\n\n【4】What Causes Heart Failure?\n--------------------------\n\n【5】Certain problems can make your heart work harder than it should and weaken the muscle. Some of these are:\n\n【6】*   High blood pressure\n*   Diabetes\n*   Coronary artery disease\n*   Past heart attack\n*   Being too overweight\n\n【7】Things like drinking too much alcohol, smoking, and using illegal drugs are all known to damage your heart.\n\n【8】Some things that raise your chances of heart failure are out of your control, including:\n\n【9】*   Race (African American people are more likely to have heart failure)\n*   Heart defects you're born with\n*   Age (your odds go up if you're 65 or older)\n\n【10】Can I Prevent Heart Failure?\n----------------------------\n\n【11】Heart failure means your heart can't pump enough oxygenated blood to your organs.\n\n【12】You can lower your odds of getting heart failure. And the earlier you start, the better your chances. You can begin with a few of these simple steps:\n\n【13】**Stay active.** Check with your doctor before starting an exercise routine. Try for at least 2 1/2 hours a week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise -- the kind that gets your heart pumping. And try not to sit for more than 2 hours a day. That can raise your heart failure risk.\n\n【14】**Keep moving.** Even if you do exercise, especially if you're a man, your risk for heart failure may go up if you sit a lot. In one study, men who sat for 5 hours or more a day outside of work, even those who exercised, were more likely to get heart failure than those who limited their couch potato time to 2 hours or less. So look for ways to keep yourself moving the next time you're about to reach for the TV remote.\n\n【15】**Don't use illegal drugs.** Even occasional use of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamines, and ecstasy can harm your heart. It can make your heart rate and blood pressure go up. It may also lead to hardening of your arteries. All these problems raise your risk of heart failure.\n\n【16】**Treat heart and other conditions.** Other heart problems, like heart attacks, raise your chances of getting heart failure. So treat your high blood pressure and take any medication your doctor prescribes to lower your cholesterol levels. \n\n【17】**Don't smoke.** If you do, try to quit. Ask your doctor for advice on ways to stop. Smoking damages your arteries, which can start you down the road to heart failure.\n\n【18】**Eat right.** Good nutrition is important if you want to prevent heart failure. Limit saturated fats, trans fats, extra sugar, and salt in your diet. Instead, go for fruits and veggies, low-fat dairy products, and lean protein. Also choose \"good fats\" in olive oil, walnuts, avocados, and fish like salmon or tuna. \n\n【19】**Limit alcohol.** If you're a man, stick to no more than two drinks a day (a 5-ounce glass of wine equals 1 drink). Women should only have one drink a day. And if you already have heart failure, alcohol can make it worse.\n\n【20】**Lose weight if you need to.** Aim for a body mass index (BMI) between 18.5 and 24.9. And pay particular attention to belly fat, which can increase your risk of heart disease even more than fat on other parts of your body. Even a small weight loss can add up to big gains in your health.\n\n【21】**Manage stress.** It can raise your blood pressure. Try to keep yourself on an even keel with meditation, counseling, or yoga. \n\n【22】**Get a good night's sleep.** A long-term sleep problem like sleep apnea can raise your chance of heart failure. If you have it, get treatment. And take steps to get better sleep, like going to bed and getting up at the same time every night, and keeping electronics out of the bedroom.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:23:40", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:23:57", "cost": 16.648}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:08", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:23:57", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:23:40"}

That means they don't work together to look at an object. One may look in or out, or turn up or down. It can happen all the time or only when you’re stressed out or sick.\n\n【1】What Causes It?\n---------------\n\n【2】Some children are born with it. Your child’s doctor will call this congenital strabismus. Many times, there’s no clear cause. There may be a problem with the part of their nervous system that controls eye muscles. Or they could have a tumor or eye disorder.\n\n【3】If it doesn’t appear until later in life, it will cause double vision. If an adult’s eyes cross without warning, they could have a serious condition like a stroke. If either one happens, see a doctor immediately.\n\n【4】Young children can suppress vision in a weaker eye, which lets them avoid double vision. However, that may lead to \"lazy eye,\" a condition your doctor will refer to as amblyopia. Depth perception and peripheral vision (vision off to the side) may be affected. It can cause eyestrain and headaches. If your eyes cross when you’re older, you may start to turn your head to see in certain directions and avoid double vision.\n\n【5】How Is It Treated?\n------------------\n\n【6】Start treatment as soon as you can. If you don’t, the condition could continue into adulthood. Most adults with crossed eyes were born that way.\n\n【7】Talk to a pediatric optometrist or ophthalmologist, an eye doctor who specializes in working with kids. They may start treatment with eyeglasses or a patch to force your child to use the off-kilter eye until they see normally.\n\n【8】Sometimes, farsightedness is to blame. Glasses may solve the problem. The main goal is to get the problem eye working like it should before your child turns 8 years old. After that, permanent vision loss can set in.\n\n【9】Is Surgery an Option?\n---------------------\n\n【10】Yes. It affects the muscles that move your child’s eye. It works best when done during childhood, but adults can have it, too\n\n【11】The ophthalmologist, or eye surgeon, opens the eyeball’s outer layer to reach a muscle. To strengthen the muscle, the surgeon removes a small section from one end and reattaches at the same location. This makes the muscle shorter, which turns the eye toward that side.\n\n【12】To weaken a muscle, the doctor moves it back or makes a partial cut across it.

It causes your airways to get inflamed and narrow, and it makes it hard to breathe. Severe asthma can cause trouble talking or being active. You might hear your doctor call it a chronic respiratory disease. Some people refer to asthma as \"bronchial asthma.\"\n\n【2】Asthma is a serious disease that affects about 25 million Americans and causes nearly 1.6 million emergency room visits every year. With treatment, you can live well. Without it, you might have to go to the ER often or stay at the hospital, which can affect your daily life.\n\n【3】What Does Asthma Feel Like?\n---------------------------\n\n【4】Asthma is marked by inflammation of the bronchial tubes, with extra sticky secretions inside the tubes. People with asthma have symptoms when the airways tighten, inflame, or fill with mucus.\n\n【5】There are three major signs of asthma:\n\n【6】*   **Airway blockage.** When you breathe as usual, the bands of muscle around your airways are relaxed, and air moves freely. But when you have asthma, the muscles tighten. It’s harder for air to pass through.\n*   **Inflammation**. Asthma causes red, swollen bronchial tubes in your lungs. This inflammation can damage your lungs. Treating this is key to managing asthma in the long run.\n*   **Airway irritability.** People with asthma have sensitive airways that tend to overreact and narrow when they come into contact with even slight triggers.\n\n【7】These problems may cause symptoms such as:\n\n【8】*   Coughing, especially at night or in the morning\n*   Wheezing, a whistling sound when you breathe\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Tightness, pain, or pressure in your chest\n*   Trouble sleeping because of breathing problems\n\n【9】Not every person with asthma has the same symptoms in the same way. You may not have all of these symptoms, or you may have different symptoms at different times. Your symptoms may also vary from one asthma attack to the next, being mild during one and severe during another.\n\n【10】Some people with asthma may go for long periods without having any symptoms. Others might have problems every day. In addition, some people may have asthma only during exercise or with viral infections like colds.\n\n【11】Mild asthma attacks are generally more common. Usually, the airways open up within a few minutes to a few hours. Severe attacks are less common but last longer and require medical help right away. It is important to recognize and treat even mild asthma symptoms to help you prevent severe episodes and keep asthma under better control.\n\n【12】**When to see your doctor**\n\n【13】Get medical help right away if you have serious symptoms including:\n\n【14】*   Fast breathing\n*   Pale or blue face, lips, or fingernails\n*   The skin around your ribs pulls inward when you breathe in\n*   Trouble breathing, walking, or talking\n*   Symptoms that don’t get better after you take medication\n\n【15】What Is an Asthma Attack?\n-------------------------\n\n【16】An asthma attack is the episode in which bands of muscle around the airways are triggered to tighten. This tightening is called bronchospasm. During the attack, the lining of the airways becomes swollen or inflamed, and the cells lining the airways make more and thicker mucus than normal.\n\n【17】All of these things -- bronchospasm, inflammation, and mucus production -- cause symptoms such as trouble breathing, wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, and trouble with normal daily activities.\n\n【18】Other symptoms of an asthma attack include:\n\n【19】*   Severe wheezing when breathing both in and out\n*   Coughing that won't stop\n*   Very rapid breathing\n*   Chest pain or pressure\n*   Tightened neck and chest muscles, called retractions\n*   Difficulty talking\n*   Feelings of anxiety or panic\n*   Pale, sweaty face\n*   Blue lips or fingernails\n\n【20】An asthma attack can get worse quickly, so it's important to treat these symptoms right away.\n\n【21】Without immediate treatment, such as with your asthma inhaler or bronchodilator, it will become harder to breathe. If you use a peak flow meter at this time, the reading will probably be less than 50% of your usual or normal peak flow reading. Many asthma action plans suggest interventions starting at 80% of normal.\n\n【22】As your lungs continue to tighten, you won’t be able to use the peak flow meter at all. Your lungs will tighten so there is not enough air movement to wheeze. You need to go to a hospital right away. Unfortunately, some people think that the disappearance of wheezing is a sign of improvement and don’t get emergency care.\n\n【23】Without proper treatment, over time, you may be unable to speak and will get a bluish coloring around your lips. This color change, known as cyanosis, means you have less and less oxygen in your blood. It can cause a loss of consciousness and death.\n\n【24】If you have an asthma attack, follow the \"Red Zone\" or emergency instructions in your asthma action plan right away. These symptoms happen in life-threatening asthma attacks. You need medical attention right away.\n\n【25】How Is Asthma Classified?\n-------------------------\n\n【26】Doctors rank how bad asthma is by its symptoms:\n\n【27】1.  **Mild intermittent asthma.** Mild symptoms less than twice a week. Nighttime symptoms less than twice a month. Few asthma attacks.\n2.  **Mild persistent asthma.** Symptoms three to six times a week. Nighttime symptoms three to four times a month. Asthma attacks might affect activities.\n3.  **Moderate persistent asthma.** Daily asthma symptoms. Nighttime attacks five or more times a month. Symptoms may affect activities.\n4.  **Severe persistent asthma.** Ongoing symptoms both day and night. You have to limit your activities.\n\n【28】Your asthma may be getting worse if:\n\n【29】*   You have symptoms more often and they interfere more with your daily life.\n*   You have a hard time breathing. You can measure this with a device called a peak flow meter.\n*   You need to use a quick-relief inhaler more often.\n\n【30】Types of Asthma\n---------------\n\n【31】There are several:\n\n【32】*   **Adult-onset asthma.** Asthma can start at any age, but it's more common in people younger than 40.\n*   **Status asthmaticus**. These long-lasting asthma attacks don’t go away when you use bronchodilators. They’re a medical emergency that needs treatment right away.\n*   **Asthma in children****.** Symptoms can vary from episode to episode in the same child. Watch for problems like:\n    *   Coughing often, especially during play, at night, or while laughing. This may be the only symptom.\n    *   Less energy or pausing to catch their breath while they play\n    *   Fast or shallow breathing\n    *   Saying their chest hurts or feels tight\n    *   A whistling sound when they breathe in or out\n    *   Seesaw motions in their chest because of trouble breathing\n    *   Shortness of breath\n    *   Tight neck and chest muscles\n    *   Weakness or fatigue\n*   **Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction.** You might hear this called exercise\\-induced asthma. It happens during physical activity, when you breathe in air that’s drier than what’s in your body, and your airways narrow. It can affect people who don’t have asthma, too. You’ll notice symptoms within a few minutes after you start to exercise, and they might last 10 to 15 minutes after you stop.\n*   **Allergic asthma****.** Things that trigger allergies, like dust, pollen and pet dander, can also cause asthma attacks.\n*   **Nonallergic asthma.** This type flares in extreme weather. It could be the heat of summer or the cold of winter. It could also show up when you’re stressed or have a cold.\n*   **Occupational asthma****.** This usually affects people who work around chemical fumes, dust, or other irritating things in the air.\n*   **Eosinophilic asthma.** This severe form is marked by high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils. It usually affects adults between 35 and 50 years old.\n*   **Nocturnal asthma****.** Your asthma symptoms get worse at night.\n*   **Aspirin****\\-induced asthma.** You have asthma symptoms when you take aspirin, along with a runny nose, sneezing, sinus pressure, and a cough.\n*   **Cough-variant asthma.** Unlike with other types, the only symptom of this kind of asthma is a long-term cough.\n\n【33】Asthma Causes and Triggers\n--------------------------\n\n【34】When you have asthma, your airways react to things in the world around you. Doctors call these asthma triggers. They might cause symptoms or make them worse. Common asthma triggers include:\n\n【35】*   Infections like sinusitis, colds, and the flu\n*   Allergens such as pollens, mold, pet dander, and dust mites\n*   Irritants like strong odors from perfumes or cleaning solutions\n*   Air pollution\n*   Tobacco smoke\n*   Exercise\n*   Cold air or changes in the weather, such as temperature or humidity\n*   Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)\n*   Strong emotions such as anxiety, laughter, sadness, or stress\n*   Medications such as aspirin\n*   Food preservatives called sulfites, found in things like shrimp, pickles, beer and wine, dried fruits, and bottled lemon and lime juices\n\n【36】Asthma Risk Factors\n-------------------\n\n【37】Things that might make you more likely to have asthma include:\n\n【38】*   Things in the world around you before you’re born or while you’re growing up\n*   Whether your parents have asthma, especially your mother\n*   Your genes\n*   Your race. Asthma is more common in people of African American or Puerto Rican descent.\n*   Your sex. Boys are more likely to have asthma than girls. In teens and adults, it’s more common in females.\n*   Your job\n*   Other conditions like lung infections, allergies, or obesity\n\n【39】Asthma Diagnosis\n----------------\n\n【40】If you think you have asthma, see your doctor. They may refer you to a lung doctor, called a pulmonologist, or a specialist in allergy and immunology.\n\n【41】The doctor will start with a physical exam and ask about your symptoms and medical history.\n\n【42】You’ll have tests to see how well your lungs work, which may include:\n\n【43】*   **Spirometry****.** This simple breathing test measures how much air you blow out and how fast.\n*   **Peak flow**. These measure how well your lungs push out air. They’re less exact than spirometry, but they can be a good way to test your lungs at home, even before you feel any symptoms. A peak flow meter can help you figure out what makes your asthma worse, whether your treatment is working, and when you need emergency care.\n*   **Methacholine challenge.** This and similar tests involve using triggers or challenges. Adults are more likely to have this test than children. You might get it if your symptoms and spirometry test don’t clearly show asthma. During this test, you inhale a chemical called methacholine before and after spirometry to see if it makes your airways narrow. If your results fall at least 20%, it is possible that you have asthma. Your doctor will give you medicine at the end of the test to reverse the effects of the methacholine.\n*   **Exhaled nitric oxide test.** You breathe into a tube connected to a machine that measures the amount of nitric oxide in your breath. Your body makes this gas normally, but levels could be high if your airways are inflamed.\n\n【44】Other tests you might get include:\n\n【45】*   **Chest X-ray.** It isn’t an asthma test, but your doctor can use it to make sure nothing else is causing your symptoms. An X-ray is an image of the inside of your body, made with low doses of radiation.\n*   **CT.** This test takes a series of X-rays and puts them together to make a view of your insides. A scan of your lungs and sinuses can identify physical problems or diseases (like an infection) that may cause breathing problems or make them worse.\n*   **Allergy tests****.** These can be blood or skin tests. They tell if you’re allergic to pets, dust, mold, and pollen. Once you know your allergy triggers, you can get treatment to prevent them -- and asthma attacks.\n*   **Sputum eosinophils**. This test looks for high levels of white blood cells (eosinophils) in the mix of saliva and mucus (sputum) that comes out when you cough.\n\n【46】Asthma Treatment\n----------------\n\n【47】Many asthma treatments can ease your symptoms. Your doctor will work with you to make an asthma action plan that will outline your treatment and medications. They might include:\n\n【48】*   **Inhaled corticosteroids****.** These medications treat asthma in the long term. That means you’ll take them every day to keep your asthma under control. They prevent and ease swelling inside your airways, and they may help your body make less mucus. You’ll use a device called an inhaler to get the medicine into your lungs. Common inhaled corticosteroids include:\n    *   Beclomethasone (QVAR)\n    *   Budesonide (Pulmicort)\n    *   Fluticasone (Arnuity Ellipta, Armonair Respiclick, Flovent)\n*   **Leukotriene modifiers.** Another long-term asthma treatment, these medications block leukotrienes, things in your body that trigger an asthma attack. You take them as a pill once a day. Common leukotriene modifiers include:\n    *   Montelukast (Singulair)\n    *   Zafirlukast (Accolate)\n*   **Long-acting beta-agonists.** These medications relax the muscle bands that surround your airways. You might hear them called bronchodilators. You’ll take these medications with an inhaler, even when you have no symptoms. They include:\n    *   Formoterol (Perforomist)\n    *   Salmeterol (Serevent)\n*   **Combination inhaler.** This device gives you an inhaled corticosteroid, a long-acting beta-agonist, and sometimes another type of bronchodilator together to ease your asthma. Common ones include:\n    *   Budesonide and formoterol (Symbicort)\n    *   Fluticasone and salmeterol (Advair Diskus, AirDuo Respiclick)\n    *   Fluticasone and vilanterol (Breo)\n    *   Fluticasone, umeclidinium, and vilanterol (Trelegy Ellipta)\n    *   Mometasone and formoterol (Dulera)\n*   **Theophylline.** It opens your airways and eases tightness in your chest. You take this long-term medication by mouth, either by itself or with an inhaled corticosteroid.\n*   **Short-acting beta-agonists.** These are known as rescue medicines or rescue inhalers. They loosen the bands of muscle around your airways and ease symptoms. Examples include:\n    *   Albuterol (Accuneb, ProAir FHA, Proventil FHA, Ventolin FHA)\n    *   Levalbuterol (Xopenex HFA)\n*   **Anticholinergics.** These bronchodilators prevent the muscle bands around your airways from tightening. Common ones include:\n    *   Ipratropium (Atrovent FHA)\n    *   Tiotropium bromide (Spiriva)\n\n【49】You can get ipratropium in an inhaler or as a solution for a nebulizer, a device that turns liquid medicine into a mist that you breathe in through a mouthpiece. Tiotropium bromide comes in a dry inhaler, which lets you breathe in the medicine as a dry powder.\n\n【50】*   **Oral and intravenous corticosteroids.** You’ll take these along with a rescue inhaler during an asthma attack. They ease swelling and inflammation in your airways. You’ll take oral steroids for a short time, between 5 days and 2 weeks. Common oral steroids include:\n    *   Methylprednisolone (Medrol)\n    *   Prednisolone (Flo-Pred, Orapred, Pediapred, Prelone)\n    *   Prednisone (Deltasone)\n\n【51】You’re more likely to get steroids injected directly into a vein if you’re in the hospital for a bad asthma attack. This will get the medication into your system more quickly.\n\n【52】*   **Biologics.** If you have severe asthma that doesn’t respond to control medications, you might try a biologic:\n    *   Omalizumab (Xolair) treats asthma caused by allergens. You get it as an injection every 2 to 4 weeks.\n    *   Other biologics stop your immune cells from making things that cause inflammation. These drugs include:\n        *   Benralizumab (Fasenra)\n        *   Mepolizumab (Nucala)\n        *   Reslizumab (Cinqair)\n\n【53】Tezepelumab-ekko (Tezspire) is a first-in-class medicine for add-on maintenance treatment of adults and children 12 and older. Taken as a shot, it targets a molecule that causes inflammation in the airways.\n\n【54】**Home remedies**\n\n【55】Medication will probably be key to getting your asthma under control, but you can do some things at home to help.\n\n【56】*   Avoid asthma triggers.\n*   Exercise regularly.\n*   Stay at a healthy weight.\n*   Take care of conditions that can trigger symptoms, such as GERD.\n*   Do breathing exercises to ease symptoms so you need less medication.\n*   Some people use complementary treatments such as yoga, acupuncture, biofeedback, or supplements like vitamin C and ding chuan tang. Talk to your doctor before trying any of these.\n\n【57】Asthma Complications\n--------------------\n\n【58】When it’s not under control, asthma can cause problems with your daily life, such as:\n\n【59】*   Fatigue\n*   Lack of exercise and weight gain\n*   Hospital or ER visits\n*   Missing work\n*   Time away from school or trouble focusing on schoolwork\n*   Mental health issues such as stress, anxiety, and depression\n\n【60】Asthma can also lead to serious medical conditions including:\n\n【61】*   Pneumonia and other complications from common infections like the flu\n*   Early delivery or the loss of a pregnancy\n*   Permanently narrowed bronchial tubes in your lungs\n*   Lung collapse\n*   Respiratory failure\n\n【62】Asthma Attack Prevention\n------------------------\n\n【63】Your action plan will include different ways to keep your asthma under control and prevent attacks. These might include:\n\n【64】*   Know your triggers, and stay away from them.\n*   Follow your doctor’s instructions on taking your asthma medications. Let them know if you notice that you’re using a quick-relief inhaler more often.\n*   Keep track of your condition and learn the signs that it might be getting worse. A peak flow meter can help.\n*   Know what to do if you think your asthma is getting worse.\n*   Talk to your doctor about vaccines to lower your chances of certain conditions. You might get vaccinations for COVID-19, flu, pneumonia, shingles, or whooping cough (pertussis).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:17:52", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:18:14", "cost": 21.063}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:08", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:18:13", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:17:52"}

Tumors form on your nerve tissues. Mainly, neurofibromatosis disorders affect the growth and development of nerve cell tissue. The disorders are known as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). NF1 is the more common type of neurofibromatosis. Schwannomatosis has recently been identified as a third and more rare type of neurofibromatosis, but doctors don’t know much about it yet.\n\n【2】You may also hear NF1 called Recklinghausen disease, von Recklinghausen disease, von Recklinghausen’s phakomatosis, von Recklinghausen’s neurofibromatosis, neurofibroma (multiple), neurofibromatosis-pheochromocytoma\\-duodenal carcinoid syndrome, or peripheral neurofibromatosis. It causes multiple café au lait spots (patches of tan or light brown skin) and neurofibromas (soft, fleshy growths) on or under your skin. It can also cause enlarged or deformed bones and curvature of the spine (scoliosis). Occasionally, tumors may develop in the brain, on cranial nerves, or on the spinal cord. About 50% to 75% of people with NF1 also have learning disabilities.\n\n【3】Neurofibromatosis, neurofibromas. Neurofibromatosis is a genetic disorder of the nervous system which causes tumors to form on your nerve tissues. It causes multiple patches of tan or light brown skin and soft, fleshy growths known as neurofibromas to grow on or under your skin.\n\n【4】NF2 is also called bilateral acoustic neurofibromatosis, vestibular schwannoma neurofibromatosis, or central neurofibromatosis. It’s much less common than NF1 and is characterized by multiple tumors on the cranial and spinal nerves. Tumors that affect both of the auditory nerves and hearing loss beginning in the teens or early 20s are generally the first symptoms of NF2.\n\n【5】Neurofibromatosis Symptoms\n--------------------------\n\n【6】**Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) symptoms**\n\n【7】The following symptoms appear in people with NF1:\n\n【8】*   Neurofibromatosis. Also called Recklinghausen’s disease, neurofibromatosis is characterized by areas of pigmentation like this café au lait spot on a 16-year-old. NF1 is a genetic disorder of the nervous system causing neurofibromas (tumors) to grow on the fibrous covering of nerves. Spots like this one can appear on the skin and can sometimes be accompanied by physical deformation. Most are benign but they can become malignant and those with NF1 have a predisposition to brain tumors and various forms of cancer. People with this disorder should seek genetic counseling before planning a child. Dermatologists look for more than six cafe au lait macules greater than 5mm in greatest diameter in pre-pubescent kids and greater than 15 mm in postpubertal people to initiate a workup for Neurofibromatosis 1.\n\n【9】    Several (usually 6 or more) café au lait spots\n*   Multiple freckles in the armpit or groin area\n*   Tiny growths in the iris (colored area) of the eye; these are called Lisch nodules and usually do not affect eyesight.\n*   Neurofibromas that occur on or under the skin, sometimes even deep within the body. These are benign (harmless) tumors. But in rare cases, they can turn malignant or cancerous.\n*   Bone deformities, including a twisted spine (scoliosis) or bowed legs\n*   Tumors along the optic nerve, which may cause eyesight problems\n*   Nerve-related pain\n*   High blood pressure\n*   Osteoporosis\n*   Learning disabilities\n*   Large head size\n*   Short stature\n\n【10】**Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) symptoms**\n\n【11】People with NF2 often display the following symptoms:\n\n【12】*   Loss of hearing\n*   Weakness of the muscles of the face\n*   Dizziness\n*   Poor balance\n*   Uncoordinated walking\n*   Cataracts (cloudy areas on the lens of the eye) that develop at an unusually early age\n*   Headaches\n\n【13】**Schwannomatosis symptoms**\n\n【14】People with schwannomatosis may have the following symptoms:\n\n【15】*   Pain from the enlarging tumors\n*   Numbness and tingling of the fingers or toes\n*   Weakness in the fingers and toes\n*   Chronic pain\n*   Loss of muscle\n\n【16】Neurofibromatosis Causes\n------------------------\n\n【17】Neurofibromatosis: Crowe's Sign is freckling in the armpit of those with neurofibromatosis type I (von Recklinghausen's disease). Neurofibromatosis is a genetic disorder of the nervous system which affect the growth and development of nerve cell tissue. These freckles occur in up to 30% of people with the disease and their presence is one of six diagnostic criteria for neurofibromatosis. Freckles can also appear in the groin area, along the jaw and in the nape of the neck.\n\n【18】Neurofibromatosis is often inherited (passed on by family members through your genes). But about 50% of people newly diagnosed with the disorder have no family history of the condition. That’s because it can result from a sudden mutation (change) in your genes. Once this change takes place, you can pass the mutant gene on to future generations. Mutations that lead to neurofibromatosis include:\n\n【19】*   **Neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1):** The NF1 gene on chromosome 17 makes a protein called neurofibromin that controls your cells’ growth. The mutation of this gene causes a neurofibromin loss and uncontrolled cell growth.\n*   **Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2):** The NF2 gene on chromosome 22 makes a protein called merlin or schwannomin. It suppresses tumors. Changes to this gene cause a loss of merlin and uncontrolled cell growth.\n*   **Schwannomatosis:** Mutations of the two known genes linked to schwannomatosis, SMARCB1 and LZTR1, which both suppress tumors, are associated with this type of neurofibromatosis.\n\n【20】Neurofibromatosis Diagnosis\n---------------------------\n\n【21】Neurofibromatosis is diagnosed using a number of tests, including:\n\n【22】*   Physical examination\n*   Medical history\n*   Family history\n*   X-rays\n*   Computerized tomography (CT) scans\n*   Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n*   Biopsy of neurofibromas\n*   Eye tests\n*   Tests for particular symptoms, such as hearing or balance tests\n*   Genetic testing\n\n【23】To receive a diagnosis of NF1, you must have two of the following features:\n\n【24】*   Six or more café au lait spots that are 1.5 centimeters or larger in people who have had puberty, or 0.5 centimeters or larger in people who haven’t\n*   Two or more neurofibromas (tumors that develop from the cells and tissues that cover nerves) of any type, or one or more plexiform neurofibroma (a nerve that has become thick and misshapen due to the abnormal growth of cells and tissues that cover the nerve)\n*   Freckling in the armpit or groin\n*   Optic glioma (tumor of the optic pathway)\n*   Two or more Lisch nodules\n*   A distinctive bony lesion, dysplasia of the sphenoid bone, or dysplasia or thinning of long bone cortex\n*   A first-degree relative with NF1\n\n【25】To be diagnosed with NF2, you must have:\n\n【26】*   Bilateral (on both sides) vestibular schwannomas, also known as acoustic neuromas. These are benign tumors that develop from the balance and hearing nerves supplying the inner ear.\n\n【27】or\n\n【28】*   Family history of NF2 (first-degree family relative) plus unilateral (on one side) or bilateral vestibular schwannomas, or any two of the following health conditions:\n*   Multiple meningiomas (tumors that occur in the meninges, the membranes that cover and protect the brain and spinal cord)\n*   Glioma (cancer of the brain that begins in glial cells, which are those that surround and support nerve cells)\n*   Any neurofibromas\n*   Schwannoma\n*   Juvenile cataracts\n*   Gradual hearing loss\n*   Ringing in the ears\n*   Balance problems\n*   Headaches\n\n【29】Schwannomatosis diagnosis is based on these criteria:\n\n【30】*   If you’re 30 or older, you have no evidence of vestibular tumors on an MRI scan, no known NF2 gene mutation, and two or more schwannomas within or between skin layers, one being confirmed by a biopsy.\n*   You have one schwannoma confirmed by biopsy and a first-degree relative who also meets the criteria.\n*   If you have a type called segmental schwannomatosis, you have tumors limited to one area of the body, such as your arm, leg, or spine.\n\n【31】Neurofibromatosis Treatment\n---------------------------\n\n【32】There’s no cure for neurofibromatosis. Treatments focus on controlling symptoms. There’s no standard treatment for NF, and many symptoms, such as café au lait spots, do not need treatment. When treatment is necessary, options may include:\n\n【33】*   Surgery to remove problem growths or tumors\n*   Treatment that includes chemotherapy or radiation if a tumor has turned malignant, or cancerous\n*   Surgery for bone problems, like scoliosis\n*   Therapy (including physical therapy, counseling, or support groups)\n*   Cataract removal surgery\n*   Aggressive treatment of pain linked to the condition\n*   Stereotactic radiosurgery\n*   Auditory brainstem and cochlear implants\n\n【34】Neurofibromatosis Complications\n-------------------------------\n\n【35】Neurofibromatosis complications may vary from person to person. They typically stem from a growing tumor pressing against your nerve tissue or an internal organ.\n\n【36】Possible NF1 complications include:\n\n【37】*   Neurological problems like trouble learning or thinking\n*   Anxiety or distress with changes to your appearance, like large numbers of cafe au lait spots\n*   Skeletal problems, like bowing of the legs, scoliosis, fractures that don’t heal, or low bone density that increases your risk of osteoporosis\n*   Vision problems due to a tumor pressing against the optic nerve\n*   Problems during times of hormonal changes, such as puberty or pregnancy\n*   Cardiovascular problems like high blood pressure\n*   Breathing problems\n*   Higher risk of some cancers, such as breast cancer, leukemia, colorectal cancer, brain tumors, and some soft tissue cancers\n*   Benign adrenal gland tumor that could cause high blood pressure\n\n【38】Possible NF2 complications include:\n\n【39】*   Partial hearing loss or deafness\n*   Nerve damage in the face\n*   Benign skin tumors or schwannomas\n*   Vision problems\n*   Weakness or numbness in your extremities\n*   Benign brain or spine tumors that need to be removed with surgery\n\n【40】One possible schwannomatosis complication is severe pain that requires specialist medical treatment or even surgery.\n\n【41】Neurofibromatosis Outlook\n-------------------------\n\n【42】Your outlook depends on the type of NF you have. Often, the symptoms of NF1 are mild, and people who have it are able to lead full and productive lives. Sometimes, pain and deformity can lead to significant disability. The NF2 outlook depends on your age at the start of the disease and on the number and location of tumors. Some can be life-threatening.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:48:50", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:50:03", "cost": 73.618}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:08", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:50:03", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:48:49"}

The disease is usually caused by one of several viral infections, so it's sometimes referred to as viral encephalitis.\n\n【4】Most people who have mild encephalitis fully recover. The most appropriate treatment and the patient's chance of recovery depend on the virus involved and the severity of the inflammation.\n\n【5】In acute encephalitis, the infection directly affects the brain cells. In para-infectious encephalitis, the brain and spinal cord become inflamed within one to two weeks of contracting a viral or bacterial infection.\n\n【6】What Causes Encephalitis?\n-------------------------\n\n【7】Viral encephalitis may develop during or after infection with any of several viral illnesses including influenza, herpes simplex, measles, mumps, rubella, rabies, chickenpox, and arbovirus infection including West Nile virus.\n\n【8】Herpes simplex type 1 virus is one of the more common and serious causes of viral encephalitis. Herpes-related encephalitis can erupt rapidly, and may cause seizures or mental changes and even lead to coma or death. It occurs when the herpes simplex type 1 virus travels to the brain rather than moving through the body to the surface of the skin and producing its more common symptom, a cold sore. Early recognition and treatment of herpes encephalitis can be life-saving. You are not more likely to get encephalitis if you have cold sores.\n\n【9】Arbovirus encephalitis is another form of viral encephalitis. It is caused by various viruses that are carried by insects (such as mosquitoes and ticks). Unlike herpes, arboviral infections are seasonal, occurring primarily in summer and early fall, and are clustered in specific regions, such as in the case of St. Louis encephalitis.\n\n【10】In rare instances, bacterial, fungal, parasitic, or rickettsial infections cause encephalitis. Cancer or even exposure to certain drugs or toxins may also cause encephalitis.\n\n【11】What Are the Symptoms of Encephalitis?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【12】The symptoms of encephalitis are usually sudden and severe.\n\n【13】They include:\n\n【14】*   Fever\n*   Drowsiness, lethargy, and possibly coma\n*   Headaches\n*   Personality changes, irritability, or emotional outbursts\n*   Confusion\n*   Weakness in one or more areas of the body\n*   Seizures\n*   Bulging soft spots in infants\n\n【15】Seek medical attention right away if you or someone else has any of these symptoms.\n\n【16】How Is Encephalitis Diagnosed?\n------------------------------\n\n【17】Many clues as to the cause of encephalitis come from an exposure history. Because a person with encephalitis is usually disoriented, family and friends are key to getting a good history. It is important to know if the person may have come into contact with mosquitoes or ticks, infected animals, or sick people.\n\n【18】Your doctor may also order an MRI scan, spinal tap, or electroencephalogram (EEG).\n\n【19】Blood tests to check for bacteria or viruses and the immune cells produced in response to them can also be helpful.\n\n【20】Rarely, an analysis of a brain tissue sample (biopsy) may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis in cases where symptoms are getting worse and treatments aren't working. It can be very important to identify the type of encephalitis in order to give the right treatment.\n\n【21】What Are the Treatments for Encephalitis?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【22】Because complications from encephalitis can be serious, the condition requires hospitalization. Treatment will depend largely on your age and condition, as well as the form and cause of the disease.\n\n【23】If encephalitis is caused by a bacterial infection, it can be treated with intravenous antibiotics. Treatment for herpes\\-related encephalitis includes supportive care, as well as intravenous antiviral therapy with a drug such as acyclovir. Other treatments may be used to lower fever, provide hydration, treat seizures if they develop, and reduce any pressure in the skull.\n\n【24】With proper care, most people recover from encephalitis. Infants and elderly people are at greater risk of permanent brain damage.\n\n【25】How Can I Prevent Encephalitis?\n-------------------------------\n\n【26】The elimination of smallpox and the use of vaccines against mumps, measles, and rubella have lowered cases of encephalitis, especially in children.\n\n【27】Vaccines have been developed for people who travel to high-risk areas as well.\n\n【28】Other ways to prevent it are to avoid viruses that can lead to the disease (like herpes) and to protect yourself against mosquito and tick bites.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 10:55:14", "endTime": "2024/08/21 10:56:05", "cost": 51.349}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:07", "update_time": "2024-08-20 18:56:05", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 18:55:14"}

If your doctor thinks you might have heart failure, they will talk with you about your medical history and do a physical exam and tests.\n\n【2】**Medical history:** To get your medical history, your doctor will want to know if:\n\n【3】*   You have any other health problems such as diabetes, kidney disease, angina (chest pain), high blood pressure, or other heart problems\n*   You smoke\n*   You drink alcohol, and if so, how much\n*   You are taking medications\n\n【4】**Physical exam for heart failure:** Your doctor will look for signs of heart failure as well as other illnesses that may have weakened your heart. They will:\n\n【5】*   Listen to your heart\n*   Take your heart rate\n*   Check your blood pressure\n\n【6】They’ll also look at your appearance while you sit, do mild activity, and lie flat. People with mild or moderate heart failure may appear comfortable at rest, but when active, they often become short of breath. Those with heart failure may be uncomfortable if they lie flat for a few minutes.\n\n【7】Your doctor may check for fluid in your lungs with a stethoscope. People with heart failure may also have neck veins that are larger than normal, swelling of the legs or belly, or an enlarged liver.\n\n【8】Heart Failure Tests \n--------------------\n\n【9】Tests that your doctor might order to diagnose heart failure include:\n\n【10】**Blood tests** to check for anemia, thyroid problems, and high cholesterol, conditions that can be related to heart failure. There is also a blood test for B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), which can indicate active heart failure.\n\n【11】**Urine tests** to look for signs of kidney problems or diabetes, a cause of heart disease\n\n【12】**Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG)** to assess the heart rate and rhythm. This test can often detect heart disease, heart attack, an enlarged heart, or abnormal heart rhythms that may cause heart failure.\n\n【13】**Chest X-ray. You may get this done** to see if your heart is enlarged and if your lungs are congested with fluid.\n\n【14】**Echocardiogram.** This is an ultrasound test to check on  heart muscle function, see how well the heart is pumping, and detect problems with the heart valves that may cause heart failure. It can also measure ejection fraction (EF). EF is a measure of how much blood is pumped out of the heart with each beat. A normal EF is generally greater than 55%, which means that over half of the blood volume in the heart's main pumping chamber is pumped out with each beat.\n\n【15】**Radionuclide ventriculography.** This shows  the pumping function of the left and right ventricles (the heart's large pumping chambers) during heart contractions. This test can also measure EF. Rarely done  by itself, you may get it as part of an exercise stress test.\n\n【16】**Cardiac MRI****.** The goal is to distinguish scar from normal tissue and abnormalities in the heart muscle. Cardiac MRI  can also measure EF. This test is generally available only in large heart centers and is rarely used as a first step in heart disease diagnosis.\n\n【17】**Exercise stress test**. This is  an EKG done while you either walk on a treadmill, cycle on a stationary bike, or use medications to simulate exercise. This test lets your doctor check for any heart function problems brought on by exercise, which may indicate coronary artery disease.\n\n【18】Your doctor may also do more invasive tests, such as cardiac catheterization, to directly visualize the heart's chambers. This test can determine if coronary artery disease is present and can also measure EF.\n\n【19】**CT coronary angiogram.** It uses an X-ray and a contrast dye to see if you have coronary artery disease. Your doctor can view images in 3D, which lets them see blockages in your arteries.\n\n【20】**Myocardial biopsy.** In this test, your doctor puts a small, flexible biopsy catheter into a vein in your neck or groin, and takes a small piece of your heart muscle. This test can diagnose certain types of heart muscle diseases that cause heart failure.\n\n【21】Heart Failure Treatment\n-----------------------\n\n【22】Treatment of heart failure focuses on slowing or reversing its progression. The earlier treatment starts, the better.\n\n【23】After making the diagnosis, your doctor will recommend lifestyle changes. They may recommend that you reach and maintain a healthy weight, become more active, cut down on sodium and fluids, and avoid alcohol. If you smoke or chew tobacco, you'll be advised to stop. You'll work with your doctor to find the right balance of rest and activity, as mobility is important for blood circulation. You will also need to weigh yourself daily and record your weight to help flag any fluid retention.\n\n【24】Your doctor will also prescribe several medications to manage your heart failure or the problem that caused the heart failure. Drugs used to treat heart failure, often in combination, include:\n\n【25】**Diuretics or water pills** can help reduce symptoms of heart failure or keep them from getting worse. For example, they may help make breathing easier by helping pull fluid out of the lungs. A diuretic makes you urinate a lot, especially when you first start taking it. The diuretics you're most likely to be started on for heart failure include bumetanide (Bumex), furosemide (Lasix),  and  torsemide (Demadex).\n\n【26】Your doctor may also prescribe a thiazide diuretic like chlorothiazide (Diuril) or metolazone (Zaroxolyn).  Another option is a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist like eplerenone (Inspra) and spironolactone (Aldactone) that removes extra salt and fluid and holds onto potassium.\n\n【27】**Potassium****supplements**replace the potassium that may be lost because the diuretics make you urinate more. \n\n【28】**ACE inhibitors have several** benefits for people with heart failure. These medications are vasodilators, which means that they expand blood vessels and increase blood flow, thus helping the heart pump more efficiently. ACE inhibitors are important heart failure drugs since they have been shown to help most people with heart failure live longer and with a better quality of life. ACE inhibitors include: captopril (Capoten), enalapril (Vasotec), fosinopril (Monopril), lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril), quinapril (Accupril), ramipril (Altace) and trandolapril (Mavik).\n\n【29】**Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)** work in similar ways as ACE inhibitors. They are prescribed when people get side effects from ACE inhibitors, such a cough or high potassium levels. Examples of ARBs include: candesartan (Atacand), losartan (Cozaar), and valsartan (Diovan).\n\n【30】**Angiotensin receptor-neprilysin Inhibitors (ARNs)** combine a neprilysin inhibitor and an ARB. Entresto (sacubitril/valsartan) is seen as a possible replacement for ACE inhibitors or other ARBs.\n\n【31】**Beta-blockers** can improve the heart's ability to relax, and curb production of harmful hormones made by the body in response to heart failure. Beta-blockers used to treat heart failure include carvedilol (Coreg) and metoprolol (Lopressor).\n\n【32】**Digoxin**, sold under the brand name Lanoxin, may improve heart pumping function and control certain heart rhythm problems. Digoxin is an older medication and not used as often as in the past, because many of the newer drugs appear to have more profound effects on symptom control and overall outcome. But it may still be a reasonable add-on for people whose  symptoms don't improve with diuretics and ACE inhibitors.\n\n【33】**Selective sinus node inhibitors** is a class of drug which targets a specific area of the heart, the sinoatrial pacemaker. Ivabradine (Corlanor) lowers the heart rate and helps the lower left ventricle contract more efficiently.\n\n【34】**Soluble guanylate cyclase (**_**sGC**_**) stimulators** help relax and widen the blood vessels so blood can flow more easily. The drug vericiguat (Verquvo) can be prescribed  for people with chronic heart failure who have been hospitalized or need IV diuretics. It helps reduce the risk of dying and further hospitalization.\n\n【35】Some of these drugs may cause unwanted side effects. Tell your doctor about any problems you have. Don't stop or cut down on the dose of any prescribed medication unless your doctor tells you to. \n\n【36】In some cases, when drugs don't improve heart function enough or cannot be tolerated, you may need surgery or another procedure. Doctors recommend surgery for several major reasons: to correct certain problems that cause heart failure (such as coronary artery bypass graft surgery), to repair or replace valves, to implant devices (such as an intra-aortic balloon pump, specialized pacemakers, ICDs, or ventricular-assist devices) to help the heart pump, or to transplant a new heart. Heart transplants are used to treat severe congestive heart failure.\n\n【37】 If the cost of any medications is a problem for you, tell your doctor. There may be lower-priced generic medications or other options.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 11:02:17", "endTime": "2024/08/21 11:02:48", "cost": 31.027}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:07", "update_time": "2024-08-20 19:02:47", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 19:02:16"}

For the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis , penicillamine is known as a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD). It helps to decrease pain/tenderness/swelling in the joints. For the treatment of Wilson's disease, penicillamine binds to copper and helps it to be removed from the body. Decreasing copper levels helps to improve liver function and the mental/mood/nerve problems (such as confusion, difficulty speaking/walking) caused by the disease. For the treatment of cystinuria, penicillamine helps to decrease the amount of a certain substance (cystine) in the urine which can cause kidney stones.\n\n【2】### How to use Cuprimine\n\n【3】Take this medication by mouth on an empty stomach (1 hour before or 2 hours after meals) as directed by your doctor.

The goal of hypertension treatment is to lower high blood pressure and protect important organs, like the brain, heart, and kidneys from damage. Treatment for hypertension has been associated with reductions in stroke (reduced an average of 35%-40%), heart attack (20%-25%), and heart failure (more than 50%), according to research.\n\n【1】High blood pressure is now classified as a systolic blood pressure greater than 130 and diastolic over 80.\n\n【2】To prevent high blood pressure, everyone should be encouraged to make lifestyle modifications, such as eating a healthier diet, quitting smoking, and getting more exercise. Treatment with medication is recommended to lower blood pressure to less than 130/80 in people older than age 65 and those with risk factors such as diabetes and high cholesterol.\n\n【3】Treating high blood pressure involves lifestyle changes and possibly drug therapy.\n\n【4】Lifestyle Changes to Treat High Blood Pressure\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【5】A critical step in preventing and treating high blood pressure is a healthy lifestyle. You can lower your blood pressure with the following lifestyle changes:\n\n【6】*   Losing weight if you are overweight or obese\n*   Quitting smoking. Tobacco damages the walls of your blood vessels and hardens your arteries. Both need to be in good shape while you control your blood pressure.\n*   Following the DASH eating plan, which stands for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension. It focuses on vegetables, fruits, whole grains fish, poultry, nuts, and beans. High-potassium foods, like avocados, bananas, dried fruits, tomatoes, and black beans, get a big thumbs-up. This plan keeps sugary drinks, sweets, and high-fat meats and dairy products at a minimum.\n*   Reducing the amount of sodium in your diet to less than 1,500 milligrams a day if you have high blood pressure; healthy adults should try to limit their sodium intake to no more than 2,300 milligrams a day (about 1 teaspoon of salt). Many processed foods have a lot of salt in them. For instance, soups, condiments, and tomato sauce can have as much as 75% of the total amount of salt you need each day. Read food labels carefully (salt is listed as sodium), and don't sprinkle more on when you cook or before you eat. Instead, use spices and herbs to flavor your food.\n*   Getting regular aerobic exercise (such as brisk walking at least 30 minutes a day, several days a week). Check out a yoga class. Seek out activities that get your heart pounding, like biking or swimming. Over the course of a week, aim to exercise consistently for at least 2 1/2 hours total.\n*   Keeping a healthy weight for your age and height is key. If you're overweight or have obesity, you can lower your blood pressure by losing just 5 pounds.\n*   Limiting alcohol to two drinks a day for men, one drink a day for women. One drink is an ounce of alcohol, 5 ounces of wine, or 12 ounces of beer.\n*   Reducing stress. Think about stressful areas of your life and take steps to change them. Consider talking to a counselor, learning meditation or anger-control techniques, or getting regular massages.\n\n【7】In addition to lowering blood pressure, many of these measures enhance the effectiveness of high blood pressure drugs.\n\n【8】Drugs to Treat High Blood Pressure\n----------------------------------\n\n【9】There are several types of drugs used to treat high blood pressure, including:\n\n【10】*   Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors\n*   Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs)\n*   Diuretics\n*   Beta-blockers\n*   Calcium channel blockers\n*   Alpha-blockers\n*   Alpha-agonists\n*   Renin inhibitors\n*   Combination medications\n\n【11】Diuretics are often recommended as the first line of therapy for most people who have high blood pressure.\n\n【12】However, your doctor may start a medicine other than a diuretic as the first line of therapy if you have certain medical problems. For example, ACE inhibitors are often a choice for people with diabetes. If one drug doesn't work or is disagreeable, additional medications or alternative medications may be recommended.\n\n【13】If your blood pressure is more than 20/10 points higher than it should be, your doctor may consider starting you on two drugs or placing you on a combination drug.\n\n【14】High Blood Pressure Treatment Follow-Up\n---------------------------------------\n\n【15】The most important element in the management of high blood pressure is follow-up care.\n\n【16】*   After starting high blood pressure drug therapy, you should see your doctor at least once a month until the blood pressure goal is reached. Once or twice a year, your doctor may check the level of potassium in your blood (diuretics can lower this, and ACE inhibitors and ARBs may increase this) and other electrolytes and BUN/creatinine levels (to check the health of the kidneys).\n*   After the blood pressure goal is reached, you should continue to see your doctor every 3 to 6 months, depending on whether you have other diseases such as heart failure.\n*   If you have diabetes or have had a heart attack or stroke, you’ll need to keep a closer watch on your blood pressure to prevent recurrent events. Check with your doctor about what blood pressure readings you should be aiming for.\n*   With aging and hardening of the arteries, your systolic blood pressure may creep up. A treatment that once worked well may no longer work. Your drug dosage may need to be changed, or you may be prescribed a new medication.\n*   Periodically, at your follow-up visits, you should be screened for damage to the heart, eyes, brain, kidney, and peripheral arteries that may be related to high blood pressure.\n*   Follow-up visits are a good time to let your doctor know about any side effects you’re having from your medication. They will have suggestions for coping with side effects or may change your treatment.\n*   Follow-up visits are a great opportunity for monitoring other associated risk factors, such as high cholesterol and obesity.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 11:11:10", "endTime": "2024/08/21 11:11:23", "cost": 13.377}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:07", "update_time": "2024-08-20 19:11:22", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 19:11:08"}

It’s the third leading cause of cancer deaths among American men and women.\n\n【2】In the U.S. about 72% of colorectal cancer cases start in the colon and 28% in the rectum.\n\n【3】The colon is also called the large intestine, which is part of your digestive system. It absorbs water and nutrients from food after it moves through your stomach and small intestine. Solid waste (poop or stool) is stored in your colon before moving to the rectum. This 8-inch tube holds the waste until it leaves your body through the anus.\n\n【4】Most colorectal cancers are \"silent\" tumors. They grow slowly, and you may not notice any symptoms until they’re large. But you can take some steps to prevent colorectal cancer, and you can cure it if you find it early. It’s important to have regular screening exams to spot cancer or precancerous areas, especially if you have a high risk of getting it.\n\n【5】Types of Colorectal Cancer\n--------------------------\n\n【6】There are several types of colorectal cancer, based on where it starts.\n\n【7】*   **Adenocarcinoma****.** This is the most common kind, making up 96% of cases. It starts in cells that make mucus for your colon and rectum.\n*   **Carcinoid tumor.** This begins in cells that make hormones.\n*   **Gastrointestinal stromal tumor.** This forms in cells in the wall of your colon that tell your gastrointestinal muscles to move food or liquid along.\n*   **Lymphoma****.** This is cancer of your immune system cells.\n*   **Sarcoma****.** This starts in connective tissues like blood vessels or muscle layers.\n\n【8】Colorectal Cancer Causes\n------------------------\n\n【9】Nearly all colon and rectal cancers begin as a polyp, a growth on the inner surface of your colon. Polyps themselves usually aren’t cancer.\n\n【10】The most common types of polyps in your colon and rectum include:\n\n【11】*   **Hyperplastic and inflammatory polyps.** These usually don’t carry a chance of cancer. But large hyperplastic polyps, especially on the right side of your colon, can be a problem. Your doctor will want to remove them.\n*   **Adenomas or adenomatous polyps.** These are precancerous. If you leave them alone, they could turn into colon cancer.\n\n【12】Colorectal cancer may also start in an area of abnormal cells, called dysplasia, in the lining of your colon or rectum.\n\n【13】Colorectal Cancer Risk Factors\n------------------------------\n\n【14】Anyone can get colorectal cancer. It’s most common among African Americans and people over age 50.\n\n【15】The lifetime chance of developing colorectal cancer is 1 in 22 for men and 1 in 24 for women.\n\n【16】Things that can raise your chances of getting it include:\n\n【17】*   A personal or family history of colorectal cancer or polyps\n*   A diet with a lot of red and processed meats\n*   Inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis\n*   Conditions passed down through your family, such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC)\n*   Obesity\n*   Smoking\n*   Lack of activity\n*   Heavy alcohol use\n*   Type 2 diabetes\n*   Breast cancer\n*   Ovarian or uterine cancer diagnosed before age 50\n\n【18】Polyps might be more likely to contain cancer or carry a higher chance of cancer if:\n\n【19】*   They’re larger than 1 centimeter\n*   You have more than two\n*   They show signs of dysplasia\n\n【20】Colorectal Cancer Symptoms\n--------------------------\n\n【21】You might not notice any signs of colorectal cancer. When you have them, they can include:\n\n【22】*   A change in your bowel habits that doesn’t go away, such as constipation or diarrhea\n*   A feeling that your bowel hasn’t emptied all the way after you poop\n*   Bleeding from your rectum\n*   Blood on or in your poop\n*   Poop that’s narrower or thinner than usual\n*   Belly discomfort\n*   Stomach cramps\n*   Weight loss with no clear cause\n*   An unusually low number of red blood cells (anemia)\n*   Weakness or fatigue\n*   A lump in your belly or rectum\n\n【23】Colorectal Cancer Diagnosis\n---------------------------\n\n【24】Your doctor may give you a physical exam and feel your belly for any swollen organs or masses. They might also order one or more of these tests to spot polyps or colorectal cancer:\n\n【25】*   **Rectal exam.** Your doctor can use their fingers to feel for growths.\n*   **Colonoscopy.** This is the standard screening test that experts recommend. Your doctor uses a thin, flexible tube called a colonoscope to look at your entire colon and rectum.\n*   **Sigmoidoscopy****.** Your doctor looks at your rectum and the last part of your colon.\n*   **Biopsy****.** Your doctor may take out a bit of tissue during a colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy and send it to a lab for testing. They can also use a needle to take a sample, with a CT scan or ultrasound to guide them. Complications are rare, but you may have some bleeding or discomfort.\n*   **Stool DNA**. This test looks for certain gene changes that might be a sign of colon cancer.\n*   **CT colonography.** This is a special X-ray (also called a virtual colonoscopy) of your entire colon. It takes less time and is less invasive than other tests. But if it shows a polyp, you’ll still need a colonoscopy.\n*   **Barium enema X-ray.** This is a type of X-ray that involves putting dye in your colon. It can find trouble spots that might mean you need a colonoscopy.\n*   **Other imaging tests.** MRI or ultrasound can give your doctor a better look at your organs.\n\n【26】Tumors may bleed in amounts so small that only special tests can find it. This is called occult bleeding, meaning you probably can’t see it with the naked eye. These tests can look for blood in your poop:\n\n【27】*   **Fecal immunochemical test (FIT).** This reacts to part of human hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells. You can do the test at home and mail a sample of poop to a lab.\n*   **Guaiac-based fecal occult blood tests (gFOBT)**. This uses a chemical to look for blood. You can do it at home and mail in a card with a sample of poop on it.\n\n【28】If either of these tests finds blood, your doctor will probably recommend a colonoscopy.\n\n【29】Colorectal Polyps\n-----------------\n\n【30】If a test finds a polyp, your doctor will take it out and send it to a laboratory. A specialist will look at it under a microscope. Your doctor will discuss the results with you. They will recommend next steps, including when to have another colonoscopy.\n\n【31】Colorectal Cancer Stages\n------------------------\n\n【32】If you have colorectal cancer, tests can tell your doctor whether it has grown or spread. This process is called staging. The stages of colorectal cancer are:\n\n【33】*   **Stage 0.** The cancer hasn’t gone past the inner layer of your colon or rectum. This is also called cancer in situ.\n*   **Stage I.** The cancer has grown into the muscles of your colon or rectum.\n*   **Stage IIA.** It’s spread through the colon or rectum wall.\n*   **Stage IIB.** It’s grown into the lining of your abdomen (peritoneum).\n*   **Stage IIC.** The cancer has spread through your colon or rectum wall and into nearby tissues.\n*   **Stage IIIA.** It’s spread to three or fewer lymph nodes or to tissues around your colon or rectum.\n*   **Stage IIIB.** It’s grown through the wall of your bowel or into nearby organs. It’s also spread to three or fewer lymph nodes or to tissues around your colon or rectum.\n*   **Stage IIIC.** The cancer has spread to four or more lymph nodes.\n*   **Stage IVA.** Cancer has spread to one part of your body that’s farther away, like your liver or lungs.\n*   **Stage IVB.** It’s spread to more than one part of your body.\n*   **Stage IVC.** Cancer has grown in the lining of your abdomen and possibly to lymph nodes or organs that are farther away.\n\n【34】Colorectal Cancer Treatment\n---------------------------\n\n【35】Treatment will depend on several things. You and your doctor should consider:\n\n【36】*   The stage of the disease\n*   How well certain treatments will work for you\n*   Your overall health\n*   The risks and side effects\n*   How much the treatment costs\n*   The option you’d prefer\n\n【37】You might have one or more of these treatments:\n\n【38】**Surgery**\n\n【39】Your doctor can take out polyps and small tumors that haven’t spread during a colonoscopy or through a laparoscopy, in which they put special tools and cameras into your belly through small cuts. If the cancer has spread, you might have surgery to remove part of your colon (partial colectomy).\n\n【40】If cancer has spread to your liver and nowhere else, surgery is your best chance for a cure. But it’s not an option for everyone. Your doctor must be able to take out all the cancer. And you need enough healthy tissue left over for your liver to still work. If your tumor is very large, you might have chemotherapy to help shrink it before surgery.\n\n【41】Procedures called ablation and embolization can also treat cancer that has spread to the liver. They can destroy tumors without removing them. Sometimes, doctors use high-energy radio waves or electromagnetic microwaves to kill cancer cells. Or they may inject the tumor with alcohol or freeze it with a metal probe. With embolization, a substance blocks blood flow to the tumor.\n\n【42】**Radiation therapy**\n\n【43】Radiation therapy uses high-energy X-rays, electron beams, or chemical agents called radioactive isotopes to attack cancer. The radiation is aimed directly at the tumor. It damages chromosomes in cancer cells so they can't multiply.\n\n【44】**External radiation therapy** is the most common form for people with colorectal cancer. A machine aims a beam of radiation at your tumor. It's painless.\n\n【45】Before treatment begins, a team of specialists, including a radiation oncologist, will use measurements from scans to find the exact spot to aim the radiation. They'll tattoo small dots on your body to show where to target the beam. This ensures that they get the same location at every treatment.\n\n【46】You'll need to be still during the procedure, but it lasts only a few minutes. You may have five treatments a week for several weeks, and sometimes, you'll be treated a few times a day for several weeks.\n\n【47】There are many kinds of external beam radiation. These include 2D, 3D conformal, IMRT, IGRT, and proton beam therapy.\n\n【48】Radiation can also be **internal.** Interstitial radiation therapy (also known as brachytherapy) uses a tube to place small pellets, or seeds, of radioactive material directly into your tumor. After 15 minutes, they're taken out. You may have up to two treatments a week for 2 weeks.\n\n【49】**Endocavitary radiation therapy** is often used for rectal cancer**.** A device called a proctoscope is placed in your anus to carry radiation directly to the tumor. It stays there a few minutes and then is taken out. You'll probably have four treatments, each about 2 weeks apart.\n\n【50】Side effects tend to be specific to the area of your body that gets the radiation. Talk to your doctor about what you can expect.\n\n【51】You may have:\n\n【52】*   Blood in your stool\n*   Lack of energy\n*   Leaky bowels\n*   Pain and burning on your skin where beams were aimed\n*   Pain during bowel movements\n*   Pain when you pee\n*   Problems having sex\n\n【53】Most side effects should get better a few weeks after treatment ends, but some may not go away. Medications and other treatments may help.\n\n【54】**Radiofrequency ablation**\n\n【55】This kills cancer cells using a probe with electrodes.\n\n【56】**Chemotherapy**\n\n【57】Chemo drugs destroy cancer cells or stop them from spreading. You can take the medicines in pill form or through an IV. You can also get them in a blood vessel close to your tumor. There are many types of these drugs. Some work better together, so you may take two or more at the same time. You usually get the treatment for 2 or 4 weeks and then take a break.\n\n【58】You might have chemo after surgery to kill any cancer cells left behind. Or you could have it before an operation to make a tumor smaller and easier to remove. Chemo may help treat cancer pain too. And it's often the best way to slow the spread of the disease.\n\n【59】The downside is that the drugs can attack healthy cells as well as cancerous ones. This can cause side effects like hair loss, vomiting, and mouth sores. You may also feel very tired and get sick easily. But these problems usually get better when your treatment is over.\n\n【60】**Immunotherapy**\n\n【61】Immunotherapy, a type of biological therapy, uses your body's immune system to fight cancer. It includes:\n\n【62】*   **Biological response modifiers**. These trigger the immune system to indirectly affect tumors. Biological response modifiers include cytokines (chemicals produced by cells to instruct other cells) such as interferons and interleukins. This strategy involves giving larger amounts of these substances by injection or infusion in the hope of stimulating the cells of the immune system to act more effectively.\n*   **Colony-stimulating factors.** These things signal your body to make bone marrow cells (the soft, sponge-like material inside bones), which include both red and white blood cells and platelets. White blood cells fight infection; red blood cells carry oxygen to and carbon dioxide from organs and tissues; platelets are cell fragments that help the blood clot. Often, other cancer treatments cause decreases in these cells. Thus, colony-stimulating factors don’t directly affect tumors, but they can help support your immune system during cancer treatment.\n*   **Monoclonal antibodies**. These lab-made things find and bind to cancer cells wherever they are in the body. They can be used to see where the tumor is in the body (detection of cancer) and call in other immune system cells to destroy them, or as therapy to deliver drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to a tumor. Monoclonal antibodies for colorectal cancer include bevacizumab (Avastin), cetuximab (Erbitux), panitumumab (Vectibix), and ramucirumab (Cyramza).\n*   **Immune checkpoint inhibitors**. These are drugs that take the “brakes” off of checkpoint proteins in the immune system, which helps these proteins recognize and attack cancer cells. They include ipilimumab (Yervoy), pembrolizumab, (Keytruda), and nivolumab (Opdivo).\n*   **Tumor vaccines**. Researchers are developing vaccines that may encourage the immune system to better recognize cancer cells. In theory, they would work in a similar way as vaccines for measles, mumps, and other infections. The difference in cancer treatment is that vaccines are used _after_ someone has cancer, rather than to prevent the disease. There are also ongoing studies involving possible vaccines to prevent breast and prostate cancers.\n\n【63】Like other forms of cancer treatment, immunotherapy may have a number of side effects. They can vary widely from person to person. Biologic response modifiers may cause flu-like symptoms, including fever, chills, nausea, and loss of appetite. In addition, rashes or swelling may develop at the injection site, and blood pressure may fall. Fatigue is another common side effect.\n\n【64】Colony-stimulating factors might cause bone pain, fatigue, fever, and loss of appetite.\n\n【65】The side effects of monoclonal antibodies vary. They may include serious allergic reactions. Rashes are common and may be a severe side effect of Erbitux or Vectibix. They usually mean that these drugs are working.\n\n【66】Bleeding, blood clotting, or bowel perforation may be side effects of Avastin or Cyramza.\n\n【67】Vaccines can cause muscle aches and low-grade fever.\n\n【68】Immune checkpoint inhibitors can have serious side effects. One concern is that they can allow the immune system to attack normal organs in the body. More common side effects include fatigue, cough, loss of appetite, and rash.\n\n【69】**Targeted therapy**\n\n【70】This uses drugs that focus on specific things in cancer cells, like genes or proteins, to kill them or keep them from growing.\n\n【71】Some come in pill form. You get others in your vein (IV) at a hospital, doctor’s office, or clinic. Most are given along with standard chemo medicines.\n\n【72】Medications used as targeted therapies for colorectal cancer include:\n\n【73】*   Aflibercept (Zaltrap)\n*   Bevacizumab (Avastin)\n*   Cetuximab (Erbitux)\n*   Panitumumab (Vectibix)\n*   Ramucirumab (Cyramza)\n\n【74】Targeted therapies can cause serious side effects. Some of the most common are:\n\n【75】*   Diarrhea\n*   Blood clots\n*   Bleeding in the GI tract\n*   Allergic reactions\n*   Liver diseases like hepatitis and skin rash or peeling\n\n【76】**Palliative (supportive) care**\n\n【77】This doesn’t try to cure cancer. Its goal is to help you feel better. It also provides support for your family and caregivers. And it can help you make decisions about the kind of care you want in the months and years ahead.\n\n【78】Ask your doctor about palliative care as soon as you find out that you have cancer. Your care team can prescribe meds to ease pain and side effects. Palliative care can also ease depression and may help you live longer.\n\n【79】Colorectal Cancer Follow-Up Care\n--------------------------------\n\n【80】After you’ve finished your treatments for colorectal cancer, follow-up care is very important. Regular checkups can help find any changes in your health, and if the cancer comes back (or “recurs”), it can be treated as soon as possible.\n\n【81】**Ongoing care**\n\n【82】You may need to see many different doctors during the months and years after you finish treatment. Your oncologist will usually start out as your main contact. They’ll give you a schedule for screenings and tests.\n\n【83】They may ask your primary care doctor to take over your care at some point. Be sure you have a summary of your cancer treatment that includes:\n\n【84】*   Your follow-up plan from your oncologist\n*   Names and doses of all your chemotherapy drugs or other medicines\n*   The dates and specifics of your diagnosis (including cancer stage and other details)\n*   Any side effects or complications of treatment\n*   Types and dates of all surgeries and locations where they were done\n*   Dates and amounts of radiation and where it was done\n*   Contact info for all of your doctors\n\n【85】Bring this summary with you for all your appointments, since you may not always see the same doctor.\n\n【86】Ask your doctor any questions you may have about your day-to-day life, such as whether it would help to make changes in your diet or exercise habits.\n\n【87】Tell them about any supplements you take, even “natural” products or vitamins and minerals. That way, your doctor can check on anything that might have side effects or interact with your medicines.\n\n【88】If you feel down or anxious, tell your doctor that, too. They may be able to recommend a counselor or a support group.\n\n【89】**Follow-up tests**\n\n【90】What types of screenings you have and how often you get them will depend on the type and stage of cancer you had and the treatments you got. You'll probably need check-ups three to four times a year during the first 2 or 3 years after treatment and one or two times a year after that. These might include:\n\n【91】*   A physical exam\n*   Colonoscopy, usually 6 months to 1 year after surgery. Your doctor can tell you how often you'll need one.\n*   CT scans of your chest, abdomen, and possibly pelvis every 6 to 12 months for the first 3 years\n*   CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) blood test every 3 to 6 months for 5 years. High levels of CEA protein in the blood may mean cancer cells have spread.\n\n【92】**When to call your doctor**\n\n【93】Call your doctor right away if you have:\n\n【94】*   Belly pain, weight loss, or blood in your stool\n*   Fatigue that gets in the way of your daily life\n*   Problems with your bowel movements, bladder, or sexual function\n*   Mental changes like trouble concentrating, anxiety, depression, or memory loss\n*   Trouble sleeping\n*   Changes in your family medical history, like relatives who've recently been diagnosed with cancer\n\n【95】Colorectal Cancer Prevention\n----------------------------\n\n【96】A healthy tobacco-free lifestyle is the first step in preventing cancer of any kind.\n\n【97】Experts recommend that as an initial step toward the prevention of colorectal cancer, people should exercise and eat healthily. The American Cancer Society says adults should get 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of high-intensity exercise (or a combination of these) each week.\n\n【98】The National Cancer Institute recommends a low-fat, high-fiber diet that includes at least 2 1/2 cups of fruits and vegetables each day. Cut back on red meat and other high-fat foods, such as eggs and many dairy products. You can get the protein you need from low-fat dairy products (also a good source of calcium), nuts, beans, lentils, and soybean products. Avoid overcooking or barbecuing meats and fish.\n\n【99】Some experts suggest that aspirin may stop colorectal cancer cells from multiplying. In addition, other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, such as Aleve and Motrin) may reduce the size of polyps and, therefore, the risk of colon cancer. This theory has not been well established, and the proper dosage is unclear. Also, NSAIDs may raise your odds of serious complications, such as stomach bleeding, heart attacks, and strokes. If you’re at high risk of colon cancer, don’t start taking aspirin or other NSAIDs until you discuss it with your doctor.\n\n【100】Women who have gone through menopause and who take hormone replacement therapy that includes both estrogen and progesterone may be less likely to get colon cancer. But if they do, it may be more advanced when it’s found. Hormone replacement therapy also raises the risk of other cancers. Talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits.\n\n【101】Screening for colorectal cancer is crucial. The American Cancer Society and the US Preventive Services Task Force recommends that people get regular screening exams from ages 45 to 75 if they have an average chance of getting colorectal cancer. This means that you don’t have symptoms and that neither you nor a close family member has had colorectal polyps, cancer, or inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n【102】The guidelines include at least one of these tests:\n\n【103】*   Tests for blood in your poop once a year\n*   Stool DNA tests every 3 years\n*   Flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years\n*   CT colonography (virtual colonoscopy) every 5 years\n*   Colonoscopy every 10 years\n\n【104】Talk to your doctor if you have one or more of the colorectal cancer risk factors. You might need to start screenings at a younger age, get tested more often, or have specific kinds of tests.\n\n【105】If you’re 76 through 85, talk to your doctor about whether you should be tested. The American Cancer Society doesn’t recommend testing for people older than 85.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:23:03", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:25:17", "cost": 133.688}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:07", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:25:17", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:23:03"}

It’s the leading cause of serious, permanent vision loss in people over 50, with about 1 in 10 people in the U.S. affected by the condition.\n\n【2】It happens when the central portion of your retina, called the macula, wears down. The retina is the light-sensing nerve tissue at the back of your eye.\n\n【3】Because the disease happens as you get older, it’s often called age-related macular degeneration. It usually doesn’t cause blindness but might cause serious vision problems.\n\n【4】Another form of macular degeneration, called Stargardt disease or juvenile macular degeneration, affects children and young adults.\n\n【5】Symptoms of Age-Related Macular Degeneration\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【6】Early on, you might not have any noticeable signs of macular degeneration. It might not be diagnosed until it gets worse or affects both eyes.\n\n【7】Symptoms of macular degeneration may include:\n\n【8】*   Worse or less clear vision. Your vision might be blurry, and it may be hard to read fine print, drive, or recognize faces.\n*   Dark, blurry areas in the center of your vision\n*   Straight lines look wavy\n*   Worse or different color perception\n\n【9】If you have any of these symptoms, see an eye doctor as soon as possible.\n\n【10】**Learn more about the symptoms of AMD.**\n\n【11】Types of Age-Related Macular Degeneration\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【12】There are two main types of age-related macular degeneration:\n\n【13】**Dry AMD**. People with this most common type may have yellow deposits, called drusen, in their macula. A few small drusen may not cause changes in your vision. But as they get bigger and more numerous, they might dim or distort your vision, especially when you read. \n\n【14】The condition causes gradual vision loss. As it gets worse, the light-sensitive cells in your macula get thinner and eventually die. In the atrophic form, you may have blind spots in the center of your vision. If that gets worse, you might lose central vision.\n\n【15】**Wet AMD.** This is a less common type of late-stage AMD. It tends to cause faster vision loss. Unstable blood vessels grow from underneath your macula. These blood vessels leak blood and fluid into your retina, distorting your vision. You may also have blind spots and loss of central vision. These blood vessels and their bleeding can eventually form a scar, leading to permanent loss of central vision.\n\n【16】Most people with macular degeneration have the dry form, but that can lead to the wet form. Only about 20% of people with macular degeneration have the wet form.\n\n【17】If you have macular degeneration, you’ll need to see your eye doctor regularly and let them know whenever you notice changes in your vision.\n\n【18】Causes of Age-Related Macular Degeneration\n------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Experts aren't sure why some people develop AMD and others don't. They believe that your genes and your environment may play a role.\n\n【20】People who get wet AMD always have dry AMD first. But those with dry AMD don't always go on to develop the wet type.\n\n【21】Age-Related Macular Degeneration Risk Factors\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【22】Risk factors for both types of AMD include:\n\n【23】*   Smoking\n*   High blood pressure or high cholesterol \n*   Eating lots of saturated fat\n*   Having obesity\n*   Being assigned female at birth\n*   Having light skin\n\n【24】**AMD epidemiology**\n\n【25】AMD is the leading cause of permanent blindness in the industrialized world (with over 170 million people affected), and the third cause globally. Some other AMD facts and figures:\n\n【26】*   Among different racial groups, non-Hispanic White European people are at highest risk of getting AMD, followed by Hispanic, Black, and Asian people.\n*   People over 75 are nearly 15 times more likely to get AMD than those 50-59 years old.\n*   Women are slightly more likely than men to get AMD. But this may be simply because they tend to live longer.\n\n【27】Age-Related Macular Degeneration Diagnosis\n------------------------------------------\n\n【28】Your doctor can check you for age-related macular degeneration when you see them for a routine eye exam and have your eyes dilated.\n\n【29】**Tests for AMD**\n\n【30】These tests can help your doctor diagnose the condition:\n\n【31】*   **Retinal exam.** During your eye exam, the doctor will examine your retina. They'll look for drusen under the retina. \n\n【32】*   **Amsler grid.** Your doctor may also ask you to look at an Amsler grid, a pattern of straight lines that's like a checkerboard. If some of the lines appear wavy or are missing, that could be a sign of macular degeneration.\n\n【33】*   **Angiography.** If your doctor finds AMD, you may have a procedure called angiography or one called optical coherence tomography **(**OCT). In angiography, your doctor injects dye into a vein in your arm. They take photographs as the dye flows through blood vessels in your retina. If there are new vessels, or if vessels are leaking fluid or blood in your macula, the photos will show their location and type. OCT is an imaging scan that can show fluid or blood underneath your retina without dye.\n\n【34】It’s important to see your eye doctor regularly to find signs of macular degeneration early. Treatment can slow the condition or make it less serious.\n\n【35】**Learn more about how AMD is diagnosed** **.**\n\n【36】Stages of Age-Related Macular Degeneration\n------------------------------------------\n\n【37】There are three stages for dry AMD:\n\n【38】*   **Early.** In this stage, you have no symptoms.\n*   **Intermediate.** Some people have no symptoms in this stage. Or, you may notice minor symptoms like central vision blurriness or trouble seeing things in dim light.\n*   **Late.** In this stage, you will likely start to see straight lines as wavy. You may also have blurring in the center of your vision that can expand or get worse over time. Colors may look less bright, and it's even harder to see in low light. \n\n【39】Wet AMD is always considered late stage. But dry AMD may turn into the wet form during any stage. \n\n【40】Age-Related Macular Degeneration Treatment\n------------------------------------------\n\n【41】Treatment may slow the condition down and help preserve your vision. But there’s no cure for macular degeneration. \n\n【42】**Supplements and Medications for AMD**\n\n【43】Right now, there are no medicines or procedures for dry AMD. Your treatment options include:\n\n【44】**Supplements.** A large study by the National Eye Institute, called AREDS (Age-Related Eye Disease Study), found that a certain combination of vitamins and nutrients may protect the eyes of some people with intermediate or late-stage AMD. The supplements may slow intermediate AMD's progression to advanced and might help some people keep their sight longer, too. Researchers later tweaked the formula, giving it the name AREDS2.\n\n【45】If you have a lot of drusen in your eyes, your doctor might recommend you take AREDS2 supplements. If you’ve lost vision in one eye, the supplements may also lower your chances of getting wet AMD and vision loss in your other eye.\n\n【46】AREDS2 supplements are sold over the counter. They're a combination of:\n\n【47】*   Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) \n*   Vitamin E, lutein, zeaxanthin, and zinc (as zinc oxide) \n*   Copper (as cupric oxide) \n\n【48】These supplements don’t help everyone with dry AMD, though. Ask your eye doctor if they might be right for you. If your doctor gives you the green light, ask them to recommend a brand. Also ask your doctor to explain all the possible benefits and risks before you start taking the supplements. They may be part of some people’s treatment for wet AMD, too.\n\n【49】These supplements don't work to prevent AMD, so there's no need to take them if you don't have the condition.\n\n【50】If you have wet AMD, your treatments might include:\n\n【51】**Anti-angiogenesis drugs.** These medications block the creation of blood vessels and leaking from the vessels in your eye that cause wet AMD. You usually get them as injections into your eye. \n\n【52】The main protein causing that growth is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF inhibitors include: aflibercept (Eylea), bevacizumab (Avastin), pegaptanib (Macugen), and ranibizumab (Lucentis). \n\n【53】Blocking angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), another protein involved in forming blood vessels, helps stabilize fragile new vessels so they don't leak. It also makes vessels less sensitive to the effects of VEGF.\n\n【54】VEGF/Ang-2 inhibitors include: \n\n【55】*   Faricimab-svoa (Vabysmo).\n\n【56】Many people who’ve taken these drugs got back some vision that was lost. You might need to have these treatments multiple times.\n\n【57】**Procedures for AMD**\n\n【58】Several options are available for AMD:\n\n【59】**Laser therapy.** High-energy laser light can destroy abnormal blood vessels growing in your eye.\n\n【60】**Photodynamic laser therapy.** Your doctor injects a light-sensitive drug – verteporfin (Visudyne) – into your bloodstream, and it’s absorbed by the abnormal blood vessels. Your doctor then shines a laser into your eye to trigger the medication to damage those blood vessels.\n\n【61】Researchers are also studying experimental treatments for age-related macular degeneration. They include:\n\n【62】*   Submacular surgery. This procedure removes abnormal blood vessels or blood.\n*   Retinal translocation. This destroys abnormal blood vessels under the center of your macula, where your doctor can’t use a laser beam safely. In this procedure, your doctor moves the center of your macula away from the abnormal blood vessels to a healthy area of your retina. This keeps you from getting scar tissue and more damage to your retina. Then, your doctor uses a laser to treat the abnormal blood vessels.\n\n【63】**Alternative options for AMD**\n\n【64】There's no scientific proof that any type of alternative treatments work for AMD, and they can't replace medical treatments. But some people use supplements or alternative therapies along with standard treatments. Always ask your doctor before you try an alternative treatment, as some could interact with your medications or cause side effects.\n\n【65】**Herbs.** Among the herbs that may have some benefits to eye health are:\n\n【66】*   Gingko. This herb contains flavonoids, a substance known to promote eye health. A couple of studies found that people who took gingko were able to slow down vision loss.\n\n【67】*   Milk thistle. Milk thistle contains a substance called silymarin that's good for your liver. Because your liver stores certain vitamins, it plays a role in eye health.\n\n【68】*   Bilberry and grape seeds. These are also high in flavonoids.\n\n【69】**Alternative therapies.** While there's no real evidence to show these practices are effective, some people try them for AMD symptoms:\n\n【70】*   Acupuncture. This treatment involves placing tiny needles into specific points of your body. Some people who practice acupuncture think it helps with AMD by increasing blood flow to the eyes. \n\n【71】*   Microcurrent stimulation. This involves applying a slight electric current in the area around your eyes. The idea is that it could help cells in the retina get rid of waste products\n\n【72】**Find out more about the latest treatment options for AMD.**\n\n【73】Age-Related Macular Degeneration Health Disparities\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【74】While White people of European descent appear more likely to get AMD than other groups, anyone can get it. Research has found differences in how people of color are diagnosed with and treated for the condition.\n\n【75】Studies have shown that Black people with AMD were 23% less likely than White AMD patients to be treated with anti-VEGF injections, the main treatment for dry AMD. Latino and Asian American people are also less likely to be given this treatment.\n\n【76】Studies also show that Black people are 18% less likely than their White counterparts to get regular eye exams, which are important for detecting AMD.\n\n【77】Other research shows that people of color are under-represented in clinical studies of new treatments for eye diseases. The rate at which Black people take part has been decreasing over the past 20 years, even as more Latino and Asian people take part.\n\n【78】The reasons for these disparities aren't clear, but may involve a number of things, including access to health care, cultural mistrust of the health care system, and bias.\n\n【79】Complications of Age-Related Macular Degeneration\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【80】Age-related macular degeneration doesn't cause total blindness, even though it can affect central vision and cause permanent damage to your eye. Your vision loss might make it hard to: \n\n【81】*   Drive \n*   Read\n*   Recognize faces \n*   Do household tasks like cooking or yardwork\n\n【82】Serious AMD can cause you to become legally blind. \n\n【83】Living with Age-Related Macular Degeneration\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【84】When you have AMD, you may need to seek help or change the way you do some of your everyday activities. But with the right support, you should be able to remain independent and maintain a good quality of life. \n\n【85】**AMD and diet**\n\n【86】When you're diagnosed with AMD, your doctor may tell you to eat a balanced diet that’s rich in antioxidants and includes eye-friendly foods like:\n\n【87】*   Fish high in omega-3 fatty acids such as salmon, anchovies, mackerel, and trout (aim for two to three times weekly)\n*   Nuts, which are rich in vitamin E, selenium, and zinc (about a handful weekly)\n*   Dark leafy greens like kale and spinach (daily)\n*   Yellow/orange veggies like peppers and carrots (daily)\n*   Antioxidant-rich fruits, like berries (daily)\n\n【88】**Costs of AMD**\n\n【89】AMD can bring extra costs in several areas, including:\n\n【90】*   Doctor visits, treatments, and vision therapy\n*   Low-vision aids and technology\n*   Home modifications\n*   Pay for caregivers\n*   Lost productivity at work\n\n【91】AMD treatments can be expensive, though how much you pay out-of-pocket depends on your insurance. Without insurance, a 2-year course of treatment could cost between $9,000 and $65,000 per year, depending on what your doctor prescribes. Some drug companies and other groups offer programs to help low-income people with the costs. \n\n【92】**Managing AMD**\n\n【93】Some things that can help you adapt to the vison limits that may come with AMD include:\n\n【94】**Low-vision aids.** These include devices that have special lenses or electronic systems to create larger images of nearby things. They help people who have vision loss from dry or wet macular degeneration make the most of their remaining vision. Your doctor may also prescribe glasses or contacts to help you see better.\n\n【95】**Better lighting.** Bright, consistent lighting throughout your environment helps with things like reading and cooking, and also helps prevent falls.\n\n【96】**Vision rehabilitation.** A low-vision specialist can help you learn to make the most of your side (peripheral) vision and rely more on your other senses. They can help you learn to use low-vision devices and provide advice tailored to your own needs.  \n\n【97】**Mental health and AMD**\n\n【98】Any illness can be distressing, especially one that could cause major changes in your everyday life. If your AMD causes you to lose central vision, you're at higher risk of becoming depressed or socially isolated.\n\n【99】Your doctor can recommend a therapist, counselor, or social worker or help you find a support group. Family and friends can also provide emotional support as well as help you take care of everyday tasks.\n\n【100】Macular Degeneration Prognosis\n------------------------------\n\n【101】Macular degeneration usually gets worse over time. But not everyone who has AMD develops it in both eyes or progresses to the late stages.\n\n【102】The dry form of age-related macular degeneration tends to progress slowly over a period of years. The wet type, though, can come on suddenly.  \n\n【103】Since early treatment can help keep symptoms from getting worse, it's important to have regular doctor appointments and eye exams. Wet macular degeneration will likely need repeated treatments. If you don't get follow-up treatments often enough, your vision may get worse than before you started treatment. \n\n【104】**What to expect with AMD**\n\n【105】Most people with AMD will maintain good eyesight. Even those who lose central vision usually keep their side vision. Talk to your doctor about how your condition might progress. \n\n【106】If you develop advanced AMD, you might lose your ability to do things that require sharp eyesight, like driving or reading.\n\n【107】Age-Related Macular Degeneration Prevention\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【108】If you don’t have AMD, you can practice some healthy habits that may help you lower your chances of getting it:\n\n【109】*   If you smoke, consider quitting.\n*   Take charge of any other health conditions you have, like high blood pressure.\n*   Stay at a healthy weight and get regular exercise.\n*   Eat a balanced diet full of fruit, vegetables, and foods with omega-3 fatty acids (which are in certain fish and nuts).\n\n【110】Conditions That Are Similar to Age-Related Macular Degeneration\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【111】Some other eye conditions have symptoms similar to those of AMD, including:\n\n【112】*   Macular hole. This is a small hole that forms in the macula, leading to distorted vision.\n*   Myopic macular degeneration. This only affects people with serious myopia (nearsightedness).\n*   Stargardt disease. This is also known as juvenile macular degeneration. It's a hereditary condition that affects young people.\n*   Diabetic retinopathy. This is a complication of diabetes that causes damage to blood vessels in the retina.\n\n【113】Takeaways\n---------\n\n【114】Having age-related macular degeneration doesn't mean you'll lose your sight. Timely treatment and healthy lifestyle changes can help protect your central vision. Even if you do lose some vision, steps like low-vision aids and therapy can help you stay independent and keep doing the things you enjoy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 11:06:32", "endTime": "2024/08/21 11:06:49", "cost": 16.827}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:07", "update_time": "2024-08-20 19:06:49", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 19:06:32"}

That's because some children who are born with the condition either never develop symptoms or don't develop symptoms until they reach adolescence or adulthood.\n\n【6】Causes of Chiari Malformations\n------------------------------\n\n【7】Chiari malformations are usually caused by structural defects in the brain and spinal cord. These defects develop during fetal development.\n\n【8】Due to genetic mutations or a maternal diet that lacked certain nutrients, the indented bony space at the base of the skull is abnormally small. As a result, pressure is placed on the cerebellum. This blocks the flow of the cerebrospinal fluid. That's the fluid that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord.\n\n【9】Most Chiari malformations occur during fetal development. Much less commonly, Chiari malformations can occur later in life. This can happen when an excessive amount of cerebrospinal fluid is drained away because of:\n\n【10】*   injury\n*   infection\n*   exposure to toxic substances\n\n【11】Types of Chiari Malformations\n-----------------------------\n\n【12】There are four types of Chiari malformations:\n\n【13】**Type I.** This is by far the most commonly observed type in children. In this type, the lower part of the cerebellum -- but not the brain stem -- extends into an opening at the base of the skull. The opening is called the foramen magnum. Normally, only the spinal cord passes through this opening.\n\n【14】Type I is the only type of Chiari malformation that can be acquired.\n\n【15】**Type II.** This is usually only seen in children born with spina bifida. Spina bifida is the incomplete development of the spinal cord and/or its protective covering.\n\n【16】Type II is also known as \"classic\" Chiari malformation or Arnold-Chiari malformation. In type II Chiari malformation, both the cerebellum and the brain stem extend into the foramen magnum.\n\n【17】**Type III.** This is the most serious form of Chiari malformation. It involves the protrusion or herniation of the cerebellum and brain stem through the foramen magnum and into the spinal cord. This usually causes severe neurological defects. Type III is a rare type.\n\n【18】**Type IV.** This involves an incomplete or undeveloped cerebellum. It sometimes is associated with exposed parts of the skull and spinal cord. Type IV is a rare type.\n\n【19】In addition to spina bifida, other conditions sometimes associated with Chiari malformations include:\n\n【20】**Hydrocephalus****.** An excessive buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain.\n\n【21】**Syringomyelia****.** A disorder in which a cyst develops in the spinal cord's central canal.\n\n【22】**Tethered cord syndrome****.** A progressive disorder in which the spinal cord attaches itself to the bony spine.\n\n【23】**Spinal curvature.** This includes conditions such as:\n\n【24】*   scoliosis (a bending of the spine to the left or right)\n*   kyphosis (a forward bending of the spine)\n\n【25】Symptoms of Chiari Malformations\n--------------------------------\n\n【26】Chiari malformation is associated with a wide range of symptoms which vary by type.\n\n【27】Type I Chiari malformation usually causes no symptoms. Most people with the condition don't even know that they have it unless it is incidentally discovered during a diagnostic imaging test.\n\n【28】But if the malformation is severe, type I may cause symptoms such as:\n\n【29】*   Pain in the lower back of the head into the neck; it usually develops quickly and intensifies with any activity that increases pressure in the brain, such as coughing and sneezing.\n*   Dizziness and problems with balance and coordination\n*   Swallowing difficulties\n*   Sleep apnea\n\n【30】Most children born with type II Chiari malformation have hydrocephalus. Older children with type II Chiari malformation may develop head pain associated with:\n\n【31】*   coughing or sneezing\n*   bending over\n*   strenuous physical activities\n*   straining to have a bowel movement\n\n【32】Some of the most common symptoms are linked to problems with the function of nerves in the brain stem. These include:\n\n【33】*   weakness of vocal cords\n*   swallowing difficulties\n*   breathing irregularities\n*   serious changes in the function of nerves in the throat and tongue\n\n【34】Treatment of Chiari Malformations\n---------------------------------\n\n【35】If a Chiari malformation is suspected, a doctor will perform a physical exam. The doctor will also check functions controlled by the cerebellum and spinal cord. These functions include:\n\n【36】*   balance\n*   touch\n*   reflexes\n*   sensation\n*   motor skills\n\n【37】The doctor may order diagnostic tests, such as:\n\n【38】*   X-ray\n*   CT scan\n*   MRI\n\n【39】An MRI is the test most often used to diagnose Chiari malformations.\n\n【40】If Chiari malformations cause no symptoms and do not interfere with activities of daily living, no treatment is necessary. In other cases, medications can be used to manage symptoms such as pain.\n\n【41】Surgery is the only treatment that can correct functional defects or stop progression of damage to the central nervous system.\n\n【42】In both type I and type II Chiari malformations, the goals of surgery are to:\n\n【43】*   Relieve pressure on the brain and spinal cord\n*   Re-establish normal fluid circulation through and around the area\n\n【44】In adults and children with Chiari malformations, several types of surgery can be performed. These include:\n\n【45】**Posterior fossa decompression surgery.** This involves the removal of a small portion of the bottom of the skull and sometimes part of the spinal column to correct the irregular bony structure. The surgeon also may open and widen the dura. That's the firm covering of the brain and spinal cord tissues. This creates additional space for the cerebrospinal fluid to circulate.\n\n【46】**Electrocautery.** This uses high-frequency electrical currents to shrink the lower part of the cerebellum.\n\n【47】**Spinal** **laminectomy****.** This is the removal of part of the arched, bony roof of the spinal canal. This increases the canal's size and reduces pressure on the spinal cord and nerve roots.\n\n【48】Additional surgical procedures may be needed to correct conditions associated with Chiari malformations such as hydrocephalus.\n\n【49】Surgery usually results in a significant reduction of symptoms and a prolonged period of remission. According to Children's Hospital in Boston, which specializes in the treatment of Chiari malformations, surgery virtually eliminates symptoms in 50% of pediatric cases. Surgery substantially reduces symptoms in another 45% of cases. Symptoms are stabilized in the remaining 5%.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:53:51", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:54:04", "cost": 12.807}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:07", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:54:04", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:53:51"}

Some brain tumors are benign, which means the cells aren’t cancer. Others are malignant, meaning they’re cancer.\n\n【2】Brain tumors are called primary tumors if they started in your brain. They’re considered secondary if they started somewhere else in your body and spread to your brain.\n\n【3】Types of Brain Tumors\n---------------------\n\n【4】Primary brain tumors come from cells that make up the brain and central nervous system. They’re named for the kind of cell in which they first form. There are more than 100 kinds of brain tumors. The most common types in adults are:\n\n【5】*   **Gliomas.** These tumors start in the glial cells, which are cells that help keep nerves healthy. They’re most often cancer. There are several categories of gliomas, based on which specific cells they target. Astrocytomas are most common in adults. A glioblastoma is the most aggressive type of glial tumor.\n*   **Meningiomas****.** These form in the meninges, the thin layer of tissue that covers the brain and spinal cord. They aren’t cancer, but they can cause problems by pressing on your brain.\n*   **Schwannomas.** These damage the protective coating of nerve cells. They aren’t cancer, but they often cause hearing loss or problems with balance.\n*   **Pituitary adenomas.** These form on the pituitary gland, which sits at the base of your brain. It makes important hormones. These tumors usually aren’t cancer and are slow growing.\n\n【6】Benign vs. Malignant Brain Tumors\n---------------------------------\n\n【7】**Benign brain tumors** aren’t aggressive and normally don’t spread to surrounding tissues, although they can be serious and even life-threatening. Benign brain tumors usually have clearly defined borders and usually aren’t deeply rooted in brain tissue. This makes them easier to surgically remove if they’re in an area of the brain where it’s safe to operate. But they can come back. Benign tumors are less likely to come back than cancerous ones.\n\n【8】Even a benign brain tumor can be a serious health problem. Brain tumors can damage the cells around them by causing inflammation and putting increased pressure on nearby tissue, as well as inside your skull.\n\n【9】**Malignant primary brain tumors** are cancers that start in your brain, typically grow faster than benign tumors, and quickly invade surrounding tissue. Although brain cancer rarely spreads to other organs, it can spread to other parts of your brain and central nervous system.\n\n【10】**Secondary brain tumors** are cancer. They come from cancer that started somewhere else in your body and spread, or metastasized, to your brain. About 1 in 4 people with cancer develop a secondary brain tumor.\n\n【11】Brain Tumor Symptoms\n--------------------\n\n【12】Symptoms of brain tumors vary according to the type of tumor and the location. Because different areas of the brain control different functions of the body, where the tumor lies affects the symptoms you get.\n\n【13】Some tumors have no symptoms until they’re large and then cause a serious, rapid decline in health. Other tumors may have symptoms that develop slowly.\n\n【14】Common symptoms include:\n\n【15】*   Headaches, which may not get better with the usual headache remedies. You may notice you’re getting them more often or they’re worse than usual.\n*   Seizures, particularly in a person who doesn't have a history of seizures\n*   Changes in speech or hearing\n*   Changes in vision\n*   Balance problems\n*   Problems with walking\n*   Numbness or tingling in the arms or legs\n*   Problems with memory\n*   Personality changes\n*   Inability to concentrate\n*   Weakness in one part of the body\n*   Morning vomiting without nausea\n\n【16】These symptoms can result from many conditions. Don't assume you have a brain tumor just because you have some of the symptoms. Check with your doctor.\n\n【17】Most of the time, doctors can’t tell what causes a brain tumor. There are only a few known risk factors for brain tumors in adults.\n\n【18】*   **Exposure to** **radiation****.** Children who receive radiation to the head have a higher risk of developing a brain tumor as adults.\n*   **Family history****.** Some brain tumors are linked to certain rare genetic conditions such as neurofibromatosis or Li-Fraumeni syndrome.\n*   **Age.** People between ages 65 and 79 make up the population most likely to be diagnosed with a brain tumor.\n*   **No history of** **chickenpox****.** One study has found that people who had chickenpox are less likely to get gliomas.\n\n【19】Brain Tumor Diagnosis\n---------------------\n\n【20】To diagnose a brain tumor, your doctor will start by asking questions about your symptoms, overall health, and family health history. Then they’ll do a physical exam, including a neurological exam. If there's reason to suspect a brain tumor, the doctor may request one or more of the following tests:\n\n【21】*   Imaging studies like a CT scan or MRI to see detailed images of the brain\n*   Angiogram or MRA, which use dye and X-rays of blood vessels in the brain to look for signs of a tumor or abnormal blood vessels\n\n【22】The doctor may also ask for a biopsy to see if the tumor is cancer. They’ll remove a tissue sample from your brain. They might do it during surgery to remove the tumor. Or they could insert a needle through a small hole drilled into your skull. They’ll send the sample to a lab for testing.\n\n【23】Brain Tumor Treatment\n---------------------\n\n【24】Your doctor will consider several things in deciding how to treat your brain tumor, including:\n\n【25】*   Location of the tumor\n*   Size of the tumor\n*   Type of tumor\n*   Whether the tumor has spread\n*   Your overall health\n*   Potential complications\n\n【26】Surgery to remove the tumor is typically the first option once a brain tumor has been diagnosed. But some tumors can't be surgically removed because of their location in the brain. In those cases, chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be options for killing and shrinking the tumor.\n\n【27】Sometimes you’ll get chemotherapy or radiation after surgery to kill any remaining cancer cells. Your doctor may treat tumors that are deep in the brain or in areas that are difficult to reach with gamma knife therapy, a form of highly focused radiation therapy.\n\n【28】Because treatment for cancer can damage healthy tissue, you should talk about possible long-term effects of whatever treatment is being used with your doctor. They can explain the risk and the possibility of losing certain faculties. The doctor can also explain the importance of planning for rehabilitation following treatment. Rehabilitation could involve working with several different therapists, such as:\n\n【29】*   Physical therapists to regain strength and balance\n*   Speech therapists for help with speaking, expressing thoughts, or swallowing\n*   Occupational therapist to help manage daily activities such as using the bathroom, bathing, and dressing\n\n【30】10 Questions to Ask Your Doctor About Brain Tumors\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【31】If you were recently diagnosed with a brain tumor, ask your doctor these questions at your next visit.\n\n【32】1\\. What type of brain tumor do I have, and what is its grade?\n\n【33】2\\. What are the symptoms of brain cancer?\n\n【34】3\\. Which part of my brain is affected by the tumor and what does this region of the brain do?\n\n【35】4\\. Will it be possible to surgically remove my tumor?\n\n【36】5\\. If you can't surgically remove the tumor, will I need other treatments such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy after surgery?\n\n【37】6\\. What are the possible side effects of these therapies?\n\n【38】7\\. Who might my treatment team include, and for how long will I continue to see them?\n\n【39】8\\. Are there alternative treatments for my condition?\n\n【40】9\\. Will there be any lasting problems from this disease or its treatment?\n\n【41】10\\.

They happen when your immune system attacks your skin and mucous membranes -- the lining inside your mouth, nose, and other parts of your body. This causes blisters to form.\n\n【2】Researchers have found many types of this disorder. Although there's no cure for them, your doctor can give you treatments to help heal the blisters and prevent complications.\n\n【3】Types of Autoimmune Blistering Disorders\n----------------------------------------\n\n【4】Autoimmune blistering disorders are broken down into different types. These are some of the main ones:\n\n【5】**Pemphigus** is a group of disorders that cause blisters to form on the skin and inside the mouth, nose, throat, eyes, and genitals. They are soft and can break open easily.\n\n【6】**Pemphigoid** is another group. It has three main types:\n\n【7】*   **Bullous pemphigoid** usually affects people between the ages of 60 and 80. It causes itchy blisters to form on the arms, thighs, and belly.\n*   **Mucous membrane pemphigoid** affects the lining of the mouth, eyes, nose, throat, and genitals.\n*   **Pemphigoid gestationis** affects women during pregnancy or just after their baby is born. It starts as a bumpy rash on the belly, arms, and legs. Then the bumps turn into blisters.\n\n【8】**IgA mediated bullous dermatoses** are disorders in which the immune system makes a lot of immunoglobulin A (IgA), a type of antibody that fights bacteria, toxins, and viruses. It comes in two types:\n\n【9】*   **Dermatitis herpetiformis** affects people with celiac disease (who are sensitive to the wheat protein called gluten). It causes clusters of itchy blisters to appear on the elbows, knees, scalp, and buttocks.\n*   **Linear IgA disease** causes new blisters to form a ring around old ones on the skin. This is sometimes called a “cluster of jewels.” This type affects mucous membranes, too.\n\n【10】**Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita** mostly affects middle-aged and older adults. It makes the skin so fragile that blisters form from minor injuries.\n\n【11】Autoimmune Blistering Disorder Symptoms\n---------------------------------------\n\n【12】The places on your body where blisters form depends on which disorder you have. Some autoimmune blistering disorders cause blisters to grow on the skin. Other types cause them to form in the mucous membranes that line the mouth, nose, throat, eyes, and genitals.\n\n【13】They can be painful or itchy. They can break open and leave a sore.\n\n【14】Autoimmune Blistering Disorder Causes\n-------------------------------------\n\n【15】When your immune system is working as it should, it attacks bacteria and other invaders before they can make you sick. In autoimmune blistering disorders, your system mistakes healthy cells in your skin and mucous membranes for unwanted intruders.\n\n【16】Erythema multiforme minor appears as symmetrical rings of red, raised skin that look like targets. Erythema multiforme can appear anywhere on the body. It is most often caused by the herpes simplex virus but has been associated with fungal infections or reactions to medications.\n\n【17】Your immune system makes proteins called antibodies. These attack the substances that hold the outer (epidermis) and inner (dermis) layers of skin together. The damage causes the two layers of skin to separate. Fluid collects between the two and forms blisters.\n\n【18】Doctors don't know what causes the immune system to misfire. Some people have genes that make them more likely to get one of these disorders. Then, something actually triggers it, such as:\n\n【19】*   Ultraviolet light from the sun\n*   Chemicals used to kill pests\n*   Hormones\n*   Infection\n\n【20】Some medicines can also cause autoimmune blistering disorders. These include:\n\n【21】*   Diuretics and other medicines for high blood pressure\n*   Rheumatoid arthritis medications\n*   Antipsychotic medicines\n*   Antibiotics such as amoxicillin (Moxatag), ciprofloxacin (Cetraxal, Ciloxan, Cipro), and penicillin\n\n【22】Usually, the blisters go away once you stop taking the medicine causing them.\n\n【23】Autoimmune Blistering Disorder Complications\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【24】Blisters can cause long-term problems if they form in certain parts of the body or break open.\n\n【25】*   Blisters that pop open can cause infections.\n*   After they heal, they can leave scars.\n*   In the throat or lungs, they can make it hard to eat, swallow, or breathe.\n*   In the mouth, they can cause gum disease and tooth loss.\n*   In the eyes, they can affect sight.\n\n【26】Autoimmune Blistering Disorder Diagnosis\n----------------------------------------\n\n【27】You'll see a dermatologist. They will look at your skin and see where the blisters have formed.\n\n【28】You might get one or more of these tests:\n\n【29】*   **Blister** **biopsy****.** Your doctor removes a piece of the blister and looks at it under a microscope. A biopsy can show where the skin layers have separated.\n*   **Direct immunofluorescence.** A chemical is placed on the skin biopsy sample. Then it is tested for antibodies. The type of antibodies in your skin can show which type of blistering disorder you have.\n*   **Blood test.** Your doctor tests a sample of your blood for antibodies. This test can show how severe your condition is. It can also help the doctor see whether treatment is working.\n\n【30】Sometimes it’s hard to tell the difference between autoimmune blistering disorders and other conditions, including:\n\n【31】*   Genetic blistering disease, a group of disorders caused by changes in a gene needed for healthy skin\n*   Grover’s disease, a rare skin disorder that can cause small red lesions and blisters\n*   Other skin conditions that cause blisters, such as erythema multiforme or impetigo\n\n【32】Autoimmune Blistering Disorder Treatment\n----------------------------------------\n\n【33】Your doctor will decide on a treatment based on your symptoms. Medicines for these disorders lower the immune system response and prevent it from attacking your skin and mucous membranes. Treatments might include prescriptions from these classes of drugs:\n\n【34】*   **Corticosteroids**, such as prednisone (Deltasone, Prednicot, Rayos), that also ease inflammation\n*   **Immunosuppressive medicines**, such as azathioprine (Azasan, Imuran), cyclophosphamide, or mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept)\n*   **Biologic drugs,** such as rituximab (Rituxan), also used in some cancer treatments\n\n【35】For more serious cases, your treatments might include:\n\n【36】*   **Intravenous immunoglobulin G (****IVIG****).** This is a blood product you get through a needle into a vein. IVIG is an antibody found in plasma -- the liquid part of blood. It's taken from thousands of donors and pooled together. IVIG treatment gives you healthy antibodies to take over for the unhealthy ones that caused your disorder.\n*   **Plasmapheresis****.** This treatment removes the harmful antibodies from your blood. The part of blood that's removed is replaced with blood from a donor that contains healthy antibodies.\n\n【37】Blisters that pop open can get infected. These drugs help prevent an infection:\n\n【38】*   Antibiotics\n*   Antiviral drugs\n*   Antifungal drugs\n\n【39】Autoimmune Blistering Disorder Home Care\n----------------------------------------\n\n【40】To prevent infections and help you stay more comfortable, take care of your blisters. Keep them clean the way your doctor recommends. Try not to pop them. This can leave scars. If a blister is in an uncomfortable place such as your foot, your doctor can release the fluid with a clean needle. Also:\n\n【41】*   **Wash your sheets, towels, and clothes often.** Make sure everything that touches your skin is clean.\n*   **Care for your** **teeth****.** If you have blisters in your mouth, ask your dentist how to brush your teeth and gums without causing pain and more damage.\n\n【42】Each person with autoimmune blistering disorders is different. Some people have only mild blisters that go away on their own. Others have more severe skin problems that are harder to treat. Talk to your doctor about your situation. Try different treatments until you find one that works for you.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:37:42", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:38:15", "cost": 32.78}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:07", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:38:15", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:37:42"}

Your doctor may also call it PBC. It used to be called primary biliary cirrhosis.\n\n【1】These ducts have an important job. They carry a fluid called bile, which plays a key role in digestion, away from your liver. Bile is what helps your body absorb fats, cholesterol, and even some vitamins. It also helps get rid of worn-out red blood cells and other things your body doesn't need.\n\n【2】When bile ducts don’t work the way they should, those substances stay in your liver. The bile backs up, and your liver gets inflamed and maybe even scarred. Over time, the scar tissue replaces healthy liver tissue, and the organ doesn’t work the way it should.\n\n【3】This is usually a slow and gradual process. Your liver does OK for a while. And you’ll take medications to help it work better and manage your symptoms. But the disease can worsen over a few months or many years. One day, you may need a liver transplant.\n\n【4】What Causes It?\n---------------\n\n【5】Doctors aren't totally sure. It isn’t passed down from parents to children, but there does seem to be a family link. It’s more common if you have a parent, brother, or sister who has it. Most people who get it are women, and most are in their 40s and 50s.\n\n【6】The disease may be linked to immune system problems like thyroid trouble, pernicious anemia, or scleroderma. Things from outside your body -- smoking, chemicals, or infections -- can also trigger the disease.\n\n【7】What Are the Symptoms?\n----------------------\n\n【8】Early on, you might not notice any at all. You can live for many years without problems. Later, you might feel tired or have itchy skin or dry eyes and mouth.\n\n【9】As the disease gets worse, you might notice:\n\n【10】*   Yellow skin and eyes (jaundice)\n*   Swollen feet and ankles\n*   Pain and swelling in your abdomen\n*   Bone, muscle, or joint pain\n*   Darkened skin\n\n【11】How Is It Diagnosed?\n--------------------\n\n【12】If you have any of these symptoms, your doctor might suggest blood tests. They’ll tell them how well your liver works and if you have any immune system issues. They may also want you to have imaging tests like an ultrasound, CT scan, MRI, or endoscopy (ERCP). These provide a more detailed look at your liver and the area around it. They may also suggest a liver biopsy. They’ll remove a small piece of liver tissue and examine it in the lab to look for damage or disease.\n\n【13】How Is It Treated?\n------------------\n\n【14】There's no cure, but medications can slow down the disease. The most common drug is ursodiol (ursodeoxycholic acid), which helps move bile through your liver. Another drug, obeticholic acid (Ocaliva), can be used with ursodiol or alone to treat PBC. There are also newer drugs to treat symptoms like itching and fatigue.\n\n【15】Your doctor may suggest you make some changes in your daily life. If you drink alcohol, stop. It puts a strain on your liver. Choose low-sodium foods and exercise regularly to ease your symptoms.\n\n【16】When medications no longer help, a liver transplant may be an option.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:54:07", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:54:14", "cost": 6.564}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:07", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:54:14", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:54:07"}

However, studies have shown that a small number of people (especially people younger than 25) who take antidepressants for any condition may experience worsening depression , other mental/mood symptoms, or suicidal thoughts /attempts. It is very important to talk with the doctor about the risks and benefits of antidepressant medication (especially for people younger than 25), even if treatment is not for a mental/mood condition.\n\n【5】Tell the doctor right away if you notice worsening depression/other psychiatric conditions, unusual behavior changes (including possible suicidal thoughts /attempts), or other mental/mood changes (including new/worsening anxiety, panic attacks , trouble sleeping , irritability, hostile/angry feelings, impulsive actions, severe restlessness, very rapid speech).

After you have reached the best dose for you, the total dose can be taken once daily as directed by your doctor, usually at bedtime to prevent daytime drowsiness.\n\n【12】Follow your doctor's instructions carefully.

It helps to decrease the amount of HIV in your body so your immune system can work better. This lowers your chance of getting HIV complications (such as new infections, cancer ) and improves your quality of life. This product is a combination of two different drugs: darunavir and cobicistat. Darunavir belongs to a class of drugs known as protease inhibitors. Cobicistat is used to increase (\"boost\") the levels of darunavir.Darunavir/cobicistat is not a cure for HIV infection. To decrease your risk of spreading HIV disease to others, continue to take all HIV medications exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Use an effective barrier method (latex or polyurethane condoms /dental dams) during sexual activity as directed by your doctor. Do not share personal items (such as needles/syringes, toothbrushes , and razors) that may have contacted blood or other body fluids. Consult your doctor or pharmacist for more details.\n\n【2】### How to use Prezcobix\n\n【3】Read the Patient Information Leaflet if available from your pharmacist before you start taking darunavir /cobicistat and each time you get a refill.

Do not skip any doses.\n\n【6】For the best effect, take this medication at evenly spaced times. To help you remember, take this medication at the same time every day.\n\n【7】Do not take more or less of this drug than prescribed or stop taking it (or other HIV medicines) even for a short time unless directed to do so by your doctor. Doing so may cause the amount of virus to increase, make the infection more difficult to treat (resistant), or worsen side effects.\n\n【8】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【9】Diarrhea may occur. If this lasts or gets worse, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly.\n\n【10】Remember that this medication has been prescribed because your doctor has judged that the benefit to you is greater than the risk of side effects. Many people using this medication do not have serious side effects.\n\n【11】As your immune system gets stronger, it can begin to fight off infections you already had, possibly causing disease symptoms to come back. You could also have symptoms if your immune system becomes overactive. This reaction may happen at any time (soon after starting HIV treatment or many months later). Get medical help right away if you have any serious symptoms, including: unexplained weight loss , severe tiredness, muscle aches/ weakness that doesn't go away, headaches that are severe or don't go away, joint pain , numbness/tingling of the hands/feet/arms/legs, vision changes, signs of infection (such as fever, chills, swollen lymph nodes , trouble breathing , cough , non-healing skin sores), signs of an overactive thyroid (such as irritability, nervousness, heat intolerance, fast/pounding/irregular heartbeat, bulging eyes , unusual growth in the neck/ thyroid known as a goiter ), signs of a certain nerve problem known as Guillain \\-Barre syndrome (such as unsteadiness, loss of coordination, trouble swallowing/speaking/chewing, trouble moving your eyes ).\n\n【12】This medication may rarely make your blood sugar rise, which can cause or worsen diabetes . Tell your doctor right away if you have symptoms of high blood sugar such as increased thirst/urination. If you already have diabetes, check your blood sugar regularly as directed and share the results with your doctor. Your doctor may need to adjust your diabetes medication, exercise program , or diet.\n\n【13】Darunavir /cobicistat may rarely cause serious (possibly fatal) liver disease . Get medical help right away if you have any symptoms of liver damage, including: nausea / vomiting that doesn't stop, loss of appetite, stomach / abdominal pain , yellowing eyes / skin , dark urine .\n\n【14】Get medical help right away if you have any very serious side effects, including: symptoms of a heart attack (such as chest/jaw/left arm pain, shortness of breath, unusual sweating ), easy bruising/bleeding.\n\n【15】Changes in body fat may occur while you are taking this medication (such as increased fat in the upper back and stomach areas, decreased fat in the arms and legs). The cause and long-term effects of these changes are unknown. Discuss the risks and benefits of treatment with your doctor, as well as the possible use of exercise to reduce this side effect.\n\n【16】This medication can commonly cause a rash that is usually not serious. However, you may not be able to tell it apart from a rare rash that could be a sign of a severe reaction.

{"id": 2252581, "user_id": "65e7dd68e6dc6a3a8618a668", "user_name": "王磊", "task_id": 1612, "source_info": {"seq_id": "c0249d42-4749-4638-9846-bca1f5b8bcde", "title": "Angina (Ischemic Chest Pain)", "text": "【0】Angina (Ischemic Chest Pain)\nWhat Is Angina?\n---------------\n\n【1】Angina is chest pain that happens because there isn't enough blood going to part of your heart. It can feel like a heart attack, with pressure or squeezing in your chest. It’s sometimes called angina pectoris or ischemic chest pain.\n\n【2】It's a symptom of heart disease, and it happens when something blocks your arteries or there's not enough blood flow in the arteries that bring oxygen-rich blood to your heart.\n\n【3】Angina usually goes away quickly. Still, it can be a sign of a life-threatening heart problem. It's important to find out what's going on and what you can do to avoid a heart attack.\n\n【4】Usually, medicine and lifestyle changes can control angina. If it's more severe, you may need surgery, too. Or you may need what’s called a stent, a tiny tube that props open arteries.\n\n【5】There are different types of angina:\n\n【6】**Stable angina.** This is the most common. Physical activity or stress can trigger it. It usually lasts a few minutes, and it goes away when you rest. It isn't a heart attack, but it can be a sign that you're more likely to have one. Tell your doctor if this happens to you.\n\n【7】**Unstable angina.** You can have this while you're at rest or not very active. The pain can be strong and long-lasting, and it may come back again and again. It can be a signal that you're about to have a heart attack, so see a doctor right away.\n\n【8】**Microvascular angina.** With this type, you have chest pain but no coronary artery blockage. Instead, it happens because your smallest coronary arteries aren’t working the way they should, so your heart doesn’t get the blood it needs. The chest pain usually lasts more than 10 minutes. This type is more common in women.\n\n【9】**Prinzmetal's angina (variant angina).** This type is rare. It might happen at night while you're sleeping or resting. Your heart arteries suddenly tighten or narrow. It can cause a lot of pain, and you should get it treated.\n\n【10】Angina Symptoms\n---------------\n\n【11】Chest pain is the symptom, but it affects people differently. You may have:\n\n【12】*   Aching\n*   Burning\n*   Discomfort\n*   Dizziness\n*   Fatigue\n*   Feeling of fullness in your chest\n*   Feeling of heaviness or pressure\n*   Upset stomach or vomiting\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Squeezing\n*   Sweating\n\n【13】You might mistake an aching or burning for heartburn or gas.\n\n【14】You’re likely to have pain behind your breastbone, which can spread to your shoulders, arms, neck, throat, jaw, or back.\n\n【15】Stable angina often gets better with rest. Unstable angina may not, and it could get worse. It’s an emergency that needs medical help right away.\n\n【16】Angina in Women vs. Men\n-----------------------\n\n【17】Men often feel pain in their chest, neck, and shoulders. Women may feel discomfort in their belly, neck, jaw, throat, or back. You may also have shortness of breath, sweating, or dizziness.\n\n【18】One study found that women were more likely to use the words \"pressing\" or \"crushing\" to describe the feeling.\n\n【19】Angina Causes\n-------------\n\n【20】Angina usually happens because of heart disease. A fatty substance called plaque builds up in your arteries, blocking blood flow to your heart muscle. This forces your heart to work with less oxygen. That causes pain. You may also have blood clots in the arteries of your heart, which can cause heart attacks.\n\n【21】Less common causes of chest pain include:\n\n【22】*   A blockage in a major artery of your lungs (pulmonary embolism)\n*   An enlarged or thickened heart (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy)\n*   Narrowing of a valve in the main part of your heart (aortic stenosis)\n*   Swelling of the sac around your heart (pericarditis)\n*   Tearing in the wall of your aorta, the largest artery in your body (aortic dissection)\n\n【23】Angina Risk Factors\n-------------------\n\n【24】Some things about you or your lifestyle could put you at higher risk of angina, including:\n\n【25】*   Older age\n*   Family history of heart disease\n*   High blood pressure\n*   High cholesterol\n*   Diabetes\n*   Obesity\n*   Stress\n*   Using tobacco\n*   Not getting enough exercise\n\n【26】Angina Diagnosis\n----------------\n\n【27】Your doctor will do a physical exam and ask about your symptoms, risk factors, and family history. They might need to do tests including:\n\n【28】*   **EKG.** This test measures your heart’s electrical activity and rhythm.\n*   **Stress test.** This checks how your heart is working while you exercise.\n*   **Blood tests.** Your doctor will check for proteins called troponins. Lots of them are released when your heart muscle is damaged, as in a heart attack. Your doctor may also do more general tests like a metabolic panel or complete blood count (CBC).\n*   **Imaging tests.** Chest X-rays can rule out other things that might be causing your chest pain, like lung conditions. Echocardiograms and CT and MRI scans can create images of your heart to help your doctor spot problems.\n*   **Cardiac catheterization.** Your doctor inserts a long, thin tube into an artery in your leg and threads it up to your heart to check your blood flow and pressure.\n*   **Coronary angiography.** Your doctor injects dye into the blood vessels of your heart. The dye shows up on an X-ray, creating an image of your blood vessels. They may do this procedure during cardiac catheterization.\n\n【29】**Angina questions for your doctor**\n\n【30】*   Do I need any more tests?\n*   What type of angina do I have?\n*   Do I have heart damage?\n*   What treatment do you recommend?\n*   How will it make me feel?\n*   What can I do to try to prevent a heart attack?\n*   Are there activities I shouldn't do?\n*   Will changing my diet help?\n\n【31】Angina Treatment\n----------------\n\n【32】Your treatment depends on how much damage there is to your heart. For people with mild angina, medicine and lifestyle changes can often help their blood flow better and control their symptoms.\n\n【33】**Medicines**\n\n【34】Your doctor might prescribe medicines including:\n\n【35】*   Nitrates or calcium channel blockers to relax and widen blood vessels, letting more blood flow to your heart\n*   Beta-blockers to slow your heart down so it doesn't have to work as hard\n*   Blood thinners or antiplatelet medications to prevent blood clots\n*   Statins to lower your cholesterol levels and stabilize plaque\n\n【36】**Cardiac procedures**\n\n【37】If meds aren't enough, you may need to have blocked arteries opened with a medical procedure or surgery. This could be:\n\n【38】**Angioplasty/stenting.** The doctor threads a tiny tube, with a balloon inside, through a blood vessel and up to your heart. Then, they inflate the balloon inside the narrowed artery to widen it and restore blood flow. They may insert a small tube called a stent inside your artery to help keep it open. The stent is permanent and usually made of metal. It can also be made of a material that your body absorbs over time. Some stents also have medicine that helps keep your artery from getting blocked again.\n\n【39】The procedure usually takes less than 2 hours. You’ll probably stay overnight at the hospital.\n\n【40】**Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), or bypass surgery.** Your surgeon takes healthy arteries or veins from another part of your body and uses them to go around the blocked or narrowed blood vessels.\n\n【41】You can expect to stay in the hospital about a week after you have this. You'll be in the intensive care unit for a day or two while nurses and doctors keep a close eye on your heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels. You'll then move to a regular room to recover.\n\n【42】**Enhanced external counterpulsation**\n\n【43】Enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) may be an option to relieve your angina. Your doctor may recommend it if other treatments haven’t worked or aren’t right for you.\n\n【44】EECP uses several blood pressure cuffs on both legs to gently, but firmly, compress the blood vessels there to boost blood flow to your heart. Each wave is timed to your heartbeat. So more blood goes there when it’s relaxing.\n\n【45】When your heart pumps again, pressure is released right away. This lets blood be pumped more easily. It can help your blood vessels make a natural bypass around narrowed or blocked arteries that cause your chest pain. It may help some small blood vessels in your heart open. They may give more blood flow to your heart muscle to help ease your chest pain.\n\n【46】You might have EECP if you:\n\n【47】*   Have chronic stable chest pain\n*   Aren’t helped by nitrates, calcium channel blockers, and beta-blockers\n*   Invasive procedures like bypass surgery, angioplasty, or stenting aren’t right for you.\n\n【48】EECP isn’t invasive. If you’re accepted for EECP treatment, you’ll have 35 hours of therapy. It’s given 1 to 2 hours a day, 5 days a week, for 7 weeks. Studies have shown its benefits include less need for anti-anginal medicine, fewer symptoms, and the ability to be more active without symptoms\n\n【49】**Lifestyle changes**\n\n【50】You can still be active, but it's important to listen to your body. If you feel pain, stop what you’re doing and rest. Know what triggers your angina, like stress or intense exercise. Try to avoid things that tend to set it off. For example, if large meals cause problems, eat smaller ones and eat more often. If you still feel pain, talk to your doctor about having more tests or changing your medications. Because angina can be a sign of something dangerous, it’s important to get checked out.\n\n【51】These lifestyle tips may help protect your heart:\n\n【52】**If you smoke, stop.** It can damage your blood vessels and increase your heart disease risk.\n\n【53】**Eat a heart-healthy diet** to lower your blood pressure and cholesterol levels. When those are out of normal range, your chance for heart disease can rise. Eat mainly fruits and vegetables, whole grains, fish, lean meat, and fat-free or low-fat dairy. Limit salt, fat, and sugar.\n\n【54】**Use stress-relieving measures** like meditation, deep breathing, or yoga to relax.\n\n【55】**Exercise** most days of the week.\n\n【56】**See your doctor regularly.**\n\n【57】If you have chest pain that is new or unusual for you, and you think you may be having a heart attack, call 911 right away. Quick treatment is very important. It can protect you from more damage.\n\n【58】Angina Outlook\n--------------\n\n【59】Angina raises your risk of having a heart attack. But it’s treatable. Consider it a warning sign and make healthy choices.\n\n【60】Talk with others who have it. That may help you learn how to feel better.\n\n【61】Your family, too, may need support to help them understand your angina. They'll want to know what they can do to help.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:46:25", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:46:50", "cost": 25.342}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:06", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:46:50", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:46:22"}

Before using haloperidol, report all medications you are currently using to your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【45】Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking other products that cause drowsiness such as opioid pain or cough relievers (such as codeine, hydrocodone ), alcohol, marijuana ( cannabis ), drugs for sleep or anxiety (such as alprazolam , lorazepam , zolpidem), muscle relaxants (such as carisoprodol , cyclobenzaprine ), or antihistamines (such as cetirizine , diphenhydramine ).\n\n【46】Check the labels on all your medicines (such as allergy or cough \\-and-cold products) because they may contain ingredients that cause drowsiness.

It is a condition that can be hard to cope with. But you can adopt some strategies to make it easier.\n\n【1】You may go through bad phases, or relapses, followed by better ones (remission). Knowing to expect this pattern will help you understand how to manage your energy.\n\n【2】Daily Activities\n----------------\n\n【3】When you’re in a relapse, it might be hard to get through even simple morning routines, like a shower. Plan to allow extra time for tasks that are hard for you.\n\n【4】When you feel well again, you may want to try to do as much as you can while you’ve got the energy. Don’t try it. If you push yourself too hard, you may crash later. Repeating this cycle can drive you right back into a relapse.\n\n【5】You’ll need to learn to balance daily activities with rest, even when you’re in remission.\n\n【6】Exercise\n--------\n\n【7】While staying fit is an important part of your overall health, exercise can be a tricky issue for those with ME/CFS.\n\n【8】Individualized programs are needed because any exercise can and does lead to exhaustion. Work with your doctor or a physical therapist to establish your personal limits for physical and mental activity and then you can learn to pace yourself and balance your rest with your activity. Staying within this “energy envelope” can help you avoid post-exertional malaise (or PEM).\n\n【9】A physical therapist can modify your exercise plan. Do not overdo it. Pacing is important.\n\n【10】Nutrition\n---------\n\n【11】Watching what you eat can help you manage your symptoms. Avoid any foods or chemicals you are sensitive to.\n\n【12】A diet rich in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats, avoiding saturated fats and refined carbohydrates—like the Mediterranean Diet—is reported by many people with ME/CFS to be helpful. Eat several small meals throughout the day. For example, three meals and three snacks might help keep energy levels up.\n\n【13】Smaller meals might also help control nausea, which sometimes happens with chronic fatigue syndrome. To help control energy levels, it may also be a good idea to avoid these things:\n\n【14】*   Sugar\n*   Sweeteners\n*   Alcohol\n*   Caffeine\n\n【15】Help Your Memory\n----------------\n\n【16】Some people with ME/CFS have memory loss. Use a day-planner (a paper one or a smart phone app) to keep up with your schedule and remember the things you need to do.\n\n【17】Set reminders on your smartphone when it’s time to go somewhere or do something. Keep lists. Use “sticky notes.”\n\n【18】Puzzles, word games, and card games – also available on your smartphone – can keep your mind active and might help your memory improve.\n\n【19】Work\n----\n\n【20】About half of those with ME/CFS work. If you have problems, you might qualify for coverage under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). This law requires some employers to provide “reasonable accommodations” to help people with disabilities do their jobs.\n\n【21】You might need a flexible schedule, a place to rest at work, and written job instructions for people with memory problems. The accommodations depend on your job, your symptoms, and how they affect your ability to do your job.\n\n【22】If you can’t work because of your condition, you might qualify for disability benefits from either a private insurance policy or from Social Security.\n\n【23】Relationships\n-------------\n\n【24】It can be hard for co-workers, friends, family, and loved ones to understand ME/CFS. They might not realize how much it affects your daily life. Or they might not believe that it’s real. Friends and co-workers of people with ME/CFS need to get educated about the condition.\n\n【25】Chronic fatigue can take a toll on your personal relationships, too. Loss of energy, pain, and potential side effects of medications can keep you from enjoying an active social life, playing with your kids, or having a healthy sex life.\n\n【26】Get Help\n--------\n\n【27】You may find you feel better when you talk to other people with your condition. Your doctor can give you information about support groups in your area.\n\n【28】About half of those with ME/CFS develop depression at some point. Some symptoms of depression are similar to your condition, so it can be hard to tell the difference. “Red flags” for depression could include feelings of hopelessness, sadness, guilt or worthlessness, or thoughts of suicide and death.\n\n【29】If you think you are depressed, tell your doctor. Medications and talk therapy for depression can help with physical and emotional symptoms. If you have thoughts of suicide, call the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988 or go to the emergency room.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:39:00", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:39:08", "cost": 8.779}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:06", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:39:08", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:38:59"}

Proper control of diabetes may also lessen your risk of a heart attack or stroke . Dapagliflozin works by increasing the removal of sugar by your kidneys . Saxagliptin works by increasing levels of natural substances called incretins. Incretins help to control blood sugar by increasing insulin release, especially after a meal. They also decrease the amount of sugar your liver makes.\n\n【2】### How to use Qtern\n\n【3】Read the Medication Guide provided by your pharmacist before you start taking this medication and each time you get a refill.

The hepatitis A virus, present in the stool of infected people, spreads through:\n\n【1】*   Close personal contact, such as household or sexual contact, with an infected person\n*   Contaminated water or ice\n*   Contaminated raw shellfish, fruits, vegetables, or other uncooked foods\n\n【2】If you get hepatitis A as an adult, you are more likely to have signs and symptoms than young children who are infected. Symptoms may last less than two months and include:\n\n【3】*   Flu-like illness, including fever and fatigue\n*   Yellowing of skin or eyes (jaundice)\n*   Dark urine\n*   Severe stomachache, diarrhea, or nausea\n\n【4】Which adults should receive the hepatitis A vaccine?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】The CDC recommends that adults have the hepatitis A vaccine (HAV) if you:\n\n【6】*   Are traveling to or working in countries where hepatitis A is common (such as countries in Central or South America, Mexico, many Asian countries, Africa, and Eastern Europe); this disease is much more common than cholera or typhoid among international travelers.\n*   Will have close contact with an international adoptee from a country where hepatitis A is common\n*   Are a man who has sex with men\n*   Use street drugs\n*   Have experienced homelessness\n*   Have chronic liver disease\n*   You are pregnant because it may affect the outcome of your pregnancy\n*   Work with primates infected with hepatitis A or with the virus in a research lab\n\n【7】Also, if you work with food, you should consider getting the hepatitis A vaccine.\n\n【8】Are there any adults who should not get the vaccine?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】Do not get the hepatitis vaccine if you:\n\n【10】*   Have ever had a severe allergic reaction to a hepatitis A vaccine or to any vaccine component; hepatitis A vaccines contain alum and some contain 2-phenoxyethanol.\n*   Are ill, unless it is a mild illness\n*   Are pregnant, unless you are at greater risk for contracting hepatitis A (you are traveling to places with a higher prevalence of the disease, you engage in risky behaviors, have chronic liver disease, or you are exposed during a hep A outbreak) \n\n【11】How and when should you receive the hepatitis A vaccine?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n【12】You receive the injection of the hepatitis A vaccine in the muscle of your upper arm. Start the vaccine series when you are at risk of infection and at least one month before traveling. You need two doses six to twelve months apart.\n\n【13】There are also combination vaccines for adults that protect against both hepatitis A and hepatitis B. However, these have a different dosing schedule. Ask your doctor for details.

But in very rare cases, people can have a severe allergic reaction to the hepatitis A vaccine. This occurs within a few minutes to hours of getting the shot. In extremely rare cases, this reaction can be fatal. It's important to remember that the risks from the disease are much greater than the risk from the vaccine itself.\n\n【16】Signs of a severe reaction to the hepatitis A vaccination include:\n\n【17】*   High fever\n*   Behavior changes\n*   Trouble breathing\n*   Hoarseness or wheezing\n*   Hives\n*   Paleness\n*   Weakness\n*   Fast heartbeat\n*   Dizziness\n\n【18】Other minor reactions to the hepatitis A vaccine that may last one to two days may include:\n\n【19】*   Soreness at the site of injection\n*   Headache\n*   Fatigue\n\n【20】If you have any signs of a severe reaction:\n\n【21】*   Call the doctor or get to a doctor right away\n*   Describe when you had the vaccine and what occurred\n*   Have a health care professional report the reaction", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 11:06:11", "endTime": "2024/08/21 11:06:17", "cost": 5.78}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:06", "update_time": "2024-08-20 19:06:17", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 19:06:11"}

This product is used with other HIV medications to help control HIV infection. It helps to decrease the amount of HIV in your body so your immune system can work better. This lowers your chance of getting HIV complications (such as new infections, cancer ) and improves your quality of life. Both lopinavir and ritonavir belong to a class of drugs known as HIV protease inhibitors. Ritonavir increases (\"boosts\") the levels of lopinavir. This helps lopinavir work better.Lopinavir/ritonavir is not a cure for HIV infection. To decrease your risk of spreading HIV disease to others, continue to take all HIV medications exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Use an effective barrier method (latex or polyurethane condoms /dental dams) during sexual activity as directed by your doctor. Do not share personal items (such as needles/syringes, toothbrushes , and razors) that may have contacted blood or other body fluids. Consult your doctor or pharmacist for more details.\n\n【2】### How to use Kaletra oral\n\n【3】Read the Medication Guide and, if available, the Patient Information Leaflet provided by your pharmacist before you start taking lopinavir/ ritonavir and each time you get a refill.

Be sure to tell your doctor and pharmacist about all the products you use (including prescription drugs , nonprescription drugs, and herbal products).\n\n【6】For children, the dosage is also based on age, weight , and height. Once-daily dosing of this medication is not recommended for children younger than 18 years of age.\n\n【7】If you are taking didanosine in addition to this product, you can take it at the same time as this product, but take them both without food.\n\n【8】It is very important to continue taking this medication (and other HIV medications) exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Do not skip any doses.\n\n【9】For the best effect, take this medication at evenly spaced times. To help you remember, take this medication at the same time(s) every day.\n\n【10】Do not take more or less of this drug than prescribed or stop taking it (or other HIV medicines) even for a short time unless directed to do so by your doctor. Doing so may cause the amount of virus to increase, make the infection more difficult to treat (resistant), or worsen side effects.\n\n【11】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【12】Diarrhea , nausea , vomiting , stomach upset, gas, headache , and trouble sleeping may occur. If any of these effects last or get worse, tell your doctor or pharmacist promptly.\n\n【13】Remember that this medication has been prescribed because your doctor has judged that the benefit to you is greater than the risk of side effects. Many people using this medication do not have serious side effects.\n\n【14】As your immune system gets stronger, it can begin to fight off infections you already had, possibly causing disease symptoms to come back. You could also have symptoms if your immune system becomes overactive. This reaction may happen at any time (soon after starting HIV treatment or many months later). Get medical help right away if you have any serious symptoms, including: unexplained weight loss , severe tiredness, muscle aches/ weakness that doesn't go away, headaches that are severe or don't go away, joint pain , numbness/tingling of the hands/feet/arms/legs, vision changes, signs of infection (such as fever, chills, swollen lymph nodes , trouble breathing , cough , non-healing skin sores), signs of an overactive thyroid (such as irritability, nervousness, heat intolerance, fast/pounding/irregular heartbeat, bulging eyes , unusual growth in the neck/ thyroid known as a goiter ), signs of a certain nerve problem known as Guillain \\-Barre syndrome (such as unsteadiness, loss of coordination, trouble swallowing/speaking/chewing, trouble moving your eyes ).\n\n【15】Tell your doctor right away if you have any serious side effects, including: nausea/vomiting that doesn't stop, increased thirst, increased urination, confusion, stomach / abdominal pain , yellowing eyes / skin , dark urine .\n\n【16】Get medical help right away if you have any very serious side effects, including: symptoms of a heart attack (such as chest/jaw/left arm pain, shortness of breath, unusual sweating ), severe dizziness , fainting , slow/fast/irregular heartbeat.\n\n【17】Changes in body fat may occur while you are taking this medication (such as increased fat in the upper back and stomach areas, decreased fat in the arms and legs).

People who have it find it difficult or impossible to make certain motor movements, even though their muscles are normal. Milder forms of apraxia are known as dyspraxia.\n\n【2】Apraxia can occur in a number of different forms. One form is orofacial apraxia. People with orofacial apraxia are unable to voluntarily perform certain movements involving facial muscles. For instance, they may not be able to lick their lips or wink. Another form of apraxia affects a person's ability to intentionally move arms and legs.\n\n【3】With apraxia of speech a person finds it difficult or impossible to move their mouth and tongue to speak. This happens, even though the person has the desire to speak and the mouth and tongue muscles are physically able to form words.\n\n【4】Are There Different Types of Apraxia of Speech?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【5】There are two forms of apraxia of speech -- acquired apraxia and childhood apraxia of speech. Acquired apraxia can occur in people of all ages. Typically, though, it is found in adults. This condition causes people to lose the speech-making abilities they once possessed.\n\n【6】Childhood apraxia of speech is a motor speech disorder. This condition is present from birth, and it affects a child's ability to form sounds and words. Children with speech apraxia often have far greater abilities to understand speech than to express themselves with spoken words.\n\n【7】The majority of children with childhood apraxia of speech will experience significant improvement, if not complete recovery, with the correct treatment.\n\n【8】What Is the Difference Between Apraxia of Speech and Aphasia?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】Apraxia is sometimes confused with aphasia, another communication disorder. That confusion can be complicated by the fact that the two conditions can occur together.\n\n【10】People with apraxia and aphasia might both have difficulty expressing themselves with words. There are, though, distinct differences between the two. Aphasia describes a problem in a person's ability to understand or use words in and of themselves. This may make it hard for someone with the condition to speak, read, or write. But apraxia does not describe a problem with language comprehension. Apraxia refers to the difficulty someone has initiating and performing the movements needed to make speech. This difficulty arises despite the fact that there is no weakness in the necessary muscles.\n\n【11】What Are the Symptoms of Apraxia of Speech?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【12】There are a variety of speech-related symptoms that can be associated with apraxia, including:\n\n【13】*   Difficulty stringing syllables together in the appropriate order to make words, or inability to do so\n*   Minimal babbling during infancy\n*   Difficulty saying long or complex words\n*   Repeated attempts at pronunciation of words\n*   Speech inconsistencies, such as being able to say a sound or word properly at certain times but not others\n*   Incorrect inflections or stresses on certain sounds or words\n*   Excessive use of nonverbal forms of communication\n*   Distorting of vowel sounds\n*   Omitting consonants at the beginnings and ends of words\n*   Seeming to grope or struggle to make words\n\n【14】Childhood apraxia of speech rarely occurs alone. It is often accompanied by other language or cognitive deficits, which may cause:\n\n【15】*   Limited vocabulary\n*   Grammatical problems\n*   Problems with coordination and fine motor skills\n*   Difficulties chewing and swallowing\n*   Clumsiness\n\n【16】What Causes Apraxia of Speech?\n------------------------------\n\n【17】Acquired apraxia results from brain damage to those areas of the brain that control the ability to speak. Conditions that may produce acquired apraxia include head trauma, stroke, or a brain tumor.\n\n【18】Experts do not yet understand what causes childhood apraxia of speech. Some scientists believe that it results from signaling problems between the brain and the muscles used for speaking.\n\n【19】Ongoing research is focusing on whether brain abnormalities that cause apraxia of speech can be identified. Other research is looking for genetic causes of apraxia. Some studies are trying to determine exactly which parts of the brain are linked to the condition.\n\n【20】Are There Tests to Diagnose Apraxia of Speech?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【21】There is not a single test or procedure that is used to diagnose childhood apraxia of speech. Diagnosis is complicated by the fact that speech-language pathologists have different opinions about which symptoms indicate the condition.\n\n【22】Most experts, though, look for the presence of multiple, common apraxia symptoms. They may assess a patient's ability to repeat a word multiple times. Or they may assess whether a person can recite a list of words that are increasingly more difficult, such as \"play, playful, playfully.\"\n\n【23】A speech-language pathologist may interact with a child to assess which sounds, syllables, and words the child is able to make and understand. The pathologist will also examine the child's mouth, tongue, and face for any structural problems that might be causing apraxia symptoms.\n\n【24】When diagnosing apraxia, experts may look for the presence of other symptoms. For instance, they may look for weakness or difficulties with language comprehension. Both of these are indicative of other conditions and their presence would help rule out apraxia. For people with possible acquired apraxia, an MRI of the brain may be useful to determine the extent and location of any brain damage.\n\n【25】Typically, a diagnosis of childhood apraxia of speech cannot be made before a child's second birthday. Before this time, most children are unable to understand or perform the tasks needed to determine the presence of apraxia.\n\n【26】Are There Treatments for Apraxia of Speech?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【27】In some cases of acquired apraxia, the condition resolves spontaneously. This is not the case with childhood apraxia of speech, which does not go away without treatment.\n\n【28】There are various treatment approaches used for apraxia. How effective they are can vary from person to person. For the best results, apraxia treatment must be developed to meet a given individual's needs. Most children with apraxia of speech benefit from meeting one on one with a speech-language pathologist three to five times a week. They may also need to work with their parents or guardians to practice the skills they are developing.\n\n【29】Therapy for childhood apraxia of speech aims to improve speech coordination. Exercises may include:\n\n【30】*   Repeatedly practicing the formation and pronunciation of sounds and words\n*   Practicing stringing together sounds to make speech\n*   Working with rhythms or melodies\n*   Using multisensory approaches, such as watching in a mirror while trying to form words or touching the face while talking\n\n【31】Many therapists believe that sign language is beneficial for children who have difficulty being understood. They often recommend that children attempt to say the words they are signing to practice making the necessary movements with their mouths.\n\n【32】People with more extreme cases of acquired apraxia may also benefit from sign language. Or they may use assistive electronic devices, including computers that can be used to produce words and sentences.\n\n【33】Very few studies have been done to determine the relative effectiveness of various treatment approaches for childhood apraxia of speech. This may be due, in part, to ongoing debate among experts as to which symptoms and characteristics merit a diagnosis of apraxia.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:06:39", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:06:49", "cost": 9.34}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:06", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:06:49", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:06:39"}

Experts say it's the top reason people see a doctor -- more than 30 million visits a year.\n\n【1】Your first step toward relief is to find out the cause. Then consider your symptoms. With that info, you can choose the best treatment.\n\n【2】What Causes It?\n---------------\n\n【3】A cough is supposed to protect you. It gets out stuff that doesn't belong in your lungs and windpipe, like inhaled dirt or food. Here are the common triggers.\n\n【4】*   **Viruses.** Colds and the flu are the most common causes. While annoying, coughs that are “productive” get germy mucus out of your lungs when you're sick. Most will go away in a few days. After a cold, though, some \"dry\" coughs last weeks. That could be because coughing irritates your lungs, which leads to more coughing, which irritates your lungs, and so on.\n*   **Allergies and asthma****.** If you have them, inhaling a trigger like mold can cause your lungs to overreact. They're trying to cough out what’s bothering them. \n*   **Irritants.** Even if you're not allergic, things like cold air, cigarette smoke, or strong perfumes can set off a hacking spell.\n*   **Postnasal drip.** When you're congested, mucus drips down from your nose into your throat and makes you cough. You can get postnasal drip from colds, flu, sinus infections, allergies, and other problems.\n*   **Acid reflux.** When you have heartburn, stomach acids back up into your throat, especially at night. They can irritate your windpipe, vocal cords, and throat and make you cough.\n*   **COPD.** This includes one or more of three separate serious conditions: Emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and chronic obstructive asthma. These illnesses weaken the tubes in your airway (bronchial tubes) and the tiny sacs (alveoli) that pass oxygen into your blood and remove carbon dioxide. Cigarette smoking is the most common cause of COPD.\n*   **Other causes.** Many other problems -- lung inflammation, sleep apnea, and drug side effects -- can be triggers. Get coughs that won't go away checked out to make sure you don’t have a separate problem.\n\n【5】What Can You Do to Treat It?\n----------------------------\n\n【6】That depends on the cause. Options include:\n\n【7】*   **Medicines.** Over-the-counter cough remedies can help in a number of ways. Suppressants lessen your urge to cough. Expectorants thin mucus and make it easier to hack up.\n*   **Home remedies.** You can drink warm fluids, inhale warm, moist air, and use cough drops. Add a spoonful of honey to hot tea, or choose a cough drop that has it. Never give honey to a child under a year old -- it can make them very sick.\n*   **Avoid triggers.** If you have allergies or asthma, remove allergens from your home. Keep pets out of your bedroom. Use air conditioners to filter air during pollen season. You won’t see the effects right away, but if you stay away from what bothers you, you'll start to feel better.\n*   **Treatment for another problem.** Coughs triggered by asthma, acid reflux, COPD, and other medical conditions need special treatment -- often medicine. Talk to your doctor.\n*   **Time.** Common viruses are the most likely causes. Sometimes, the cough can last weeks or months after the virus is gone. Over time your airways will heal and the cough will stop.\n\n【8】When to See a Doctor\n--------------------\n\n【9】Most lingering coughs are harmless. But you can't figure out the causes on your own. If your cough isn't getting better after 1 week, it's time to call your doctor.\n\n【10】See them as soon as you can if your cough interferes with your daily life and ability to work, or if it comes with any of these other symptoms:\n\n【11】*   Trouble breathing\n*   Chest pain\n*   Ongoing heartburn\n*   Coughing up blood\n*   Fever or night sweats\n*   Trouble sleeping", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:44:14", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:44:18", "cost": 4.152}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:06", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:44:18", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:43:57"}

Generally, a male condom plus another form of birth control is the most effective way to prevent pregnancy.\n\n【2】What's \"best\" among birth control methods differs from person to person. What's right for you may not be right for everyone. And your needs may change over time.\n\n【3】Here’s what to think about when choosing a kind of birth control:\n\n【4】*   How fail-proof do you need your protection plan to be?\n*   How much does the cost matter?\n*   How important is your privacy?\n*   Do you need to protect against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)?\n*   How much effort do you want to make to prevent a pregnancy?\n*   If you're a woman, does it matter if your period is affected?\n*   Will you someday want to have a child?\n\n【5】How Birth Control Works\n-----------------------\n\n【6】You can compare facts about birth control methods in the sections below, including the basic ways they work. The types of methods are:\n\n【7】*   **Behavior.** This is something you and your partner decide to do to avoid pregnancy. For example, you could bar sexual intercourse altogether (abstinence), or avoid it at points in a woman’s cycle when she is likely to get pregnant (fertility awareness), or remove the penis from the vagina before ejaculation (withdrawal).\n*   **Barrier.** This type goes on or in your body before you have sex to block sperm from getting to the egg.\n*   **Hormonal.** This type changes a woman's body chemistry. (Depending on the hormones, it stops ovaries from releasing eggs, thickens the mucus around your cervix to keep sperm from reaching the egg, or thins the lining of the uterus.)\n*   **Medical.** This is a procedure that changes your body to prevent sperm and egg from coming together.\n\n【8】Birth Control Effectiveness\n---------------------------\n\n【9】When doctors talk about how effective a birth control method is, there are different rates when it's used \"ideally\" (exactly the way it was designed) or “typically” (by the average person in real life). “Typical\" use takes into account that people can't or don't always use birth control correctly or consistently.\n\n【10】Keep in mind that out of every 100 women who don't use _any_ birth control, about 85 will get pregnant within a year.\n\n【11】Birth Control Methods\n---------------------\n\n【12】The various kinds of birth control, from most effective to least effective, are:\n\n【13】**Abstinence**\n\n【14】**Type:** Behavior\n\n【15】**How it works:** Some people consider abstinence to mean zero sexual contact (complete abstinence). Others say it's when the penis does not have contact with the vagina (contraceptive abstinence).\n\n【16】**Number of pregnancies per 100 women:**\n\n【17】*   Ideal use = 0\n*   Typical use = unknown\n\n【18】**How long it lasts:** As long as you abstain\n\n【19】**STD protection?** Yes, when you practice complete abstinence; no, if you practice only contraceptive abstinence.\n\n【20】**Need to see a doctor?** No\n\n【21】**Pros:** Highly effective when used correctly. No side effects. No cost.\n\n【22】**Cons:** Giving up sex for a long time may be very hard. You might also have trouble saying \"no\" or \"stop\" while you're enjoying other sex play.\n\n【23】**Sterilization surgery for women**\n\n【24】**Type:** Medical\n\n【25】**How it works:** A doctor blocks, ties, clamps, seals, or cuts the two fallopian tubes that connect a woman’s ovaries and uterus. It’s also known as a tubal ligation or \"getting your tubes tied.\" Or they may completely remove the tubes (called a salpingectomy).\n\n【26】**Pregnancies per 100 women:**\n\n【27】*   Ideal use = less than 1 (0 with a salpingectomy)\n*   Typical use = less than 1\n\n【28】**How long it lasts:** Permanent\n\n【29】**STD protection?** No\n\n【30】**Need to see a doctor?** Yes\n\n【31】**Pros:** It’s a one-time procedure.\n\n【32】**Cons:** You'll have to go to the hospital, and you'll need general anesthesia for the surgery. Risks of pain, bleeding, infection, and ectopic pregnancy afterward. Not meant to be reversed.\n\n【33】**Sterilization surgery for men**\n\n【34】**Type:** Medical\n\n【35】**How it works:** The tubes from the testes to other glands are blocked so the semen no longer has sperm.\n\n【36】**Pregnancies per 100 women:**\n\n【37】*   Ideal use = less than 1\n*   Typical use = less than 1\n\n【38】**How long it lasts:** Ongoing\n\n【39】**STD protection?** No\n\n【40】**Need to see a doctor?** Yes\n\n【41】**Pros:** One-time procedure.

Most people die within a year of getting it.\n\n【3】The disease destroys brain cells. Seen through a microscope, it makes the brain look like a sponge.\n\n【4】Classic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is not the same as “mad cow disease,\" which only happens in cattle. It's also not linked to \"variant\" CJD, which comes from products made from cattle that had mad cow disease.\n\n【5】Causes\n------\n\n【6】There are three types of classic CJD. Each has a different cause:\n\n【7】**Sporadic:** This is the most common type. It's caused by harmful proteins in the body called prions. Prion proteins are a normal part of your body. But sometimes they can fold the wrong way as they form. This “misfolded” prion infects the brain and destroys brain cells. Scientists don’t know why this happens.\n\n【8】**Familial:** This happens in people who inherit a bad gene from a parent. Only 10% to 15% of CJD cases each year are familial.\n\n【9】**Acquired:** The rarest form, It happens when someone comes into contact with a medical instrument (like a scalpel), organ (by transplantation), or growth hormone that’s infected with CJD. It makes up less than 1% of classic CJD cases.\n\n【10】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【11】The symptoms start and worsen very quickly. People with CJD often have signs of dementia, including:\n\n【12】*   Confusion\n*   Trouble walking\n*   Jerky muscle movements or twitching\n*   Personality changes\n*   Trouble with memory and judgment\n*   Vision problems\n\n【13】Sometimes people with it have trouble sleeping or become depressed. In later stages of the disease, they often lose the ability to speak or move. They may also get pneumonia or other infections, or slip into a coma.\n\n【14】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【15】There is no single test for CJD. Doctors diagnose it from your symptoms. One sign of the disease is how fast it gets worse.\n\n【16】A few tests doctors can use include:\n\n【17】**Magnetic resonance imaging** **(MRI).** This brain scan puts together detailed images. Doctors use these images to see changes in the brain over time.\n\n【18】**Electroencephalogram (****EEG****).** This is another type of test using surface electrodes that measures the electrical activity in the brain.\n\n【19】**Lumbar puncture** **(****spinal tap****).** Doctors use a long, very thin needle to draw some of the fluid out of the spinal column to test for certain proteins.\n\n【20】The only way to know for sure someone has CJD is by taking a sample (called a biopsy) of their brain tissue, or by autopsy. Doctors don’t usually biopsy brain tissue, because it’s risky, both for the patient and the doctor. It’s hard to target which tissue in the brain is infected, so doing a biopsy may not give helpful information. And it puts the doctor at risk of getting the disease.\n\n【21】Since a positive diagnosis doesn't help someone with CJD, doctors often confirm cases only after someone dies of it.\n\n【22】Treatment\n---------\n\n【23】There are no treatments for CJD. Researchers have tested several drugs, but none have been able to slow or stop the disease.\n\n【24】Doctors can prescribe pain medicine for the symptoms. Muscle relaxers or anti-seizure drugs can help with stiffness. People with CJD need full-time care once the disease is in its late stage.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:55:38", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:55:49", "cost": 10.537}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:06", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:55:49", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:55:38"}

It’s defined by the advocacy groups Little People of the World Organization (LPOTW) and Little People of America (LPA) as an adult height of 4 feet 10 inches or under, as a result of a medical or genetic condition. Other groups extend the criteria for certain forms of dwarfism to 5 feet, but the average height of an adult with dwarfism is 4 feet.\n\n【2】There are two main categories of dwarfism -- **disproportionate** and **proportionate**.\n\n【3】Disproportionate dwarfism is characterized by an average-size torso and shorter arms and legs or a shortened trunk with longer limbs.\n\n【4】In proportionate dwarfism, the body parts are in proportion but shortened.\n\n【5】Dwarfism Symptoms\n-----------------\n\n【6】In addition to short stature, dwarfism has many other symptoms that can vary depending the type it is.\n\n【7】**Disproportionate dwarfism symptoms**\n\n【8】Disproportionate dwarfism usually doesn’t affect intellectual development unless a child has other rare conditions, including hydrocephalus, or excess fluid around the brain.\n\n【9】Symptoms of disproportionate dwarfism may include:\n\n【10】*   Adults typically are about 4 feet tall\n*   Average-size torso and very short limbs, especially in the upper halves of arms and legs\n*   Short fingers\n*   Wide spaces between the middle and ring fingers\n*   Limited elbow mobility\n*   Disproportionately large head\n*   Prominent forehead\n*   Flattened bridge of the nose\n*   Bowing of legs that progressively worsens over time\n*   Swaying of the back that progressively worsens over time\n\n【11】Some people with disproportionate dwarfism have a rare disorder called spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita (SEDC). Adults with SEDC are around 3 to 4 feet tall and may have these signs too:\n\n【12】*   Very short trunk\n*   Short neck, arms, and legs, but average-size hands and feet\n*   Broad chest\n*   Flattened cheekbones\n*   Cleft palate, or an opening in the roof of the mouth\n*   Unstable neck bones\n*   Deformed hips where the thigh bones turn inward\n*   Twisted feet\n*   Hunched upper back that progressively worsens\n*   Swayed lower back that progressively worsens\n*   Arthritis\n*   Joint mobility problems\n*   Impaired vision or hearing\n\n【13】**Proportionate dwarfism symptoms**\n\n【14】Proportionate dwarfism is caused by a medical condition you have at birth or that develops in childhood that hinders growth and development. One common cause is too-low amounts of growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland.\n\n【15】Symptoms of proportionate dwarfism include a smaller head, arms, and legs. But all are in proportion with each other. Organ systems may be smaller too.\n\n【16】Other signs of proportionate dwarfism in children are:\n\n【17】*   Slower growth rate than expected for their age\n*   Height lower than the third percentile on standard charts for age\n*   Delayed or no sexual development during the teen years\n\n【18】Dwarfism Causes\n---------------\n\n【19】There are approximately 400 types of dwarfism. Causes of proportionate dwarfism include metabolic and hormonal disorders such as growth hormone deficiency.\n\n【20】The most common types of dwarfism, known as skeletal dysplasias, are genetic. Skeletal dysplasias are conditions of abnormal bone growth that cause disproportionate dwarfism.\n\n【21】They include:\n\n【22】**Achondroplasia.** The most common form of dwarfism -- accounting for 70% of cases -- achondroplasia occurs in about one out of 26,000 to 40,000 babies and is evident at birth. People with achondroplasia have a relatively long trunk and shortened upper parts of their arms and legs. Other features of achondroplasia include:\n\n【23】*   A large head with a prominent forehead\n*   A flattened bridge of the nose\n*   Protruding jaw\n*   Crowded and misaligned teeth\n*   Forward curvature of the lower spine\n*   Bowed legs\n*   Flat, short, broad feet\n*   \"Double-jointedness\"\n\n【24】**Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasias (SED).**A less common form of dwarfism, SED affects approximately one in 95,000 babies. Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia refers to a group of conditions characterized by a shortened trunk, which may not become apparent until a child is between ages 5 and 10. Other features can include:\n\n【25】*   Club feet\n*   Cleft palate\n*   Severe osteoarthritis in the hips\n*   Weak hands and feet\n*   Barrel-chested appearance\n\n【26】**Diastrophic dysplasia.A** rare form of dwarfism, diastrophic dysplasia occurs in about one in 100,000 births. People who have it tend to have shortened forearms and calves (this is known as mesomelic shortening).\n\n【27】Other signs can include\n\n【28】*   Deformed hands and feet\n*   Limited range of motion\n*   Cleft palate\n*   Ears with a cauliflower appearance\n\n【29】**Turner syndrome.**This genetic condition only affects females. It’s caused by a missing or partial X chromosome. Girls with Turner syndrome only inherit one fully functioning X chromosome from their parents, instead of one from each parent.\n\n【30】Dwarfism Genetics\n-----------------\n\n【31】**Skeletal dysplasia** is caused by a genetic mutation. The gene mutation can occur spontaneously or can be inherited.\n\n【32】**Diastrophic dysplasia** and usually **spondyloepiphyseal dysplasias** are inherited in a recessive manner. This means a child must receive two copies of the mutated gene -- one from the mother, one from the father -- to be affected.\n\n【33】**Achondroplasia**, on the other hand, is inherited in a dominant manner. That means a child needs only one copy of the mutated gene to have that form of skeletal dysplasia. There is a 25% chance that a child born to a couple in which both parents have achondroplasia will be of normal height. But there is also a 25% chance the child will inherit both dwarfism genes, a condition known as double-dominant syndrome. This is a fatal condition that usually results in miscarriage.\n\n【34】Often parents of children with achondroplasia do not carry the mutated gene themselves. The mutation in the child occurs spontaneously at the time of conception.\n\n【35】Doctors do not know what causes a gene to mutate. It is a seemingly random occurrence that can happen in any pregnancy. When average-size parents have a child with dwarfism due to a spontaneous mutation, it is not likely that other children will also have the mutation.\n\n【36】In addition to genetic skeletal dysplasia, short stature has other causes, including disorders of the pituitary, which influence growth and metabolism; kidney disease; and problems that affect the body's ability to absorb nutrients.\n\n【37】Dwarfism Diagnosis\n------------------\n\n【38】Some forms of dwarfism are evident in utero, at birth, or during infancy and can be diagnosed through X-rays and a physical exam. A diagnosis of achondroplasia, diastrophic dysplasia, or spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia can be confirmed through genetic testing. In some cases, prenatal testing is done if there is concern for specific conditions.\n\n【39】Sometimes dwarfism doesn't become evident until later in a child's life, when dwarfism signs lead parents to seek a diagnosis. Here are signs and symptoms to look for in children that indicate a potential for dwarfism:\n\n【40】*   A larger head\n*   Late development of certain motor skills, such as sitting up or walking\n*   Breathing problems\n*   Curvature of the spine\n*   Bowed legs\n*   Joint stiffness and arthritis\n*   Lower back pain numbness in the legs\n*   Crowding of teeth\n\n【41】Doctors may also use these tests to help diagnose dwarfism:\n\n【42】**Appearance.** Children with possible dwarfism may have changes to their skeleton or facial structures as they develop.\n\n【43】**Chart comparisons.** At regular check-ups, your child’s height, weight, and head circumference will be measured and compared to percentiles for standard development for their age. If your child shows any signs of abnormal growth, they may need more frequent measurements.\n\n【44】**Imaging.**Doctors may spot signs of achondroplasia, such as shorter limbs, or other causes of dwarfism on ultrasounds of a fetus during pregnancy. X-rays of babies or children may show that their arms or legs are not growing at a normal rate, or that their skeleton shows signs of dysplasia. MRI scans can show any abnormalities of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus, which affect hormone production.\n\n【45】**Genetic testing.**DNA tests may be done before or after birth to look for genetic mutations linked to dwarfism. Girls with suspected Turner syndrome may need DNA tests to check their X chromosomes. DNA testing may help parents with family planning if they wish to have more children.\n\n【46】**Family history****.**Pediatricians may check the height and size of other family members, such as siblings, to compare with the child with suspected dwarfism.\n\n【47】**Hormone tests.**Tests of growth hormone levels can confirm if they’re low.\n\n【48】Dwarfism Treatments\n-------------------\n\n【49】Early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent or lessen some of the problems associated with dwarfism. People with dwarfism related to growth hormone deficiency can be treated with growth hormone. For children five years of age and older with achondroplasia who still have the potential for growth, the FDA has approved vosoritide (Voxzogo) to help stimulate bone growth.\n\n【50】In many cases, people with dwarfism have orthopaedic or medical complications. Treatment of those can include:\n\n【51】*   Insertion of a shunt to drain excess fluid and relieve pressure on the brain\n*   A tracheotomy to improve breathing through small airways\n*   Corrective surgeries for deformities such as cleft palate, club foot, or bowed legs\n*   Surgery to remove tonsils or adenoids to improve breathing problems related to large tonsils, small facial structures, and/or a small chest\n*   Surgery to widen the spinal canal (the opening through which the spinal cord passes) to relieve spinal cord compression\n*   Extended limb lengthening, a controversial surgery, due in part to its risks, involves several procedures. It is only done on adults.\n\n【52】Other treatment may include:\n\n【53】*   Physical therapy to strengthen muscles and increase joint range of motion\n*   Back braces to improve curvature of the spine\n*   Placement of drainage tubes in the middle ear to help prevent hearing loss due to repeated ear infections\n*   Orthodontic treatment to relieve crowding of teeth caused by a small jaw\n*   Nutritional guidance and exercise to help prevent obesity, which can aggravate skeletal problems\n\n【54】Dwarfism Complications\n----------------------\n\n【55】Disproportionate dwarfism causes changes to the limbs, back, and head size that could cause complications like these:\n\n【56】*   Arthritis\n*   Back pain or breathing difficulties due to hunched or swayed back\n*   Bowed legs\n*   Crowded teeth\n*   Delayed motor skills development\n*   Frequent ear infections and possibly hearing loss\n*   Hydrocephalus (fluid on the brain)\n*   Pressure on the spine at the base of the skull\n*   Sleep apnea\n*   Spinal stenosis, a narrowing of the spine that may cause leg pain or numbness\n*   Weight gain that may cause back problems\n\n【57】Proportionate dwarfism may cause you to have smaller or less developed organs. Girls with Turner syndrome may have heart problems. Kids with lower growth hormone levels or Turner syndrome may have emotional or social problems due to delays in sexual development.\n\n【58】Women with disproportionate dwarfism may have pregnancy complications, such as respiratory problems. They almost always need to deliver their babies by C-section, as the shape of their pelvis makes vaginal delivery too difficult.\n\n【59】Anyone with dwarfism may encounter people who call them names or don’t understand their condition. Kids with dwarfism who have lower self-esteem may need emotional support from their parents to deal with their feelings.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:23:59", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:34:51", "cost": 652.766}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:06", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:34:52", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:23:59"}

It is used to prevent and treat malaria caused by mosquito bites in countries where malaria is common. Malaria parasites can enter the body through these mosquito bites , and then live in body tissues such as red blood cells or the liver . This medication is used to kill the malaria parasites living inside red blood cells and other tissues. In some cases, you may need to take a different medication (such as primaquine ) to complete your treatment. Both medications may be needed for a complete cure and to prevent the return of infection (relapse). Atovaquone/proguanil belongs to a class of drugs known as antimalarials.The United States Centers for Disease Control provide updated guidelines and travel recommendations for the prevention and treatment of malaria in different parts of the world. Discuss the most recent information with your doctor before traveling to areas where malaria occurs.\n\n【2】### How to use Malarone Tablet\n\n【3】Read the Patient Information Leaflet if available from your pharmacist before you start taking this medication , and each time you get a refill. If you have any questions regarding the information, consult your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【4】Take this medication by mouth with food or a milky drink (such as whole milk, milkshake) that contains fat . If you vomit within 1 hour of taking a dose, repeat the dose. If you have vomiting that doesn't stop after taking atovaquone /proguanil, contact a doctor right away. You may need another medication to prevent vomiting or a different malaria medication.\n\n【5】Swallow the tablet whole because of its bitter taste. Do not chew. If you have trouble swallowing tablets, this medication may be crushed and mixed with condensed milk. Take the entire mixture right away.

Skipping or changing your dose without approval from your doctor may cause prevention/treatment to be ineffective, cause the amount of parasite to increase, make the infection more difficult to treat (resistant), or worsen side effects.\n\n【12】It is important to prevent mosquito bites (such as by using appropriate insect repellents, wearing clothes that cover most of the body, remaining in air-conditioned or well-screened areas, using mosquito nets and insect-killing sprays). Buy insect repellent before traveling. The most effective insect repellents contain diethyltoluamide (DEET).

You can treat high cholesterol with healthy lifestyle changes like diet, exercise, and weight loss and, sometimes, medications too.\n\n【2】Your cholesterol treatment plan is done on a case-by-case basis, based on:\n\n【3】*   Your blood cholesterol test results\n*   Your age, family history of high cholesterol, or heart problems\n*   Current health problems like diabetes or high blood pressure, or being overweight\n*   Your personal preferences, like how you feel about sticking to diet changes, taking pills every day, or dealing with side effects\n*   Your risk of developing heart disease or having a heart attack or stroke\n*   If you’ve already been diagnosed with heart disease or had a heart attack or stroke before\n\n【4】**Cholesterol treatment goals**\n\n【5】Your personal high cholesterol treatment goals are based on your current health and cardiac risk, or risk of a heart attack or stroke within the next 10 years. Your doctor can use a formula to calculate your cardiac risk.\n\n【6】Your blood lipid profile or panel test results show your cholesterol levels. Your doctor can test your cholesterol to help you track how well your treatment plan is working or if it needs to be adjusted.\n\n【7】Normal cholesterol levels are:\n\n【8】*   **Total cholesterol:** Lower than 170 mg/dL if you’re 19 or younger, and 125-200 mg/dL for men and women over 19\n*   **LDL cholesterol****:** Lower than 110 mg/dL if you’re 19 or younger, and less than 100 mg/dL for men and women over 19\n*   **HDL cholesterol****:** Above 45 mg/dL if you’re 19 or younger, 40 mg/dL or higher if you’re a man over 19, and 50 mg/dL or higher if you’re a woman over 19\n*   **Triglycerides****:** Lower than 150 mg/dL for all adults\n\n【9】Based on your cardiac risk, your cholesterol goal numbers may be lower. For example:\n\n【10】*   If you don’t have heart disease or blood vessel disease, and your overall cardiac risk is low, your LDL cholesterol treatment goal may be 100 mg/dL or lower.\n*   If you do have heart disease or blood vessel disease, your LDL treatment goal may be 70 mg/dL or lower.\n*   If you have diabetes, your LDL treatment goal may be below 70 mg/dL or at least reduced by 50%.\n\n【11】**Lifestyle changes first**\n\n【12】Your doctor may suggest heart\\-healthy lifestyle changes as the first step to lower your high cholesterol. If your cholesterol is borderline but not yet high, you should make these lifestyle changes, too. A heart-healthy diet and exercise can help lower your risk of heart attacks and strokes.\n\n【13】You may not need a cholesterol-lowering drug if your cardiac risk is low and your cholesterol is not above 190 mg/dL. Lifestyle changes may help you reach your goals without having to take medication.\n\n【14】If lifestyle changes don’t lower your cholesterol levels enough, your doctor may suggest medication. Stick with these healthy changes even if you do take meds. They can lower your cholesterol even more and may allow you to take a lower dose of medicine:\n\n【15】*   **Eat a heart-healthy diet** low in saturated fats, and high in omega-3 fats and soluble fiber. Cut back on red meat, full-fat dairy foods, and sugar. Stay away from trans fats.\n*   **Get at least 30 minutes** of moderate exercise 5 days a week.\n*   **Don’t smoke or vape.**  Quit smoking and try to avoid secondhand smoke.\n*   **Limit** **alcohol** to one drink a day for women and men over 65, and two drinks a day for men younger than 65.\n*   **Lose weight if you need to.** Even a 10% body weight loss can improve your cholesterol.\n\n【16】**Medications**\n\n【17】Your doctor may prescribe medication to lower your LDL cholesterol in addition to your lifestyle changes. That’s more likely if:\n\n【18】*   Your LDL cholesterol is 190 mg/dL or higher\n*   You’re 45-70 years old and have diabetes, and your LDL cholesterol is 70 mg/dL or higher\n*   You’re 45-70 years old with a high risk of heart disease, and your LDL cholesterol is 70 mg/dL or higher\n*   You’ve already had a heart attack or stroke, or you have peripheral arterial disease\n\n【19】**Statins** are the most widely prescribed medication for high cholesterol. Statins reduce the amount of cholesterol made by your liver. These drugs may lower your risk of heart attacks and strokes. Statins include atorvastatin (Lipitor), rosuvastatin calcium (Crestor), simvastatin (Zocor), Fluvastatin (Lescol), Lovastatin (Mevacor, Altoprev), and Pravastatin (Pravachol), as well as combinations of statins and other cholesterol-lowering meds, atorvastatin with amlodipine (Caduet) and simvastatin and ezetimibe (Vytorin).\n\n【20】**Ezetimibe** (Zetia) is a drug that lowers your body’s absorption of cholesterol and may be prescribed with a statin.\n\n【21】**Bile acid-binding drugs** cling to acids in your digestive system and help your liver use up excess cholesterol. They include cholestyramine (Locholest, Locholest Light, Prevalite, Questran, Questran Light), Colestipol (Colestid), and Colesevelam Hcl (WelChol).\n\n【22】**Fibrates** reduce triglycerides and boost HDL cholesterol to help balance your overall cholesterol levels. They include clofibrate (Atromid-S), fenofibrate (Antara, Lofibra, Tricor, and Triglide), and gemfibrozil (Lopid).\n\n【23】**Niacin** **or nicotinic acid** is a vitamin that helps reduce fats produced by your liver to lower triglycerides and LDL cholesterol. Don’t take this vitamin unless your doctor tells you to do so.\n\n【24】**Omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters** are made from fish oil. These supplements (Epanova, Lovaza, Omtryg, and Vascepa) help lower triglycerides along with a healthy diet.\n\n【25】**PSCK9 inhibitors** are newer, more targeted drugs that bind to and block a protein, PSCK9, on your liver cells to help lower your LDL cholesterol, including alirocumab (Praluent) and evolocumab (Repatha).\n\n【26】**ACL inhibitors** are another new cholesterol drug. They’re prescribed with a statin and lifestyle changes to lower your LDL cholesterol even more. ACL inhibitors, including bempedoic acid (Nexletol) or bempedoic acid and (Nexlizet), may be prescribed if you have heart disease or if your high cholesterol is caused by genetic factors.\n\n【27】**SiRNA (small interfering RNA) therapy** can treat some health conditions by changing how some of your genes work.  A new medication called inclisiran (Leqvio) uses this technology to treat adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) who need additional LDL lowering. It lowers your LDL levels by disrupting the gene that makes PCSK9. Inclisiran comes in the form of shots, taken several months apart. You can use this medication along with other cholesterol-lowering treatments or alone.\n\n【28】**How long does cholesterol treatment take to work?**\n\n【29】When you first make lifestyle changes, plan to see your doctor for regular checkups. After 12 weeks, they may check your LDL cholesterol again to see if you need to adjust your diet or exercise even more.\n\n【30】After 18 weeks of lifestyle changes, if your cholesterol levels haven’t improved, they may suggest adding medication. You’ll probably see your doctor once every 4-6 months for checkups after that.\n\n【31】If you’re prescribed a statin or other cholesterol medication, your doctor can check your LDL cholesterol again 4-8 weeks later to see if the drugs are working. If it hasn’t lowered your numbers enough, they may adjust your prescription or add another treatment. You’ll have your cholesterol checked every year.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:57:07", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:57:26", "cost": 18.851}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:05", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:57:26", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:57:07"}

Vaccination during childhood may help prevent this infection and the problems that can occur.The virus in this vaccine is alive, but it has been weakened (attenuated) and so it has a decreased ability to cause illness. It works by helping the body produce immunity (protection) that will prevent you from getting chickenpox, or will lessen the seriousness of the infection.

It's more common in young people, mostly boys. It doesn't run in families.\n\n【2】ALCL is a serious illness. It can be fast growing, and it often returns. Treatments can help you fight it. Other therapies can help you feel better.\n\n【3】Scientists are still looking for new and better ways to treat both the disease and the symptoms.\n\n【4】When you have lymphoma, cells called lymphocytes grow out of control. These are white blood cells that usually fight infection. With ALCL, they build up in small glands called lymph nodes or in other parts of your body, like your lungs or skin.\n\n【5】ALCL can show up in two ways:\n\n【6】*   In the skin, it's called **cutaneous ALCL**. It usually grows slowly.\n*   In the lymph nodes and other organs, it's called systemic ALCL. It often spreads quickly.\n\n【7】Doctors will also need to find out whether your cancer has a certain protein, called ALK.\n\n【8】*   ALK-positive cancers are more common in young people and usually respond well to chemotherapy.\n*   ALK-negative cancers are more common people over 60. This type may need stronger treatment because it is more likely to come back.\n\n【9】Causes\n------\n\n【10】Researchers don't know what causes ALCL, but they do know it isn't inherited.\n\n【11】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【12】Often, the first sign of systemic ALCL is swelling in the neck, armpit, or groin, where your legs meet the trunk of your body.\n\n【13】You may also have symptoms like:\n\n【14】*   Fatigue\n*   Fever\n*   Loss of appetite\n*   Night sweats\n*   Weight loss\n\n【15】With cutaneous ALCL, you may first notice one or more raised, red bumps on the skin that don't go away. These are tumors. They can form open sores, and they may itch.\n\n【16】Getting a Diagnosis\n-------------------\n\n【17】When you come in for a visit, your doctor will want to know:\n\n【18】*   When did you first notice changes?\n*   Are there any swollen glands?\n*   Is there pain? Where?\n*   What about appetite? Any weight loss?\n*   More tired than usual?\n*   Any skin bumps? Do they itch?\n\n【19】To see if you have ALCL, doctors may take a biopsy from a swollen lymph node. It's quick and doesn't require a hospital stay. Doctors make a small cut in the skin and remove all or part of the lymph node, or use a needle to take a sample. They look at the cells under a microscope.\n\n【20】Other tests may be needed, such as:\n\n【21】*   Blood tests\n*   Bone marrow biopsy. Doctors use a special needle to remove a small amount of the soft material inside your bones and check it for cancer cells.\n*   Chest X-ray, which uses radiation in low doses to make images of organs in your chest.\n*   CT. A powerful X-ray that makes detailed pictures of the inside of your body.\n*   MRI, which uses powerful magnets and radio waves to make pictures of organs and structures.\n*   PET scan, in which radioactive materials called tracers look for cancer.\n\n【22】These tests look to see where and how much the cancer has spread. This is called staging. It helps you and your doctor decide the right treatment.\n\n【23】*   Stage I. Cancer is found in one place as a tumor or in the lymph nodes in only one part of the body, like the neck or groin.\n*   Stage II. Cancer can also be found in a single tumor and its nearby lymph nodes of only one part of the body. All of the lymph nodes are either above or below the diaphragm, a sheet of muscle between your chest and stomach.\n*   Stage III. Cancer is found in lymph nodes both above and below the diaphragm and is outside the lymphatic system.\n*   Stage IV. ALCL has spread to other organs, such as the liver, bones, or lungs.\n\n【24】Questions to Ask Your Doctor\n----------------------------\n\n【25】*   What stage is the cancer?\n*   Where exactly have you found cancer?\n*   Is it ALK-positive?\n*   Have you treated someone with ALCL before?\n*   What treatment do you recommend?\n*   What are the side effects?\n*   How and when will we know if it works?\n*   What if it doesn't work?\n*   Could I be in a clinical trial?\n*   How do I connect with other families facing ALCL?\n\n【26】Treatment\n---------\n\n【27】No matter what form of ALCL you have, there are treatments to help. And researchers are hopeful tthere will be new and better options in the future.\n\n【28】Your treatment choices will depend on the type of ALCL you have and where it is in the body.\n\n【29】Chemotherapy is the main treatment for systemic ALCL, when the cancer is in your lymph nodes and other parts of the body.\n\n【30】A kind of chemotherapy called CHOP is used for both ALK-positive and ALK-negative ALCL. The therapy gets its name for the first letters of the drugs it uses: Cytoxan, hydroxydaunorubicin, Oncovin, and prednisolone.\n\n【31】If your cancer is ALK-negative, doctors may use CHOP at higher doses.\n\n【32】If your cancer doesn't respond to CHOP, you may get another drug called brentuximab vedotin (Adcetris).\n\n【33】A stem cell transplant may also be an option for you, but it's a complicated and risky procedure. It's usually only done when other treatments have failed. Doctors inject stem cells into your body to help you grow new cancer-free ones. The stem cells come from your own body, or from a closely matched donor.\n\n【34】For primary cutaneous ALCL, treatment may include:\n\n【35】*   Radiation, which uses high-energy rays to kill cancer cells\n*   Surgery to remove the tumors\n\n【36】If the cancer is in many areas of the skin, you may need a combination of chemotherapy drugs.\n\n【37】Taking Care of Yourself\n-----------------------\n\n【38】Being diagnosed with cancer can make you feel like you've lost control. Remember that you're in charge of your treatment decisions and how you live your life.\n\n【39】While you are getting treatment, you may not feel your best. Some treatments, like chemotherapy, have side effects. You may feel weak or tired, and you may be sick to your stomach\n\n【40】To help you feel better:\n\n【41】*   Eat enough calories and protein each day to keep up weight and stay strong. Try several small meals instead of fewer bigger ones.\n*   Ask the doctor or nurse for ways to ease nausea and other side effects of treatment.\n*   Get support from friends, family members, counselors, or members of your spiritual community. You can also join a support group of other people with ALCL.\n*   Stay active. Exercise when you feel up to it. Talk to your doctor about what's right for you.\n*   Try to get good rest.\n*   Wash hands often, and stay away from people who may be sick.\n\n【42】Don't miss regular doctor appointments. They're key to finding out how well the treatment is going, and to deciding if any changes are needed.\n\n【43】What to Expect\n--------------\n\n【44】Every situation is different, but treatment to fight ALCL can work well. Sometimes, the cancer comes back. Ask your doctor what to watch for, and listen to your body.\n\n【45】The treatments can bring discomfort. Make sure your doctor knows how you're feeling. Take advantage of other therapies that can ease symptoms and help you feel better.\n\n【46】A serious illness is hard for the whole family. It's natural that you will have questions, concerns, and frustrations. Find the support you need, and ask for help when you need it.\n\n【47】Keep informed about research that's under way. You may be able to take part in a clinical trial.\n\n【48】Getting Support\n---------------\n\n【49】You can find out more information on anaplastic large-cell lymphoma on the web site of the Lymphoma Research Foundation. It has links to help you find the support of people and families who have ALCL, and to information about clinical trials.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:42:21", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:42:32", "cost": 11.925}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:05", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:42:33", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:42:20"}

It affects the way your body makes mucus, a substance that helps your organs and systems work. Mucus should be thin and slippery, but when you have CF, it becomes thick and glue-like. This blocks tubes and ducts throughout your body.\n\n【2】Over time, this thick mucus builds up inside your airways. This makes it hard to breathe. The mucus traps germs and leads to infections. It can also cause severe lung damage like cysts (fluid-filled sacs) and fibrosis (scar tissue). That’s how CF got its name.\n\n【3】More than 30,000 people in the U.S. live with cystic fibrosis. Doctors diagnose about 1,000 new cases each year.\n\n【4】Cystic Fibrosis Symptoms\n------------------------\n\n【5】People with CF can have symptoms including:\n\n【6】*   Trouble with bowel movements or frequent, greasy stools\n*   Wheezing  or trouble breathing\n*   Frequent lung infections\n*   Infertility, especially in men\n*   Trouble growing or gaining weight\n*   Skin that tastes very salty\n\n【7】Cystic Fibrosis Causes\n----------------------\n\n【8】Cystic fibrosis is caused by a change, or mutation, in a gene called CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator). This gene controls the flow of salt and fluids in and out of your cells. If the CFTR gene doesn’t work the way it should, a sticky mucus builds up in your body.\n\n【9】To get CF, you have to inherit the mutated copy of the gene from both of your parents. Ninety percent of those with affected have at least one copy of the F508del mutation.\n\n【10】If you inherit only one copy, you won’t have any symptoms, but you will be a carrier of the disease. That means there’s a chance you could pass it to your children.\n\n【11】About 10 million Americans are CF carriers. Every time two CF carriers have a baby, there’s a 25% (1 in 4) chance that their baby will be born with CF.\n\n【12】Cystic Fibrosis Diagnosis\n-------------------------\n\n【13】Early diagnosis means early treatment and better health later in life. Every state in the U.S. tests newborns for cystic fibrosis using one or more of these three tests:\n\n【14】*   **Blood test.** This test checks the levels of immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT). People with CF have higher levels of it in their blood.\n\n【15】*   **DNA test.** This looks for mutations to the CFTR gene.\n*   **Sweat test.** It measures the salt in your sweat. Higher than normal results suggest CF.\n\n【16】Some people who weren’t tested at birth aren’t diagnosed with CF until they become adults. Your doctor might give you DNA or sweat tests if you have symptoms of the disease.\n\n【17】Cystic Fibrosis Treatment\n-------------------------\n\n【18】There’s no cure for cystic fibrosis, but medications and other therapies can ease symptoms.\n\n【19】**Medications.** Your doctor may give you drugs to open your airways, thin mucus, prevent infections, and help your body get nutrients from food. These include:\n\n【20】*   **Antibiotics.** They can prevent or treat lung infections and help your lungs work better. You might get them as pills, in an inhaler, or in a shot.\n*   **Anti-inflammatory medicines.** These include ibuprofen and corticosteroids.\n*   **Bronchodilators.** You’ll get these from an inhaler. They’ll relax and open your airways.\n*   **Mucus thinners.** They’ll help you get the gunk out of your airways. You’ll get them from an inhaler.\n*   **CFTR modulators.** These help CFTR work like it should. They can make your lungs work better and help you gain weight.\n*   **Combination therapy.** The new medication elexacaftor/ivacaftor/tezacaftor (Trikafta) combines three CFTR modulators to target the CFTR protein and make it work for efficiently.\n\n【21】**Airway clearance techniques.** These can help get rid of mucus. You might try:\n\n【22】*   **Chest therapy or percussion.** This involves tapping or clapping on your chest or back to clear mucus from your lungs. Someone else does this for you.\n*   **Oscillating devices.** You breathe into a special device that oscillates, or vibrates, your airways. This loosens mucus and makes it easier to cough up. You can wear an oscillating chest vest instead.\n\n【23】**Physical therapy for CF**. This includes breathing exercises designed to push air between layers of mucus and your chest wall. They make it easier to cough up the gunk and ease blocked airways. Some common exercises include:\n\n【24】*   **Autogenic drainage.** To do this, you breathe out hard, or huff. This moves mucus from your smaller airways to the central airways and makes it easier to get out.\n*   **Active cycle of breathing.** This controls your breath and relaxes the upper chest and shoulders, which can help clear mucus and prevent airway blockages. You breathe in deeply, hold it, and then huff for different lengths of time.\n\n【25】Cystic Fibrosis Complications\n-----------------------------\n\n【26】The lungs aren’t the only part of your body CF damages. Cystic fibrosis also affects the following organs:\n\n【27】*   **Pancreas.** The thick mucus caused by CF blocks ducts in your pancreas. This stops proteins that break down your food, called digestive enzymes, from reaching your intestine. As a result, your body has a hard time getting the nutrients it needs. Over time, this can also lead to diabetes.\n*   **Liver.** If the tubes that remove bile get clogged, your liver gets inflamed. This can lead to severe scarring called cirrhosis.\n*   **Small intestine.** Because it can be hard to break down high-acid foods that come from your stomach, the lining of the small intestine can wear away.\n*   **Large intestine.** The thick fluid in your stomach can make your poop large and harder to pass. This can lead to blockages. In some cases, your intestine may also start to fold in on itself like an accordion, a condition called intussusception.\n*   **Bladder.** Chronic or long-lasting coughing weakens your bladder muscles. Almost 65% of women with CF have stress incontinence. This means that you leak a little pee when you cough, sneeze, laugh, or lift something. Though it’s more common in women, men can have it, too.\n*   **Kidneys.** Some people with CF get kidney stones. These small, hard globs of minerals can cause nausea, vomiting, and pain. If you don’t treat them, you could get a kidney infection.\n*   **Reproductive organs.** Excess mucus affects fertility in men and women. Most men with CF have problems with the tubes that move sperm, called the vasa deferentia. Women with CF have very thick cervical mucus, which can make it harder for a sperm to fertilize an egg.\n*   **Other parts of the body.** CF can also lead to muscle weakness and thinning bones, or osteoporosis.  Because it upsets the balance of minerals in your blood, it can also cause low blood pressure, fatigue, a fast heart rate, and a general feeling of weakness.\n\n【28】Although CF is a severe condition that needs daily care, there are many ways to treat it, and there’s been a great improvement in those treatments over the years. People who have CF now can expect to live a much longer life than those who had it in the past.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:54:27", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:54:57", "cost": 30.128}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:05", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:54:57", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:54:26"}

In recent years, it's become a controversial diagnosis. Some experts believe it is rare and being overdiagnosed; others think the opposite. At this point, it's hard to be sure just how common it is.\n\n【1】Another diagnosis, called Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) also has been established to describe children ages 6-18 who have severe and persistent irritability and temper outbursts that don't meet conventional definitions of bipolar disorder.\n\n【2】So it's important not to jump to conclusions. If your child is diagnosed with bipolar disorder, you might want to get a second opinion before embarking on a treatment plan. Make sure you're comfortable with your child's health care provider.\n\n【3】Bipolar Disorder in Young Children\n----------------------------------\n\n【4】Diagnosing bipolar disorder in young children is difficult, because many of the symptoms are similar to those of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or conduct disorders -- or even just normal, childhood behavior. One problem is that medications used for ADHD are often stimulants, which can potentially trigger mania in children with bipolar disorder.\n\n【5】Young children in a manic phase might be more irritable than adults; they may be more likely to have psychotic symptoms, hearing and seeing things that aren't real. During a depressive episode, they might be more likely to complain of physical symptoms, like aches and pains.\n\n【6】One of the most notable differences is that bipolar disorder in children cycles much more quickly. While manic and depressive periods may be separated by weeks, months, or years in adults, they can happen within a single day in children.\n\n【7】How Can I Help my Bipolar Child?\n--------------------------------\n\n【8】As the parent of a child with bipolar disorder, there's a lot you can do to keep your child well. Here are some suggestions.\n\n【9】*   **Follow the medication schedule.** You absolutely must make sure that your child gets the medication they need for bipolar disorder. Use timers, pillboxes, notes, or whatever it takes for you to remember. If your child needs medication at school, talk to their teacher or school nurse -- schools may not allow students to take medication on their own.\n*   **Monitor side effects.** Most drugs used for bipolar disorder (including mood-stabilizers, antipsychotic medications, and even antidepressants) were originally tested in adults, and only a few have been well-studied in children and adolescents. Some children are more prone to side effects from some of these drugs, such as weight gain and changes in blood sugar and cholesterol caused by some atypical antipsychotics. Ask your child's health care provider what symptoms to watch for and you may need to routinely monitor bloodwork. The FDA has issued a warning that using some types of antidepressants or other medicines used to treat depression may increase the risk of suicide in children, adolescents and young adults up to 24 years old.\n*   **Talk to your child's teachers.** In some cases, a child with bipolar disorder may need special allowances at school. They may need extra breaks or less homework during difficult times. So work out an agreement with your child's teachers or the school principal. In some cases, you may need to take your child out of school for a while, at least until their bipolar symptoms stabilize.\n*   **Keep a routine.** Children with bipolar disorder can really benefit from a daily schedule. Help them get up, eat meals, exercise, and go to bed at roughly the same times each day. Do what you can to reduce stress in the household.\n*   **Consider family therapy.** Having a child with bipolar disorder can be disruptive to the whole family. It can put extra stress on your marriage. Your other children may not understand what's wrong with their sibling, or they may be resentful of all the attention they are getting. Going to family therapy can help you all recognize and deal with these issues.\n*   **Take suicidal threats seriously.** No parent wants to think about their children hurting themselves. But unfortunately, it can happen, even with young children. So if your child begins to express a desire to die, or engages in life-threatening behavior, don't ignore it. Remove any weapons or dangerous drugs from the house. And get help right away.\n\n【10】Teenagers With Bipolar Disorder\n-------------------------------\n\n【11】In older teenagers, the symptoms and treatment of bipolar disorder are much more similar to those seen in adults. But having a teenager with this condition presents a lot of distinct problems.\n\n【12】As they get older, teenagers might be resentful if they feel that you're imposing treatment on them. So let them into the conversation. Talk frankly -- along with your child's doctor or therapist -- about treatment options. Try not to develop an adversarial relationship with your child over their treatment or medication.\n\n【13】As with adults, it's key that teenagers with bipolar disorder avoid alcohol and drugs, which can interact with medications or bring on or worsen mood episodes. The risks of developing a substance abuse problem are much higher in teens with bipolar disorder than in their peers. It's also important to maintain regular routines around sleep and wake times, and to develop effective coping strategies for managing stress and distress.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:41:44", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:42:07", "cost": 23.221}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:05", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:42:07", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:41:44"}

Those are the nerves that control your muscles. The condition makes it hard for them to send the electrical signals that move your body, which makes your hands and arms feel weak. They’ll also twitch and cramp.\n\n【2】MMN is not life-threatening, and, in most cases, treatments can make the muscles stronger. The disease can get worse slowly, and after a while, you may have a hard time doing daily tasks, like typing or getting dressed. But for many people, symptoms may be so mild that they don't need treatment at all. You may be able to work and stay active for many years after your diagnosis.\n\n【3】Most people are diagnosed with MMN in their 40s and 50s, although adults from ages 20 to 80 can find out they have the disease.\n\n【4】Causes\n------\n\n【5】No one knows what causes MMN. Scientists do know it’s an autoimmune disease, meaning your immune system mistakenly attacks your nerve cells as if they were invaders. Researchers are studying the disease to try to find out why it happens.\n\n【6】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【7】If you have MMN, you’ll most likely notice the first symptoms in your hands and lower arms. Your muscles may feel weak and cramp up or twitch in a way you can’t control. It may start in specific parts of the arm or hand, like the wrist or finger. Usually the symptoms are more severe on one side of your body. The disease may eventually affect your legs.\n\n【8】MMN isn’t painful, and you’ll still be able to feel with your hands and arms because your sensory nerves are not affected. But your symptoms will slowly get worse as you get older.\n\n【9】Getting a Diagnosis\n-------------------\n\n【10】Doctors often mistake MMN for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. They have similar symptoms, like twitching. Unlike ALS, though, MMN is treatable.\n\n【11】Your doctor may tell you to see a neurologist, a specialist who treats problems with the nervous system. They will give you a physical exam and also ask questions about your symptoms, like:\n\n【12】*   Which muscles are giving you trouble?\n*   Is it worse on one side of your body?\n*   How long have you been feeling this way?\n*   Do you have any numbness or tingling?\n*   Does anything make your symptoms better? What makes them worse?\n\n【13】The doctor will do some nerve and blood tests to rule out other conditions that might cause your symptoms. They may do:\n\n【14】*   A nerve conduction study (NCS). This test measures how fast electrical signals travel through your nerves. Usually, your doctor will put two sensors on the skin over one of your nerves: one to transmit a small electric shock and the other to record the activity. The doctor will repeat the test on other nerves if they think that more than one is involved.\n*   A needle electromyography (EMG). Your doctor will put electrodes on your arms. The electrodes have small needles, which go into your muscle, and they’re attached by wires to a machine that can measure the electrical activity in your muscles. Your doctor will ask you to slowly flex and relax your arms so the machine can record the activity. The doctor can do this test at the same time as the NCS.\n*   A blood test to look for GM1 antibodies, part of your body’s immune system. Some people with MMN have higher levels of them. If you do have a lot of these antibodies, chances are you have the disease. You might have MNN even if you don't have a lot of the antibodies, though.\n\n【15】Questions for Your Doctor\n-------------------------\n\n【16】*   How will MMN affect me?\n*   Do I need treatment?\n*   What kinds are available?\n*   How will they make me feel?\n*   Will I be able to work?\n*   What happens if the treatment doesn't help?\n*   Are there any clinical trials I can join?\n*   Are there any activities I won't be able to do?\n\n【17】Treatment\n---------\n\n【18】If your symptoms are very mild, you may not need any treatment. If you do need treatment, your doctor will probably prescribe a medication called intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). You’ll get the drug directly into one of your veins through an IV. You’ll usually get it in a doctor's office, although you can learn to do it at home.\n\n【19】If IVIg works, you should feel your muscle strength improve within 3 to 6 weeks. The effects will wear off over time, though, so you’ll need to keep having the treatment. People usually have it once a month, but it may be more or less often depending on your condition.\n\n【20】IVIg doesn't have many side effects, but it is expensive.\n\n【21】Doctors are testing ways to give it directly through the skin like a regular shot, but this method isn’t available for everyone.\n\n【22】If IVIg doesn't work, your doctor may try a drug called cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), which is also used to treat certain types of cancer. This drug controls symptoms by turning down your immune system. Unlike immunoglobulin, cyclophosphamide can have bad side effects, so doctors try not to use it.\n\n【23】Taking Care of Yourself\n-----------------------\n\n【24】If you get treatment for MMN early, you’re more likely to have few symptoms or long-term problems. Stick to your treatment plan, and talk to your doctor about any changes in how you’re feeling.\n\n【25】If you have trouble with certain activities, you may want to see an occupational or physical therapist. They can help you keep your muscles strong and show you how to do daily tasks more easily if your muscles are bothering you.\n\n【26】What to Expect\n--------------\n\n【27】Many people with MMN can continue most or at least some of their normal activities. The disease can get worse for some people and keep them from doing daily tasks.\n\n【28】The kind of problems you have depend on which of your muscles are affected. If your hand muscles are weak, you may have trouble eating, typing, writing, or buttoning clothes. If your leg muscles are affected, you could have trouble walking. Some people with severe MMN have trouble in all these areas.\n\n【29】Getting Support\n---------------\n\n【30】To learn more about multifocal motor neuropathy, visit the web sites of the Neuropathy Action Foundation, the Neuropathy Association, or the GBS-CIDP (Guillain-Barre Syndrome-Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy\\] Foundation International.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:50:45", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:50:58", "cost": 13.365}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:05", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:50:58", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:48:54"}

Treatment for secondary restless legs syndrome (RLS caused by another medical problem) involves treating the underlying cause.\n\n【1】The First Step in Treating Restless Legs Syndrome\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【2】The first line of defense against restless legs syndrome (RLS) is to avoid substances or foods that may aggravate or worsen the problem. Stay away from alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine. This may help relieve your symptoms. In addition, review all medications you are taking with your doctor to determine if any of these drugs could be causing the problem.\n\n【3】Any underlying medical conditions, such as anemia, diabetes, nutritional deficiencies, kidney disease, thyroid disease, varicose veins, or Parkinson's disease, should be treated. Dietary supplements to correct an iron, vitamin or mineral deficiency may relieve or even cure the RLS. \n\n【4】You may also benefit from physical therapy and self-care treatments, such as stretching, taking hot or cold baths, whirlpool baths, applying hot or cold packs to the affected area, limb massage, or vibratory or electrical stimulation of the feet and toes before bedtime. Exercise and relaxation techniques also may be helpful.\n\n【5】Medications for Restless Legs Syndrome\n--------------------------------------\n\n【6】Daily medication is usually recommended only for people who have symptoms of restless legs syndrome at least three nights a week, or as determined by your doctor. Keep in mind that drugs used to treat primary RLS do not cure the condition, but only relieve symptoms. People whose RLS symptoms occur sporadically may be prescribed medication to take only when they have symptoms.\n\n【7】The following medications are the most widely prescribed to treat RLS. They may be given alone or, in certain cases, in combination. Your doctor will prescribe the best treatment plan for you.\n\n【8】*   **Dopamine agonists:** These are most often the first medicines used to treat RLS. These drugs, including pramipexole (Mirapex), rotigotine (Neupro), and ropinirole (Requip), act like the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain. Side effects include daytime sleepiness, nausea, and lightheadedness.\n*   **Dopaminergic agents:** These drugs, including Sinemet -- a combination of levodopa and carbidopa -- increase the level of dopamine in the brain and may improve leg sensations in RLS. However, they may cause a worsening of symptoms for some people after daily use. Side effects can also include nausea, vomiting, hallucinations, and involuntary movements (dyskinesias).\n*   **Benzodiazepines:** Benzodiazepines, such as alprazolam (Xanax), clonazepam (Klonopin), and temazepam (Restoril), are sedatives. They do not so much relieve symptoms as help you sleep through the symptoms.\n*   **Opiates:** These drugs are most often used to treat pain, but they can also relieve RLS symptoms. Because opiates are very addictive, they are usually used only when other drugs don't work. Hydrocodone (Vicodin, Norco) is one example.\n*   **Anticonvulsants:** These agents, such as gabapentin (Neurontin) and gabapentin enacarbil (Horizant), may help relieve the symptoms of RLS as well as any chronic pain or nerve pain.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:05:12", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:05:21", "cost": 9.211}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:05", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:05:21", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:05:11"}

Although it’s the top cause of death in the U.S. there is a lot you can do to prevent or treat it.\n\n【1】The trouble starts when a waxy substance called plaque builds up inside the arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle. It can take decades to block the blood flow, but it can eventually cause a heart attack or failure.\n\n【2】What Causes CAD?\n----------------\n\n【3】Starting as early as childhood, plaque -- a combination of cholesterol, fat, and other substances -- starts to stick to the walls lining your blood vessels.\n\n【4】It builds up over time. That makes arteries become harder and narrower, which doctors call “atherosclerosis.“\n\n【5】In some cases, plaque can break or rupture. As a result, blood cells called platelets will try to repair the artery, forming a blood clot.\n\n【6】Like gunk in a clogged drainpipe, this buildup prevents a free flow of blood through the arteries. Blood carries oxygen and nutrients to the heart. If you don’t get enough, it can lead to shortness of breath and chest pain (angina).\n\n【7】Without enough oxygen, the heart can become weaker. This can lead to an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia). It can also cause heart failure, which means the heart can’t pump enough blood throughout the body to meet the body's needs.\n\n【8】If a plaque grows so large that it stops blood flow to the heart muscle, you could have a heart attack.  Most of the time, however, heart attacks happen from the smaller plaques that rupture.\n\n【9】What Are the Symptoms?\n----------------------\n\n【10】In the early stages, you may not have any symptoms. But as the plaque continues to build up and curbs blood flow to the heart muscle, you may notice that you’re short of breath or fatigued, especially during exercise.\n\n【11】The most common symptom of CAD is angina, or chest pain. Some people mistake it for heartburn or indigestion.\n\n【12】With angina, your chest feels uncomfortable. You may also experience the feeling in the shoulders, arms, back, or jaw. You may feel:\n\n【13】*   Tightness\n*   Discomfort\n*   Pressure\n*   Heaviness\n*   Squeezing\n*   Burning\n*   Aching\n*   Numbness\n*   Fullness\n\n【14】If you have any of the following symptoms, **call 911 immediately**:\n\n【15】*   **Chest pain**, especially in the center or left side of the chest, which lasts for a few minutes, or goes away and comes back. It can feel like pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. Some people mistake it for indigestion or heartburn.\n*   **Discomfort in any part of your upper body.** It could be in one or both arms, the shoulders, neck, jaw, or upper part of the stomach.\n*   **Shortness of breath** with or without chest discomfort\n*   **Nausea or vomiting with lightheadedness, dizziness, or cold sweat**\n\n【16】Women often have different heart attack symptoms than men. While the most common red flag is still chest pain, women are more likely to have other symptoms, such as shortness of breath, extreme fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and back or jaw pain.\n\n【17】What Puts Me at Risk?\n---------------------\n\n【18】Coronary artery disease (CAD) becomes more likely as you get older or if it runs in your family. But you can manage many other risk factors, including:\n\n【19】*   High cholesterol and triglycerides\n*   High blood pressure\n*   Smoking\n*   Metabolic syndrome\n*   Diabetes\n*   Obesity and overweight\n*   Lack of exercise\n*   Stress, depression, and anger\n*   Unhealthy diet\n*   Too much alcohol\n*   Sleep apnea\n\n【20】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【21】Your doctor will give you a checkup and talk with you about your symptoms, risks, and family history. You may also get tests such as:\n\n【22】*   Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG), which measures the heart’s electrical activity and can assess heart damage\n*   Stress test -- Usually, this involves walking on a treadmill or pedaling a stationary bike in a doctor’s office while your EKG, heart rate, and blood pressure are monitored. \n*   Chest X-ray\n*   Blood tests to check on your levels of blood sugar, cholesterol, and triglycerides (a type of fat in the blood)\n*   Cardiac catheterization in which a doctor guides a very thin, flexible tube (called a catheter) through a blood vessel in your arm or leg to reach your heart. The doctor injects dye through the catheter and then uses X-ray videos to see inside your heart.\n\n【23】Treatment\n---------\n\n【24】Depending on your case, your plan may include:\n\n【25】**Lifestyle changes:** These time-tested methods sound familiar for a reason -- they work!\n\n【26】*   Favor foods that are low in trans fats, saturated fats, simple sugars, and sodium.\n*   If you smoke, quit.\n*   Be active every day, ideally for 30 minutes or more a day (first, ask your doctor if there are any limits on what you can do).\n*   Work to stick to a healthy weight. \n*   Learn effective ways to manage your stress.\n\n【27】**Medications:** If these lifestyle changes aren’t enough, you may also need to take medicines to help your heart be healthier. They can include blood thinners (anticoagulants), aspirin and other anti-clotting medicines, ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, nitroglycerin, calcium channel blockers, certain immunosuppressants, statins, or PCSK9s. \n\n【28】**Angioplasty:** This procedure can open blocked or narrowed arteries without opening up your chest. In angioplasty, a doctor threads a thin, flexible tube with a balloon through your blood vessels until it reaches the blocked artery. The doctor then inflates the balloon, which stretches the artery open so more blood can flow. In many cases, a tiny tube called a stent is also inserted to keep the blood vessel open. You’ll typically be in and out of the hospital in a day.  \n\n【29】**Coronary artery bypass grafting** is a type of surgery in which doctors use blood vessels from other parts of your body to make a detour around blockages in your coronary arteries. It’s a major operation and you’ll probably need to be in the hospital for at least 5 days.\n\n【30】Prevention\n----------\n\n【31】Fortunately, there are a number of things you can do to reduce your chances of getting CAD.\n\n【32】**Get wise to your risk.** Speak to your doctor about getting your cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar checked. If you have high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or diabetes, it’s important to manage those conditions.\n\n【33】**Aim for a healthy weight**. If you’re not sure what your target weight should be, ask your doctor. And if you have a lot of weight to lose, remember that even a modest amount of weight loss helps.\n\n【34】**Avoid cigarette smoke.** If you smoke, quit. Steer clear of secondhand smoke.\n\n【35】**Limit your alcohol.** One or two drinks may have some heart benefits, but too much is risky. Men should have no more than two alcoholic drinks and women should have no more than one per day. \n\n【36】**Eat smart.** Eat whole foods and avoid trans fats, which can be found in many baked goods and deep-fried and processed foods. Get plenty of fiber-rich foods, such as fruits and veggies, whole grains, and beans. Limit salt and aim to have two servings of fatty fish, such as salmon, tuna, or mackerel, a week. They’re high in heart-healthy omega-3 fats.\n\n【37】**Exercise regularly.** You’ll want to get at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise (like hiking or going for a bike ride that makes your heart beat faster but not race) on 5 or more days a week. Speak with your doctor before you begin a new exercise routine.\n\n【38】**Manage your stress level.** Use strategies such as exercise, meditation, and other healthy activities that relax you.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:45:12", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:45:38", "cost": 25.64}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:05", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:45:38", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:45:12"}

It contains 2 medications : cabotegravir and rilpivirine. It helps to decrease the amount of HIV in your body so your immune system can work better. This lowers your chance of getting HIV complications (such as new infections, cancer ) and improves your quality of life. Cabotegravir is an integrase inhibitor while rilpivirine is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). Both drugs block the virus from growing and infecting more cells.Cabotegravir/rilpivirine is not a cure for HIV infection.

It can affect any part of your digestive tract, but  most often involves your small intestine and colon (large intestine).\n\n【2】Crohn's and another disease, ulcerative colitis (UC) , are part of a group of conditions called inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).\n\n【3】There's no cure for Crohn's, but treatment can ease your symptoms and help you enjoy a full, active life.\n\n【4】Crohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of your digestive tract. Photo Credit: Moment / Getty Images\n\n【5】Symptoms of Crohn's Disease \n----------------------------\n\n【6】People with Crohn's disease can have intense symptoms, followed by periods of no symptoms that may last for weeks or years. The symptoms depend on where the disease happens and how serious it is. \n\n【7】**What are the first signs of Crohn's disease?**\n\n【8】Early signs of Crohn's disease can easily be mistaken for other conditions. Theyh may include:\n\n【9】*   Frequent diarrhea\n*   Abdominal pain and tenderness\n*   Unexplained weight loss\n*   Blood in your poop\n\n【10】**Other symptoms of Crohn's disease**\n\n【11】When it advances, you might notice:\n\n【12】*   Nausea\n*   Tiredness\n*   Joint pain\n*   Fever\n*   Long-lasting diarrhea, often bloody and with mucus or pus\n*   Weight loss\n*   Mouth sores\n\n【13】Learn more about Crohn's disease symptoms.\n\n【14】Types of Crohn's Disease\n------------------------\n\n【15】There are five types of Crohn's, based on which part of your digestive tract is affected.\n\n【16】*   **Ileocolitis**, the most common form of Crohn's disease, involves your colon and the last part of your small intestine (called the ileum or terminal ileum).\n*   **Crohn's colitis or granulomatous colitis** affects only your colon.\n*   **Gastroduodenal Crohn's disease** affects your stomach and the first part of your small intestine (called the duodenum).\n*   **Ileitis** affects your ileum.\n*   **Jejunoileitis** causes small areas of inflammation in the upper half of your small intestine (called the jejunum).\n\n【17】Causes of Crohn's Disease\n-------------------------\n\n【18】Doctors aren't sure what causes Crohn's disease. Some people think of it as an autoimmune disease. Research suggests that long-term inflammation may not happen because your immune system attacks your own body but because it attacks a harmless virus, bacteria, or food in your gut.\n\n【19】**Is Crohn's disease contagious?**\n\n【20】Although its causes are unclear, it can't spread from person to person.\n\n【21】Crohn's Disease Risk Factors\n----------------------------\n\n【22】A few things can make you more likely to get Crohn’s:\n\n【23】*   **Genes.** Crohn's disease is often inherited. About 20% of people who have it have a close relative with either Crohn's or UC.\n*   **Age.** Though it can affect people of all ages, it's mostly an illness of the young. Most people are diagnosed before age 30, but the disease can affect people in their 50s, 60s, 70s, or even later in life.\n*   **Smoking****.** This is one risk factor that's easy to control. Smoking can make Crohn's more serious and raisethe odds that you’ll need surgery.\n*   **Medications.** Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, naproxen, and similar medications don't cause Crohn's disease, but they can lead to inflammation of the bowels that makes it worse.\n*   **Where you live.** People who live in urban areas or industrialized countries are more likely to get Crohn's.\n*   **Diet****.** If you eat a lot of high-fat or processed foods, your odds could go up.\n*   **Infection.** Bacteria linked to Crohn's disease include _Mycobacterium aviumparatuberculosis_, which causes a similar condition in cattle, along with a type of _Escherichia coli_.\n\n【24】**Crohn's disease epidemiology**\n\n【25】The disease is most often found in North America and Western Europe, where it affects 100-300 out of every 100,000 people.\n\n【26】In the U.S. more than half a million people have it. Researchers think cases are increasing in the U.S. and some other nations.\n\n【27】Crohn's disease seems to affect men and women at similar rates. People of northern European or central European Jewish (Ashkenazi) descent are at  highest risk.\n\n【28】Crohn's Disease Diagnosis\n-------------------------\n\n【29】If you have symptoms of Crohn's disease, your doctor will try to figure out whether you have Crohn's disease or another condition like ulcerative colitis.\n\n【30】**Tests for Crohn's disease**\n\n【31】Your doctor will review your medical history and talk about your symptoms. Then they might order some lab tests, such as:\n\n【32】*   **Blood** **tests**, including blood counts\n*   **Stool samples** to rule out infections as the cause of diarrhea\n*   **Imaging tests****:**\n    *   **MRI****.** This shows your doctor a clear picture of the inside of your body without using radiation.\n    *   **CT scan****.** This test uses X-rays to make detailed images of your internal organs.\n*   **Endoscopy****.** Your doctor might send you to a gastroenterologist to get one of these:\n    *   **Balloon-assisted enteroscopy.** This test uses balloons that inflate and deflate to pull a flexible tube called an endoscope through your small intestine. A tiny camera on one end gives a view of the inside of your guts.\n    *   **Capsule endoscopy.** You'll swallow a tiny, pill-sized camera to give the doctor a closer look at your small intestine.\n    *   **Upper endoscopy**. The doctor performs this to see your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum.\n    *   **Colonoscopy or** **sigmoidoscopy****.** This gives the doctor a clear picture of your intestines and lets them take a tissue sample to study.\n\n【33】Learn more about how doctors diagnose Crohn's disease.\n\n【34】Stages of Crohn's Disease\n-------------------------\n\n【35】Crohn's disease often gets worse over time. An endoscopy can show your doctor how much inflammation you have in your intestines. That, along with your symptoms, helps them know how advanced your Crohn's disease is.\n\n【36】**Mild Crohn's disease**\n\n【37】People with mild Crohn's disease have symptoms like diarrhea, but they don't have:\n\n【38】*   Fever\n*   Major weight loss\n*   Signs of infection or blockages in their intestines\n\n【39】**Moderate to severe Crohn's disease**\n\n【40】Along with diarrhea and abdominal pain or tenderness, you could have:\n\n【41】*   Fever\n*   Nausea or vomiting\n*   Noticeable weight loss\n\n【42】**Severe Crohn's disease**\n\n【43】This stage may bring:\n\n【44】*   Blockages or infections in your intestines \n*   Symptoms that don't respond to treatment\n*   Symptoms in places other than your digestive tract, such as your skin, eyes, joints, liver, and kidneys\n\n【45】Crohn's Disease Treatment\n-------------------------\n\n【46】There's no single treatment that's right for everyone with Crohn's disease. Your treatment will depend on what's causing your symptoms and how serious they are. Your doctor will try to reduce the inflammation in your digestive tract and keep you from having complications.\n\n【47】**Medications for Crohn's disease**\n\n【48】Crohn's disease is mostly treated with medications, including:\n\n【49】*   **Anti-inflammatory drugs.** Examples include mesalamine (Asacol, Lialda, Pentasa), olsalazine (Dipentum), and sulfasalazine (Azulfidine). Side effects include upset stomach, headache, nausea, diarrhea, and rash. These medicines are used only in mild cases.\n*   **Corticosteroids**, a more powerful type of anti-inflammatory drug. Examples include budesonide (Entocort) and prednisone or methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol). If you take these for a long time, side effects can be serious and may include bone thinning, muscle loss, skin problems, and a higher risk of infection.\n*   **Immune system modifiers (immunomodulators),** such as azathioprine (Imuran, Azasan) and methotrexate (Rheumatrex, Trexall). It can take up to 6 months for these drugs to work. They also bring a higher risk of infections that could be life-threatening.\n*   **Antibiotics** such as ciprofloxacin (Cipro) and metronidazole (Flagyl) to fight infections in your digestive system caused by Crohn's disease. Metronidazole can cause a metallic taste in your mouth, nausea, and tingling, or numbness of your hands and feet. Ciprofloxacin can cause nausea and tears in your Achilles tendon.\n*   **Drugs for diarrhea** including loperamide in small doses.\n\n【50】**Biologic medicines** may be included in your treatment if you have moderate to severe Crohn's disease. The anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs are often the first choice and include:\n\n【51】*   Adalimumab (Humira)\n*   Adalimumab-atto (Amjevita)\n*   Certolizumab pegol (Cimzia)\n*   Infliximab (Remicade)\n*   Infliximab-abda (Renflexis)\n*   Infliximab-dyyb (Inflectra)\n*   Infliximab-axxq (Avsola)\n\n【52】Other biologics approved for Crohn's disease include:\n\n【53】*   Natalizumab (Tysabri)\n*   Risankizumab-rzaa (Skyrizi)\n*   Ustekinumab (Stelara)\n*   Vedolizumab (Entyvio)\n\n【54】Once you start treatment, your doctor will check back in several weeks to see how well it works. You'll continue treatment until you reach remission (when your symptoms ease). When that happens, your doctor may prescribe \"maintenance therapy\" to keep your symptoms at bay. If you don't get better, you'll need stronger treatment. Your doctor may suggest nutritional supplements , too.\n\n【55】Learn more about Crohn's disease medications.\n\n【56】**Surgeries for Crohn's disease**\n\n【57】About 66%-75% of people with Crohn's disease will need surgery. It can help with complications or when medications don't work. Common procedures include:\n\n【58】*   **Resection.** Your surgeon removes the diseased part of the bowel and joins the two healthy ends together. Many people are symptom-free for years afterward, but it isn't a cure. Crohn's disease often comes back at the site of the connection, called the anastomosis.\n*   **Ileostomy****.** You might need this if your rectum is diseased and the doctor can't use it for an anastomosis. This procedure connects your intestine to the skin of your torso. It leaves an opening in your skin, where body wastes collect in a pouch that you can empty.\n\n【59】**Complementary and alternative treatment options for Crohn's disease**\n\n【60】When you use nonmedical treatment options instead of medical ones, they're called alternative therapies. Those used along with medical treatments are called complementary therapies.\n\n【61】Medication is the main treatment for Crohn's disease, but many people use complementary therapies to help ease symptoms. They include:\n\n【62】*   Mind-body therapies such as relaxation, meditation, hypnosis, acupuncture, yoga, and exercise\n*   Dietary supplements like omega-3 fatty acids and curcumin\n*   Probiotics, foods, or supplements containing microorganisms that boost \"good\" bacteria in your gut\n*   Medical cannabis\n\n【63】Research on many of these treatments is ongoing. Talk with your doctor before trying any of them.\n\n【64】**Home remedies for Crohn's disease**\n\n【65】Some things you can do on your own may also help relieve your Crohn's symptoms.\n\n【66】*   **Avoid NSAIDs.** Use acetaminophen instead.\n*   **Quit smoking****.** This may help reduce flare-ups, lessen the amount of medication you need, and lower your chances of surgery.\n*   **Manage stress****.** Stress doesn't cause Crohn's disease, but it can make symptoms worse. Try some of the mind-body therapies above, such as meditation or yoga.\n\n【67】Find out about the latest treatments for Crohn's disease.\n\n【68】Crohn's Disease Disparities\n---------------------------\n\n【69】White people are most likely to develop Crohn's disease. But cases of Crohn's disease and other types of IBD have been increasing among Black, Hispanic, and Asian people, as well as those of other ethnicities.\n\n【70】Doctors may be less likely to look for IBD in minorities, which could lead to later diagnosis and treatment. This may be one reason Black people tend to have more serious cases of IBD than white people, and the condition is more likely to seriously affect their daily lives.\n\n【71】Studies report that Black people with IBD are also less likely to get advanced treatments such as biologics and immunomodulators. They're less likely to be in remission from Crohn's disease, more likely to have surgery for it, and more likely to get complications after the surgery.\n\n【72】All the reasons for these differences aren't clear. Things that may play a role include:\n\n【73】*   Access to medical care\n*   Insurance coverage\n*   Bias among doctors\n*   Differences in diet and environment\n\n【74】Crohn's Disease Complications\n-----------------------------\n\n【75】Crohn's disease causes two types of complications:\n\n【76】*   **Local,** which affect just your intestines\n*   **Systemic,** which affect your whole body. You might also hear them called extraintestinal complications.\n\n【77】Local complications of Crohn's disease include:\n\n【78】*   **Abscess****.** This pocket of pus occurs because of a bacterial infection. It can form on the walls of your intestines and bulge out, or you might get one near your anus that looks like a boil. You'd notice swelling, tenderness, pain, and fever.\n*   **Bile salt diarrhea.** Crohn's disease most often affects the lower end of your intestine (ileum). This part usually absorbs bile acids, which your body makes to help it absorb fat. If your body can't process the fat, you could get this type of diarrhea.\n*   **Fissure.** This is a painful tear in the lining of the anus. It can cause bleeding during bowel movements.\n*   **Fistulas.** Sores or ulcers can turn into openings called fistulas that connect two parts of your intestine. They can also tunnel into nearby tissues, such as the bladder, vagina, and skin.\n*   **Malabsorption and malnutrition.** Crohn's disease affects your small intestine—the part of your body that absorbs nutrients from food. After you've had it for a long time, your body may no longer be able to get enough nutrients from what you eat.\n*   **Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.** Your gut is full of bacteria that help you break down food. When this happens higher up in your digestive tract than usual, you can get gas, bloating, abdominal pain, and diarrhea.\n*   **Strictures.** These narrowed, thickened areas of your intestines result from the inflammation that comes with Crohn's disease. They can be mild or serious depending on how much of your intestine is blocked. Symptoms include cramping, abdominal pain, and bloating.\n\n【79】Systemic complications include:\n\n【80】**Arthritis****.** Joint inflammation, which leads to pain, swelling, and lack of flexibility, is the most common systemic complication. Three types of arthritis sometimes come with Crohn's disease:\n\n【81】*   **Peripheral.** This type affects large joints in your arms and legs, such as your elbows, knees, wrists, and ankles.\n*   **Axial.** This type affects your spine or lower back (the doctor may call it your sacroiliac joint).\n*   **Ankylosing spondylitis****.** This more serious type of spinal arthritis is rare among people with Crohn's, but it can happen. It can also lead to inflammation in your eyes, lungs, and heart valves.\n\n【82】**Skin problems****.** These are the second most common systemic complications. Those most often linked to Crohn's include:\n\n【83】*   **Erythema nodosum****.** These small, tender, red nodules usually show up on your shins, ankles, and sometimes arms.\n*   **Pyoderma gangrenosum.** These pus-filled sores often follow an injury or other skin trauma. They often appear on your legs but can show up anywhere.\n*   **Skin tags****.** These small flaps of skin are common in people with Crohn's disease, especially around the anus.\n*   **Mouth** **ulcers.** You might hear them called canker sores. They form between your gum and lower lip or along the sides and bottom of your tongue.\n\n【84】**Bone loss.** Medications like steroids can lead to bone loss, a condition known as osteoporosis. They can:\n\n【85】*   Stop your body from absorbing calcium, which it needs to build bones\n*   Make your body get rid of calcium when you pee\n*   Boost production of cells that break down bones\n*   Lower the number of cells that help form bones\n*   Lower your body's output of estrogen, which also helps build bones\n\n【86】The proteins that cause inflammation can also change the speed at which your body removes and makes bones.\n\n【87】**Lack of** **vitamin D****.** If your body can't absorb vitamin D because of Crohn's damage to your small intestine, or if part of your small intestine has been removed, you're less likely to be able to absorb calcium and make new bones.\n\n【88】**Eye problems****.** Inflammation due to Crohn's disease can affect your eyes in several ways. Common conditions include:\n\n【89】*   **Episcleritis****.** Inflammation of the area just below the conjunctiva (the clear tissue that covers the inside of your eyelids and the white of your eye) is the most common complication of Crohn's. It can affect one eye or both the eyes. You'll notice pain, itching, burning, and severe redness, but it won't usually affect your vision.\n*   **Scleritis****.** This condition causes constant pain that gets worse when you move your eyes.\n*   **Uveitis****.** This is a painful inflammation of the uvea, the middle layer of your eye. It can cause blurry vision, light sensitivity, and redness.\n\n【90】**Kidney** **problems.** These organs can be affected  because they play a role in processing waste and are near your intestines. Potential issues include:\n\n【91】*   **Kidney stones****.** They're a common problem with Crohn's. One type happens when a salt called oxalate gets absorbed into your kidneys and turns into stones. Another type, called uric acid stones, form when your body can't absorb all the uric acid that it makes.\n*   **Hydronephrosis.** This happens when the ileum (where the small intestine meets the large) swells because of Crohn's and puts pressure on the ureter,  the tube that carries urine from your kidney to your bladder. When urine can't drain as it should, your kidney swells, and scar tissue can form.\n*   **Fistulas.** In addition to forming within your intestines, fistulas can form between the intestine and other organs, like your bladder or ureter.\n\n【92】**Liver problems****.** Your liver processes everything you eat and drink. It can get inflamed as a result of Crohn's disease treatment or the disease itself. You're likely to only notice low energy and fatigue unless you get a more serious problem. Among the most common issues are:\n\n【93】*   **Fatty liver disease****.** When your body doesn't process fats well, they can build up in your liver. Steroids can also cause fatty liver disease.\n*   **Gallstones****.** When Crohn's disease affects the ileum, it can't process bile salts, which help dissolve cholesterol. The cholesterol can form stones that block the opening between your liver and the bile duct.\n*   **Hepatitis****.** Long-term liver inflammation can result from Crohn's disease itself.\n*   **Pancreatitis****.** Inflammation of your pancreas can result from both gallstones and medications. It can cause pain, nausea, vomiting, and fever.\n\n【94】**Physical development problems.** Crohn's can start at any age. When kids get it, parents are likely to notice:\n\n【95】*   **Growth failure.** Kids  who haveh Crohn's  are likely to be shorter and weigh less than those who don't. They may stop getting taller before their symptoms start.\n*   **Delayed** **puberty****.** Kids with Crohn's disease are likely to start puberty later.\n\n【96】Most studies link Crohn's disease to a very small but real increase in the risk of early death. Usually, the causes are not Crohn's disease itself but related complications, which include infections, a tear in the bowels, and deadly reactions to steroids and other treatments.\n\n【97】Living With Crohn's Disease\n---------------------------\n\n【98】Daily life with Crohn's disease has its challenges. Your symptoms can leave you feeling tired and drained. They may also be embarrassing. You might avoid socializing or other activities you enjoy.\n\n【99】The most important step in managing Crohn's disease is to work closely with your doctor to find the right treatment. But self-care is also essential.\n\n【100】**Crohn's disease diet**\n\n【101】Foods don't seem to cause Crohn's disease, but soft, bland things may cause fewer symptoms than spicy or high-fiber foods when the disease is active. Most doctors try to be flexible in planning the diets of people with Crohn's.\n\n【102】You might also try an elimination diet, which can help you figure out which foods trigger symptoms of Crohn's disease. You'll remove things from your diet one at a time to see what happens. Work with your doctor or a dietitian to make sure you don't miss out on any nutrients while you're doing it.\n\n【103】See how you feel after cutting back on:\n\n【104】*   Greasy or fried foods\n*   Processed foods\n*   Dairy products\n*   Carbonated drinks\n*   Caffeine\n*   High-fiber foods like nuts, seeds, and raw vegetables\n*   Foods that can cause gas, such as beans and cruciferous veggies\n\n【105】**Cost of Crohn's disease**\n\n【106】Crohn's disease can take a toll on your pocketbook as well as your body. One study reported that people with IBD spent more than $2,200 out-of- pocket for health care each year, That's more than twice what people without IBD paid.\n\n【107】Medications for Crohn's disease can be very expensive. For example, a single dose of a biologic drug can cost thousands of dollars before insurance.\n\n【108】Work time lost to sick days and medical appointments can add up, too. Research shows that people with IBD lose about $3,000 in wages per year.\n\n【109】**Managing Crohn's disease**\n\n【110】To minimize flare-ups and protect your health, take these steps:\n\n【111】**Get enough sleep.** Losing sleep can make inflammation worse and affect your mood. But many people with Crohn's disease have trouble getting enough shut-eye, especially when they're having a flare. Adopt healthy sleep habits: Go to sleep and get up at about the same time every day, and avoid electronic devices around bedtime.\n\n【112】**Stay active**. Regular exercise helps with symptoms of Crohn's disease, boosts mood, and reduces stress. Low-impact, moderate activities like walking, biking, swimming, and yoga are often best for people with IBD. Talk with your doctor about what workouts might be right for you.\n\n【113】**Stay hydrated**. It's easy to get dehydrated when your body is losing lots of fluid through diarrhea. Make sure you drink enough fluids, especially when you're exercising or it's hot outside. Water is best, since juices and sodas might make your symptoms worse. A good rule of thumb is to drink eight glasses of water a day, though some people need more than that and some less.\n\n【114】**Track your symptoms.** Whether you use a smartphone app or a paper notebook, keeping track of your symptoms can help you recognize flare-ups early on and figure out what might trigger them. It can also help your doctor understand what your condition looks like between visits. Let your doctor know if you have signs of a flare.\n\n【115】**Crohn's disease and mental health** \n\n【116】Dealing with a lifelong disease like Crohn's disease can wreak havoc on your quality of life and your emotions. That's one reason people with Crohn's disease are at a higher risk of depression than others. Stress and anxiety can affect you, too, and can make your symptoms worse.\n\n【117】If you're feeling sad, stressed, or overwhelmed:\n\n【118】**Try a support group.** Talking to people who are in the same boat can be reassuring and uplifting. Support groups are also good places to hear about the latest therapies and lifestyle changes that have helpedothers. There are plenty of online support groups. If you prefer an in-person group, your doctor may be able to help you find one.\n\n【119】**Seek therapy.** Look for a mental health professional experienced in treating people with IBD. Cognitive behavioral therapy, gut-directed hypnotherapy, or mindfulness therapy are some of the types of psychotherapy you might consider.\n\n【120】**Talk with your doctor.** They may recommend antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications. These medications may be most effective when you use them together with psychotherapy.\n\n【121】Crohn's Disease Prognosis\n-------------------------\n\n【122】Crohn's disease doesn't usually shorten your life. Most people with Crohn's disease are able to live productive and fulfilling lives, especially when they get effective treatment.\n\n【123】**Is there a cure for Crohn's disease?**\n\n【124】Existing treatments can't cure Crohn's disease, but they can help relieve symptoms, reduce flare-ups, and help you avoid possibly serious complications.\n\n【125】**What to expect with Crohn's disease**\n\n【126】Crohn's disease is a lifelong disease whose course varies a lot from person to person. Doctors can't predict how it will affect you.\n\n【127】It might be mild or serious. You could have periods of symptoms that can last days, weeks, or months, followed by periods of remission that can last days, weeks, or years. There's often no way to predict when you'll have a flare.\n\n【128】Conditions Similar to Crohn's Disease\n-------------------------------------\n\n【129】**Ulcerative coitis**, the other form of IBD, has symptoms very similar to those of Crohn's disease. It also tends to affect people younger than age 30.\n\n【130】UC causes inflammation only in the colon, while Crohn's disease can affect any part of your digestive tract from the mouth to the anus. Crohn's disease usually affects your bowel in patches, but with UC, you have continuous stretches of inflammation.\n\n【131】Other conditions that could look like Crohn's disease include:\n\n【132】*   **Irritable bowel syndrome** , a common digestive disorder whose symptoms may include abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, gas, or bloating.\n*   **Celiac disease,** an immune system reaction to gluten (a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye) that can damage your intestines. Symptoms include diarrhea, tiredness, and weight loss.\n*   **Food allergy**, in which certain foods trigger an allergic reaction in your body. Symptoms can include abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea. Some people have much more serious symptoms such as trouble breathing.\n*   **Colon cancer,** which could cause weight loss, abdominal pain, and blood in your poop.\n\n【133】Takeaways\n---------\n\n【134】While there's no cure for Crohn's disease, treatment can ease symptoms and help prevent complications. Work with your doctor to find the right treatment.

When you light them, they give out a warm, reddish-pink glow.\n\n【2】Sellers of these decorative pieces say they do more than light up a room. They claim the lamps can boost mood, improve sleep, ease allergies, help people with asthma breathe better, and clean the air, among other benefits.\n\n【3】The claims sound impressive. Yet the scientific evidence to back them up is scarce.\n\n【4】The salt in these lamps comes from the Himalayas, a mountain range that stretches about 1,500 miles across Pakistan, India, Bhutan, and Nepal.\n\n【5】True Himalayan salt lamps come from the Khewra Salt Mine in Pakistan. The salt this mine produces has a reddish, pink, or off-white color.\n\n【6】There are plenty of fake ones sold online. The real versions are fragile and give off a dim light. The phony products are tough to break and glow brightly.\n\n【7】How Do Himalayan Salt Lamps Work?\n---------------------------------\n\n【8】Advocates say the lamps work in two ways:\n\n【9】**Pull in particles.** These lamps supposedly attract allergens, toxins, and pollutants to their surface.\n\n【10】**Possibly release negative ions.** Some people believe negative ions in the air have health benefits.\n\n【11】Ions are molecules that have undergone a change in charge. Negative ions have gained an electron. Positive ions have lost one.\n\n【12】Ions are all around us. Some come from particles from outer space that make their way to Earth. Others form closer to home, from radiation, sunlight, lightning, or the collision of water droplets in a waterfall.\n\n【13】Some people say they feel more refreshed and clear-headed after a storm, a feeling they believe is due to the amount of negative ions in the air. Commercial ionizers and purification systems also produce negatively charged ions to create cleaner and more comfortable indoor spaces.\n\n【14】Himalayan salt lamps supposedly produce negatively charged ions while water molecules from the air attract to -- and then evaporate from -- the warmth of its surface. Those who believe in the health benefits of these lamps give negative ions much of the credit.\n\n【15】Claims About Himalayan Salt Lamps\n---------------------------------\n\n【16】Although a few studies show some benefits from negative ions, the evidence that salt lamps improve health is lacking.\n\n【17】**Mood and** **sleep.** Some people believe that positive ions in the air increase anxiety, crankiness, and other unpleasant feelings. They say that negative ones ease stress, anxiety, and depression, and improve overall well-being.\n\n【18】Studies with mice and rats suggest that high amounts of negative air ions alter levels of serotonin, a chemical that contributes to feelings of well-being.\n\n【19】In some human studies, negative ions at high concentrations did lessen depression slightly, but they didn't have much of an effect on anxiety levels or sleep.\n\n【20】A very small study shows that people did better on thinking skills tests when they were in a room where the paint on the walls had a high concentration of total air ions (both positive and negative ions). But the paint had no effect on their general well-being.\n\n【21】**Asthma and allergies.** The notion that negative ions may improve breathing has led to a few studies on the topic. In most of them, negative ions didn't ease breathing or asthma symptoms. They also didn't lower inhaler use in children and adults with chronic asthma.\n\n【22】**Cleaning the air.** Negative ions do have some ability to clean harmful particles from the air. When ions build up on bacteria or pollen, they neutralize the pollutants. Studies suggest that negative and positive ions may kill germs, though exactly how isn't clear, and some experts say the germ-killing may be due to other reasons. In any case, there's no evidence salt lamps have this effect.\n\n【23】Do Himalayan Salt Lamps Have Health Benefits?\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【24】Though the claims sound promising, so far no one has proved that Himalayan salt lamps release negative ions, let alone enough to have any impact on health.

A long-lasting condition like multiple sclerosis is different. It can affect your life in many ways.\n\n【1】It doesn't have to keep you from being happy, though. A positive attitude can be one of the best ways to handle the changes MS can bring. The condition shouldn't define who you are. You just have an extra challenge in your day-to-day life.\n\n【2】Here are some ways to stay upbeat:\n\n【3】Take Care of Your Mind\n----------------------\n\n【4】**Get help if you need it.** If you’re struggling with the disease’s impact on your life, reach out to someone. Sometimes just talking about what’s bothering you can lighten your mental load. It will also help you understand and better manage the many effects of MS.\n\n【5】A mental health professional can listen to what’s troubling you and make a treatment plan to meet your needs. Some therapies help you regain a sense of control over your life. If you’re depressed, medications also can help lift your mood.\n\n【6】**Find a support group.** One of the best resources is other people who live with MS. Support groups give you a place to learn new ways to handle your condition and a chance to share how you’re feeling with others who understand what it’s like. It always helps to know you’re not alone.\n\n【7】**Consider counseling.** If there’s a problem you’d rather handle in a one-on-one atmosphere, talk to a counselor or therapist. You’ll feel safer discussing sensitive or private feelings about MS and its impact on your life and relationships.\n\n【8】**Keep a diary.** Write down how you’re feeling. Not only will this be valuable info to share with your doctor, but it will also help you learn to express yourself.\n\n【9】**Take control.** MS comes with a lot of uncertainty, so it may help to take charge of the things in your life that you can control. Also keep in mind some of your life-planning issues, such as finances, work, and adapting your home.\n\n【10】Get More Rest\n-------------\n\n【11】**Head off fatigue.** Take a nap if you need it. But keep it to less than 2 hours. Any longer and you might not be able to fall asleep at night.\n\n【12】**Fall asleep easier.** Listen to relaxing music before you hit the hay. Cut out screen time half an hour before you go to bed. A bad email could ramp up your stress. Plus, your brain sees blue light from your gadgets as daylight and thinks you need to be awake.\n\n【13】**Improve your sleep****.** Try meditation, deep breathing, or yoga during the day.\n\n【14】**Prevent pit stops.** Do you wake up at night with a need to go? Skip that glass of water before bed.\n\n【15】Watch What You Eat and Drink\n----------------------------\n\n【16】**Boost your energy:** Instead of three big meals a day, eat several smaller ones packed with nutrients.\n\n【17】**Avoid complications:** Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods to help prevent heart disease and diabetes, which make MS worse.\n\n【18】**Be kind to your** **bladder****:** Cut back on coffee. It increases your urge to go.\n\n【19】**Travel safely:** Stay hydrated on vacation, but be careful when it comes to local water and raw foods.\n\n【20】Put Gadgets to Work for You\n---------------------------\n\n【21】**Chill out.** Set up a fan at your desk to keep cool while you work. Wear a cooling vest when you go outside in the summer.\n\n【22】**Get a move on.** Use a motorized scooter to make shopping easier.\n\n【23】**Adapt your auto.** Install hand controls in your car so you can speed up and apply the brakes without using your feet.\n\n【24】**Use the right tool for the job.** Is food prep a real chore? Use electric can openers and forks and knives with easy-grip handles.\n\n【25】**Walk this way.** Wear lightweight shoes with good tread to avoid falling while you're out for a stroll.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:22:36", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:22:51", "cost": 14.381}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:05", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:22:51", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:22:36"}

No matter how careful you are, though, your COPD may act up from time to time.\n\n【1】When you have a flare-up like this, you may hear a doctor or nurse call this an “exacerbation.”\n\n【2】A flare-up can make you feel sick. A bad one could put you in the hospital and might make your COPD more severe. So the fewer you have, the better.\n\n【3】Awareness is key with COPD flare-ups. You know how you feel on a typical day with your breathing and how much you cough.\n\n【4】If you get an infection in your lungs or if something else irritates them -- secondhand smoke, for instance -- you might be headed for a flare-up.\n\n【5】Signs of a COPD Flare-up\n------------------------\n\n【6】You might be more short of breath or wheeze and cough more than you usually do. Other symptoms include:\n\n【7】*   Fatigue\n*   Fever\n*   Scratchy throat or other signs of a cold\n*   Coughing up more mucus than usual, or it turns green, tan, or bloody\n*   Swollen ankles\n*   Confusion\n*   Unusual sleepiness\n\n【8】What to Do When Flare-ups Happen\n--------------------------------\n\n【9】Ideally, your doctor has given you instructions for what to do, and has set you up with an inhaler and a rescue pack of drugs. If so, follow the instructions.\n\n【10】Here are some tips to help you judge how severe your flare-up is and what action to take:\n\n【11】*   **Mild --** You’re more breathless than you usually are, but you aren’t coughing up any more than usual. In this case, use your inhaler.\n*   **Moderate --** The inhaler isn’t helping, or you’re coughing up more than usual. Take your rescue-pack medicine and call your doctor.\n*   **Severe --** You keep getting worse despite the medicine, or you have a fever. Call your doctor’s office at once. If you can’t wait for the doctor, call 911.\n\n【12】Signs of an Emergency\n---------------------\n\n【13】Some flare-ups are so serious that you should call 911 right away. Here are some signs of this:\n\n【14】*   You have chest pains.\n*   Your lips or fingers turn blue.\n*   You’re very short of breath.\n*   You can’t think clearly, or you’re upset.\n*   You’re drowsy.\n\n【15】Flare-up Triggers\n-----------------\n\n【16】These are some of the things that can make your COPD worse and spark a flare-up:\n\n【17】*   Smog and other kinds of air pollution\n*   Cigarette or cigar smoke\n*   Strong fumes from perfume and other scented products\n*   Cold air or hot, humid air\n*   Ragweed and other pollens that trigger allergies\n\n【18】Tips to Prevent Flare-Ups\n-------------------------\n\n【19】Because infections or other triggers that irritate your lungs generally cause flare-ups, you need to protect yourself against things like that.\n\n【20】Start with your lifestyle, because a healthier body has the best chance to fight off germs. Eat nutritious food. Exercise. Get plenty of sleep. Also:\n\n【21】*   **Wash your hands often.** They pick up germs from things you touch. Try not to touch your eyes, nose, or mouth, because that can help germs get into your body.\n*   **Get a flu shot every year.** Also, ask your doctor about a shot to protect against pneumonia.\n*   **Carry your own pen with you**. That way, if you need to fill out paperwork at the doctor’s office or other places, you won’t handle the same pen as other people.\n*   **Show up for all of your medical appointments**. Do that even if you feel OK.\n*   **Stay away from crowds when you can.** That’s especially important during cold and flu season.\n*   **Try to avoid perfumes or the odors of household cleaning products**. Buy unscented products whenever you can.\n*   **Avoid secondhand smoke.** And if you smoke -- the cause behind many cases of COPD -- ask your doctor for help in quitting.\n*   **Be careful outdoors.** If cold air bothers you, pull up your scarf around your mouth and nose, and breathe through your nose. During hot, humid weather, stay inside with air conditioning.\n\n【22】Have a Plan\n-----------\n\n【23】No matter how careful you are, your COPD may act up sooner or later. Be prepared. Ask your doctor to help you work out an action plan to guide you.\n\n【24】Your plan should fit what you personally need, and will depend on what symptoms you have. To get an idea of what it might look like, you can see a blank form for a plan on the Canadian Lung Association website, in the sections that covers COPD. You plan should spell out things such as:\n\n【25】*   What your special flare-up medicine is and when to use it\n*   If you have an inhaler or oxygen, when to use it or use it more\n*   How you’ll know it’s time to call the doctor or call 911\n\n【26】Remember, when you start feeling bad, you have to take it seriously.\n\n【27】Flare-ups are a leading cause of disability in people with COPD. But if you take the right precautions, you can go on about your business.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:54:35", "endTime": "2024/08/21 15:00:13", "cost": 337.93}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:05", "update_time": "2024-08-20 23:00:13", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:54:35"}

It belongs to a class of drugs known as pyrethrins . Permethrin works by paralyzing and killing lice and their eggs (nits).\n\n【2】### How to use Nix Creme Rinse 1 % Topical Liquid\n\n【3】Apply this medication as soon as possible after it is prescribed. When treating head lice , apply this medication to the hair and scalp only. First wash hair with your regular shampoo, but do not use conditioner. Thoroughly rinse the shampoo out with water, and towel- dry hair . Shake this medication well before using. Cover your eyes with a towel while applying this medication. Completely cover the hair and scalp with the medicine (especially behind the ears and on the hairline at the neck). Avoid getting permethrin in your nose, ears, mouth , vagina , or eyes . If the medicine gets in any of these areas, flush with plenty of water. Do not use more medication than prescribed. Leave the medication on your hair for 10 minutes or as directed by your doctor, then rinse with warm water. Towel-dry your hair and comb out any tangles. A single permethrin treatment can help prevent lice from coming back for 14 days. If eyebrows or eyelashes are infested, do not apply this medication to those areas without first consulting your doctor.\n\n【4】Head lice lay small white eggs (nits) at the base of hair close to the scalp, especially on the hairline at the back of the neck and behind the ears. After treatment with this medication, the infected person should be checked by another person for lice and nits using a magnifying glass and bright light. To remove nits, use the special comb provided, and follow the instructions on the package. After combing, re-check the entire head every day for nits you might have missed. Remove any nits by combing, by hand using a disposable glove, or by cutting them out. If live lice are seen 7 days or more after treatment, a second treatment with permethrin or another drug may be needed.\n\n【5】Tell your doctor if your condition lasts or gets worse.\n\n【6】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【7】Scalp irritation, including itching , swelling, or redness may occur with head lice and temporarily worsen after treatment with permethrin .

Olodaterol belongs to the class of drugs known as long-acting beta agonists (LABAs). Olodaterol is also known as a bronchodilator . It works by relaxing the muscles around the airways so that they open up and you can breathe more easily. Controlling symptoms of breathing problems can decrease time lost from work or school.This medication does not work right away and should not be used for sudden attacks of breathing trouble. Your doctor must prescribe a quick-relief medicine/ inhaler (such as albuterol , also known as salbutamol) for sudden shortness of breath while you are using olodaterol. You should always have a quick-relief inhaler with you.Olodaterol is not approved to treat asthma .

Do not use more than 2 inhalations of olodaterol a day.\n\n【8】Use this medication regularly to get the most benefit from it. To help you remember, use it at the same time each day. Do not stop taking this medication without consulting your doctor.\n\n【9】If you have been using a quick-relief inhaler ( albuterol , salbutamol) on a regular daily schedule (such as 4 times daily), your doctor will direct you to stop this schedule and only use the quick-relief inhaler as needed for sudden shortness of breath. Consult your doctor for details.\n\n【10】Learn which of your inhalers you should use every day and which you should use if your breathing suddenly worsens (quick-relief drugs). Ask your doctor ahead of time what you should do if you have new or worsening cough or shortness of breath, wheezing , increased sputum, waking up at night with trouble breathing , if you use your quick-relief inhaler more often, or if your quick-relief inhaler does not seem to be working well.

Lactose is a type of sugar found in milk products. Lactase enzyme is normally produced by the body to help break down (digest) lactose. Lactose intolerance occurs when the body produces low amounts of lactase enzyme.Lactose intolerance can begin at different ages. Infants are not usually affected, but lactose intolerance can affect children as young as 2. It is very common in adults. One way to treat lactose intolerance is to avoid milk products. However, this can result in a lack of important nutrients and vitamins such as calcium , vitamin D , riboflavin, and protein. Some people use lactose-free milk or milk substitutes such as soy or rice milk. Most people with low lactase enzyme levels can tolerate small amounts of milk products at one time (2-4 ounces) and get symptoms only with larger servings (6 ounces or more). Taking lactase enzyme with milk products as directed can help prevent upset stomach , abdominal bloating /cramping, gas, and diarrhea caused by these products.The FDA has not reviewed this product for safety or effectiveness.

A medical abortion (mifepristone, also known as RU-486) is a prescription pill and can be taken at home used during the early part of a pregnancy. The type or abortion you get will probably depend almost entirely on how far you are along in your pregnancy.\n\n【1】If you’re in your first trimester, you’ll likely have a vacuum aspiration. If you’re in your second trimester (meaning that it’s been more than 13 weeks since your last menstrual period), you’ll likely have a dilation and evacuation, or D&E. If you’re further along than that, you might have a dilation and extraction, or D&X.\n\n【2】Almost all abortion procedures are out-patient, which means you won’t have to stay overnight in the doctor’s office, clinic, or hospital afterward.\n\n【3】Before the Procedure\n--------------------\n\n【4】When you schedule your appointment, your health care provider will probably give you some instructions over the phone. Because in-clinic abortions are considered surgeries, you may have to fast starting around midnight the night before your procedure.\n\n【5】When you arrive at the clinic, you’ll fill out some paperwork and answer questions about your medical history. You’ll then get a pre-abortion workup, which includes a physical examination, pregnancy test, blood test, screening for sexually transmitted infections, and possibly additional testing, if your case warrants it. Many providers will also use an ultrasound to confirm how far along you are in your pregnancy and check for uterine, fetal, or placental abnormalities.\n\n【6】All of this information, which your doctor will discuss with you during a short counseling session, will help them determine which procedure is right for you.\n\n【7】Pain Management\n---------------\n\n【8】Your doctor will also talk to you about different types of pain management available to you during the procedure.\n\n【9】For an in-clinic abortion, you’ll probably get local anesthesia, meaning that your cervix will be numbed but you’ll be awake. While 600 to 800 milligrams of ibuprofen usually provides enough pain relief, your doctor might also offer you an oral medication to calm you down or mildly sedate you, so you’re awake but relaxed. If you prefer heavy sedation, meaning you’re in a light sleep throughout the procedure, you can ask if a sedative medication can be given to you through an IV.\n\n【10】Vacuum Aspiration (Suction Abortion)\n------------------------------------\n\n【11】Most abortions done in the U.S. take place in the first 12 to 13 weeks of pregnancy. If you opt for an in-clinic abortion in your first trimester, you’ll have a vacuum aspiration, which you may also hear called a “suction abortion.”\n\n【12】In most cases, your cervix doesn’t need to be prepped or dilated for this procedure. But if you’re more than about 10 to 12 weeks pregnant, your health care provider may take steps to open your cervix a bit before getting started so that the medical tools can access your uterus. They’ll likely insert little sticks made of sterilized seaweed that absorb moisture and expand, called laminaria.\n\n【13】Once you’re ready for the procedure, your health care provider will have you lie on an exam table with your feet in stirrups, like you’re having a pelvic exam.\n\n【14】When you’re comfortable and sedated, if you so choose, your health care provider will insert a medical tool called a speculum into your vagina to keep it open, and swab your vagina and cervix with an antiseptic solution called Betadine.\n\n【15】They’ll inject an anesthetic into the cervix to numb it, holding your cervix in place with a grasping instrument. They’ll then insert a small tube attached to either a hand-held syringe or a suction machine into your uterus, and clear out its contents. From start to finish, the procedure takes several minutes.\n\n【16】Afterward, your doctor will check to make sure that the procedure was successful, and then let you rest for about 30 minutes under observation.\n\n【17】Second Trimester: Dilation and Evacuation\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【18】If you’re more than 12 weeks pregnant, your provider will use an ultrasound to date your pregnancy. The farther along you are, the more prep work you may have to undergo to prepare your body for the procedure.\n\n【19】While doctors can do vacuum aspirations until about 14 weeks, the most common type of second-trimester abortion is called dilation and evacuation, or D&E.\n\n【20】The first step a provider will take before this procedure is to prepare and dilate your cervix so that it’s not injured in the procedure. They will likely use laminaria sticks, which might be left in overnight. They might also give you a dose of a medication such as misoprostol, either by mouth or through your vagina, to soften your uterus. They may also use tools to help dilate your cervix.\n\n【21】Like a first-trimester abortion, you’ll lie on an exam table with your feet in stirrups, and your health care provider will swab your vagina and cervix with Betadine, inject anesthesia into your cervix, and then use a gripping tool to hold your cervix in place.\n\n【22】The main difference is that in addition to using a vacuum suction in your uterus, they’ll also use forceps and other medical tools, including one called a curette to scrape the inside of your uterus. Your doctor may use ultrasound to guide them, and will likely use a suction or vacuum to make sure everything is cleared out. Some providers may use a medication, which you would get as a shot into your abdomen, to stop the fetal heartbeat before the procedure. Afterward, your provider may give you a medication to contract your uterus and reduce bleeding.\n\n【23】This procedure takes 10 to 20 minutes. You’ll rest for 30 minutes to an hour while your health care providers make sure you’re well.\n\n【24】Late-Term Abortion: Dilation and Extraction\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【25】If you’re having an abortion further along in your pregnancy, you may have to find a specialized, experienced provider to do a dilation and extraction procedure, or D&X. This is a procedure that doctors usually reserve for when there is a serious problem with the fetus or medical complications related to the mother.\n\n【26】All the steps leading up to the procedure and steps taken after the procedure are the same as for a D&E, including the ultrasound to date your pregnancy and prep work to soften and dilate your cervix.\n\n【27】For sedation, you might be offered a general IV anesthesia, especially if the procedure is done in a hospital.\n\n【28】There are a few other options, like labor induction, hysterotomy and hysterectomy. But because they are riskier, doctors only do them if medically necessary.\n\n【29】How Much Does an Abortion Cost?\n-------------------------------\n\n【30】The amount may depend on how many weeks pregnant you are, if you get anesthesia or sedation for pain or discomfort, your financial situation, and where you get the procedure. Many clinics offer free or sliding-scale payment options based on how much money you make. To explore these options, look into your local Planned Parenthood or other women’s health clinics.\n\n【31】Generally, without other help, you can expect to pay anywhere from:\n\n【32】*   $430 to $600 if you’re 4 to 12 weeks from your last menstrual period (LMP)\n*   $540 to $1,100 if you’re 13 to 16 weeks from your LMP\n*   $900 to $1,850 if you’re 17 to 21 weeks from your LMP\n\n【33】Suction termination (also called suction curettage or vacuum aspiration abortion) may range around $500 to $700. Dilation and evacuation abortions, which are usually for later-stage pregnancies, range from $800 to $2,500. But in some areas, these prices could be as little as $300. In other cases, they may be more expensive depending on your medical needs.\n\n【34】If you get conscious sedation as opposed to local anesthetic, your cost may be on the higher end.\n\n【35】If you’re 5-10 weeks pregnant, you can use the abortion pill to end a pregnancy. It usually costs about $500 to $1,500.\n\n【36】Paying for Abortions\n--------------------\n\n【37】In some states, you may only be able to get an abortion if you get pregnant because of rape, incest, or if the pregnancy threatens your life. In these situations, you may be able to receive financial help from the government. The facility that does your abortion will need to apply for government funds in these cases. Ask your provider to complete an application if you need financial help.\n\n【38】If you have Medicaid, you can get financial help for an abortion. Some states, including California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, and New Jersey, also choose to use their funds to help people with abortion costs.\n\n【39】If you have insurance, abortions might be covered, depending on the rules of the state you’re insured in. Some states have stricter rules than others. If your insurance covers your abortion, it may be free. In some situations, you may have to pay a copay, just like with other medical procedures.\n\n【40】For example, Texas only allows abortion coverage if the pregnancy could severely threaten your health or life.\n\n【41】If you need a low-cost or free abortion, there are organizations that can help. You can find more information at:\n\n【42】*   The National Abortion Federation: Visit prochoice.org or call 800-772-9100.\n*   Planned Parenthood: Visit plannedparenthood.org or call 800-230-7526.\n*   National Network of Abortion Funds: Visit abortionfunds.org to find local organizations that can offer financial help.\n\n【43】What Happens Next?\n------------------\n\n【44】Once your procedure is done, you’ll rest at the clinic under supervision for about 30 minutes. You can then continue to relax in a recovery area until you’re ready to head home. If you’ve had any sedation, you’ll need someone to drive you. You’ll get a prescription for an antibiotic, too.\n\n【45】You’ll probably have some cramping for a few days and light bleeding for up to 2 weeks. Most pain and cramping is effectively treated with an over the counter or prescription painkiller like acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or codeine.\n\n【46】Plan to rest on the day of your procedure. You may need a few more days of rest if you had a D&E or D&X. You shouldn’t lift anything heavy for a few days. Ask your doctor when it would be OK to have sex or use a tampon again -- it may be up to a month before you can have anything in your vagina.\n\n【47】If you have severe pain, a fever over 100 F, or soak through more than two pads per hour, you should call your provider or the emergency contact they gave you right away.\n\n【48】Most providers will have you come back for a follow-up appointment in 1 to 4 weeks to make sure that you’ve physically recovered and are no longer pregnant.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "You can find more information at:", "content": "【0】What Are the Types of Abortion Procedures?\nThere are a few types of procedures to induce an abortion that are done in clinics or hospitals.

This is a procedure that doctors usually reserve for when there is a serious problem with the fetus or medical complications related to the mother.\n\n【26】All the steps leading up to the procedure and steps taken after the procedure are the same as for a D&E, including the ultrasound to date your pregnancy and prep work to soften and dilate your cervix.\n\n【27】For sedation, you might be offered a general IV anesthesia, especially if the procedure is done in a hospital.\n\n【28】There are a few other options, like labor induction, hysterotomy and hysterectomy. But because they are riskier, doctors only do them if medically necessary.\n\n【29】How Much Does an Abortion Cost?\n-------------------------------\n\n【30】The amount may depend on how many weeks pregnant you are, if you get anesthesia or sedation for pain or discomfort, your financial situation, and where you get the procedure. Many clinics offer free or sliding-scale payment options based on how much money you make. To explore these options, look into your local Planned Parenthood or other women’s health clinics.\n\n【31】Generally, without other help, you can expect to pay anywhere from:\n\n【32】*   $430 to $600 if you’re 4 to 12 weeks from your last menstrual period (LMP)\n*   $540 to $1,100 if you’re 13 to 16 weeks from your LMP\n*   $900 to $1,850 if you’re 17 to 21 weeks from your LMP\n\n【33】Suction termination (also called suction curettage or vacuum aspiration abortion) may range around $500 to $700. Dilation and evacuation abortions, which are usually for later-stage pregnancies, range from $800 to $2,500. But in some areas, these prices could be as little as $300. In other cases, they may be more expensive depending on your medical needs.\n\n【34】If you get conscious sedation as opposed to local anesthetic, your cost may be on the higher end.\n\n【35】If you’re 5-10 weeks pregnant, you can use the abortion pill to end a pregnancy. It usually costs about $500 to $1,500.\n\n【36】Paying for Abortions\n--------------------\n\n【37】In some states, you may only be able to get an abortion if you get pregnant because of rape, incest, or if the pregnancy threatens your life. In these situations, you may be able to receive financial help from the government. The facility that does your abortion will need to apply for government funds in these cases. Ask your provider to complete an application if you need financial help.\n\n【38】If you have Medicaid, you can get financial help for an abortion. Some states, including California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, and New Jersey, also choose to use their funds to help people with abortion costs.\n\n【39】If you have insurance, abortions might be covered, depending on the rules of the state you’re insured in. Some states have stricter rules than others. If your insurance covers your abortion, it may be free. In some situations, you may have to pay a copay, just like with other medical procedures.\n\n【40】For example, Texas only allows abortion coverage if the pregnancy could severely threaten your health or life.\n\n【41】If you need a low-cost or free abortion, there are organizations that can help. <mark>You can find more information at:</mark>\n\n【42】*   The National Abortion Federation: Visit prochoice.org or call 800-772-9100.\n*   Planned Parenthood: Visit plannedparenthood.org or call 800-230-7526.\n*   National Network of Abortion Funds: Visit abortionfunds.org to find local organizations that can offer financial help.\n\n【43】What Happens Next?\n------------------\n\n【44】Once your procedure is done, you’ll rest at the clinic under supervision for about 30 minutes. You can then continue to relax in a recovery area until you’re ready to head home. If you’ve had any sedation, you’ll need someone to drive you. You’ll get a prescription for an antibiotic, too.\n\n【45】You’ll probably have some cramping for a few days and light bleeding for up to 2 weeks. Most pain and cramping is effectively treated with an over the counter or prescription painkiller like acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or codeine.\n\n【46】Plan to rest on the day of your procedure. You may need a few more days of rest if you had a D&E or D&X. You shouldn’t lift anything heavy for a few days. Ask your doctor when it would be OK to have sex or use a tampon again -- it may be up to a month before you can have anything in your vagina.\n\n【47】If you have severe pain, a fever over 100 F, or soak through more than two pads per hour, you should call your provider or the emergency contact they gave you right away.\n\n【48】Most providers will have you come back for a follow-up appointment in 1 to 4 weeks to make sure that you’ve physically recovered and are no longer pregnant.", "index": 9311, "show": true, "start": 9298, "end": 9571, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:39:55", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:40:58", "cost": 62.975}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:05", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:40:58", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:39:54"}

The most common kind of bird flu is the H5N1 strain. It's mostly a threat to birds and doesn’t spread easily among people, but there was a major outbreak of bird flu in people in 2014. The very few cases of human-to-human transmission were among people with exceptionally close contact, such as a mother who caught the virus while caring for their sick infant.\n\n【2】Migrating water fowl -- most notably wild ducks -- are the natural carriers of bird flu viruses. Scientists suspect that infection can spread from wild fowl to domestic poultry.\n\n【3】What Are the Symptoms of Bird Flu?\n----------------------------------\n\n【4】Bird flu symptoms in people can vary. The illness could start out with flu-like symptoms that include fever, cough, sore throat, and muscle aches. But it may worsen to include:\n\n【5】*   Gut problems: Nausea, belly pain, diarrhea, and vomiting.\n*   Breathing problems: Shortness of breath, serious  respiratory distress or failure, pneumonia, and other respiratory diseases.\n*   Brain or nervous system changes: You might notice shifts in behavior, thinking, or even organ function. Seizures are possible in serious cases.\n\n【6】In February 2005, researchers in Vietnam reported human cases of bird flu in which the virus infected the brains and digestive tracts of two children. Both died. These cases show that bird flu in humans may not always look like typical cases of flu.\n\n【7】Scientists have identified more than a dozen different strains, or variants, of bird flu. H5N1, one of the deadliest strains for humans, has caused 456 bird flu deaths since 2003, according to the World Health Organization. \n\n【8】How Do Humans Get Bird Flu?\n---------------------------\n\n【9】People catch bird flu by close contact with birds or bird droppings.\n\n【10】In the 2014 outbreak, some people caught H5N1 from cleaning or plucking infected birds. There were reports in China of infection via inhalation of aerosolized materials in live bird markets. It's also possible that some people were infected after swimming or bathing in water contaminated with the droppings of infected birds. And some infections have occurred in people who handle fighting cocks.\n\n【11】People don't catch the virus from eating fully cooked chicken or eggs.\n\n【12】There were a few cases where one infected person caught the bird flu virus from another person, but only after close personal contact.\n\n【13】In Indonesia in 2006, bird flu spread to eight members of one family. Seven of them died. It's not clear exactly how this happened. Family members likely had similar contacts with infected birds. They may also have shared genes that made them particularly susceptible to the virus. However, casual contact does not seem to be involved.\n\n【14】Has Bird Flu Been Seen in the U.S.\n-----------------------------------\n\n【15】Various strains of bird flu pop up in U.S. poultry from time to time. When they do, all affected poultry flocks are culled.\n\n【16】For example, in 2004, a highly dangerous bird flu strain appeared in a Texas chicken flock. The outbreak involved an H5N2 virus (not the H5N1 bird flu). By April 2004, the outbreak had been eradicated. No human infections were detected.\n\n【17】What Are the Types of Bird Flu?\n-------------------------------\n\n【18】The bird flu virus, avian influenza A, is divided into two main categories:\n\n【19】*   Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) causes more serious illness in chickens and is more likely to kill them.\n*   Low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) causes less serious illness in chickens and is less likely to cause death.\n\n【20】Both versions can spread quickly through bird flocks and may cause serious illness in humans. This is important because birds infected with LPAI viruses may show little or no sign of disease as it spreads to animals or humans.\n\n【21】Viruses often change over time, leading to different subtypes called strains. When bird flu infects humans, which is rare, it's most often from strains known as H5, H7, and H9. Less commonly, researchers have detected H10N8, H10N7, and H6N8 strains in humans.\n\n【22】Is There a Bird Flu Vaccine?\n----------------------------\n\n【23】Yes, but you can't make an appointment to get it. The FDA approved the first vaccine to prevent human infection with one strain of the bird flu (H5N1) in 2007. But it’s not been made commercially available to the general public. The U.S. government purchased the vaccine in case it needed to be distributed by public health officials.\n\n【24】Is There a Treatment for Bird Flu?\n----------------------------------\n\n【25】The flu drugs oseltamivir (Tamiflu), peramivir (Rapivab), or zanamivir (Relenza) may help treat bird flu in people, although more studies are needed. These drugs must be given soon after symptoms appear.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 11:05:21", "endTime": "2024/08/21 11:05:36", "cost": 15.2}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:04", "update_time": "2024-08-20 19:05:35", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 19:05:20"}

That’s because there are things to consider for a diagnosis, as COPD can mirror the symptoms of other illnesses.\n\n【4】Getting a Diagnosis\n-------------------\n\n【5】First, your doctor will want to know your medical history, any family history of COPD, as well as any symptoms you might have and how long you’ve had them.\n\n【6】The key symptoms of COPD are shortness of breath, a cough that doesn’t go away, and a thick, often colored mucus (phlegm) that you cough up.\n\n【7】Other symptoms, especially in later stages of the disease, may include:\n\n【8】*   Tight feeling in chest\n*   Less ability to stay active\n*   Less sexual activity\n*   Weight gain (because you can’t be as active)\n*   Weight loss (because of breathing problems while eating)\n*   Symptoms that are worse in the morning (typical for COPD)\n\n【9】Your doctor will definitely want to know about any of those symptoms when they assess you. They’ll also want to know about any smoking by you or anyone in your home, as smoking is the biggest risk factor for COPD. Long-term exposure to fumes, pollution, or dust is also a risk factor for COPD.\n\n【10】But keep in mind that in the early stages, you may have no symptoms at all. Or the signs may be very subtle -- something like being a little more tired from basic tasks like walking up stairs or bringing in your groceries.\n\n【11】Symptoms like these may be of particular interest to your doctor if they worsen slowly over time, with no obvious cause. If your doctor suspects COPD, they will likely test your breathing with a special airflow device called a spirometer. A chest X-ray and other tests may also help zero in on a diagnosis (see below).\n\n【12】It’s important to diagnose your COPD as soon as you can because, though there’s currently no cure, early treatment can do much to slow the progress of the disease.\n\n【13】Tests for COPD\n--------------\n\n【14】A number of tests can help zero in on a COPD diagnosis. They reveal signs of COPD and help rule out signs of other illnesses that might be mistaken for COPD. These tests include:\n\n【15】**Chest exam.** Your doctor will inspect your chest visually and listen to it with a stethoscope. They will place the stethoscope on your chest to listen for anything unusual, like wheezing. They might even tap on your chest to listen for certain sounds. Based on what they hear, they may recommend more tests.\n\n【16】**Spirometry.** This tests the amount of air you can breathe in and out. It’s the most common lung function test and considered the best way to diagnose COPD. It’s simple and painless. You will be asked to take a deep breath, and you’ll blow hard into a mouthpiece that’s connected to a small machine. That machine, called the spirometer, measures how fast you blow air out of your lungs.\n\n【17】Results can tell you whether you have COPD, even if you haven’t gotten symptoms yet. It can also indicate whether you have another health issue, such as asthma or heart failure.\n\n【18】**Chest X-ray.** This creates an image of your chest, including your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. This shows whether there are problems in the lungs, including other diseases such as pneumonia, cancer, and heart failure (when your heart can’t pump enough blood).\n\n【19】**Chest** **CT scan****.** This also creates an image of your chest, although it has more details than a chest X-ray. This test is also painless, although a dye may be injected into a vein in your arm to get clearer images of your chest.\n\n【20】You will lie on a table that moves into a CT scanner, which is shaped like a tunnel. You’ll hear clicks and various sounds as the scanner moves around you to take pictures. The entire scan takes about 30 minutes.\n\n【21】**Arterial blood gas test.** This measures how much oxygen and carbon dioxide you have flowing in your blood. You will get blood drawn so a lab can analyze it.\n\n【22】If you’re not getting enough oxygen into your bloodstream, it could be a sign that you have COPD or other lung diseases.\n\n【23】**Alpha-1** **antitrypsin deficiency** **testing.** This tests for a protein called AAT, which is found in your lungs and blood.\n\n【24】The protein helps protect your lungs from diseases such as COPD. But some people don’t make enough AAT because they inherited a genetic mutation. People who lack AAT are more likely to get lung diseases earlier than usual, at around 30 to 40 years old.\n\n【25】This genetic mutation is rare. Your doctor may suggest you get this test if your family has a history of AAT deficiency.\n\n【26】For the test, a small sample of blood is taken from one of your veins, and it is then checked for levels of AAT.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 11:00:23", "endTime": "2024/08/21 11:00:41", "cost": 17.503}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:04", "update_time": "2024-08-20 19:00:41", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 19:00:23"}

Many people using this medication do not have serious side effects.\n\n【16】This medication can cause breathing problems , which in rare cases can be fatal. If you experience trouble breathing such as wheezing or shortness of breath, stop using zanamivir and get medical help right away. Zanamivir is not recommended if you have lung / breathing problems . Discuss the risks and benefits with your doctor. However, if your doctor decides you should use zanamivir, have a quick-relief inhaled bronchodilator (such as albuterol inhaler ) readily available.\n\n【17】The flu itself or zanamivir may rarely cause serious mental/mood changes. This may be more likely in children. Tell your doctor right away of any signs of unusual behavior, including confusion, agitation, self-injury.\n\n【18】A very serious allergic reaction to this drug is rare.

(Stay away from ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin, which can make your symptoms worse.)\n\n【13】Your doctor might also give you antibiotics to ward off infections in your digestive tract that could lead to abscesses or fistula (abnormal passageways between organs).\n\n【14】And your doctor could recommend loperamide, a short-term treatment for severe diarrhea.\n\n【15】Bowel Rest\n----------\n\n【16】Your doctor might advise bowel rest if your symptoms are serious. It’s just what it sounds like -- your intestine takes off work for several days to several weeks.\n\n【17】You won't eat during this time. Instead, you might only drink clear liquids. Or you could get nourishment through an IV or a feeding tube.\n\n【18】This treatment often works well to help your intestines heal.\n\n【19】Diet and Nutrition\n------------------\n\n【20】Crohn’s isn’t caused by any certain food or foods. But symptoms like appetite loss and diarrhea can keep you from getting enough nutrients or drain them from your body.\n\n【21】And some food ingredients could aggravate your symptoms or trigger a flare-up:\n\n【22】*   Lactose, a protein found in dairy products\n*   Intense spices\n*   Sugar\n*   Fat\n\n【23】There's no one diet that doctors recommend for Crohn's.

Drink enough water to keep your pee clear or very pale yellow.\n*   Use simple cooking methods: boil, poach, grill, or steam.\n*   Know which foods your body handles best and keep your kitchen stocked with them.\n\n【26】Surgery\n-------\n\n【27】Even when other treatments work for a time, most people with Crohn’s need surgery at some point. Your meds might no longer do the job, or part of your bowel may need to be removed to save the healthy parts. You also might need surgery to repair a fistula, abscess (infection), or intestinal blockage.\n\n【28】These are some common types of surgery you might get for Crohn's:\n\n【29】*   **Strictureplasty** opens up a blockage that happens when long-lasting swelling thickens the walls of your digestive tract.\n*   **Bowel resection.** The surgeon removes damaged parts of your small or large intestine, then joins the two healthy ends.\n*   **Proctocolectomy or colectomy** removes your colon (large intestine) or rectum, or both**.** The surgery changes the path of your digestive tract so waste can pass through your body. In a proctocolectomy, the waste is diverted to an ostomy bag on the outside of your body. In a colectomy, the waste moves from the lower part of your small intestine to your anus.\n*   **Fistula removal** might be done when meds don’t heal these ulcers, which form tunnels to drain pus from an infection. Your surgeon might close the fistula with a plug or medical glue, or drain the infection.\n\n【30】NEWSLETTER\n\n【31】Get the Crohn's and Ulcerative Colitis Newsletter\n\n【32】Tips from experts and people with Crohn's and UC.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "NEWSLETTER\n\n【31】Get the Crohn’s and Ulcerative Colitis Newsletter\n\n【32】Tips from experts and people with Crohn’s and UC.\n\n\n", "content": "【0】Crohn’s Disease Treatment: Common Medications for Treating Crohn’s\nThere's no one best treatment for Crohn's disease. So your doctor will try to find what works best to stop your symptoms and keep the disease from damaging your body.\n\n【1】To create your treatment plan, your doctor will check out:\n\n【2】*   What kind of complications you have\n*   How bad your symptoms are\n*   Other medical conditions you have\n*   How you’ve responded to medication before\n*   How side effects of medication might affect you\n\n【3】They might recommend medication, diet changes, a spell of bowel rest, surgery to remove or repair parts of your digestive tract, or a combination of these.\n\n【4】Medication\n----------\n\n【5】Drugs are usually your doctor’s first choice to treat Crohn’s.\n\n【6】Crohn’s meds tamp down your body’s inflammatory response. This helps stifle your symptoms and gives your intestines time to rest.\n\n【7】Some of the different common types are:\n\n【8】**Corticosteroids** (steroids). They calm your immune system and ease swelling. Your doctor might prescribe them for a short time if your Crohn’s is moderate to serious. But you probably won't stay on them long, since they can cause serious side effects.\n\n【9】**Immunomodulators,** which modify your immune system to stop inflammation. Your doctor may prescribe these if other drugs haven't worked. They’re heavy duty, and may take weeks or months to kick in.\n\n【10】**Biologic therapies.** These drugs target certain proteins that your immune system makes. This cuts down inflammation in your intestines. You’ll inject them yourself at home or get them every two months or so at a medical center to help your body go into remission.\n\n【11】**Aminosalicylates.** These help tame inflammation in your digestive tract. Your doctor is more likely to prescribe them if you’ve just been diagnosed with Crohn's and have mild symptoms.\n\n【12】**Other meds.** You might also take acetaminophen to control the pain of Crohn's.

Herpes is a virus that lives in the body quietly until an outbreak is triggered. Trifluridine is not a cure for the infection, but treatment of an outbreak can speed up the healing of the sores/swelling in the eye and lower the risk of complications (such as vision loss ).\n\n【2】### How to use Trifluridine Drops\n\n【3】To apply eye drops, wash your hands first. To avoid contamination, do not touch the dropper tip or let it touch your eye or any other surface.\n\n【4】Tilt your head back, look up, and pull down the lower eyelid to make a pouch. Hold the dropper directly over your eye and place 1 drop into the pouch as directed by your doctor. Look down and gently close your eyes for 1 to 2 minutes. Place one finger at the corner of your eye (near the nose) and press gently. This will prevent the medication from draining out. Try not to blink and do not rub your eye. Repeat these steps for your other eye if so directed.\n\n【5】Do not rinse the dropper. Replace the dropper cap after each use.\n\n【6】Use this medication as directed by your doctor, usually every 2 hours while awake until the eye has healed. Do not use more than 9 drops into the eye in a 24-hour period. After healing, use this medication for another 7 days, usually every 4 hours while awake (at least 5 drops per day).\n\n【7】If you are using another kind of eye medication (such as drops or ointments), wait at least 5 to 10 minutes before applying other medications . Use eye drops before eye ointments to allow the drops to enter the eye.\n\n【8】Use this medication regularly in order to get the most benefit from it. To help you remember, use it at the same times each day. Continue using it for the full time prescribed. Stopping the medication too early may result in a return of the infection.\n\n【9】Do not use this medication more often or use longer than prescribed because doing so may increase the risk of side effects.

Other body functions -- like heart rate, skin temperature, and blood pressure -- are controlled involuntarily by your nervous system. You don't think about making your heart beat faster. It just happens in response to your environment, like when you're nervous, excited, or exercising.\n\n【1】One technique can help you gain more control over these normally involuntary functions. It's called biofeedback, and the therapy is used to help prevent or treat conditions, including migraine headaches, chronic pain, incontinence, and high blood pressure.\n\n【2】The idea behind biofeedback is that, by harnessing the power of your mind and becoming aware of what's going on inside your body, you can gain more control over your health.\n\n【3】How Does Biofeedback Therapy Work?\n----------------------------------\n\n【4】Researchers aren't exactly sure how or why biofeedback works. They do know that biofeedback promotes relaxation, which can help relieve a number of conditions that are related to stress.\n\n【5】During a biofeedback session, electrodes are attached to your skin. Finger sensors can also be used. These electrodes/sensors send signals to a monitor, which displays a sound, flash of light, or image that represents your heart and breathing rate, blood pressure, skin temperature, sweating, or muscle activity.\n\n【6】When you're under stress, these functions change. Your heart rate speeds up, your muscles tighten, your blood pressure rises, you start to sweat, and your breathing quickens. You can see these stress responses as they happen on the monitor, and then get immediate feedback as you try to stop them. Biofeedback sessions are typically done in a therapist's office, but there are computer programs that connect the biofeedback sensor to your own computer.\n\n【7】A biofeedback therapist helps you practice relaxation exercises, which you fine-tune to control different body functions. For example, you might use a relaxation technique to turn down the brainwaves that activate when you have a headache.\n\n【8】Several different relaxation exercises are used in biofeedback therapy, including:\n\n【9】*   Deep breathing\n*   Progressive muscle relaxation -- alternately tightening and then relaxing different muscle groups\n*   Guided imagery -- concentrating on a specific image (such as the color and texture of an orange) to focus your mind and make you feel more relaxed\n*   Mindfulness meditation -- focusing your thoughts and letting go of negative emotions\n\n【10】As you slow your heart rate, lower your blood pressure, and ease muscle tension, you'll get instant feedback on the screen. Eventually, you'll learn how to control these functions on your own, without the biofeedback equipment.\n\n【11】Different types of biofeedback are used to monitor different body functions:\n\n【12】**Electromyogram (EMG).** This measures muscle activity and tension. It may be used for back pain, headaches, anxiety disorders, muscle retraining after injury, and incontinence.\n\n【13】**Thermal.** This measures skin temperature. It may be used for headache and Raynaud's disease.\n\n【14】**Neurofeedback or** **electroencephalography** **(EEG).** This measures brain waves. It may be used for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), epilepsy and other seizure disorders.\n\n【15】**Electrodermal activity (****EDA****).** This measures sweating and can be used for pain and anxiety.\n\n【16】**Heart rate variability (HRA).** This measures heart rate. It may be used for anxiety, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and irregular heartbeat.\n\n【17】Each biofeedback therapy session lasts about 60-90 minutes. Usually, you can start to see biofeedback benefits within 10 sessions or less. Some conditions, such as high blood pressure, can take more sessions to improve.\n\n【18】Biofeedback Uses\n----------------\n\n【19】Biofeedback can help many different conditions. Here is a rundown of some biofeedback benefits:\n\n【20】**Chronic pain****.** By helping you identify tight muscles and then learn to relax those muscles, biofeedback may help relieve the discomfort of conditions like low back pain, abdominal pain, temporomandibular joint disorders (TMJ), and fibromyalgia. For pain relief, biofeedback can benefit people of all ages, from children to older adults.\n\n【21】**Headaches.** Headaches are one of the best-studied biofeedback uses. Muscle tension and stress can trigger migraines and other types of headaches, and can make headache symptoms worse. There is good evidence that biofeedback therapy can relax muscles and ease stress to reduce both the frequency and severity of headaches. Biofeedback seems to be especially beneficial for headaches when it's combined with medications.\n\n【22】**Anxiety.** Anxiety relief is one of the most common uses of biofeedback. Biofeedback lets you become more aware of your body's responses when you're stressed and anxious. Then you can learn how to control those responses.\n\n【23】**Urinary Incontinence****.** Biofeedback therapy can help people who have trouble controlling the urge to use the bathroom. Biofeedback can help women find and strengthen the pelvic floor muscles that control bladder emptying. After several sessions of biofeedback, women with incontinence may be able to reduce their urgent need to urinate and the number of accidents they have. Biofeedback can also help children who wet the bed, as well as people with fecal incontinence (the inability to control bowel movements). Unlike drugs used to treat incontinence, biofeedback doesn't tend to cause side effects.\n\n【24】**High Blood Pressure****.** Evidence on the use of biofeedback for high blood pressure has been mixed. Although the technique does seem to lower blood pressure slightly, biofeedback isn't as effective as medication for blood pressure control.\n\n【25】Other biofeedback uses include:\n\n【26】*   Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\n*   Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\n*   High blood pressure\n*   Raynaud's disease\n*   Injury\n*   Asthma\n*   Constipation\n*   Epilepsy\n*   Rheumatoid arthritis\n\n【27】Getting Started With Biofeedback Therapy\n----------------------------------------\n\n【28】Many different health care providers offer biofeedback therapy, including psychiatrists, psychologists, and general physicians.

It helps the hemispheres share information, but it also contributes to the spread of seizure impulses from one side of the brain to the other. A corpus callosotomy is an operation that severs (cuts) the corpus callosum, interrupting the spread of seizures from hemisphere to hemisphere. Seizures generally do not completely stop after this procedure (they continue on the side of the brain in which they originate). However, the seizures usually become less severe, as they cannot spread to the opposite side of the brain.\n\n【2】Who Is a Candidate for a Corpus Callosotomy?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【3】A corpus callosotomy, sometimes called split-brain surgery, may be performed in people with the most extreme and uncontrollable forms of epilepsy, when frequent seizures affect both sides of the brain. People considered for corpus callosotomy are typically those who do not respond to treatment with antiseizure medications.\n\n【4】What Happens Before a Corpus Callosotomy?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【5】Candidates for corpus callosotomy undergo an extensive pre-surgery evaluation -- including seizure monitoring, electroencephalography (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET). These tests help the doctor pinpoint where the seizures begin and how they spread in the brain. It also helps the doctor determine if a corpus callosotomy is an appropriate treatment.\n\n【6】What Happens During a Corpus Callosotomy?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【7】A corpus callosotomy requires exposing the brain using a procedure called a craniotomy. After the patient is put to sleep with anesthesia, the surgeon makes an incision in the scalp, removes a piece of bone and pulls back a section of the dura, the tough membrane that covers the brain. This creates a \"window\" in which the surgeon inserts special instruments for disconnecting the corpus callosum. The surgeon gently separates the hemispheres to access the corpus callosum. Surgical microscopes are used to give the surgeon a magnified view of brain structures.\n\n【8】In some cases, a corpus callosotomy is done in two stages. In the first operation, the front two-thirds of the structure is cut, but the back section is preserved. This allows the hemispheres to continue sharing visual information. If this does not control the serious seizures, the remainder of the corpus callosum can be cut in a second operation. After the corpus callosum is cut, the dura and bone are fixed back into place, and the scalp is closed using stitches or staples.\n\n【9】What Happens After a Corpus Callosotomy?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【10】The patient generally stays in the hospital for two to four days. Most people having a corpus callosotomy will be able to return to their normal activities, including work or school, in six to eight weeks after surgery. The hair next to the incision will grow back over the area and hide the surgical scar. The person will continue taking antiseizure drugs.\n\n【11】How Effective Is a Corpus Callosotomy?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【12】Corpus callosotomy is successful in stopping drop attacks, or atonic seizures in which a person suddenly loses muscle tone and falls to the ground, in about 50% to 75% of cases. This can decrease the risk of injury and improve the person's quality of life.\n\n【13】What Are the Side Effects of Corpus Callosotomy?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】The following symptoms may occur after having a corpus callosotomy, although they generally go away on their own:\n\n【15】*   Scalp numbness\n*   Nausea\n*   Feeling tired or depressed\n*   Headaches\n*   Difficulty speaking, remembering things, or finding words\n*   Paralysis, weakness, loss of sensation\n*   Change in personality\n\n【16】What Are the Risks of a Corpus Callosotomy?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【17】Serious problems are uncommon with a corpus callosotomy, but there are risks, including:\n\n【18】*   Risks associated with surgery, including infection, bleeding, and an allergic reaction to anesthesia\n*   Swelling in the brain\n*   Lack of awareness of one side of the body\n*   Loss of coordination\n*   Problems with speech, such as stuttering\n*   Increase in partial seizures (occurring on one side of the brain)\n*   Stroke", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:38:06", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:38:14", "cost": 8.208}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:04", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:38:14", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:38:06"}

When your thyroid hormone levels are too high or too low, your body can't work right. That can affect your energy level, mood, and weight.\n\n【1】If your thyroid becomes inflamed, you have thyroiditis. Sometimes it happens because your body makes antibodies that attack your thyroid by mistake. This condition is called autoimmune thyroiditis, chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, or Hashimoto’s disease.\n\n【2】Causes\n------\n\n【3】Doctors don’t fully understand why your immune system misfires this way. It could be set off by a faulty gene, a virus, or something else. Or it could be a combination of causes.\n\n【4】Could You Get It?\n-----------------\n\n【5】You may be more likely to get autoimmune thyroiditis if you:\n\n【6】*   Are a woman\n*   Are middle-aged\n*   Have another autoimmune disorder like lupus, type 1 diabetes, or rheumatoid arthritis\n*   Are related to someone who has autoimmune thyroiditis\n*   Have been exposed to environmental radiation\n\n【7】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【8】You may not have any in the beginning.\n\n【9】As the disease goes on, your thyroid may become enlarged, a condition called a goiter. The front of your neck will look swollen, and it might make your throat feel full. The thyroid may or may not be tender to the touch. \n\n【10】A damaged thyroid can’t do its job, which leads to hypothyroidism -- too little of the thyroid hormones.

The tests also look for something called thyroperoxidase antibodies.\n\n【14】You also might have an ultrasound so your doctor can look at your thyroid, especially if your blood test results aren’t clear. Your doctor might spot the problem through regular blood tests even if you don’t have any symptoms, especially if they’re aware that your family has a history of thyroid problems.\n\n【15】Treatment\n---------\n\n【16】The usual therapy is a prescription medicine called levothyroxine (Levo-T, Levothroid, Levoxyl, Synthroid, Tirosint, Unithroid). It’s a man-made version of what a healthy thyroid makes.\n\n【17】Your doctor will keep an eye on you and may have to adjust your dosage every once in a while. You’ll need to take medicine for the rest of your life.\n\n【18】Some foods, like a high-fiber diet or soy products, can mess with levothyroxine.

Emollients are substances that soften and moisturize the skin and decrease itching and flaking. Some products (such as zinc oxide, white petrolatum) are used mostly to protect the skin against irritation (such as from wetness). Dry skin is caused by a loss of water in the upper layer of the skin. Emollients/moisturizers work by forming an oily layer on the top of the skin that traps water in the skin. Petrolatum, lanolin , mineral oil and dimethicone are common emollients. Humectants, including glycerin , lecithin, and propylene glycol, draw water into the outer layer of skin. Many products also have ingredients that soften the horny substance (keratin) that holds the top layer of skin cells together (including urea, alpha hydroxy acids such as lactic/citric/glycolic acid, and allantoin ). This helps the dead skin cells fall off, helps the skin keep in more water, and leaves the skin feeling smoother and softer.\n\n【2】### How to use Mapo Oil\n\n【3】Use this product as directed. Some products require priming before use. Follow all directions on the product package. If you have any questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist .\n\n【4】Some products need to be shaken before use. Check the label to see if you should shake the bottle well before using. Apply to the affected areas of the skin as needed or as directed on the label or by your doctor. How often you apply the medication will depend on the product and your skin condition. To treat dry hands, you may need to use the product every time you wash your hands , applying it throughout the day.\n\n【5】If you are using this product to help treat diaper rash , clean the diaper area well before use and allow the area to dry before applying the product.\n\n【6】If you are using this product to help treat radiation skin burns, check with radiation personnel to see if your brand can be applied before radiation therapy .\n\n【7】Follow all the directions on the label for proper use. Apply to the skin only. Avoid sensitive areas such as your eyes , inside your mouth /nose, and the vaginal/ groin area , unless the label or your doctor directs you otherwise. Check the label for directions about any areas or types of skin where you should not apply the product (such as on the face, any areas of broken/chapped/cut/irritated/scraped skin, or on a recently shaved area of the skin). Consult your doctor or pharmacist for more details.\n\n【8】Use this medication regularly to get the most benefit from it. Most moisturizers need water to work well. Apply the product after bathing/showering while the skin is still damp. For very dry skin , your doctor may instruct you to soak the area before using the product.

It’s a common condition, but it’s not the only one that causes problems in your hands and wrists. It helps to know what to look for so you can get the right care. Early treatment can make a big difference in how long it takes to get better.\n\n【1】Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by pressure on your median nerve. This nerve gives you feeling in your thumb and all your fingers except your pinky. When it goes through your wrist, it passes through the carpal tunnel -- a narrow path that’s made of bone and ligament. If you get any swelling in your wrist, this tunnel gets squeezed and pinches your median nerve, which causes your symptoms.\n\n【2】What Are the Early Signs?\n-------------------------\n\n【3】Typically, the symptoms start out slowly, with burning, numbness, tingling, or pain. You might feel it in your thumb and any of your fingers, but not your pinkie. The strange feeling may also travel up your forearm.\n\n【4】Often, symptoms start at night. That’s because most people sleep with their wrists bent, which causes pressure on the median nerve. You might wake up feeling like you need to shake your hands out.\n\n【5】As your condition gets worse, you may notice symptoms during the day, as well. This often happens when you’re doing something where your wrist is bent up or down for a long time, like driving a car, reading a newspaper, or holding your phone.\n\n【6】At first, symptoms tend to come and go. But over time, they occur more often and become worse.\n\n【7】You might also notice other symptoms:\n\n【8】*   Your fingers feel swollen, even though they don’t look like it.\n*   Pain and tingling travel up your forearm to your shoulder.\n*   “Shocks” come and go in your thumb and fingers.\n\n【9】Over time, carpal tunnel can also affect your grip and ability to pinch. Here are some things that could be happening:\n\n【10】*   You drop things more often (due to numbness or weakened muscles).\n*   You’re having a hard time working with small objects, like the buttons on your shirt.\n*   It’s harder to make a fist than it used to be.\n\n【11】In more severe cases, you can lose muscle at the base of your thumb. Or you may no longer be able to tell hot from cold just by touch.\n\n【12】When Should I Call a Doctor?\n----------------------------\n\n【13】Anytime you have any of the common symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome on a regular basis. When you get care early on, you may find that basic options, such as rest or wearing a wrist brace, work well. That’ll allow you to avoid more serious treatment like surgery. Without any treatment, your symptoms could become permanent.\n\n【14】What Other Conditions Can Cause Similar Symptoms?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Several of them. One, which doctors call de Quervain tenosynovitis, causes problems with the tendons that control your thumb. It hurts to turn your wrist, make a fist, or try to grasp an object. Your doctor can do some simple tests to tell whether you have this condition or carpal tunnel.\n\n【16】Other health problems that may seem like carpal tunnel syndrome include:\n\n【17】*   Arthritis\n*   Ligament damage\n*   Neuropathy, a nerve problem\n*   Wrist injury, such as a fracture\n*   Cervical (C6-7) root compression in the neck\n\n【18】It’s not as common, but for some people, carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by other health issues, like:\n\n【19】*   Amyloidosis, a disease where proteins collect in your organs\n*   Birth control pills\n*   Diabetes\n*   Pregnancy\n*   Rheumatoid arthritis\n*   Thyroid problems\n\n【20】Check with your doctor to see if you have another condition that might cause carpal tunnel syndrome.

It happens when the body matures sooner -- perhaps years earlier -- than expected.\n\n【1】Puberty usually starts around age 8 in girls and around age 9 in boys. For some children, such as those who are African-American or Hispanic, normal puberty may happen as early as age 6 in girls and age 8 in boys. But with CPP, signs of puberty, such as budding breasts and body hair, show up much sooner. It's more common for girls.\n\n【2】When it happens in boys, there’s often another, potentially serious medical condition causing it. This is usually not the case for girls.\n\n【3】Puberty is a big change, even when it happens on schedule. Early puberty can also cause problems with bone growth. Talk with your child's doctor about what's happening. If it's too soon, you can slow or even reverse the changes in their body.\n\n【4】Causes\n------\n\n【5】The brain releases a hormone called gonadotropin-releasing hormone. Your doctor may call it GnRH. It tells the pituitary gland to release hormones called gonadotropins. They tell the sex organs to make other hormones that start sexual development.\n\n【6】In central precocious puberty, the brain releases GnRH at a younger-than-normal age and starts the process. Most of the time, doctors can't pinpoint an exact cause for girls, but researchers have linked childhood obesity to early periods.\n\n【7】Boys are more likely to have a specific trigger.\n\n【8】Other causes include:\n\n【9】*   A family history of CPP\n*   A rare gene problem\n*   A noncancerous tumor in the brain or pituitary gland\n*   A brain injury\n*   An infection in the brain, like meningitis\n*   Radiation or chemotherapy for cancer treatment\n\n【10】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【11】The signs of CPP are the changes you'd expect to see in a maturing preteen or teen.\n\n【12】*   Hair in underarms and on genitals, and, for boys, on the face\n*   Acne\n*   Adult body odor\n*   Sexual development like breast buds or testicle growth\n*   Emotional changes\n*   Mood swings\n\n【13】Sometimes, kids can have hair appear on their genitals and under the arm, but it doesn’t mean they are in true puberty.\n\n【14】Getting a Diagnosis\n-------------------\n\n【15】Your child's doctor will likely ask you questions before doing an exam or tests.\n\n【16】*   What physical changes have you seen in your child?\n*   Has their behavior changed recently?\n*   When did you first notice this? How long has this change been there?\n*   Is there a history of early puberty in your family?\n\n【17】If the symptoms aren't severe, it can be hard to tell if it's CPP. Your doctor may want your child to see a specialist who focuses on children's hormones and growth, called a pediatric endocrinologist. They’ll look for signs of puberty, but they may also check:\n\n【18】*   Hormone levels\n*   Bone age\n\n【19】**Blood tests** check levels of hormones.\n\n【20】**X-rays** help find out if your child's bones are maturing too early.\n\n【21】**MRI or CT scans** can rule out a tumor.\n\n【22】Questions for Your Doctor\n-------------------------\n\n【23】*   What caused my child's symptoms?\n*   Is there a way to slow down their development?\n*   Do we need to treat this?\n*   Could treating it cause other problems?\n*   What happens after treatment stops?\n*   What happens if we don't do anything?\n*   What's the best way to explain CPP to my child?\n*   Will my child be OK?\n\n【24】Treatment\n---------\n\n【25】If your doctor can find a cause, they’ll treat that.\n\n【26】In some cases, doctors can use a drug to block sex hormones and prevent further development. A man-made version of GnRH stops the pituitary gland from sending out gonadotropins.\n\n【27】The doctor can give your child a shot once a month or every 3 months, or they can put a small implant under the skin of your child's upper arm that works for a year. The part of the body where they get the shot or implant may hurt a bit, or their skin might get irritated around that spot, but there don’t seem to be any long-term side effects.\n\n【28】You'll probably want to keep up the treatment until your child gets old enough to let puberty continue. Talk with your doctor about when that would be.\n\n【29】Most doctors treat a child younger than 7 years old. When you're thinking about whether to treat CPP in an older child, you'll want to think about:\n\n【30】*   Your child's age\n*   How slow or fast they're developing\n*   How your child has been reacting\n*   The chance of early menstruation\n*   Concerns about their height as an adult\n\n【31】Talk these things over with your child's doctor before you make any decisions.\n\n【32】Taking Care of Your Child\n-------------------------\n\n【33】Most kids want to fit in with their peers. Developing early could make your child feel self-conscious. Other people may expect more maturity because they think your kid is older than they are.\n\n【34】These challenges plus the emotional changes from extra hormones can be a lot for them to deal with. Check in with the teachers and counselors at school, and keep an eye on your child's grades. Pay attention to their interest in things and being around friends and classmates.\n\n【35】How can you help? Explain what's happening in simple terms. Keep the lines of communication open.\n\n【36】*   Encourage your child to talk freely about their feelings.\n*   Treat your kid appropriately for their age.\n*   Watch out for teasing.\n*   Do what you can to boost their self-esteem. Try to focus your praise on grades or activities rather than appearance.\n\n【37】What to Expect\n--------------\n\n【38】An early growth spurt can make your child taller than their friends at first, but their bones may stop growing earlier, too. Without treatment, your child may end up shorter than they could have been.\n\n【39】With treatment, they're more likely to reach their full adult height. Within a year, their growth should slow to a normal rate. Their sexual development will stall and may even reverse. For example, a girl's breasts and a boy's penis and testicles could get smaller. Your child should start acting like other kids their age, too.\n\n【40】Studies show children who are treated with GnRH have normal bone density.

It means your heart is out of its usual rhythm.\n\n【2】It may feel like your heart skipped a beat, added a beat, or is \"fluttering.\" It might feel like it’s beating too fast (which doctors call tachycardia) or too slow (called bradycardia). Or you might not notice anything.\n\n【3】Arrhythmias can be an emergency, or they could be harmless. If you feel something unusual happening with your heartbeat, get medical help right away so doctors can find out why it's happening and what you need to do about it.\n\n【4】What Are the Symptoms of Arrhythmia?\n------------------------------------\n\n【5】An arrhythmia can be silent, meaning you don't notice any symptoms. Your doctor may spot an uneven heartbeat during a physical exam.\n\n【6】If you have symptoms, they may include:\n\n【7】*   Palpitations (a feeling of skipped heartbeats, fluttering, or \"flip-flops\")\n*   Pounding in your chest\n*   Dizziness or feeling lightheaded\n*   Fainting\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Chest pain or tightness\n*   Weakness or fatigue (feeling very tired)\n*   Anxiety\n*   Blurry vision\n*   Sweating\n\n【8】What Causes Arrhythmia?\n-----------------------\n\n【9】You could have an arrhythmia even if your heart is healthy. Or it could happen because of:\n\n【10】*   Heart disease\n*   The wrong balance of electrolytes (such as sodium or potassium) in your blood\n*   Heart injury or changes such as reduced blood flow or stiff heart tissue\n*   Healing process after heart surgery\n*   Infection or fever\n*   Certain medications\n*   Problems with the electrical signals in your heart\n*   Strong emotions, stress, or surprise\n*   Things in your daily life like alcohol, tobacco, caffeine, or exercise\n\n【11】What Are Some Arrhythmia Risk Factors?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【12】Things that may make you more likely to have an arrhythmia include your:\n\n【13】*   **Age.** The chances go up as you get older.\n*   **Genes.** Your odds might be higher if a close relative has had an arrhythmia. Some types of heart disease can also run in families.\n*   **Lifestyle.** Alcohol, tobacco, and recreational drugs can raise your risk.\n*   **Medical conditions.** High blood pressure, diabetes, low blood sugar, obesity, sleep apnea, and autoimmune disorders are among the conditions that may cause heart rhythm problems.\n*   **Environment.** Things in the world around you, like air pollution, can make an arrhythmia more likely.\n\n【14】What Are the Types of Arrhythmias?\n----------------------------------\n\n【15】Arrhythmias are divided up by where they happen. If they start in the ventricles, or lower chambers of your heart, they’re called ventricular. When they begin in the atria, or upper chambers, they’re called supraventricular.\n\n【16】Doctors also group them by how they affect your resting heart rate. Bradycardia is a heart rate of fewer than 60 beats per minute. Tachycardia is more than 100 beats per minute.\n\n【17】Supraventricular arrhythmias include:\n\n【18】*   **Premature atrial contractions.** These are early extra beats. They’re harmless and generally don't need treatment.\n*   **Atrial fibrillation (AFib).** The upper chambers of your heart contract in an unusual way. Your heart might beat more than 400 times a minute.\n*   **Atrial flutter****.** This is usually more organized and regular than atrial fibrillation. It happens most often in people who have heart disease and in the first week after heart surgery. It often changes to atrial fibrillation.\n*   **Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT).** This is a rapid heart rate, usually with a regular rhythm. It begins and ends suddenly.\n*   **Accessory pathway tachycardias.** You can have a rapid heart rate because of an extra pathway between your heart's upper and lower chambers. Think of it as an extra road on your way home as well as your usual route. When that happens in your heart, it can cause a fast rhythm.\n*   **AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT).** This is caused by an extra pathway through a part of your heart called the AV node. It can cause heart palpitations, fainting, or heart failure.\n\n【19】Ventricular arrhythmias include:\n\n【20】*   **Premature ventricular contractions** **(PVCs).** These are among the most common arrhythmias. They're the \"skipped heartbeat\" that many of us feel sometimes.\n*   **Ventricular tachycardia (V-tach).** This is a rapid heart rhythm starting from your heart's lower chambers. Because your heart is beating too fast, it can't fill with enough blood. This can be a serious arrhythmia, especially in people who have heart disease, and it may be linked to other symptoms.\n*   **Ventricular fibrillation (V-fib).** This happens when your heart's lower chambers quiver and can't contract or pump blood to the rest of your body. It’s a medical emergency that must be treated with CPR and defibrillation as soon as possible.\n*   **Long QT syndrome.** Your heart’s lower chambers take too long to contract and release. This may cause dangerous rhythm problems and death.\n\n【21】Another type of arrhythmia, bradyarrhythmia, is a slow rhythm because of disease in your heart's electrical system or because of medication. It may make you pass out or feel like you will. Types of bradyarrhythmia include:\n\n【22】*   **Sinus node dysfunction.** This is caused by a problem with your heart's sinus node, its natural pacemaker.\n*   **Heart block.** There’s a delay or a block of the electrical impulse as it travels from your heart's sinus node to its lower chambers.\n\n【23】How Are Arrhythmias Diagnosed?\n------------------------------\n\n【24】To diagnose an arrhythmia or find its cause, doctors use tests including:\n\n【25】*   **EKG.** An electrocardiogram records the electrical activity of your heart. You wear small electrode patches on your chest, arms, and legs for the quick, painless test, which you take in your doctor's office.\n*   **Holter monitor.** This is a portable EKG (also called an \"ambulatory electrocardiogram\" or an ECG) about the size of a postcard or digital camera that you'll use for 1 to 2 days, or up to 2 weeks. The test measures the movement of electrical signals or waves through your heart. These signals tell your heart to contract (squeeze) and pump blood.  You'll have electrodes taped to your skin. It's painless, although some people have mild skin irritation from the tape used to attach the electrodes to the chest. You can do everything but shower or bathe while wearing the electrodes. After the test period, you'll go back to see your doctor. They'll download the information.\n*   **Event monitor**. If your symptoms don't happen often, your doctor may suggest that you wear one of these, usually for about a month. When you push a button, it records and stores your heart's electrical activity for a few minutes. Try to get a reading when you notice symptoms. Your doctor will interpret the results.\n*   **Implantable loop recorder.** Your doctor puts this under your skin, where it constantly records your heart’s electrical activity. It can send information to your doctor’s office.\n*   **Stress test****.** There are different kinds of stress tests. The goal is to check how much stress your heart can manage before having a rhythm problem or not getting enough blood. For the most common type of stress test, you'll walk on a treadmill or pedal a stationary bike while you get an EKG and have your heart rate and blood pressure monitored. Technicians slowly raise the intensity level of your exercise.\n*   **Echocardiogram.** This test uses ultrasound to check your heart muscle and valves.\n*   **Cardiac catheterization.** Your doctor will insert a long, thin tube, called a catheter, into a blood vessel in your arm or leg. They’ll guide it to your heart with help from a special X-ray machine. Then, they’ll inject dye through the catheter to help make X-ray videos of your heart valves, coronary arteries, and chambers.\n*   **Electrophysiology study****.** This test records your heart's electrical activities and pathways. It can help find out what's causing heart rhythm problems and find the best treatment for you. During the test, your doctor will safely trigger your unusual heart rhythm. Then, they may give you medications to see which one controls it best or to see what procedure or device you need to treat it.\n*   **Head-up tilt table test.** Doctors use this test to find out what's causing fainting spells. It measures the difference in heart rate and blood pressure when you're standing up and lying down. You'll get this test in a lab. You'll lie on a stretcher, tilted at different angles while you get an EKG and specialists check your blood pressure and oxygen level. This shows if symptoms of passing out are due to your electrical system, nervous system, or vascular system.\n\n【26】How Are Arrhythmias Treated?\n----------------------------\n\n【27】Treatment will depend on what type of arrhythmia you have. Your doctor may recommend one or more of these.\n\n【28】**Medications**\n\n【29】Medicines that treat uneven heart rhythms include:\n\n【30】*   Adenosine (Adenocard)\n*   Atropine (Atropen)\n*   Beta-blockers\n*   Calcium channel blockers\n*   Digoxin (Digitek, Digox, Lanoxin)\n*   Potassium channel blockers\n*   Sodium channel blockers\n\n【31】**Vagal maneuvers**\n\n【32】These techniques trigger your body to relax by affecting your vagus nerve, which helps control your heart rate. Your doctor might tell you to:\n\n【33】*   Cough or gag\n*   Hold your breath and bear down (Valsalva maneuver)\n*   Lie down\n*   Put a cold, wet towel over your face\n\n【34】**Electrical cardioversion**\n\n【35】If drugs can't control an uneven heart rhythm (such as atrial fibrillation), you might need cardioversion. For this, doctors put you under and then send an electrical shock to your chest wall to trigger your heart’s regular rhythm.\n\n【36】**Pacemaker**\n\n【37】This device sends small electrical impulses to your heart muscle to keep a safe heart rate. It includes a pulse generator, which houses the battery and a tiny computer, and wires that send impulses to the heart muscle.\n\n【38】**Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)**\n\n【39】Doctors mainly use ICDs to treat ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation, two life-threatening heart rhythms.\n\n【40】The ICD constantly tracks your heart rhythm. When it detects a very fast, unusual rhythm, it delivers an electric shock to the heart muscle to make it beat in a regular rhythm again. The ICD has two parts: the leads and a pulse generator. The leads are made up of wires and sensors that monitor the heart rhythm and deliver energy used for pacing or defibrillation. The generator houses the battery and a tiny computer. Energy is stored in the battery until it is needed. The computer receives information from the leads to determine how the heart is beating.\n\n【41】Your doctor programs the ICD to include one or all of the following functions:\n\n【42】*   **Anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP).** A series of small electrical impulses to the heart muscle restores a regular rate and rhythm.\n*   **Cardioversion****.** You may get a low-energy shock at the same time your heart beats to restore regular rhythm.\n*   **Defibrillation.** When your heartbeat is dangerously fast or uneven, your heart muscle gets a higher-energy shock to restore a regular rhythm.\n*   **Anti-bradycardia pacing.** Many ICDs give backup pacing to keep the heart rhythm if it slows too much.\n\n【43】There are different types of ICDs, including:\n\n【44】*   **Single-chamber ICD.** A lead is attached in the right ventricle. If needed, energy is delivered to the ventricle to restore a normal heart rhythm.\n*   **Dual-chamber ICD.** Leads are attached in the right atrium and the right ventricle. Energy can be delivered to the right atrium and then to the right ventricle, helping your heart to be paced in a normal sequence.\n*   **Biventricular ICD.** Leads are attached in the right atrium, the right ventricle, and the coronary sinus adjacent to the left ventricle. This technique helps the heart beat in a more efficient way and is specifically used for patients with heart failure.\n\n【45】Your doctor will determine which type of ICD is best for you. Before you have your ICD implanted, ask your doctor what medications you can take. Your doctor may ask you to stop taking certain medications before the procedure. You will receive specific instructions.\n\n【46】After it’s implanted, you might not notice a low-energy shock. Or it may feel like a flutter in your chest. The high-energy shock lasts just a second, but it can hurt. Some people say it feels like being hit with a baseball bat or being kicked by a horse. Most people feel it more in their back than their chest. If you feel a shock, sit or lie down because you may pass out.\n\n【47】Talk to your doctor about what to do if you ever get shocked. If you do get shocked, call your doctor immediately.\n\n【48】**Catheter ablation**\n\n【49】Think of this procedure as rewiring to fix an electrical problem in your heart.\n\n【50】Your doctor will insert a catheter through your leg. It delivers high-frequency electrical energy to a small area inside your heart that causes the unusual rhythm. This energy \"disconnects\" the pathway of the unusual rhythm.\n\n【51】Doctors use ablation to treat most PSVTs, atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, and some atrial and ventricular tachycardias.\n\n【52】**Heart surgery for arrhythmias**\n\n【53】The maze procedure is a type of surgery to correct atrial fibrillation. Your surgeon makes a series, or \"maze,\" of cuts in your heart's upper chambers. The goal is to keep your heart's electrical impulses only on certain pathways. Some people need a pacemaker afterward.\n\n【54】Your doctor might recommend other procedures, such as a coronary bypass, to treat other forms of heart disease.\n\n【55】Complications of Arrhythmias\n----------------------------\n\n【56】Without treatment, an uneven heart rhythm could cause dangerous problems such as:\n\n【57】*   **Alzheimer’s disease and dementia.** These cognitive disorders may happen because your brain doesn’t get enough blood over time.\n*   **Heart failure****.** Your heart might not pump as well as it should after repeated arrhythmias.\n*   **Stroke.** Blood that lingers in your atria can clot. If a clot travels to your brain, it may cause a stroke.\n*   **Cardiac arrest.** V-fib could cause your heart to stop.\n\n【58】Safe Driving Concerns\n---------------------\n\n【59】If you have an arrhythmia, you could faint behind the wheel. This could put you, other motorists, pedestrians, and property at great risk.\n\n【60】To figure out whether you can drive safely, your doctor will consider:\n\n【61】*   What type of arrhythmia you have\n*   How serious yours is\n*   The treatment you receive for it (if any)\n*   How often you have symptoms and how serious they are\n\n【62】If you have no symptoms and you haven't had any serious heart rhythm problems, you should be able to drive as you always have. If meds keep your arrhythmia under control, your doctor may give you the green light to drive, too.\n\n【63】In addition to meds to help manage your heart rhythm, you may have two other treatments. Both would keep you out of the driver's seat for a while:\n\n【64】**Ablation****:** This treatment will usually restrict you to the passenger's seat for about a week. It may keep you there longer, depending on your medical history.\n\n【65】**Implantable cardioverter defibrillator:** Usually after you get an ICD, you'll be asked not to drive for a week. If you got an ICD after fainting or surviving cardiac arrest, you may have to wait several months before you get back behind the wheel.\n\n【66】You can't drive commercially (as in a delivery truck or a taxi) at all if you have an ICD.\n\n【67】Arrhythmia Prevention\n---------------------\n\n【68】You can’t always prevent arrhythmias. Regular checkups with your doctor can help keep you from having more heart rhythm problems. Be sure they know all of the medications you’re taking. Some cold and cough medicines can trigger an arrhythmia, so talk to your doctor before using them.\n\n【69】They may also recommend some lifestyle changes:\n\n【70】*   Eat a healthy diet. Get plenty of fruits and vegetables, fish, and plant-based proteins. Avoid saturated and trans fats.\n*   Keep cholesterol and blood pressure under control.\n*   Don’t smoke.\n*   Keep a healthy weight.\n*   Exercise regularly.\n*   Manage stress.\n*   Limit alcohol and caffeine.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:07:09", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:07:52", "cost": 43.378}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:04", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:07:52", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:07:09"}

Their risk of getting COVID-19 is about the same as that of adults. The risk can be drastically reduced if your child receives the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n【2】COVID-19 may cause more serious illness in children who have certain medical conditions and in babies younger than 12 months.\n\n【3】In some cases, children develop multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), which is a serious condition that requires medical attention (more below).\n\n【4】Some very simple and effective ways to help prevent your child from catching or spreading COVID-19 are:\n\n【5】*   Have them wash their hands often.\n*   Clean your home often.\n*   Keep your child away from sick people.\n*   Know the COVID-19 level in your community, a statistic that is constantly updated by the CDC.\n*   Follow CDC recommendations as far as precautions such as masking.\n*   Have them vaccinated\n\n【6】You’ll also want to reassure your child if they’re anxious about any changes in their routines, like staying home from school or not seeing friends face-to-face. Watch for unusual worry or sadness, trouble eating or sleeping, and attention problems.\n\n【7】Talk to them about what’s happening, and reassure them that most cases of COVID-19 are mild. Your children will pick up cues from you, so it’s important that you stay calm, too.\n\n【8】Are COVID-19 Symptoms Different in Children and Adults?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【9】When children and teens get sick with COVID-19, their symptoms appear to be similar to adults. There have been fewer hospitalizations among people in the U.S. under the age of 19. Research shows that over 90% of children who get sick have very mild to moderate cold-like symptoms that include:\n\n【10】*   Fever\n*   Runny nose\n*   Cough\n*   Vomiting\n*   Diarrhea\n\n【11】Some children and teens have been hospitalized with a condition called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) or pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome (PMIS). Doctors are still learning about it, but they think it’s linked to COVID-19. Symptoms include fever, belly pain, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, headache, and confusion. They’re similar to those of toxic shock syndrome or Kawasaki disease, which causes inflamed blood vessels in children.\n\n【12】Serious problems are rare. Get medical help right away if your child shows any of these symptoms:\n\n【13】*   Trouble breathing\n*   Can't keep liquids down\n*   Changes in skin color, including blue lips or face\n*   Confusion or trouble waking up\n\n【14】Coronavirus in Children With Medical Conditions\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Some children may be at higher risk for more severe disease if they have other medical conditions such as:\n\n【16】*   Asthma\n*   Diabetes\n*   Blood disorders\n*   Heart or liver disease\n*   Kidney disease that needs dialysis\n*   A weakened immune system\n\n【17】How Can I Protect My Children From the Coronavirus?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】The CDC has recommended that everyone 6 months and older should get the COVID-19 vaccine to protect against the coronavirus. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are approved for ages 6-months and older. The CDC also recommends a booster with the bilvalent vaccine 2 months after their most recent vaccination to cover the more current variants of coronavirus.\n\n【19】But getting the vaccine does not ensure that your child will not get infected. It’s important to do everything you can to protect your child and the rest of your family from disease. Here are ways to cut their risk of illness:\n\n【20】**Wear masks indoors in public.** People can spread the coronavirus even when they don’t have symptoms or before symptoms start. To slow the spread, the CDC says everyone over the age of 2 should wear a mask indoors when they’re in a public place if they have not been fully vaccinated or if the level of COVID-19 spreading in your community is high. The CDC has a tool to help you track the COVID-19 community level where you live.\n\n【21】Fit is important, so buy masks that are sized for small faces. Try on masks at home so children have time to get used to them. Make sure your child doesn’t touch the mask while wearing it.\n\n【22】**Wash hands often.** All kids should wash their hands:\n\n【23】*   After they go to the bathroom\n*   After they sneeze, cough, or blow their nose\n*   Before they eat\n*   As soon as they enter the house\n\n【24】Soap and water are best. Make sure they lather the backs of their hands, between their fingers, and under their nails for at least 20 seconds (the same amount of time it takes to sing “Happy Birthday” two times). If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.\n\n【25】**Stay home, and no playdates in person.**When levels of coronavirus are high in your area, it’s important to limit close contact with others to reduce the spread of the disease. Stay home as much as possible, and avoid public places like shopping malls and movie theaters. Don’t have playdates or sleepovers. Your child may not seem sick, but they may still have the virus and can pass it to others.\n\n【26】**Keep your kids away from others who are ill.** And if your child has cold-like symptoms, keep them home. Teach them to cough and sneeze into a tissue that they toss after each use, or into their arm or elbow instead of their hands.\n\n【27】**Clean your home regularly.** Disinfect high-touch surfaces like toilets, sinks, doorknobs, light switches, handles, smartphones, tablets, and TV remotes every day. You can use most regular household cleaners, or make your own by mixing a quarter cup of bleach with a gallon of water. If your child has a favorite stuffed animal or plush item, wash it frequently at the highest possible temperature.\n\n【28】**Take care if you get sick.** A new mom who tests positive for COVID-19 or thinks she could have it might choose to temporarily stay away from her baby in order to lower the chances of spreading the virus.\n\n【29】Talk about the pros and cons with your medical team. If you go this route and still want to breastfeed, you can pump breast milk and have a healthy caregiver feed your child. If you might be sick but don’t want to separate from your baby, take extra steps to avoid spreading the virus. Wash your hands often, and wear a face mask when you’re 6 feet away or closer, including when nursing.\n\n【30】Variants and Children\n---------------------\n\n【31】The number of children with COVID-19 has dramatically spiked with the Omicron variant. To ensure their safety, it’s important to have your kids fully vaccinated against COVID-19. To keep your young ones safe:\n\n【32】*   Have your child wear a mask in crowded areas, even if they’re vaccinated.\n*   If possible, allow children to social distance.\n*   Try to avoid crowded indoor activities. Take your children to outdoor events.\n*   Keep windows open, if the weather allows, to create more ventilation.\n*   Be cautious around older people and those with underlying conditions.\n*   If your child is too young to get the vaccine, ensure that all others in your household get vaccinated.\n\n【33】What’s the Treatment for Young Children With COVID-19?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【34】There’s one FDA-approved COVID-19 treatment for certain kids under 12 years old. It’s a shot called remdesivir (Veklury). It’s for children 28 days of age and older who weigh about 7 pounds at least, and are either:\n\n【35】*   In the hospital due to COVID-19\n*   Not hospitalized but have mild to moderate COVID-19 and are at high risk for the disease becoming severe\n\n【36】Remdesivir can cause side effects. There’s a chance it could raise a child’s levels of liver enzymes, which may be a sign of liver injury. It could also trigger an allergic reaction, which may include signs like:\n\n【37】*   Changes in blood pressure and heart rate\n*   Low blood oxygen level\n*   Fever\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Wheezing\n*   Swelling of the lips, around the eyes, under the skin, or other body parts\n*   Rashes\n*   Nausea\n*   Sweating\n*   Shivering\n\n【38】Get medical help right away if you think your child is having side effects. Dial 911 if they’re having trouble breathing.\n\n【39】Paxlovid is used to treat adults and children 12 and older (weighing at least 88 pounds) who have mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and high risk of the disease becoming severe. Paxlovid should be taken as soon as possible after you’re diagnosed and within 5 days of your symptoms starting.\n\n【40】Remdesivir and Paxlovid are not substitutes for the COVID-19 vaccine in children who are eligible. Your child should still get the COVID vaccine if they are 6-months or older.\n\n【41】What to Do if Your Child Gets Sick With COVID-19\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【42】If your child has symptoms that you think might be COVID-19, call a doctor. They can tell you what to do and whether the doctor needs to see your child in person. Don’t just show up at the doctor’s office -- call first.\n\n【43】In the event that your child has COVID-19, they’ll likely stay at home to recover. Your child should rest and drink plenty of fluids. Never use aspirin in children younger than 19. It increases their risk of a serious condition called Reye’s syndrome. You may want to try giving your child an over-the-counter pain reliever that’s a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID), such as ibuprofen or naproxen.  Acetaminophen may be a safer option. To make sure the rest of the family doesn’t get sick:\n\n【44】**Separate them.** Your child should stay away from the other people in your home -- ideally, in a specific room and bathroom. They shouldn’t snuggle or kiss family pets, either. If your child has COVID-19, they should wear a face mask when they’re around other people. If that makes it harder for them to breathe, or they get upset, you can instead wear one when you’re with them.\n\n【45】**Don’t share personal items with them.** This includes things like drinking glasses, towels, and bedding.\n\n【46】**Clean and disinfect constantly.** If your sick child is old enough to clean high-touch areas like phones, doorknobs, and toilets themselves, let them. Otherwise, do it yourself but wear a mask.\n\n【47】**Track their symptoms.** Call your doctor right away if your child has trouble breathing, has chest pressure or pain, or seems confused.\n\n【48】**Keep them isolated even if they seem better.** Your child can be around other people once they have had a full day with no fever -- without the use of fever-reducing medication -- their other symptoms have improved, and it’s been at least 5 days since they got sick. They need to keep wearing a mask when they’re around other people for another 5 days, for a total of 10 days. If they can’t wear a mask, they should remain isolated for a full 10 days.\n\n【49】NEWSLETTER\n\n【50】Stay Up-to-Date on COVID-19\n\n【51】Sign up for the latest coronavirus news.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【49】NEWSLETTER\n\n【50】Stay Up-to-Date on COVID-19\n\n【51】Sign up for the latest coronavirus news.\n\n\n", "content": "【0】Coronavirus in Kids and Babies\nWhat’s My Child’s Risk of Getting the Coronavirus?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n【1】Children can get the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, but their symptoms tend to be milder than adults’ symptoms, and in many cases, they may have no symptoms at all.

Make sure they lather the backs of their hands, between their fingers, and under their nails for at least 20 seconds (the same amount of time it takes to sing “Happy Birthday” two times). If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.\n\n【25】**Stay home, and no playdates in person.**When levels of coronavirus are high in your area, it’s important to limit close contact with others to reduce the spread of the disease. Stay home as much as possible, and avoid public places like shopping malls and movie theaters. Don’t have playdates or sleepovers. Your child may not seem sick, but they may still have the virus and can pass it to others.\n\n【26】**Keep your kids away from others who are ill.** And if your child has cold-like symptoms, keep them home. Teach them to cough and sneeze into a tissue that they toss after each use, or into their arm or elbow instead of their hands.\n\n【27】**Clean your home regularly.** Disinfect high-touch surfaces like toilets, sinks, doorknobs, light switches, handles, smartphones, tablets, and TV remotes every day. You can use most regular household cleaners, or make your own by mixing a quarter cup of bleach with a gallon of water. If your child has a favorite stuffed animal or plush item, wash it frequently at the highest possible temperature.\n\n【28】**Take care if you get sick.** A new mom who tests positive for COVID-19 or thinks she could have it might choose to temporarily stay away from her baby in order to lower the chances of spreading the virus.\n\n【29】Talk about the pros and cons with your medical team. If you go this route and still want to breastfeed, you can pump breast milk and have a healthy caregiver feed your child. If you might be sick but don’t want to separate from your baby, take extra steps to avoid spreading the virus. Wash your hands often, and wear a face mask when you’re 6 feet away or closer, including when nursing.\n\n【30】Variants and Children\n---------------------\n\n【31】The number of children with COVID-19 has dramatically spiked with the Omicron variant. To ensure their safety, it’s important to have your kids fully vaccinated against COVID-19. To keep your young ones safe:\n\n【32】*   Have your child wear a mask in crowded areas, even if they’re vaccinated.\n*   If possible, allow children to social distance.\n*   Try to avoid crowded indoor activities. Take your children to outdoor events.\n*   Keep windows open, if the weather allows, to create more ventilation.\n*   Be cautious around older people and those with underlying conditions.\n*   If your child is too young to get the vaccine, ensure that all others in your household get vaccinated.\n\n【33】What’s the Treatment for Young Children With COVID-19?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n【34】There’s one FDA-approved COVID-19 treatment for certain kids under 12 years old. It’s a shot called remdesivir (Veklury). It’s for children 28 days of age and older who weigh about 7 pounds at least, and are either:\n\n【35】*   In the hospital due to COVID-19\n*   Not hospitalized but have mild to moderate COVID-19 and are at high risk for the disease becoming severe\n\n【36】Remdesivir can cause side effects. There’s a chance it could raise a child’s levels of liver enzymes, which may be a sign of liver injury. It could also trigger an allergic reaction, which may include signs like:\n\n【37】*   Changes in blood pressure and heart rate\n*   Low blood oxygen level\n*   Fever\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Wheezing\n*   Swelling of the lips, around the eyes, under the skin, or other body parts\n*   Rashes\n*   Nausea\n*   Sweating\n*   Shivering\n\n【38】Get medical help right away if you think your child is having side effects. Dial 911 if they’re having trouble breathing.\n\n【39】Paxlovid is used to treat adults and children 12 and older (weighing at least 88 pounds) who have mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and high risk of the disease becoming severe. Paxlovid should be taken as soon as possible after you’re diagnosed and within 5 days of your symptoms starting.\n\n【40】Remdesivir and Paxlovid are not substitutes for the COVID-19 vaccine in children who are eligible. Your child should still get the COVID vaccine if they are 6-months or older.\n\n【41】What to Do if Your Child Gets Sick With COVID-19\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【42】If your child has symptoms that you think might be COVID-19, call a doctor. They can tell you what to do and whether the doctor needs to see your child in person. Don’t just show up at the doctor’s office -- call first.\n\n【43】In the event that your child has COVID-19, they’ll likely stay at home to recover. Your child should rest and drink plenty of fluids. Never use aspirin in children younger than 19. It increases their risk of a serious condition called Reye’s syndrome. You may want to try giving your child an over-the-counter pain reliever that’s a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID), such as ibuprofen or naproxen.  Acetaminophen may be a safer option. To make sure the rest of the family doesn’t get sick:\n\n【44】**Separate them.** Your child should stay away from the other people in your home -- ideally, in a specific room and bathroom. They shouldn’t snuggle or kiss family pets, either. If your child has COVID-19, they should wear a face mask when they’re around other people. If that makes it harder for them to breathe, or they get upset, you can instead wear one when you’re with them.\n\n【45】**Don’t share personal items with them.** This includes things like drinking glasses, towels, and bedding.\n\n【46】**Clean and disinfect constantly.** If your sick child is old enough to clean high-touch areas like phones, doorknobs, and toilets themselves, let them. Otherwise, do it yourself but wear a mask.\n\n【47】**Track their symptoms.** Call your doctor right away if your child has trouble breathing, has chest pressure or pain, or seems confused.\n\n【48】**Keep them isolated even if they seem better.** Your child can be around other people once they have had a full day with no fever -- without the use of fever-reducing medication -- their other symptoms have improved, and it’s been at least 5 days since they got sick. They need to keep wearing a mask when they’re around other people for another 5 days, for a total of 10 days. If they can’t wear a mask, they should remain isolated for a full 10 days.\n\n【49】NEWSLETTER\n\n【50】Stay Up-to-Date on COVID-19\n\n【51】Sign up for the latest coronavirus news.", "index": 11086, "show": true, "start": 11086, "end": 11182, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/08/21 10:56:16", "endTime": "2024/08/21 10:56:53", "cost": 36.815}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:04", "update_time": "2024-08-20 18:56:53", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 18:56:16"}

The amount of hair loss is different in everyone. Some people lose it only in a few spots. Others lose a lot. Sometimes, hair grows back but falls out again later. In others, hair grows back for good.\n\n【2】There are different types of this condition. Alopecia areata is most common in its main form, but there are other, more rare types:\n\n【3】*   **Alopecia areata totalis** means you’ve lost all the hair on your head.\n*   **Alopecia areata universalis** is the loss of hair over your entire body.\n*   **Diffuse alopecia areata** is a sudden thinning of your hair rather than lost patches.\n*   **Ophiasis alopecia areata** causes hair loss in a band shape around the sides and back of your head.\n\n【4】Alopecia Symptoms\n-----------------\n\n【5】Alopecia areata (AA) is a chronic, autoimmune disease and while most associate it with temporary and permanent hair loss, it affects the nails in up to 46% of those affected. AA nails may appear pitted with lines, having splitting and/or white spots.\n\n【6】The main and often the only symptom of alopecia is hair loss. You may notice:\n\n【7】*   Small bald patches on your scalp or other parts of your body\n*   Patches may get larger and grow together into a bald spot\n*   Hair grows back in one spot and falls out in another\n*   You lose a lot of hair over a short time\n*   More hair loss in cold weather\n*   Fingernails and toenails become red, brittle, and pitted\n\n【8】The bald patches of skin are smooth, with no rash or redness. But you may feel a tingling, itching, or burning sensation on your skin right before the hair falls out.\n\n【9】Alopecia Causes and Risk Factors\n--------------------------------\n\n【10】When you have an autoimmune disease, your immune system attacks your body. With alopecia areata, it’s the hair follicles that are attacked.\n\n【11】Doctors don’t know why it happens. But they think people who get it have something in their genes that makes it more likely. Then something happens to trigger the hair loss. Learn more about what causes alopecia.\n\n【12】You’re more likely to get alopecia areata if you have:\n\n【13】*   A family member who has it\n*   Asthma\n*   Down syndrome\n*   Pernicious anemia\n*   Seasonal allergies\n*   Thyroid disease\n*   Vitiligo\n\n【14】Alopecia Diagnosis\n------------------\n\n【15】If you think you have alopecia areata, you may want to see a skin specialist called a dermatologist. They will:\n\n【16】*   Talk to you about your symptoms\n*   Take a close look at the areas where you have hair loss\n*   Pull gently on the hairs at the edges of the bald patch to see if they come out easily\n*   Check individual hairs and follicles to see if they’re abnormally shaped\n*   Examine your nails\n\n【17】Rarely, you may have a biopsy, which means a small piece of skin is removed from your scalp and looked at under a microscope.\n\n【18】Many conditions can cause hair loss. So your doctor may test your skin for a fungal infection or give you blood tests to check for thyroid, hormone, or immune system problems.\n\n【19】Alopecia Treatment\n------------------\n\n【20】Alopecia areata can’t be cured. But it can be treated and hair can grow back. If you have it, there are several things to try:\n\n【21】**Corticosteroids**. These are anti-inflammatory drugs that are prescribed for autoimmune diseases. They can be given as an injection into the scalp or other areas. They can also be given as a pill or rubbed on the skin as an ointment, cream, or foam. The downside is that it may take a long time to work.\n\n【22】**Topical** **immunotherapy**. This is used when there’s a lot of hair loss or if it happens more than once. Chemicals are applied to the scalp to produce an allergic reaction. If it works, this reaction is actually what makes the hair grow back. It also causes an itchy rash and usually has to be repeated several times to keep the new hair growth.\n\n【23】**Minoxidil** **(****Rogaine****)**. This treatment, which is put on the scalp, is already used for pattern baldness. It usually takes about 12 weeks before you see growth, and some users are disappointed in the results. Read more about which types of alopecia are most likely to respond to minoxidil.\n\n【24】Other treatments for alopecia areata include medications that are sometimes used for other autoimmune disorders. These medicines have differing amounts of success in regrowing hair.\n\n【25】Alopecia Home Care\n------------------\n\n【26】Apart from medications, there are other things you can try if you have alopecia areata. \n\n【27】Wear wigs, hats, or scarves. They cover your hair loss and will protect your head from the sun.\n\n【28】Reduce stress. Personal troubles seem to trigger alopecia areata, although this has not been proven scientifically. Telogen effluvium, another form of hair loss, can also be triggered by stress. Learn more about the signs and symptoms of telogen effluvium.\n\n【29】Alopecia Outlook\n----------------\n\n【30】Alopecia areata isn’t usually a serious medical condition, but it can cause a lot of anxiety and sadness. Support groups are out there to help you deal with the psychological effects of the condition.\n\n【31】If you lose all your hair, it could grow back. If it doesn’t, there are different ways to cover your hair loss and protect your scalp.\n\n【32】If you notice sudden hair loss, always check with a doctor. There can be other reasons for it besides alopecia areata.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:54:06", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:54:17", "cost": 10.599}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:04", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:54:17", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:54:06"}

There’s no surefire way to prevent them, but making some lifestyle changes might lower your odds of them progressing more rapidly.\n\n【1】Eat Right\n---------\n\n【2】You can’t do anything about your age or family history, but you can change your diet.\n\n【3】Some research shows that eating foods high in antioxidants like vitamins C and E may help prevent cataracts. If you already have cataracts, it may slow their growth.\n\n【4】Good sources of vitamin C include:\n\n【5】*   Citrus (oranges, grapefruit, limes, etc.)\n*   Tomatoes and tomato juice\n*   Red and green peppers\n*   Kiwifruit\n*   Broccoli\n*   Strawberries\n*   Brussels sprouts\n*   Cantaloupe\n*   Potatoes\n\n【6】For vitamin E, look to vegetable oils like sunflower, safflower, or wheat germ. Nuts, especially almonds, are also good sources of vitamin E. So are peanuts. So are green veggies like spinach and broccoli. Some foods -- maybe even your favorite breakfast cereal -- contain extra vitamin E. Check the info on the package to be sure.\n\n【7】You may not have heard of lutein and zeaxanthin. These are two more vitamins that could help protect your eyes from cataracts. Eggs have them, as do green, leafy vegetables.\n\n【8】Make sure you eat fruits and veggies every day. Five servings can provide more than 100 milligrams of vitamin C and 5 to 6 milligrams of lutein and zeaxanthin. Just two servings of nuts can provide 8 to 14 milligrams of vitamin E. If you find it tough to fit all of this into your daily diet, consider multivitamins or supplements. But always talk to your doctor first.\n\n【9】Quit Smoking\n------------\n\n【10】You know that smoking is bad for your lungs and your heart, but it’s also really bad for your eyes. When it comes to cataracts, smoking is a risk factor you can control.\n\n【11】Smoking creates more free radicals in your eyes. These are chemicals that harm cells. Antioxidants -- all those good chemicals that you get from fruits and vegetables -- fight the bad chemicals. But smoking kills off the good chemicals. And it produces a lot of toxins that can cause cataracts.\n\n【12】If you kick the habit, it may help prevent cataracts, even if you’ve smoked a lot of cigarettes over a long period of time. Talk to your doctor about programs and medications that can help you quit.\n\n【13】If you don’t smoke, don’t start.\n\n【14】Wear Shades\n-----------\n\n【15】Sunglasses can make you look cool. They can also help cut your risk of getting cataracts.\n\n【16】Science shows that ultraviolet (UV) light can cause changes in your eyes. And researchers now know that UV light actually damages the proteins in your lens.\n\n【17】There are lots of options for sunglasses that look good and protect your eyes at the same time. When shopping for shades, look for the kind that:\n\n【18】*   Block out 99% to 100% of UVA and UVB rays\n*   Screen out 75% to 90% of visible light\n*   Fit your face shape, with a frame that is close to your eyes\n*   Have a gray tint, which is helpful when driving\n\n【19】Limit Alcohol\n-------------\n\n【20】You don’t have to give up that glass of wine with dinner. But there is some evidence that drinking too much alcohol can increase your risk for cataracts.\n\n【21】Research has shown that if you drink fewer than two standard-size drinks each day, your odds of getting cataracts may be lower than if you never drank at all. But research also shows that drinking more than two drinks a day (about 20 grams of alcohol), raises those odds.\n\n【22】Keep Blood Sugar in Check\n-------------------------\n\n【23】If you have diabetes, you know how important it is to keep your blood sugar under control. But did you know that it can also help prevent cataracts? That’s because people who have diabetes are more likely to develop the eye condition than people who don’t.\n\n【24】Your lens swells if your blood sugar stays too high for too long. Your lens also changes blood sugar into sorbitol. When this substance collects in the lens of your eye, you see less clearly, and a cataract may form.\n\n【25】Get Regular Eye Exams\n---------------------\n\n【26】Your eye doctor can spot problems early on. If you’re between 40 and 64, you should get a complete eye exam every 2 to 4 years. (A “complete” exam means your eye doctor will dilate your pupils).\n\n【27】If you’re over age 65, you should get an exam every 1 to 2 years.\n\n【28】If your odds are high for certain eye diseases, your eye doctor may want to see you more often.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 11:01:08", "endTime": "2024/08/21 11:02:15", "cost": 67.391}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:04", "update_time": "2024-08-20 19:02:14", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 19:01:06"}

And you could say, like you might say about a wheel, rotavirus goes round and round. This nasty, potentially lethal bug causes severe acute gastroenteritis with diarrhea and vomiting, primarily in infants and young children. Fortunately, there are two rotavirus vaccines that can protect children from this disease.\n\n【1】How Big a Problem Is Rotavirus Infection?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【2】Prior to the introduction of the rotavirus vaccine, rotavirus infection was responsible for 200,000 emergency room visits, 55,000 hospitalizations, and 60 to 65 deaths each year in the U.S. Worldwide, it is the leading cause of severe diarrhea among young children, leading to 2 million hospitalizations and more than 500,000 deaths of children ages 5 and under annually. Older children and adults can also be infected with the virus, but the illness is generally milder.\n\n【3】Rotavirus disease is highly contagious. The germ is present in the stool of an infected person and can remain viable for a long time on contaminated surfaces, including people's hands. Children catch it by touching something that's contaminated and then putting their hands in their mouth. The spread of rotavirus infection is a particular problem in hospitals and in day care settings, where it can be easily spread from child to child. It's also easily spread by day care workers, especially when they change diapers without washing their hands afterward.\n\n【4】Symptoms of rotavirus infection, which may last up to eight days, include fever, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and frequent, watery diarrhea. If it's severe enough, the diarrhea can cause dehydration, and it's the dehydration that's responsible for the hospitalizations and deaths associated with this disease.\n\n【5】How Is the Rotavirus Vaccine Given?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【6】There are two brands of the rotavirus vaccine -- RotaTeq (RV5) and Rotarix (RV1). Both vaccines are given orally, not as a shot. The only difference is the number of doses that need to be given.\n\n【7】With RotaTeq, three doses are required. They should be given at ages 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months. Rotarix only requires two doses -- at 2 months and 4 months.\n\n【8】The vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that the rotavirus vaccine be included as part of the routine immunizations given to infants.\n\n【9】How Effective Is the Rotavirus Vaccine?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【10】Studies of the rotavirus vaccine have shown that it can prevent about 74% of rotavirus infections. More importantly, it can prevent approximately 98% of severe infections and 96% of hospitalizations from rotavirus. In one Massachusetts hospital, in two years, the number of people with rotavirus dropped from 65 to three.\n\n【11】Is the Rotavirus Vaccine Safe?\n------------------------------\n\n【12】Before being approved, the rotavirus vaccine was tested on more than 70,000 children and found to be safe. However, an earlier vaccine, called RotaShield, was removed from the market after being used for two years, because it was found to slightly increase the risk of intussusception -- a condition in which the small bowel folds back inside another part of the intestine, causing a bowel obstruction.\n\n【13】The RotaTeq and Rotarix vaccines now in use do not appear to increase this risk and are considered safe.\n\n【14】Are There Some Children Who Shouldn't Have the Rotavirus Vaccine?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Any child who has had a severe allergic reaction to an earlier dose of the rotavirus vaccine should not be given any more doses of the vaccine. If your baby has a moderate or severe illness at the time the vaccination is scheduled, wait until the baby has recovered before being vaccinated. Also, the CDC recommends that you check with your doctor if your baby's immune system has been weakened. Things that could compromise the immune system include:\n\n【16】*   Exposure to HIV/AIDS or any other disease that involves the immune system\n*   Treatment with long-term steroids\n*   Cancer or cancer treatment with X-rays or drugs\n\n【17】What Are the Side Effects of the Rotavirus Vaccine?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】With any vaccine there is chance of a serious allergic reaction. Signs of an allergic reaction can include:\n\n【19】*   Difficulty breathing\n*   Wheezing\n*   Hives\n*   Paleness\n*   Fast heart beat\n\n【20】However, with the rotavirus vaccine, the risk of a serious reaction is extremely small.\n\n【21】Most children who get the vaccine have no problem at all. However, there is a slight chance your child may have temporary, mild effects following the vaccine including:\n\n【22】*   Increased irritability\n*   Diarrhea\n*   Vomiting", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:51:01", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:51:20", "cost": 19.759}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:03", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:51:20", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:51:00"}

Many children in the U.S. are immunized as infants and toddlers, but that doesn't guarantee lifetime protection. And not everyone gets vaccinated as a child. Many adults move to the U.S. from countries without immunization programs. World travel increases the chances of these diseases spreading.\n\n【1】Generally, adults born before 1957 are considered immune to measles and mumps. The CDC advises most adults born in 1957 or afterward who can't show that they've had all 3 diseases get an MMR vaccine, whether they had one as a child or not.\n\n【2】Why do adults need the MMR vaccine?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【3】The three diseases covered by the MMR vaccine -- measles, mumps, and rubella -- are highly contagious. Viruses cause all three of these illnesses, and they spread through the air. They can pass from person to person through coughing, sneezing, or just breathing.\n\n【4】**Measles.** This disease causes a fever, runny nose, and rash. It attacks the throat and lungs. Vaccinations have helped stop the spread of the disease in the U.S. but there are still cases reported. While immunization rates are on the rise around the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates there were 207,500 measles deaths in 2019. Measles outbreaks often happen in countries without strong childhood immunization programs. But outbreaks have also happened in Europe, South Africa, and the Philippines.\n\n【5】**Mumps.** This disease causes fever, fatigue, head and muscle aches, and swelling of the salivary glands. In men, it can cause the testicles to become inflamed. Mumps can lead to a loss of hearing, infection of the covering around the brain and spinal cord, and other serious problems. Mumps outbreaks do still happen in the U.S. but rarely.\n\n【6】**Rubella (****German measles****).** This disease can cause a fever and rash. It's especially dangerous if a pregnant mother has it. Rubella can lead to serious birth defects, including heart problems, deafness, liver and spleen damage, and intellectual disability. If a woman has rubella while pregnant, there's at least a 20% chance their baby will have problems.\n\n【7】When should adults get the MMR vaccine?\n---------------------------------------\n\n【8】The CDC says most adults born in 1957 or later should get at least one dose of the MMR vaccine. Because of the risk of birth defects, all women of childbearing age should have the MMR vaccine unless they're pregnant or have proof of immunity, or proof of already being vaccinated for rubella.\n\n【9】The CDC says adults at greater risk of measles or mumps should get two doses of MMR vaccine, the second one 4 weeks after the first. This includes adults who:\n\n【10】*   Have been exposed to measles or mumps or live in an area where an outbreak has happened\n*   Are students in colleges or trade schools\n*   Travel internationally\n*   Work in health care\n\n【11】For measles, the CDC advises a second dose for adults who:\n\n【12】*   Were previously given a vaccine made with \"killed\" measles (instead of the live-type of vaccine used today)\n*   Were given an MMR vaccine between 1963 and 1967, but there's no record of what type.\n\n【13】Exceptions: Who does not need the MMR vaccine?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【14】Adults don't need the MMR vaccine if:\n\n【15】*   They have proof of vaccination already.\n*   They have proof that they've already had measles or mumps and rubella.\n\n【16】Who should not have the MMR vaccine?\n------------------------------------\n\n【17】Adults who should not have the MMR vaccine include people in these groups:\n\n【18】**Pregnancy.** Pregnant women should not get the MMR vaccine due to risks to the baby. Women who get the MMR vaccine should wait 4 weeks before getting pregnant.\n\n【19】**Life-threatening allergic reactions.** Adults who have had a life-threatening allergic reaction to gelatin, a previous MMR vaccine, or a medication called neomycin should not get the vaccine.\n\n【20】**Medical conditions.** Adults should talk with their doctor if they:\n\n【21】*   Have HIV\n*   Have any other immune system disorder\n*   Have cancer or are being given cancer drugs or X-rays\n*   Are taking steroids or other drugs that affect the immune system\n*   Have had a low platelet count (a blood disorder)\n*   Have had a blood transfusion or took blood products\n*   Have a moderate or severe illness\n\n【22】What are the MMR vaccine ingredients?\n-------------------------------------\n\n【23】As with many vaccines, the MMR vaccine works with the immune system to build up protection by putting a small amount of the virus into the body. The safest and most effective ingredients in the MMR vaccine used today include \"attenuated\" forms of each virus, which means they're live forms of the virus that have been made weak in medical labs.\n\n【24】What are the risks and side effects of the MMR vaccine?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【25】For most adults, the benefits of the MMR vaccine outweigh the risks. A few people develop a short-term mild rash, fever, swollen glands, or pain and stiffness in the joints after getting the shot. More serious, and rare, side effects include a temporary low platelet count or serious allergic reaction.\n\n【26】Call your doctor if you have trouble breathing, dizziness, rapid heartbeat, hives, weakness, or other problems after vaccination.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:42:04", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:42:17", "cost": 13.431}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:03", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:42:18", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:42:04"}

Chelation therapy is a treatment that uses medicine to remove these metals so they don't make you sick.\n\n【1】Some alternative health care providers also use it to treat heart disease, autism, and Alzheimer's disease. But there's very little evidence it works for those conditions. In fact, chelation therapy can cause serious side effects -- including death -- especially if it's used in the wrong way.\n\n【2】How Does It Work?\n-----------------\n\n【3】Chelation therapy uses special drugs that bind to metals in your blood. You get the chelating medicine through an intravenous (IV) tube in your arm. It’s also available in pill form. Once the drug has attached to the metal, your body removes them both through your pee.\n\n【4】Metals that can be removed with chelation therapy include lead, mercury, and arsenic. Before you get this treatment, your doctor will do a blood test to make sure you have metal poisoning.\n\n【5】What Other Conditions Does It Treat?\n------------------------------------\n\n【6】Some natural health care providers and supplement companies claim they use chelation therapy to reduce symptoms of autism, Alzheimer's disease, or heart disease. Yet this treatment is only approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat metal poisoning.\n\n【7】Here's what the research shows regarding chelation treatment for these three conditions:\n\n【8】**Autism.** The use of chelation therapy to treat this condition is based on the idea that autism is caused by mercury in childhood vaccines. Studies have proven this idea to be false. But some health care providers also believe that removing metals from the body can improve autism symptoms.\n\n【9】The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) says there’s no evidence that chelation is an effective treatment for autism, and it may be dangerous. One child with the condition died after having this treatment. The AAP doesn't recommend using chelation therapy for autism, except in a clinical trial.\n\n【10】**Alzheimer's Disease.** In patients who have this, abnormal proteins called tau and beta amyloid build up in the brain and damage it. To date, no treatment can stop or reverse this disease.\n\n【11】Some researchers think that a buildup of metals like copper, iron, and zinc might also play a role in Alzheimer's disease. If this is true, chelation therapy might have a place in treating it. So far, there's no evidence that it works.\n\n【12】**Heart Disease.** You get this when fatty deposits called plaques form in your arteries. These substances cause your blood vessels to narrow. They also make them less flexible, so less blood can flow through them. Artery plaques contain calcium. The chelating drug disodium EDTA binds to this mineral. The idea is that chelation therapy clears it out of the blood vessels. It removes plaques, too.\n\n【13】In 2002, the National Institutes of Health did a big study on chelation therapy, called TACT. It found that this treatment somewhat reduced the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and other heart problems. But it only worked in people with diabetes. The study didn't find enough proof that it treats heart disease. And so far, the FDA hasn't approved this treatment for the condition. A new study called TACT2 may yield more information.\n\n【14】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【15】When chelation therapy is used the right way and for the right reason, it can be safe. The most common side effect is burning in the area where you get the IV. You might also experience fever, headache, and nausea or vomiting.\n\n【16】Chelating drugs can bind to and remove some metals your body needs, like calcium, copper, and zinc. This can lead to a deficiency in these important substances. Some people who’ve had chelation therapy also have low calcium levels in the blood and kidney damage.\n\n【17】Things To Watch For\n-------------------\n\n【18】Today, chelation therapy is only FDA-approved to treat metal poisoning. There just isn't enough evidence to support its use for any other condition. And, as research shows, it can be dangerous if it’s used for an unapproved reason.\n\n【19】Beware of any online products or health care providers who try to use this treatment for other purposes -- like Alzheimer's or heart disease. Chelating products are also not approved for home use. They can only be used with a doctor's prescription. If you're thinking about trying chelation therapy, talk to your doctor.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 11:06:29", "endTime": "2024/08/21 11:06:35", "cost": 6.053}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:03", "update_time": "2024-08-20 19:06:35", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 19:06:28"}

It sounds and feels like a cold, alright. But as time goes on, you start to wonder. Is it turning into a sinus infection?\n\n【1】They've got some things in common, but there are ways to tell them apart. The right diagnosis lets your doctor get you the best treatment.\n\n【2】What Is a Common Cold?\n----------------------\n\n【3】It's an illness caused by many different kinds of viruses, which are tiny infectious particles.\n\n【4】You can't miss the symptoms:\n\n【5】*   Nasal congestion\n*   Runny nose\n*   Postnasal drip (drop-by-drop release of fluid from your nose into the back of the throat)\n*   Headache\n*   Fatigue\n\n【6】You may also get a cough and a mild fever. The symptoms usually build, peak, and slowly disappear. Some medications can ease symptoms. For example, decongestants may decrease drainage and open the nasal passages. Pain relievers may help with fever and headache. Cough medicine or a bioelectronic sinus device may help, as well.\n\n【7】Colds typically last from a few days to about a week or longer.\n\n【8】Sometimes, a cold may cause swelling in the sinuses, hollow spaces in your skull that are connected to each other. The swelling can prevent the flow of mucus.\n\n【9】This can lead to a sinus infection. If you have pain around your face and eyes -- and thick yellow or green mucus for more than a week -- see your doctor.\n\n【10】What Is a Sinus Infection?\n--------------------------\n\n【11】It's inflammation or swelling of your sinuses. Normally they're filled with air. When they become blocked and filled with fluid, bacteria can grow there and cause infection. The result: a sinus infection. You may hear your doctor refer to it as sinusitis.\n\n【12】What Are the Symptoms of a Sinus Infection?\n-------------------------------------------\n\n【13】They may include things like:\n\n【14】*   Thick, yellow, foul-smelling discharge from your nose\n*   Pressure or pain around your face and eyes\n*   Headache (generally in the forehead area)\n*   Blockage in your nose\n*   Congestion\n*   Postnasal drip\n*   A cold that won't go away or gets worse\n*   Fever or cough\n\n【15】These symptoms can also happen with a cold. But if they continue for more than 10 days, you may have a sinus infection.\n\n【16】What Causes It?\n---------------\n\n【17】Any condition that blocks off the drainage channels of your sinuses can cause a sinus infection, such as:\n\n【18】*   Colds\n*   Allergies such as hay fever\n*   Nonallergic rhinitis (symptoms that are like an allergy but don't have a known cause)\n*   Nasal polyps (small growths in the lining of your nose)\n\n【19】A sinus infection may start after a cold. It can also happen because of something called a deviated septum, which refers to a shift in your nasal cavity.\n\n【20】How Is a Sinus Infection Diagnosed and Treated?\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n【21】Your doctor will give you a physical exam and take your medical history. You might get a CT scan of your sinuses.\n\n【22】Your doctor may prescribe medication. They may recommend antibiotics if your symptoms go on for more than 10 days. Decongestants, antihistamines, and other drugs help lessen the swelling in your sinuses and nasal passages.\n\n【23】Steam and hot showers can help you loosen mucus. Your doctor may also suggest nasal saline to wash mucus from your nose.\n\n【24】In rare cases, when a sinus infection doesn't go away, long-term antibiotics or surgery may be needed.\n\n【25】When Should I Call the Doctor About a Cold or Sinus Infection?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【26】Most colds go away without medical treatment. If you have pain around your face or eyes, along with thick yellow or green nasal discharge for more than a week, check with your doctor. Also call them if you have fever or symptoms that are severe or don't get better with over-the-counter treatments.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:27:52", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:28:26", "cost": 33.901}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:03", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:28:25", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:27:51"}

Doctors are discovering new forms of leukodystrophy all the time, but experts currently know of about 52 different kinds.\n\n【1】Most of the leukodystrophies are genetic, meaning they’re passed down from parent to child. Sometimes symptoms will show up early in childhood. But because the diseases are progressive, meaning they get worse over time, some children born with a form of leukodystrophy may seem fine.\n\n【2】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【3】The one thing all leukodystrophies have in common is they cause abnormal development or destruction of the brain’s myelin sheath. That’s the white fatty matter that protects the brain’s nerves. Without it, your nervous system can’t function properly.\n\n【4】But each leukodystrophy affects myelin differently. That means children can have many problems, including:\n\n【5】*   Balance and mobility problems\n*   Behavioral and learning disabilities\n*   Bladder issues\n*   Breathing difficulties\n*   Developmental delays\n*   Hearing, speech, and vision problems\n*   Muscle control disorders\n*   Seizures\n\n【6】For example, one type of leukodystrophy, Canavan disease, causes decreased muscle tone, especially in the neck, and abnormally straight legs and flexed arms. It can also include symptoms like blindness and seizures.\n\n【7】Sometimes symptoms show up soon after a child is born, and sometimes as late as adulthood. Signs of Refsum Disease, for example, usually occur around age 20, but can be as late as age 50. Some of the common symptoms include degeneration of the retina in the eye, deafness, and loss of sense of smell.\n\n【8】While every leukodystrophy is different, the most common problem is a child’s health gradually worsening in some way, even though they seemed fine to start with. This can be a worsening of their vision, hearing, speech, ability to eat, behavior, or thought. Since symptoms can vary so much, leukodystrophy can be hard to diagnose.\n\n【9】Causes\n------\n\n【10】Most of the leukodystrophies are inherited, which means they’re passed down through family genes. Some may not be inherited, but are still caused by a genetic mutation. One child in your family could have leukodystrophy, and others might not.\n\n【11】For example, Alexander disease doesn’t seem to be genetically inherited, so your child can have a defective gene even if neither you nor your partner have it.\n\n【12】If you have a child with leukodystrophy and you’re planning to have more children, you may want to consider genetic counseling. It can help you understand your chances of having another child with leukodystrophy.\n\n【13】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【14】Diagnosing leukodystrophy can be difficult. Oftentimes, doctors have to use several types of testing, including:\n\n【15】*   Blood and urine analysis\n*   CT scans\n*   Genetic testing\n*   MRI scans\n*   Psychological and cognitive tests\n\n【16】Treatment\n---------\n\n【17】There is no cure for most kinds of leukodystrophy. Treating it depends on the type, and doctors address the symptoms of the disease with medications and special kinds of physical, occupational, and speech therapy. Some people may need additional help with learning or nutrition.\n\n【18】In some cases, a bone marrow transplant can help by slowing or stopping the progression of the disease. Scientists are also researching whether gene therapy or replacing certain enzymes can help treat some kinds of leukodystrophy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:50:56", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:51:02", "cost": 6.531}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:03", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:51:02", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:50:56"}

It helps to decrease the amount of HIV in the body so your child's immune system can work better. This lowers the chance of getting HIV complications (such as new infections, cancer ) and improves your child's quality of life.Atazanavir belongs to a class of drugs known as protease inhibitors. This form of atazanavir must be given with a certain other protease inhibitor ( ritonavir ) to increase (\"boost\") the levels of atazanavir. This helps atazanavir work better.Atazanavir is not a cure for HIV infection. To decrease the risk of spreading HIV disease to others, your child should continue to take all HIV medications exactly as prescribed by the doctor. Do not share your child's personal items (such as needles/syringes, toothbrushes ) that may have contacted blood or other body fluids. Consult the doctor or pharmacist for more details.\n\n【2】### How to use Reyataz 50 Mg Oral Powder Packet\n\n【3】Read the Patient Information Leaflet and Instructions for Use if available from your pharmacist before you start giving atazanavir to your child and each time you get a refill. If you have any questions, ask the doctor or pharmacist.\n\n【4】This medication is taken by mouth . Give this medication to your child as directed by the doctor, usually once daily. Open the packet and mix its contents with food (such as applesauce, yogurt) as directed. If your child cannot eat solid food, this medication may be mixed with liquid (such as milk, infant formula, or water). If your child is younger than 6 months and cannot eat solid food or drink from a cup, mix this medication with infant formula as directed and give it to your child using an oral syringe. Do not use a baby bottle . Give the dose within 1 hour after mixing with food or liquid. Also, give your child's ritonavir dose right after this medication.\n\n【5】Since this medication may cause kidney problems, give plenty of fluids during treatment to lower the risk.\n\n【6】The dosage is based on your child's medical condition, weight , response to treatment, and other medications your child may be taking. Be sure to tell the doctor and pharmacist about all the products your child uses (including prescription drugs , nonprescription drugs, and herbal products).\n\n【7】If your child is taking antacids or buffered forms of drugs (such as didanosine solution, didanosine enteric \\-coated capsules), give atazanavir at least 2 hours before or 1 hour after these medications.\n\n【8】For the best effect, take this medication at evenly spaced times. To help you remember, take this medication at the same time every day.\n\n【9】It is very important to continue giving this medication (and other HIV medications) exactly as prescribed by the doctor. Do not skip any doses. Do not give more or less of this drug than prescribed or stop giving it (or other HIV medicines) even for a short time unless directed to do so by the doctor. Doing so may cause the amount of virus to increase, make the infection more difficult to treat (resistant), or worsen side effects.\n\n【10】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【11】Headache or nausea may occur. If either of these effects lasts or gets worse, tell the doctor or pharmacist promptly.\n\n【12】Remember that this medication has been prescribed because the doctor has judged that the benefit to your child is greater than the risk of side effects. Many people using this medication do not have serious side effects.\n\n【13】As your immune system gets stronger, it can begin to fight off infections you already had, possibly causing disease symptoms to come back.

Polymyalgia literally means \"many muscle pains.\" Rheumatica means \"changing\" or \"in flux.\"\n\n【1】What Are the Symptoms of Polymyalgia Rheumatica?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【2】Symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica tend to develop quickly and in addition to muscle pain, other symptoms may include:\n\n【3】*   Stiffness around the shoulders and hips, especially in the morning and after resting\n*   Weakness\n*   Fatigue\n*   Generally feeling ill\n*   Mild fevers (occasionally)\n*   Weight loss\n\n【4】What Is Temporal Arteritis?\n---------------------------\n\n【5】About 15% of people with polymyalgia rheumatica also have temporal arteritis and about half of people with temporal arteritis also have polymyalgia rheumatica. Temporal arteritis causes inflammation that damages large and medium-sized arteries. The name of the condition stems from the fact that some of the affected arteries provide blood to the head, including the temples. Temporal arteritis is also known as \"giant cell arteritis.\"\n\n【6】What Are the Symptoms of Temporal Arteritis?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【7】Temporal arteritis has several symptoms, including:\n\n【8】*   Severe headaches, the most common symptom\n*   Scalp tenderness\n*   Jaw or facial soreness, especially with chewing\n*   Vision changes or distorted vision that's caused by decreased blood flow to the eye\n*   Stroke (rare)\n*   Fatigue \n*   Fever\n*   Weight loss\n*   Night sweats\n*   Depression\n*   Feeling ill \n\n【9】Who Gets Polymyalgia Rheumatica and Temporal Arteritis?\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n【10】Polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis frequently affect people over age 50. The average age of patients is 70. These diseases are more common among women, and Caucasians are more likely to get these diseases than other ethnic groups.\n\n【11】The exact cause of these illnesses is unknown.\n\n【12】How Are Polymyalgia Rheumatica and Temporal Arteritis Diagnosed?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】Under the new criteria developed by the American College of Rheumatology and The European League Against Rheumatism, patients ages 50 years and older can be classified as having PMR if they meet the conditions below:\n\n【14】*   Shoulder pain on both sides\n*   Morning stiffness that lasts at least 45 minutes\n*   High levels of inflammation measured by blood tests\n*   Reported new hip pain\n*   Absence of swelling in the small joints of the hands and feet, and absence of positive blood tests for rheumatoid arthritis\n\n【15】The new classification criteria may also help to evaluate existing treatments for polymyalgia rheumatica.\n\n【16】Everyone with polymyalgia rheumatica is typically tested for temporal arteritis. This, too, would start with the exam and listening to the patient's symptoms.\n\n【17】If temporal arteritis is suspected, but less convincing features are present, a temporal artery biopsy may confirm the diagnosis. The biopsy is taken from a part of the artery located in the hairline, in front of the ear. In most cases the biopsy is helpful, but in some individuals it may be negative or normal, even though the person does have temporal arteritis.\n\n【18】Can Other Problems Mimic Polymyalgia Rheumatica?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】Yes. Some other illnesses that may be confused with polymyalgia rheumatica include:\n\n【20】*   Rheumatoid arthritis\n*   Infections\n*   Inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis)\n*   Chemical and hormonal abnormalities\n*   A variety of muscle diseases\n*   Cancer\n\n【21】How Are Polymyalgia Rheumatica and Temporal Arteritis Treated?\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【22】There is no known cure for polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis, but these diseases can be treated and controlled. Corticosteroids -- often called \"steroids\" -- help rapidly relieve the symptoms of both conditions.\n\n【23】Treatment with steroids -- usually in the form of prednisone -- is mandatory for temporal arteritis to prevent serious complications, such as blindness. Low doses of steroids are often successful in treating polymyalgia rheumatica. Higher doses are often required to treat temporal arteritis.\n\n【24】Steroids reduce the function of inflammatory cells that cause these illnesses. Consequently, steroids minimize tissue damage. Steroids also impair the immune system -- thus increasing the risk of infection.\n\n【25】The decision to prescribe steroids is always made on an individual basis. Your doctor will consider your age, presence of other illnesses, and medications you are taking. Your doctor also will make sure you understand the potential benefits and risks of steroids before you start taking them.\n\n【26】You will have frequent blood tests while taking steroids or other medications to monitor for possible side effects and to evaluate the effectiveness of therapy. These blood tests can usually detect problems before you are aware of any symptoms. Your doctor will frequently evaluate your heart and lung function and blood sugar level, which may increase after you start taking steroids.\n\n【27】While being treated for polymyalgia rheumatica or temporal arteritis, it is important to keep all appointments with your doctor and the lab, and have your blood pressure checked regularly.\n\n【28】Because the medicines used to treat polymyalgia and temporal arteritis increase your chance for developing infections, report symptoms such as a cough, fever, or shortness of breath to your doctor.\n\n【29】Long-term steroid treatment (for a few months to several years) requires additional testing and monitoring. The long-term use of steroids can cause osteoporosis (bone loss), which can be detected with scans similar to X-rays. Taking supplements of calcium and vitamin D, sometimes along with prescription medication is recommended to prevent osteoporosis in people taking steroids. Discuss the potential side effects caused by your treatment with your doctor.\n\n【30】Temporal arteritis may also be treated with methotrexate or a biologic drug called tocilizumab (Actemra). Tocilizumab is given as an injection under the skin to decrease the amount of steroid a person needs. This medicine may be used along with steroids.\n\n【31】Treatments work fairly quickly and have excellent results. \n\n【32】What Is the Long-Term Outlook for Polymyalgia Rheumatica and Temporal Arteritis?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【33】With careful monitoring and appropriate treatment, most patients with polymyalgia rheumatica or temporal arteritis have a normal life span and lifestyle. Most of the time, these diseases can be successfully controlled with steroids and other drugs (including tocilizumab, a rheumatoid arthritis drug which has been touted for people who have trouble with or do not respond to steroids).\n\n【34】The success of treatment is related to prompt diagnosis, aggressive treatment, and careful follow-up to prevent or minimize side effects from the medications.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 11:00:43", "endTime": "2024/08/21 11:00:58", "cost": 15.413}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:03", "update_time": "2024-08-20 19:00:58", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 19:00:43"}

You end up with better vision and recover without any long-term issues. But like any surgery, there are risks, especially if you have other eye problems or a serious medical condition.\n\n【1】So it helps to know what might go wrong. You can keep a close watch on any symptoms and call your doctor if something seems off.\n\n【2】Infection\n---------\n\n【3】Germs that get in your eye during surgery can lead to an infection. You might feel sensitive to light or have pain, redness, and vision problems. If this happens to you, call your doctor right away.\n\n【4】Infections after cataract surgery are rare, but if you have one, you'll get a shot of antibiotics into your eye. In some cases, your doctor also removes the vitreous, the clear gel in the center of the eye, to stop the infection from spreading.\n\n【5】Inflammation\n------------\n\n【6】A little swelling and redness after surgery is normal. If you have more than usual, you'll get eye drops or other medicine to take care of it.\n\n【7】Retinal Detachment\n------------------\n\n【8】The retina sits way back in your eye, sensing light and sending messages to the brain. After surgery, you have a slightly higher chance that it pulls away from the back of the eye -- a problem called retinal detachment.\n\n【9】It's an emergency that could cause loss of vision. See your eye doctor right away if you:\n\n【10】*   Feel like a curtain has fallen over part of your eye\n*   Have new floating spots in your vision\n*   See flashes of light\n\n【11】Lens Fragments\n--------------\n\n【12】When your doctor removes your cloudy lens during cataract surgery, some pieces may fall into your eye and get left behind. Small ones aren't a problem, but bigger ones can be.\n\n【13】You may need surgery to remove the vitreous and prevent swelling.\n\n【14】Fluid Buildup in the Retina\n---------------------------\n\n【15】Sometimes after surgery, blood vessels in the retina leak. As fluid collects in your eye, it blurs your vision.\n\n【16】Your doctor will treat it with eye drops, and it could take weeks or months to heal. It usually gets completely better. In more serious cases, you may need a steroid shot behind the eye or surgery.\n\n【17】Dislocated Intraocular Lens (IOL)\n---------------------------------\n\n【18】The IOL is the artificial lens your doctor puts in your eye during surgery. It can slip out of place, causing blurred or double vision.\n\n【19】It can also lead to more serious issues like bleeding and swelling. You may need surgery to get it back in position or to put in a new one.\n\n【20】Secondary Cataract\n------------------\n\n【21】The lens capsule surrounds the eye's lens. Cataract surgery removes the front part of the lens but leaves the back in place. That's where you may get a secondary cataract, also called posterior capsule opacification (PCO). When that happens, your vision may get cloudy again. It usually happens eventually after cataract surgery.\n\n【22】To fix it, you need a procedure called YAG laser capsulotomy. Your doctor uses a laser to create a hole in the back of the lens capsule. That lets light pass through so you can see normally. It's painless and takes about 5 minutes. This happens to everybody who has had cataract surgery and is a natural process. \n\n【23】Swelling in the Cornea\n----------------------\n\n【24】The cornea is the clear, front part of the eye. It may get swollen and hazy after surgery, making it harder to see.\n\n【25】This problem is almost always temporary and gets better in days or weeks. Your doctor may treat it with eye drops.\n\n【26】Bleeding\n--------\n\n【27】It's rare, but during surgery, blood vessels that supply the retina may start bleeding for no reason. A little bit of blood isn't a problem, but larger amounts could lead to loss of vision.\n\n【28】After surgery, blood may collect between the cornea and iris -- the colored part of your eye -- and block your vision. Eye drops may help, and you'll need to rest in bed with your head up.\n\n【29】If the blood doesn't drain or causes too much pressure in your eye, you may need surgery.\n\n【30】Floaters and Flashes of Light\n-----------------------------\n\n【31】Surgery can cause posterior vitreous detachment, where the vitreous separates from the retina. It makes you see moving spider webs and clouds in your vision, along with flashes of light.\n\n【32】Usually, it gets better on its own within a few months. Because the symptoms are similar to retinal detachment, call your doctor right away to get checked out.\n\n【33】High Eye Pressure\n-----------------\n\n【34】For some people, surgery raises pressure in the eye. It's called ocular hypertension and can damage your vision. Your doctor may suggest you treat it with eye drops, shots, or pills.\n\n【35】Swelling, bleeding, or leftover lens fragments can cause greater pressure in your eye, which can lead to glaucoma.\n\n【36】How it's treated depends on the specific reason it's happening. If your optic nerve gets damaged, you might also need glaucoma surgery.\n\n【37】Light Sensitivity\n-----------------\n\n【38】This can be normal, but if it lasts more than a couple of days, talk to your doctor.\n\n【39】Sometimes, you just need to wear sunglasses for a few months until it goes away. But it could also be a sign of another issue, like too much inflammation in your eye, and you may need eye drops.\n\n【40】Droopy Eyelid\n-------------\n\n【41】Also called ptosis, this is a common condition after eye surgery.\n\n【42】Doctors don't know what causes it, but it typically goes away on its own. If it lasts more than 6 months, you may need surgery.\n\n【43】Dysphotopsia\n------------\n\n【44】This causes you to see visual effects, and there are two types:\n\n【45】*   Negative, which gives you a curved shadow at the edge of your vision\n*   Positive, which you see as halos, starbursts, flashes, or streaks of light\n\n【46】Doctors don't know why it happens, and it often goes away on its own. It's more likely to last when it's the negative kind. Typically, you wait and see if it gets better. You might try eye drops or even glasses with thick rims so you don't notice the shadow as much.\n\n【47】If it goes on for months, your doctor may suggest surgery. You might get a new lens or try a second lens on top of the first.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 11:01:29", "endTime": "2024/08/21 11:01:39", "cost": 9.511}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:03", "update_time": "2024-08-20 19:01:39", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 19:01:29"}

Parkinson's disease is thought to be caused by too little of a naturally occurring substance ( dopamine ) in the brain . Levodopa changes into dopamine in the brain, helping to control movement. Carbidopa prevents the breakdown of levodopa in the bloodstream so more levodopa can enter the brain. Carbidopa can also reduce some of levodopa's side effects such as nausea and vomiting .\n\n【2】### How to use Rytary\n\n【3】Take this medication by mouth as directed by your doctor, usually 3 times a day.\n\n【4】Swallow the capsules whole. Do not crush or chew the capsules. Doing so can release all of the drug at once, increasing the risk of side effects. If you have trouble swallowing the capsule, you may open up the capsule and sprinkle the entire contents onto a small amount (1 to 2 tablespoons or 15 to 30 grams) of applesauce. Swallow all of the mixture right away without chewing it. Do not prepare the mixture ahead of time for later use.\n\n【5】This medication may be taken with or without food. However, avoid high- protein diets because they may reduce how much of the medication you can absorb. Also avoid taking this medication with a high- fat , high-calorie meal since this can slow down the time it begins to work by about 2 hours. The manufacturer says you should take your first dose of the day about 1 to 2 hours before eating. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how best to take this medication.\n\n【6】Separate your dose of this medication as many hours as possible from any iron supplements or products containing iron (such as multivitamins with minerals ) you may take.

If you experience increased sleepiness or fall asleep during the day, do not drive or take part in other possibly dangerous activities until you have discussed this effect with your doctor. Your risk of this sleep effect is increased by using alcohol or other medications that can make you drowsy.

It's very rare. Only 1 out of every 1 million people gets it. About 300 people are diagnosed with chordoma in the United States each year.\n\n【1】You can get it at any age -- even in childhood. But most people are diagnosed between ages 40 and 70. Men get it more often than women.\n\n【2】Chordomas can form anywhere in your back, neck, or skull. Many grow in the bottom of your spine or at the base of your skull. From there, they can spread to other organs, like your lungs. But they usually grow slowly.\n\n【3】Because they're close to important areas like the brain and spinal cord, they need to be treated very carefully.\n\n【4】Causes\n------\n\n【5】In the womb, a baby has a thin bar called a notochord that runs along their back. This bar supports the bones of the spine as they grow. The notochord disappears before the baby is born.\n\n【6】In a small number of people, some of the notochord cells are left behind in the spine and skull.\n\n【7】Doctors believe chordoma starts because of a change in the gene that carries instructions for making a protein that helps the spine form. This change causes notochord cells that are left in the brain or spinal cord to divide too quickly.\n\n【8】This change usually happens randomly -- no one in your family has to have chordoma for you to get it. But it can run in families in rare instances.\n\n【9】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【10】Chordomas can press on nerves in your spine or brain. This can cause pain, numbness, or weakness. Your symptoms depend on where the cancer is and how big it is.\n\n【11】Chordoma in the skull causes symptoms like:\n\n【12】*   Abnormal eye movements\n*   Changes to your voice or speech\n*   Double vision\n*   Headache\n*   Loss of feeling and movement in your face\n*   Neck pain\n*   Trouble swallowing\n\n【13】Chordoma of the spine causes symptoms like:\n\n【14】*   Loss of control over your bowels\n*   Lump in the lower part of your back\n*   Numbness, tingling, or weakness in your arms or legs\n*   Pain in your lower back\n*   Problems controlling your bladder\n\n【15】Sometimes, chordomas in the brain can block the flow of fluid there and in the spine. The fluid can build up and put pressure on the brain. This is called hydrocephalus.\n\n【16】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【17】Your doctor can do imaging tests to see where the cancer is inside your body and how big it's grown. These include:\n\n【18】*   X-ray: Low doses of radiation are used to make images of your brain or spinal cord.\n*   CT (computed tomography) scan: X-rays are taken from several different angles and put together to make detailed pictures of the affected area.\n*   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): Powerful magnets and radio waves are used to make pictures of organs and other structures inside your body.\n\n【19】A biopsy is the only test that can confirm you have chordoma. Your doctor will use a needle to take a small sample of cells from the tumor. A specialist will look at the cells under a microscope to see what kind of tumor you have.\n\n【20】Your doctor might also do a blood test, a CT scan of your lungs, or a bone scan to see if the tumor has spread.\n\n【21】Treatment\n---------\n\n【22】Your treatment will depend on:\n\n【23】*   Your age\n*   Your health\n*   Size of the tumor\n*   Where the tumor is\n\n【24】Often, doctors remove the tumor with surgery. Taking out as much of the tumor as possible and some of the tissue around it can stop it from coming back.\n\n【25】Sometimes surgeons can't remove the whole tumor because they might damage healthy cells in your brain or spine. Radiation -- high energy X-rays -- can kill any cancer cells that are left behind after surgery. This lowers the chance that the cancer will return.\n\n【26】Still, chordoma often comes back after treatment. During the first year after your surgery, your doctor will check you with an MRI about once every 3 months to make sure it hasn't. If it does come back, you might need another surgery.\n\n【27】Researchers are studying several new treatments for chordoma. They test these in clinical trials to see if they're safe and if they work. These are often a way for people to try a new therapy that isn't available to everyone. Your doctor can tell you if there's a trial that might be a good fit for you.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:16:43", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:17:49", "cost": 65.96}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:03", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:17:49", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:16:43"}

But many people live with this condition every day. Hearing from others who know what it’s like can make you feel less isolated and help you find new ways to deal with nervous feelings. Group therapy is one way to make those connections as part of your treatment.\n\n【1】What a Group Is Like\n--------------------\n\n【2】Group therapy usually includes five to 15 people with a common issue -- in this case, anxiety -- who meet, usually every week for an hour or so. Yours might be for people with all types of anxiety or for specific types, such as social phobia. Most groups are held in person in a space like a community center or hospital. Others meet online.\n\n【3】A trained therapist will lead the sessions. Your therapist will talk to you and the group and make suggestions about dealing with anxiety. You’ll also talk with other members of the group, who share their experiences and may make suggestions to each other. The goal is to learn about yourself and find new ways to ease your anxious feelings. You might improve your relationships with others, feel more connected, and be more satisfied with your life, too.\n\n【4】Groups that focus on anxiety often use cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). In CBT, a therapist helps you identify negative thoughts (including anxious ones) and replace them with healthier, more realistic ones. Some sessions may include outings or social events.\n\n【5】You may decide to see a therapist on your own and also go to a group, along with using other treatments for anxiety, such as medication.\n\n【6】Finding the Right Group\n-----------------------\n\n【7】Before you join, it can help to ask the organizer or therapist running the group these questions:\n\n【8】**Is this group open or closed?** Can people join at any time, or does everyone begin together and meet for a set period of time (for example, 12 weeks)? Starting together as a closed group may help you get to know the members better, making for good, productive conversations. But with an open group, you can start therapy right away instead of waiting for the next open session.\n\n【9】**How many people are in the group?** A large gathering means you get to hear from more people. A small one can give you more time to work through your own feelings. A psychologist or another therapist can help you decide which size suits your needs.\n\n【10】**Do all the members have anxiety?** There are lots of different kinds of support groups. They often work best when most of the members have similar issues.\n\n【11】**What are the rules for sharing in this group?** A therapist won’t share anything you say to them. Group members aren’t supposed to, either. Ground rules about keeping what’s shared during therapy confidential can help the members build trust with each other.\n\n【12】What to Consider\n----------------\n\n【13】One of the biggest advantages is that you’ll get support from other people who feel like you do. That can improve your mood and make you feel less alone.\n\n【14】Other people who have started to treat their anxiety may inspire you. You might pick up tips or techniques that help you deal with your own situation.\n\n【15】Helping problem-solve for your fellow group members can also remind you that you know a lot about managing anxiety. That can prompt you to use those skills in your own life. And group therapy is often less expensive than individual counseling.\n\n【16】There can be drawbacks, though. If one person doesn’t want to open up to the group, others may hesitate to share their thoughts. That can make sessions less effective.\n\n【17】While you may get helpful ideas from other members, don’t take their opinions and comments more seriously than the therapist who is leading the group.\n\n【18】If you have concerns about how your group is going, you may want to privately talk to the therapist who leads it to see if they can change how things are done. Or you may want to try another group or one-on-one therapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 10:52:50", "endTime": "2024/08/21 10:53:37", "cost": 47.662}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:02", "update_time": "2024-08-20 18:53:37", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 18:52:49"}

A variant usually doesn't affect how the virus works. But sometimes they make it act in different ways.\n\n【2】Scientists around the world are tracking changes in the virus that causes COVID-19. Their research is helping experts understand whether certain COVID-19 variants spread faster than others, how they might affect your health, and how effective different vaccines might be against them.\n\n【3】How Many Coronaviruses Are There?\n---------------------------------\n\n【4】Coronaviruses didn't just pop up recently. They're a large family of viruses that have been around for a long time. Many of them can cause a variety of illnesses, from a mild cough to severe respiratory illnesses.\n\n【5】The new (or “novel”) coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is one of several known to infect humans. It's probably been around for some time in animals. Sometimes, a virus in animals crosses over into people. That's what scientists think happened here. So this virus isn't new to the world, but it is new to humans. When scientists found out that it was making people sick in 2019, they named it as a novel coronavirus. Experts call these strains SARS-CoV-2.\n\n【6】How Do Variants Happen?\n-----------------------\n\n【7】Coronaviruses have all their genetic material in something called RNA (ribonucleic acid). RNA has some similarities to DNA, but they aren't the same.\n\n【8】When viruses infect you, they attach to your cells, get inside them, and make copies of their RNA, which helps them spread. If there's a copying mistake, the RNA gets changed. Scientists call those changes mutations.\n\n【9】These changes happen randomly and by accident. It's a normal part of what happens to viruses as they multiply and spread.\n\n【10】Because the changes are random, they may make little to no difference in a person's health. Other times, they may cause disease. For example, one reason you need a flu shot every year is because influenza viruses change from year to year. This year's flu virus probably isn't the exact same one that circulated last year.\n\n【11】If a virus has a random change that makes it easier to infect people and it spreads, that variant will become more common.\n\n【12】The bottom line is that all viruses, including coronaviruses, can change over time, and there have been several variants already that have contributed to the pandemic. As of May 2022, the CDC only lists one as a Variant of Concern (VOC) and that is the Omicron variant.\n\n【13】What Is the Omicron Variant?\n----------------------------\n\n【14】The Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) was first detected in specimens collected on Nov. 11, 2021, in Botswana. Experts in South Africa first reported the Omicron variant to the World Health Organization (WHO) on Nov. 24, 2021. They discovered the variant after COVID-19 infections suddenly began to go up.\n\n【15】The WHO grouped Omicron as a VOC. This category means the variant might have higher transmissibility, cause more intense disease, and may be less likely to respond to vaccines or treatments. \n\n【16】The Omicron variant is now the dominant strain in the U.S.\n\n【17】Experts are keeping a close eye on how the variant spreads or develops. So, far, the Omicron variant has been found to carry a higher risk of reinfection compared to other variants and while it can still be deadly, most infections are not as serious.\n\n【18】Breakthrough infections are possible with the Omicron variant even if you’re fully vaccinated. However, COVID-19 vaccines and boosters are still effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalizations, and death.\n\n【19】Current PCR tests for COVID-19 can effectively find Omicron cases. Experts found that one specific PCR test doesn't identify one of the three target genes (called the S gene dropout) in people infected with Omicron. Because of this, these tests can specifically mark positive Omicron cases and, because of that, can detect this variant faster than with previous surges.\n\n【20】In the meantime, experts recommend protecting yourself by getting the vaccine or a booster if you’re eligible for it. Wear a mask and maintain social distance if the COVID-19 community level is high or if you prefer to be masked.  Also wear a mask if you or a family member are at high risk for severe COVID-19 disease even if the community level is at medium.\n\n【21】If you test positive for COVID or if you’ve come in close contact with someone who has it, follow the CDC guidelines for quarantine and isolation. Call your doctor if you notice symptoms.\n\n【22】**Omicron “stealth” variant (BA.2)**: Scientists call it Omicron BA.2 as opposed to the original Omicron variant, BA.1. At first, scientists thought BA.2 wasn’t as contagious as BA.1 and would soon fade away. That didn’t happen, and starting in January 2022, BA.2 appeared to be at least as easy to transmit as BA.1.\n\n【23】As of the end of February 2022, BA.2 showed signs of spreading more easily than other variants, though it didn’t seem to cause more serious symptoms. The World Health Organization has said that BA.2 is a “variant of concern.”\n\n【24】The best protection is still the coronavirus vaccine. Current vaccines and boosters seem to work well against BA.2, protecting against initial infection as well as against serious illness if you do get infected.\n\n【25】**Omicron subvariant BA.2.12.1**: As of early May 2022, it made up almost 43% of COVID-19 infections in the U.S. Some early research suggests it’s spreading faster than other Omicron subvariants. The CDC is looking into how it spreads and how well available treatments and the COVID vaccine work against it.\n\n【26】**Omicron variants BA.4 and BA.5.** These were first spotted in South Africa. There, they’ve “rapidly replaced” BA.2, according to early research. As of May 2022, the CDC listed BA.4 and BA.5 as variants of concern.\n\n【27】Earlier Coronavirus Variants\n----------------------------\n\n【28】**Alpha (B.1.1.7).** In late 2020, experts noted gene mutations in COVID-19 cases seen in people in southeastern England. This variant has since been reported in other countries, including the U.S. Scientists estimate that these mutations could make the virus up to 70% more transmissible, meaning it could spread more easily. Some research has linked this variant to a higher risk of death, but the evidence isn't strong.\n\n【29】The mutation on the Alpha variant is on the spike protein, which helps the virus infect its host. This is what COVID-19 vaccines target. These vaccines make antibodies against many parts of the spike protein, so it's unlikely that a single new mutation in the Alpha variant will make the vaccine less effective.\n\n【30】**Beta (B.1.351).** This variant was first found in other countries, including South Africa and Nigeria. The Beta variant appears to spread more easily than the original virus but doesn't seem to cause worse illness.\n\n【31】**Gamma (P.1).** In January 2021, experts spotted this COVID-19 variant in people from Brazil who'd traveled to Japan. By the end of that month, it was showing up in the U.S.\n\n【32】The Gamma variant appears to be more contagious than earlier strains of the virus. And it may be able to infect people who've already had COVID-19. A report from Brazil confirms that a 29-year-old woman came down with this variant after an earlier coronavirus infection a few months before.   \n\n【33】Some early research suggests that the variant's changes might help it evade antibodies (made by your immune system after an infection or a vaccine) that fight the coronavirus. A lab study shows that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine can neutralize the fast-spreading Brazil strain. But more research is needed.\n\n【34】**Delta (B.1.617.2).** This variant was spotted in India in December 2020. It caused a huge surge in cases in mid-April 2021, quickly spreading across the globe. \n\n【35】By March 2022 its presence had diminished considerably due to the prevalence of Omicron And the WHO had downgraded it from a VOC to a VBM in April. It is no longer considered a threat to public health in the U.S.\n\n【36】Research suggests that changes to the spike protein made the Delta variant up to 50% more transmissible than previous COVID-19 variants.\n\n【37】**Mu (B.1.621).** Experts first spotted this COVID-19 variant (pronounced m'yoo) in Colombia in January 2021. Since then, countries in South America and Europe have reported outbreaks of Mu.\n\n【38】In the U.S. the CDC says Mu reached a peak in June 2021, when it made up less than 5% of variants going around the country. As of early September, it had been steadily declining.  \n\n【39】**R.1.** Scientists first detected R.1 in a number of countries, including Japan. There was an outbreak at a Kentucky nursing home in March 2021, when an unvaccinated health care worker passed it to about 45 other staff and residents.\n\n【40】The WHO labeled it a “variant under monitoring” in April 2021, meaning some of its characteristics may pose a future risk to humans.\n\n【41】As of October 2021, the CDC hadn't labeled R.1 as a variant of concern or interest.\n\n【42】**Epsilon**, **Theta**, and **Zeta** were at one point listed as variants of interest and were downgraded by the WHO. They are still being monitored.\n\n【43】The First Variants\n------------------\n\n【44】Earlier in 2020, when the pandemic was new, you might have heard that there was more than one strain of the new coronavirus. Is it true? The answer appeared to be yes.\n\n【45】The theory about different variants of the new coronavirus came from a study in China. Researchers were studying changes in coronavirus RNA over time to figure out how various coronaviruses are related to each other. They looked at 103 samples of the new coronavirus collected from people, and they looked at coronaviruses from animals. It turned out that the coronaviruses found in humans weren't all the same.\n\n【46】There were two types, which the researchers called “L” and “S.” They're very similar, with slight differences in two places. It looks like the S type came first. But the scientists say the L type was more common early in the outbreak.\n\n【47】What to Expect\n--------------\n\n【48】The virus that causes COVID-19 will probably keep changing. Experts may find new variants. It's impossible to predict how those virus changes might affect what happens. But change is just what viruses do.\n\n【49】NEWSLETTER\n\n【50】Stay Up-to-Date on COVID-19\n\n【51】Sign up for the latest coronavirus news.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:19:15", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:19:37", "cost": 22.484}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:02", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:19:37", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:19:15"}

But some children who have it might not complain about the joint pain.\n\n【2】The condition can affect any joint, and it may limit how well that joint works.\n\n【3】Most children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis recover fully. With the right treatment, they’re likely to do well and live a normal life.\n\n【4】Causes\n------\n\n【5】Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is an autoimmune disorder. This means that the immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues. That causes the inflammation.\n\n【6】Researchers don't know exactly why it happens. But they think it's a two-step process. First, something in a child’s genes makes them more likely to get it. Then something else, like a virus, triggers the arthritis itself.\n\n【7】How Is It Different From Adult Rheumatoid Arthritis?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】Adults who have it usually have symptoms all their lives. But studies show that by adulthood, 70% of children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis outgrow it. They don’t have symptoms anymore. \n\n【9】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【10】Besides joint pain, it may cause chronic fever and anemia, which is a shortage of red blood cells. It can also affect the heart, lungs, eyes, and nervous system.\n\n【11】Flare-ups, times when it gets worse, can last for several weeks. Later on, symptoms may lessen. They include:\n\n【12】*   Fevers of 103 F or higher\n*   Pink rash that comes and goes\n*   Eye inflammation\n*   Joint pain or stiffness\n*   Limping\n*   Swelling in joints\n*   Being less active\n*   Trouble with movements of hands or fingers, affecting things like handwriting or coloring\n*   Problems with bone development and growth\n\n【13】Different Types of Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】There are three kinds. Each type is based on the number of joints involved, the symptoms, and certain antibodies that may be in the blood.\n\n【15】1.  **Four or fewer joints are involved.** Doctors call this pauciarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis.\n\n【16】It’s the most common form. About half of all children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis have this type.\n\n【17】It usually affects large joints like the knees. Girls under age 8 are most likely to get it.\n\n【18】Some children with this type have special proteins in the blood called antinuclear antibodies. They are more likely to get eye diseases like iritis, which is inflammation of the iris, or colored part of the eye. They can also get uveitis, which is inflammation of the inner eye. These children need regular eye exams by an ophthalmologist, a doctor who specializes in eye diseases.\n\n【19】Lots of children with this condition will outgrow it by adulthood. Still, eye problems can continue, and joint symptoms may come back.\n\n【20】1.  **Five or more joints are involved.** You may hear this called polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. \n\n【21】About 30% of all children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis have this type. It usually affects the small joints, like those in the hands and feet, but it can sometimes involve the large joints.\n\n【22】This type of juvenile idiopathic arthritis is usually symmetrical. That means it affects the same joints on both sides of the body.\n\n【23】Some children who have this have an immune system chemical called rheumatoid factor in their blood. They often have a more severe form of the condition.\n\n【24】1.  **It affects much of the body.** Doctors may call this form “systemic.”\n\n【25】Signs of this include joint swelling, fever, and a light pink rash. It may involve the heart, liver, spleen, and lymph nodes.\n\n【26】A small percentage of children who have it develop arthritis in their joints. They may have severe arthritis that lasts into adulthood.\n\n【27】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【28】Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is often hard to diagnose. Sometimes children who have it do not complain of pain. In fact, parents may not be aware of symptoms.\n\n【29】Some symptoms are similar to other serious conditions like infections, cancer, bone disorders, Lyme disease, and lupus.\n\n【30】If a doctor thinks a child may have juvenile idiopathic arthritis, they will ask about symptoms and the family’s medical history. They will give the child a physical exam to look for joint swelling, rashes, signs of internal organ inflammation, and eye problems. They may also take samples of the child’s blood and joint fluid, and use X-rays or other tests.\n\n【31】Treatment\n---------\n\n【32】Treatment usually includes medications along with exercise. The goals are to:\n\n【33】*   Stop inflammation\n*   Ease pain and swelling\n*   Strengthen joints and help them move better\n*   Prevent joint damage and other complications\n\n【34】Medications\n-----------\n\n【35】Medications for juvenile idiopathic arthritis include:\n\n【36】**NSAIDS (Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs)**\n\n【37】The medicines can curb pain, fever, and inflammation.\n\n【38】They come as a liquid or a pill. People usually take them from one to 4 times a day. Some common NSAIDs are aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, and tolmetin.\n\n【39】While NSAIDs ease pain and inflammation, they also have side effects. These include stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, headache, and anemia. Sometimes your doctor will give you another stomach\\-protecting medication to take with the NSAIDs. This will make stomach bleeding less likely.\n\n【40】If you child does not respond well to NSAIDS, the doctor may prescribe a new drug called Xatmep. Xatmep is the first ready-to-use oral solution formulation of methotrexate to be approved for use in children with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis. An aggressive therapy, this medicine helps reduce further joint damage and helps preserve joint function. Side effects can include dizziness, fatigue, chills and fever.\n\n【41】**Meds That Stop the Condition From Getting Worse**\n\n【42】Your doctor may prescribe “DMARDs,” which stands for Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs. They also help with joint stiffness, pain, and swelling. Examples include hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), methotrexate, and sulfasalazine (Azulfidine).\n\n【43】It may take about 3 to 6 months for these medicines to work.\n\n【44】Because these are strong drugs, your child will need frequent tests to check for side effects. They can include anemia, low blood count, and kidney and liver problems. Other possible problems could be stomach aches, diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, headaches, rashes, loss of appetite, and weakness.\n\n【45】**“Biologic” Drugs for Your Immune System**\n\n【46】These drugs are genetically engineered to work on the immune system. They include adalimumab (Humira), adalimumab-atto (Amjevita), a biosimilar to Humira, anakinra (Kineret), etanercept (Enbrel), etanercept\\-szzs (Ereizi), a biosimilar to Enbrel, infliximab (Remicade), and infliximab-dyyb (Inflectra), a biosimilar to Remicade.\n\n【47】If you take them, you are more likely to get an infection, including serious diseases like tuberculosis. Some biologics are only approved by the FDA for use in adults. Check with your doctor about which ones are appropriate for children.\n\n【48】**If You Need Corticosteroids**\n\n【49】These are strong, anti-inflammatory drugs. Doctors usually prescribe them only if other treatments don’t work, or if the condition is severe.\n\n【50】This type of steroid isn’t the kind that bulks up your muscles.\n\n【51】Corticosteroids come in pills or liquids, and are usually prescribed for short periods of time and in low dosages. Serious side effects can happen if they’re taken too long. These include stunted growth, ulcers, mood swings, weight gain, \"moon face,\" muscle weakness, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, cataracts, and infections.\n\n【52】Examples of steroids include dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, methylprednisolone, prednisolone, and prednisone.\n\n【53】Exercise\n--------\n\n【54】Exercise and physical activity are important for children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Movement brings less pain, builds strength, and keeps joints moving well.\n\n【55】With the help of physical and occupational therapists, children learn simple ways to do everyday things. Therapists teach them exercises to improve their flexibility and strength.\n\n【56】It can help to use hot and cold treatments. For instance, a warm compress can loosen up a stiff muscle and an ice pack often reduces swelling and inflammation.\n\n【57】Therapists can also make splints for children to correctly position their joints and reduce pain. They can be used on knees, wrists, and fingers, as well as at night during sleep.\n\n【58】If your child has juvenile idiopathic arthritis, encourage them to get out there and be active. Avoid contact sports and instead go for things that are not stressful on the joints, like swimming.\n\n【59】Complications\n-------------\n\n【60】Eye problems are linked to some forms of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, so keep up with your child’s eye tests.\n\n【61】The condition can also cause problems with oral health if it affects the jaw and makes it hard to brush and floss teeth. Dentists can recommend special toothbrushes and floss to help children take care of their mouths.\n\n【62】Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) or jaw pain sometimes happens with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Certain exercises can help with jaw pain and stiffness. If the lower jaw doesn’t develop correctly, it can cause an overbite. An orthodontist can usually fix this. In some cases, surgery may be needed.\n\n【63】You may also want to check with your child’s doctor about their weight. Some children with the condition may need more calories. Others gain too much weight because they have problems being active, or because of side effects from medication. Extra weight is hard on the joints.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:09:07", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:10:00", "cost": 52.983}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:02", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:10:00", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:09:07"}

Here's what you need to know about mad cow disease.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【1】What Is Mad Cow Disease?\n------------------------\n\n【2】Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), is a transmissible, slowly progressive, degenerative, and fatal disease affecting the central nervous system of adult cattle. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has tested hundreds of thousands of cattle for BSE.\n\n【3】Researchers believe that the infectious agent that causes mad cow disease is an abnormal version of a protein normally found on cell surfaces, called a prion. For reasons still unknown, this protein becomes altered and destroys nervous system tissue -- the brain and spinal cord.\n\n【4】Does Cooking Food Kill the Prion That Causes Mad Cow Disease?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【5】Common methods to eliminate disease-causing organisms in food, like heat, do not affect prions. Also, prions only seem to live in nervous system tissue.\n\n【6】Does Mad Cow Disease Affect Humans?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【7】A human version of mad cow disease called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) is believed to be caused by eating beef products contaminated with central nervous system tissue, such as brain and spinal cord, from cattle infected with mad cow disease. For this reason, the USDA requires that all brain and spinal cord materials be removed from high-risk cattle -- older cattle, animals that are unable to walk, and any animal that shows any signs of a neurological problem. These cow products do not enter the U.S. food supply. The USDA believes this practice effectively safeguards U.S. public health from vCJD.\n\n【8】According to the CDC, four deaths from vCJD have been identified in the U.S. However, it's believed those cases were caused by consumption of meat outside the U.S.\n\n【9】It is important to clarify the differences between variant CJD and another form of the disease, referred to as classic or sporadic CJD. Classic CJD has no known cause and occurs each year at a rate of one to two cases per 1 million people throughout the world, including in the U.S. and countries where mad cow disease has never occurred. It is not linked to eating nerve tissue from mad cow disease-affected cattle -- both vegetarians and meat eaters have died from classic CJD. CJD most commonly affects people over 65 and is usually fatal within six months from onset of symptoms.\n\n【10】What Are the Symptoms of vCJD?\n------------------------------\n\n【11】The disease can affect all age groups and is very hard to diagnose until it has nearly run its course. In the early stages of vCJD, people have symptoms related to the nervous system, like depression and loss of coordination. Later in the illness, dementia develops. But only in advanced stages of the disease can brain abnormalities be detected by MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). vCJD is fatal, usually within 13 months of the onset of symptoms.\n\n【12】Is it Possible to Get vCJD From Eating Food Purchased in the U.S.\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【13】It is extremely unlikely that this would happen. To prevent mad cow disease from entering the country, since 1989 the federal government has prohibited the importation of certain types of live animals from countries where mad cow disease is known to exist. This ban includes meat products used in human, animal, and pet foods. In addition, prohibiting high-risk animals from entering the food supply and the removal of central nervous system tissue from the food supply help ensure that BSE is not a risk to consumers.\n\n【14】Can You Get vCJD From Drinking Milk From an Infected Cow?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【15】Milk and milk products are not believed to pose any risk for transmitting mad cow disease to humans. Experiments have shown that milk from mad cow-infected cows has not caused infections.\n\n【16】What About Other Products Made From Cow By-Products?\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n【17】The FDA stops the importation of cosmetic and dietary supplement ingredients containing bovine materials from animals originating in the 33 countries where mad cow disease has been found or from animals at risk of being infected.\n\n【18】What Is the Current Risk of vCJD to Americans Traveling Abroad?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【19】According to the CDC, the current risk of acquiring vCJD from any specific country appears to be extremely small. But that cannot be precisely determined because cattle products from one country might be distributed and consumed in others.\n\n【20】How Long Have Health Officials Been Concerned About Mad Cow Disease?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【21】Mad cow disease has been of great concern since 1986, when it was first reported among cattle in the U.K. At its peak in January 1993, almost 1,000 new cases per week were identified. Concern about this disease grew significantly in 1996 when an association between mad cow disease and vCJD in humans was discovered.\n\n【22】What Other Countries Have Reported Cases of Mad Cow Disease?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【23】The disease also has been confirmed in cattle born in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, and the U.K.\n\n【24】Canada has also been added to the list of countries from which imports are restricted, although that ban has been lifted recently.

It is an inactive vaccine, which means it is made using a dead form of the viruses the shot protects against. The dead germs cannot make you sick. Those ages 18 to 64 can opt for an intradermal flu shot. This injection uses a smaller needle and goes into the top layer of the skin instead of the muscle. The vaccines are generally safe for those with egg allergies. If you have severe allergies you should get the flu shot from a doctor who can treat a severe allergic reaction -- either at your doctor's office, a hospital, a clinic, or a health department.\n*   Fluzone high dose: This inactivated vaccine was developed for those ages 65 and older, because older people have weaker immune systems. It's preferred for this group instead of a regular flu shot when available.\n*   Egg-free vaccines: Unlike most flu vaccines, these are not grown inside eggs. They're approved for people with a severe allergy to eggs.\n*   Nasal spray: The nasal spray flu vaccine is a live attenuated vaccine, or LAIV. Unlike the flu shot, it is made from live, but weakened, influenza viruses. However, you cannot get the flu from the nasal spray vaccine. Healthy, non-pregnant people ages 2 to 49 may receive the nasal spray. \n\n【3】The three or four flu strains covered by the flu vaccine differ from year to year. That’s because the flu viruses are constantly changing. Scientists develop a new flu vaccine each season based on research that predicts which strains will be most likely to make you sick. \n\n【4】When Should Adults Be Vaccinated?\n---------------------------------\n\n【5】Flu seasons also vary, depending on where you live. Flu season can run from October to May. You should get vaccinated as soon as the vaccine becomes available. It takes about two weeks for the flu vaccine to start working, so you want to make sure you are fully protected as soon as possible. Generally, the seasonal flu vaccine is available from September until spring.\n\n【6】Which Adults Should Get a Flu Vaccine?\n--------------------------------------\n\n【7】The CDC recommends that most every adult receive a flu vaccine every year, especially those who are at high risk for developing flu-related complications and those who care for or live with such people, such as health care workers.\n\n【8】You are more likely to develop serious flu-related complications and should get a flu vaccine if you have:\n\n【9】*   Asthma (even if it's mild or controlled) or other lung disease\n*   Brain, spinal cord, or other neurological disorders such as stroke, epilepsy, intellectual disability, muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy, or spinal cord injury\n*   Diabetes and other endocrine disorders\n*   Epilepsy\n*   Kidney disease or damage\n*   Heart disease\n*   Liver disease or damage\n*   Metabolic disorders (such as inherited metabolic disorders and mitochondrial disorders)\n*   Morbidly obese (BMI of 40 or greater)\n*   Sickle cell disease and other blood disorders\n*   A weakened immune system due to certain diseases or medical treatments\n\n【10】Your risk of developing flu-related complications is also increased if you are:\n\n【11】*   Older than age 50 or younger than age 2\n*   Pregnant\n*   American Indian or Alaskan Native\n\n【12】You should also get a flu vaccine if you live in a nursing home or other long-term care facility.\n\n【13】Which Adults Should Not Get the Flu Vaccine?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【14】You should NOT get the influenza vaccine if you:\n\n【15】*   Developed Guillain\\-Barre syndrome within six weeks of receiving the flu vaccine in the past\n*   Had a severe reaction to the flu vaccine in the past\n*   Have a severe allergy to any vaccine component\n\n【16】It's long been advised that people with allergies to eggs should not get the flu shot. However, the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology says the vaccine contains such a low amount of egg protein that it's unlikely to cause an allergic reaction in those with an egg allergy. If you have a severe egg allergy (anaphylaxis), talk to your doctor before getting the flu vaccine. Also, as mentioned above, flu vaccines not made with eggs are available.\n\n【17】The nasal spray flu vaccine can only be used in healthy, younger adults who are not pregnant. In addition to the previously listed adults who should not receive the flu shot, adults should NOT get the nasal spray influenza vaccine if they:\n\n【18】*   Are pregnant\n*   Are ages 50 or older \n*   Have a weakened immune system due to disease or certain medical treatments\n*   Have a long-term health condition, such as diabetes, kidney disease, or heart or lung disease, including asthma\n*   Have a muscle or nerve condition that can cause problems with breathing or swallowing (such as epilepsy or cerebral palsy)\n*   Have a weakened immune system\n*   Have a nasal condition that could make breathing difficult\n\n【19】You should not get the nasal spray flu vaccine if you are in contact with people who have a severely weakened immune system.\n\n【20】If you are moderately to severely ill, your doctor may recommend waiting to get the shot until after you recover. The CDC says you can still get the vaccine if you have a mild illness such as a cold or low-grade fever.\n\n【21】If you have a stuffy nose, your doctor may recommend that you wait to get the nasal spray flu vaccine, or get the flu shot instead.\n\n【22】Side Effects and Risks for Adult Flu Vaccines\n---------------------------------------------\n\n【23】Like all medications, vaccines can have side effects. But the risk of harm or death from the influenza vaccine is rare.\n\n【24】The flu shot and nasal spray can cause different types of side effects.\n\n【25】Flu shot side effects may include:\n\n【26】*   Low fever\n*   Muscle aches\n*   Soreness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given\n\n【27】The nasal spray flu vaccine for adults may cause:\n\n【28】*   Cough\n*   Headache, muscle aches\n*   Runny nose, nasal congestion\n*   Sore throat\n\n【29】Although it's rare, someone may have a severe allergic reaction to an ingredient in the vaccine. Most of the time, such reactions occur within a few minutes to a few hours of receiving the vaccine. The following can be signs of a severe allergic reaction:\n\n【30】*   Breathing difficulty, including wheezing\n*   Dizziness\n*   Hoarse voice\n*   High fever\n*   Hives\n*   Pale skin\n*   Rapid heart beat\n*   Confusion\n*   Weakness\n\n【31】Seek immediate medical care if you notice any of these signs after receiving the influenza vaccine.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:58:19", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:58:47", "cost": 28.455}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:02", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:58:47", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:58:18"}

Binge eating disorder is different, though. You might have it if you regularly eat a lot of food in just a few hours -- even when you're not hungry -- to drown out emotions. Then you quickly feel shame or guilt about it.\n\n【1】The disorder is treatable. Your doctor can help you stop and, later on, get to and maintain a healthy weight. The first step is to understand why you're bingeing.\n\n【2】Overeating vs. Binge Eating\n---------------------------\n\n【3】Both may involve mindless behavior. You eat too much without thinking about why. But there are real differences.\n\n【4】General examples of overeating are:\n\n【5】*   Having more than one dessert after dinner\n*   Finishing a whole bag of popcorn while watching a movie\n\n【6】When you eat too much because of a stressful event such as a romantic breakup, it's sometimes called \"emotional eating.\"\n\n【7】Examples of binge eating are:\n\n【8】*   Sneaking a large bag of candy into your room and finishing it in secret\n*   Eating a whole cake in one sitting, and then feeling guilty\n*   Finishing three burgers, even when you’re already uncomfortably full\n\n【9】6 Reasons You Binge\n-------------------\n\n【10】Binge eating disorder can stem from many things. Some are:\n\n【11】**Genes.** Eating disorders tend to run in families. If your mother or grandmother binged, you're more likely to do it. Research shows that a number of genes that affect eating behavior may be passed down through families. Those genes can affect brain circuits that control appetite and mood.\n\n【12】A problem with your genes may increase the odds that you’ll have binge eating disorder -- but other things trigger it.\n\n【13】**Family**. Perhaps you watched your mom or dad overeat often. The habits you learned from the people around you may influence the way you eat in general. Still, eating disorder organizations say that parents and families aren't to blame.\n\n【14】**Depression**. If you’re depressed, you may be more likely to binge. About half of people with binge eating disorder have had depression. Scientists aren’t sure whether depression causes binge eating, or vice versa.\n\n【15】There are still some questions: Are people with depression more likely to binge? Or, do the guilt and shame make people depressed?\n\n【16】**Low Self-Esteem**. Often, people who binge aren't happy with the way they look. You might think badly about your body because of what others say or have said. You might compare yourself with TV and magazine photos that emphasize thinness. That might give you what's known as a negative body image. Such low self-esteem can lead to binge eating. After bingeing, a person feels guilt or shame because they ate too much. These feelings can cause more overeating.\n\n【17】**Stress and** **Anxiety**. Sometimes people binge after they've gone through a major stressful event, like a divorce or losing a job. Emotional eating can be temporary and may not be a binge eating disorder, though. That said, people with the disorder are usually more likely to overeat if they're anxious or stressed.\n\n【18】**Extreme** **Dieting**. Sometimes an attempt to lose weight can lead to bingeing. This is especially true when people follow unhealthy diets to lose weight, such as skipping meals or eating too little. If they don't reach their goal weight, they may feel so guilty and terrible about themselves that they eat even more.\n\n【19】Tips to Help Control Binges\n---------------------------\n\n【20】If you think you have binge eating disorder, work with a doctor to get well. Treatment might include counseling and, sometimes, medicine.\n\n【21】Try these tips to avoid food binges:\n\n【22】*   Keep a food diary. It will help you learn when you tend to binge. You can also see what was going on in your life that may have led you to do it.\n*   Eat regular meals and snacks throughout the day. They'll keep your blood sugar steady, so you won't feel hungry enough to binge.\n*   Portion out your food. Don't just grab a big bag of chips and head to the couch to watch TV. Measure out one serving into a small bag or onto a plate. You'll be less likely to eat too much if you have to get up for more.\n*   Think about why you're bingeing. Are you depressed or anxious?

Without treatment, it gets worse over time and eventually overpowers your immune system. Your symptoms will depend on your stage.   \n\n【2】The only way you can know for sure if you have HIV is to get tested. Although the virus can cause symptoms, they’re not a reliable way to tell if you’re infected. In fact, some people won’t have any symptoms at all. So even if you don’t have any of the typical signs of an infection, you should always get tested if you think you are at risk. \n\n【3】Some people notice flu-like symptoms 1-4 weeks after they're first infected. These often only last a week or two. This first stage is called acute or primary HIV infection. Then, you may go for 10 years or more without further symptoms. This is called asymptomatic HIV infection. Even though you feel fine, the virus is still active in your body. And you can still give it to someone else.  \n\n【4】Once HIV has seriously harmed your immune system, you're at risk for diseases that a healthy body could fight off. In this stage, symptomatic HIV infection, you start to notice problems caused by these \"opportunistic\" infections.\n\n【5】First Stage: Acute HIV Infection Symptoms\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【6】Most people don't know right away when they've been infected with HIV. But they may have symptoms within 2 to 4 weeks after they’ve gotten the virus. This is when your body's immune system puts up a fight. It's called acute retroviral syndrome or primary HIV infection.\n\n【7】The symptoms are similar to those of other viral illnesses, and they're often compared to the flu. They typically last a week or two and then go away. Early signs of HIV include:\n\n【8】*   Headache\n*   Fatigue\n*   Aching muscles\n*   Sore throat\n*   Swollen lymph nodes\n*   A red rash that doesn't itch, usually on your torso\n*   Fever\n*   Ulcers (sores) in your mouth, esophagus, anus, or genitals\n\n【9】If you have symptoms like these and might have come into contact with someone with HIV in the past 2 to 6 weeks, go to a doctor and ask that you get an HIV test. If you don’t have symptoms but still think you might have come into contact with the virus, get tested.\n\n【10】Early testing is important for two reasons. First, at this stage, levels of HIV in your blood and bodily fluids are very high. This makes it especially contagious. Second, starting treatment as soon as possible will help boost your immune system and ease your symptoms.\n\n【11】A combination of medications (called HIV drugs, antiretroviral therapy, or ART) can help fight HIV, keep your immune system healthy, and keep you from spreading the virus. If you take these medications and have healthy habits, your HIV infection probably won’t get worse.\n\n【12】Second Stage: Clinical Latency Symptoms\n---------------------------------------\n\n【13】After your immune system loses the battle with HIV, the flu-like symptoms will go away. But there’s a lot going on inside your body. Doctors call this the asymptomatic period or chronic HIV infection.\n\n【14】In your body, cells called CD4 T cells coordinate your immune system’s response. During this stage, untreated HIV will kill CD4 cells and destroy your immune system. Your doctor can check how many of these cells you have with blood tests. Without treatment, the number of CD4 cells will drop, and you’ll be more likely to get other infections.\n\n【15】Most people don't have symptoms they can see or feel. You may not realize that you're infected and can pass HIV on to others.\n\n【16】If you’re taking ART, you might stay in this phase for decades. You can pass the virus on to other people, but it’s extremely rare if you take your medicines.\n\n【17】Third Stage: AIDS Symptoms\n--------------------------\n\n【18】AIDS is the advanced stage of HIV infection. This is usually when your CD4 T-cell number drops below 200 and your immune system is badly damaged. You might get an opportunistic infection, an illness that happens more often and is worse in people who have weakened immune systems. Some of these, such as Kaposi's sarcoma (a form of skin cancer) and pneumocystis pneumonia (a lung disease), are also considered “AIDS-defining illnesses.”\n\n【19】If you didn't know earlier that you were infected with HIV, you may realize it after you have some of these symptoms:\n\n【20】*   Being tired all the time\n*   Swollen lymph nodes in your neck or groin\n*   Fever that lasts more than 10 days\n*   Night sweats\n*   Weight loss with no obvious reason\n*   Purplish spots on your skin that don't go away\n*   Shortness of breath\n*   Severe, long-lasting diarrhea\n*   Yeast infections in your mouth, throat, or vagina\n*   Bruises or bleeding you can't explain\n*   Neurological symptoms such as memory loss, confusion, balance problems, behavior changes, seizures, and vision changes\n\n【21】People with AIDS who don't take medication live about 3 years, or less if they get another infection. But HIV can still be treated at this stage. If you start on HIV drugs, stay on them, follow your doctor’s advice, and keep healthy habits, you can live a long time.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:11:37", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:12:29", "cost": 52.458}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:02", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:12:29", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:11:37"}

They help to prevent sunburn and premature aging (such as wrinkles , leathery skin ). Sunscreens also help to decrease the risk of skin cancer and also of sunburn-like skin reactions (sun sensitivity) caused by some medications (including tetracyclines, sulfa drugs, phenothiazines such as chlorpromazine ).The active ingredients in sunscreens work either by absorbing the sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation , preventing it from reaching the deeper layers of the skin , or by reflecting the radiation.Wearing sunscreen does not mean that you can stay out longer in the sun. Sunscreens cannot protect against all of the sun's radiation.There are various types of sunscreens available in many forms (such as cream, lotion, gel, stick, spray, lip balm). See the Notes section for information about selecting a sunscreen .\n\n【2】### How to use Total Block Lotion\n\n【3】Sunscreens are for use on the skin only. Follow all directions on the product package. If you have any questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist .\n\n【4】Apply sunscreen generously to all exposed skin 30 minutes before sun exposure. As a general guide, use 1 ounce (30 grams) to cover your entire body. Reapply the sunscreen after swimming or sweating or drying off with a towel or if it has rubbed off. If you are outside for long periods, reapply sunscreen every 2 hours. If you are using the lip balm form, apply to the lip area only.\n\n【5】The spray form is flammable. If using the spray, avoid smoking when applying this medication and do not use or store it near heat or open flame.\n\n【6】When applying sunscreen to the face, be careful to avoid contact with the eyes . If the sunscreen gets in your eyes , rinse thoroughly with water.\n\n【7】Use cautiously or avoid use on irritated skin .\n\n【8】Do not use sunscreen on infants younger than 6 months unless the doctor directs you to do so. It is best for infants to stay out of the sun and wear protective clothing (such as hats, long sleeves/pants) when outdoors.\n\n【9】If you develop a serious sunburn , or if you think you may have a serious medical problem, get medical help right away.\n\n【10】Side Effects\n------------\n\n【11】Some sunscreen products (such as those containing aminobenzoic acid or para-aminobenzoic acid/PABA) may stain clothing.\n\n【12】Some ingredients of sunscreens can cause the skin to become more sensitive. If a sunscreen causes redness or irritation, wash it off and stop using it. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about using another sunscreen product with different ingredients.\n\n【13】If your doctor has directed you to use this medication , remember that your doctor has judged that the benefit to you is greater than the risk of side effects. Many people using this medication do not have serious side effects.\n\n【14】A very serious allergic reaction to this drug is rare. However, get medical help right away if you notice any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction , including: rash , itching /swelling (especially of the face/ tongue /throat), severe dizziness , trouble breathing .\n\n【15】This is not a complete list of possible side effects.

UVA radiation causes skin damage, premature aging, and skin reactions to medications , soaps, cosmetics , and other chemicals. UVB radiation causes sunburn . Both UVA and UVB radiation increase your risk of skin cancer . Most sunscreens protect against UVB radiation, but you should use a sunscreen with both UVA and UVB protection (broad-spectrum coverage). Products that protect against UVA include ingredients such as avobenzone, octocrylene, titanium dioxide , zinc oxide, and benzophenones such as oxybenzone. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about selecting a product.\n\n【29】Sun Protection Factor (SPF) is a rating that tells how much protection a product provides against sunburn. The higher the number, the greater the protection. An SPF of at least 15 is recommended. Products with SPF 30 provide high protection against sunburn. The FDA states that products with SPF above 30 provide a benefit that is not much greater than SPF 30 products.\n\n【30】Water-resistant products provide protection for up to 40 minutes of water activity or sweating . Very water-resistant products protect for up to 80 minutes. Reapply sunscreen as often as necessary.\n\n【31】Remember that water, sand, and snow reflect the sun.

Opicapone belongs to a class of drugs known as COMT inhibitors. Many people taking levodopa for Parkinson's disease have problems with the effects of levodopa wearing off between scheduled doses, which causes symptoms to return or get worse. Opicapone blocks a certain natural substance (COMT) that breaks down levodopa in the body. This effect helps levodopa to work better and for a longer time.\n\n【2】### How to use Ongentys 50 Mg Capsule Antiparkinsonian COMT Inhibitors\n\n【3】Take this medication by mouth on an empty stomach as directed by your doctor, usually once daily at bedtime .

Many people using this medication do not have serious side effects.\n\n【10】Some people taking this medication along with levodopa/ carbidopa have fallen asleep suddenly during their usual daily activities (such as talking, eating, driving). In some cases, sleep occurred without any feelings of drowsiness beforehand. This sleep effect may occur anytime during treatment with opicapone and levodopa/carbidopa even if you have used these medications for a long time. If you experience increased sleepiness or fall asleep during the day, do not drive or do other possibly dangerous activities until you have discussed this effect with your doctor. Your risk of this sleep effect is increased by using alcohol or other medications that can make you drowsy.

This allows the bones to rub and grind on each other.\n\n【1】Age, injury, and repeated motion can play a part in osteoarthritis, but the most common cause is the normal wear and tear of living, especially after age 50. It can happen to any joint, but it’s most common in your hands, knees, hips, and spine.\n\n【2】Osteoarthritis is a chronic condition. There’s no cure for OA. Once cartilage breaks down, it doesn’t grow back in its own. Over time, you can develop other problems, or complications, from living with OA.\n\n【3】Pain and Stiffness\n------------------\n\n【4】The main complication with OA is pain and stiffness in your joints that worsens over time. It’s typically most uncomfortable when you wake up in the morning. You might not be able to move your joints as freely as you could in the past, and you may notice a scraping or crunching feeling when you do. Doctors call this crepitus.\n\n【5】Mobility and Physical Challenges\n--------------------------------\n\n【6】Over time, osteoarthritis makes your joints more stiff, weak, and painful. As a result, you might not be able to do what you did in the past. Just getting around could get a lot harder. You also might find it more difficult to:\n\n【7】*   Grasp household items\n*   Bend down\n*   Climb up and down stairs\n\n【8】OA can make you more likely to fall and hurt yourself in the course of your daily life. Your doctor can help you come up with a plan to lessen the effect of your symptoms and the risk of falls.\n\n【9】Other Health Conditions\n-----------------------\n\n【10】Lack of movement also typically means less exercise, which raises your risk for weight gain, high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and high cholesterol.\n\n【11】Your medical team should be able to help you manage these conditions with medication and changes in diet and exercise habits.\n\n【12】Sleep Problems\n--------------\n\n【13】OA pain often makes it tough to sleep. You might wake during the night from the pain or find it harder to fall asleep in the first place.\n\n【14】And the lack of sleep can make your pain seem worse. This raises your risk for depression and may worsen OA symptoms that limit how well you get around.\n\n【15】In addition to treatment for your OA, there are a number of things you could do:\n\n【16】*   Try to go to bed, and wake up, at same time each day.\n*   Get sunlight in the morning to keep your sleep cycle on track.\n*   Avoid caffeine or alcohol in late afternoon and evening.\n*   Keep your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet.\n*   Maintain a soothing pre-bedtime routine: hot bath, reading, light stretching.\n*   Avoid loud activities or difficult discussions close to bedtime.\n*   Exercise earlier in the day.\n*   Avoid heavy, fatty foods late at night.\n\n【17】Talk to your doctor about any medications you take that might keep you from getting good sleep.\n\n【18】Joint Damage\n------------\n\n【19】Possible problems include:\n\n【20】*   Pinched nerve in the spine (acquired spondylolisthesis or spinal stenosis)\n*   Infected joint, but this is rare\n*   Thinning or tearing of the tendons and ligaments around the joint, which can make the joint unstable\n*   Chondrolysis, a sudden, complete breakdown of cartilage that leaves loose tissue in the joint\n*   Stress fracture, a hairline crack in the bone that happens slowly due to repeated stress\n*   Baker’s cysts, soft fluid-filled lumps behind the knee. They're mostly painless, but they can press on blood vessels and cause leg swelling, or burst and cause pain.\n\n【21】Treatment for Osteoarthritis Complications\n------------------------------------------\n\n【22】Your doctor can help you treat and manage these OA complications, but the nature of that treatment depends on which you have.\n\n【23】The first step is to manage your OA symptoms with medicines, heat, ice, physical therapy, shots, and joint-supporting devices like braces. Your doctor might also suggest surgery in serious cases or as a last resort.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:44:16", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:44:26", "cost": 10.45}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:02", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:44:27", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:44:16"}

Treatment depends on how bad the condition is.\n\n【2】What Causes Acne?\n-----------------\n\n【3】No one factor causes acne. Acne happens when oil (sebaceous) glands become active at puberty, stimulated by male hormones from the adrenal glands in both boys and girls. Oil is a natural substance that lubricates and protects the skin. Under certain circumstances, cells that are close to the surface block the openings of sebaceous glands and cause a buildup of oil underneath. This oil stimulates bacteria, which live in everyone's skin. The bacteria generally cause no problems, but when stimulated, they multiply. That causes surrounding tissues to become inflamed.\n\n【4】If the inflammation is near the surface, you get a pustule; if it's deeper, a papule (pimple); deeper still, and it's a cyst. If the oil breaks through to the surface, the result is a \"whitehead.\" If the oil becomes oxidized (that is, acted on by oxygen in the air), the oil changes from white to black, and the result is a \"blackhead.\" Common sites for acne are the face, chest, shoulders, neck, and back -- where oil glands are.\n\n【5】Other things that may -- or may not -- cause acne include:\n\n【6】*   **Heredity:** With the exception of very severe acne, most people do not have the problem exactly as their parents did. Almost everyone has some acne at some point in life.\n*   **Food:** All over the world, parents tell teens to avoid pizza, chocolate, greasy and fried foods, and junk food. While these foods may not be good for overall health, they don't cause acne or make it worse. Studies show dairy products and high glycemic foods, however, can trigger acne.\n*   **Dirt:** Some individuals have more oily skin than others (as mentioned above, blackheads are oxidized oil, not dirt). Sweat does not cause acne. There is, though, an increased buildup of bacteria after exercise, so it is advisable to shower. On the other hand, excessive washing can dry and irritate the skin.\n*   **Hormones:** Most women break out cyclically. Some oral contraceptive pills help relieve acne, but some may make acne worse. Ask your doctor which is best for you.\n*   **Cosmetics:** Most cosmetic and skin care products are not pore-clogging (comedogenic.) Those listed as “water-based” or “oil-free” (noncomedogenic) are better choices.\n\n【7】Sometimes, contributing factors may be:\n\n【8】*   **Pressure:** In some people, pressure from helmets, cell phones, chinstraps, collars, and the like can aggravate acne.\n*   **Drugs:** Some medications may cause or worsen acne, such as those containing iodides, bromides, or oral or injected steroids (either the medically prescribed prednisone or the steroids bodybuilders or athletes take). Most cases of acne, however, are not drug-related.\n*   **Occupations:** In some jobs, exposure to industrial products like cutting oils (which is used with industrial cutting and drilling equipment) may produce acne.\n\n【9】How Is Acne Treated?\n--------------------\n\n【10】Four types of drugs have proven to be effective for the treatment of acne: antibiotics, benzoyl peroxide, retinoids, and some hormones. Most people need at least one or two, depending on how bad their acne is.\n\n【11】*   **Benzoyl peroxide** -- available as an over-the-counter product (for example, Clearasil, Stridex) and by prescription (for example, Benoxyl, PanOxyl, Persa gel) -- targets surface bacteria, which often aggravate acne. Irritation (dryness) is a common side effect.\n*   **Retinoids** (vitamin A derivatives), like Differin, Retin-A, and Tazorac, treat blackheads and whiteheads, the first lesions of acne, as well as inflammatory papules and pustules. Trifarotene (Aklief) can be used to treat severe acne called acne vulgaris. With all retinoids, the most common side effects are dryness, irritation, and an increased risk of sunburn. While most are prescription only, there is an over-the-counter version of Differin now available.\n*   **Antibiotics,** either topically applied to the skin (clindamycin, erythromycin), or taken orally (tetracycline and its derivatives, trimethoprim\\-sulfamethoxazole) control surface bacteria and reduce inflammation in the skin. Antibiotics are more effective when combined with benzoyl peroxide or retinoids. The oral retinoid isotretinoin (Absorica, Amnesteem, Claravis, Myorisan, and Zenatane) is reserved for people with severe (nodular or cystic) or widespread acne. Isotretinoin shrinks the size of oil glands, the origin of acne. Without active, plump oil glands, acne actively diminishes. Side effects can include dry skin, elevated cholesterol and triglycerides, and birth defects. Women of childbearing age must practice birth control before, during, and after treatment (about one month) with isotretinoin. The use of isotretinoin requires rigorous testing (cholesterol, pregnancy, triglyceride, cholesterol, liver function and bone marrow function) and follow-up for the prescribed period (5 or more months). It is reserved for the most severe or widespread types of acne that do not respond to other treatments.\n*   **Hormone therapy** may be helpful for some women with acne, especially for those with signs and symptoms (irregular periods, thinning hair) of androgen (male hormone) excess. The hormone therapy consists of low-dose estrogen and progesterone (birth control pills) or antiandrogen medications such as aldactone (Spironolactone) -- oral, or clascoterone (Winlevi) -- topical. Winlevi can be used in both males and females as it is a local skin androgen blocker.\n\n【12】Can Acne Be Prevented?\n----------------------\n\n【13】To prevent acne and reduce damage to your skin, follow these tips:\n\n【14】*   Choose a cleanser specially formulated for acne. These products often have salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide, which help to clear acne sores.\n*   Clean your face gently. Vigorous rubbing and scrubbing can cause trauma to the breakout area. That may worsen the acne or cause scarring. When washing your face, use your hands or cotton pads. Terry cloth or stiff sponge material (like a loofah) may cause acne sores to rupture.\n*   If you need to use a moisturizer, use only light, noncomedogenic moisturizers, which don’t aggravate acne.\n*   If you use makeup, make sure it’s an oil-free foundation. Heavy makeup or other cosmetic products that block pores may cause an acne flare-up.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:38:45", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:38:57", "cost": 12.513}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:02", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:38:58", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:38:45"}

Your doctor could find it during a regular physical. Or you might make an appointment after you notice signs like a fluttering heartbeat or fatigue.\n\n【1】If your doctor thinks you have it, the first thing they’ll do is listen to your heart. They may be able to hear your irregular heartbeat with a stethoscope. If not, they may ask for tests to confirm the diagnosis, find out what's causing it, and figure out the best way to treat it.\n\n【2】Sometimes your primary care or family doctor is the one who diagnoses AFib. But your doctor may refer you to a:\n\n【3】*   Cardiologist, a doctor who specializes in heart diseases and conditions\n*   Electrophysiologist, a doctor who specializes in arrhythmias\n\n【4】Doctor Exam\n-----------\n\n【5】When you make an appointment with your doctor or the specialist to see if you might have atrial fibrillation, ask if you need to do anything to prepare. You may need to follow a special diet before blood tests, for example.\n\n【6】To make the most of your time with the doctor, be ready to describe your symptoms and when they happen. Make a list of medications you take, including supplements and over-the-counter medicines. And be prepared with information about your health history and that of close family members.\n\n【7】Take note of any questions you have for your doctor, such as:\n\n【8】*   What could be causing my symptoms?\n*   What kind of tests will I need?\n*   What are the recommended treatments for my condition? Are there any effective alternatives?\n*   Do I need to make changes to my lifestyle?\n\n【9】During your exam, the doctor will ask detailed questions about your:\n\n【10】*   Symptoms\n*   Health habits\n*   Health problems\n*   Family medical history\n\n【11】During the physical exam, they are likely to:\n\n【12】*   Listen to your heartbeat's rate and rhythm\n*   Take your pulse and blood pressure\n*   Listen to your lungs\n\n【13】Does AFib Show Up on an Electrocardiogram (EKG)?\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【14】Yes. This simple, painless test is the most helpful to diagnose AFib. It records your heart's electrical activity. It can show the:\n\n【15】*   Speed of your heartbeat\n*   Rhythm of your heartbeat\n*   Strength and timing of electrical signals passing through your heart\n\n【16】A doctor or technician places small patches, called electrodes, on different areas of your body, including several on your chest. These pick-up signals that make wave patterns on the EKG results. It gives your doctor a picture of your heart's overall electrical activity.\n\n【17】But because the test is a quick snapshot, a standard EKG won't always catch AFib. Sometimes you'll need a portable heart rhythm monitor to keep tabs on your ticker over a longer time.\n\n【18】Holter Monitor\n--------------\n\n【19】You keep this device with you for 24 to 48 hours while it continuously records your heart's electrical activity. The extra time gives a better chance of picking up an abnormal heart rhythm, what doctors call an arrhythmia.\n\n【20】Just as with a regular EKG, you'll have small electrodes attached to your chest. Wires connect these electrodes to a small recorder you can clip onto a belt, keep in a pocket, or hang around your neck.\n\n【21】Then you just go about doing what you usually do. Your doctor will check the recorded results later.\n\n【22】Event Monitor\n-------------\n\n【23】This works like a Holter monitor, but it records your heart's activity only at certain times, usually for a 30-day period. It might automatically start recording when it senses something is off. Or you might have to push a button when you feel:\n\n【24】*   Dizzy\n*   Weak\n*   Lightheaded\n*   A racing or fluttering heart\n\n【25】You may need to wear it for a month or so -- as long as it takes to catch and record the trouble.\n\n【26】Mobile Cardiac Telemetry (MCT)\n------------------------------\n\n【27】You might hear this called mobile cardiac monitoring. You wear this small device 24/7, and it monitors your heart as you go about your daily life. Most send a Bluetooth signal to a data center, which analyzes the info and gives your doctor a report.\n\n【28】Stress Test\n-----------\n\n【29】It's just what it sounds like: A test that puts extra stress on your heart to see how it responds to working hard and beating fast. You'll be hooked up to an EKG during the test, and the technician will watch your heart rate and blood pressure, too.\n\n【30】Exercise is an easy way to get your heart pumping. You might ride a stationary bicycle, or walk or run on a treadmill. That's why this is sometimes called a treadmill test.\n\n【31】If your body can't handle intense activity, you can take a special medicine that makes your heart beat faster instead.\n\n【32】Echocardiogram\n--------------\n\n【33】This test uses sound waves and a computer to create a moving picture of your heart. An echo gives your doctor information about:\n\n【34】*   The size and shape of your heart\n*   How well the heart muscle and valves are working\n*   Where the heart muscle isn't contracting the right way\n\n【35】**Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE).** This imaging test gives your doctor a picture of your heart. The doctor uses a device called an ultrasound transducer to give off and read sound waves that bounce off the walls and valves in your heart. A computer uses the data to create a video of your heart. Your doctor can see the size of your heart, how well it’s working, how well your heart valves are working, and if you have any blood clots.\n\n【36】**Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE).** This imaging test gives the doctor a picture of your heart. They’ll place a probe down your esophagus (the tube that connects your mouth to your stomach). It goes right behind your heart. Once the probe is in place, it works the same way as a TTE.\n\n【37】Blood Tests\n-----------\n\n【38】These can point your doctor to what might be causing your AFib. Blood tests may check for infection, thyroid and kidney problems, signs of a heart attack, and more.\n\n【39】Portable Electrocardiogram\n--------------------------\n\n【40】You might hear this called a handheld EKG. Or it could look like a wristwatch. It has electrodes on the back that take your pulse at your chest or your wrist. You can get one from a discount store, drugstore, or online. The doctor may suggest you do it so you can take a quick reading when you feel something. It’ll store your EKG data in its memory for your doctor to read.\n\n【41】Fitness Trackers\n----------------\n\n【42】Popular smartwatches outfitted with special sensors called photoplethysmographic sensors (or PPGs) can detect AFib.\n\n【43】Electrophysiology Study\n-----------------------\n\n【44】An electrophysiology study (EPS) can help your doctor understand what's causing your abnormal heartbeat and figure out the best way to treat it.\n\n【45】In this operation, your cardiologist inserts a thin, flexible electrode into a blood vessel leading to your heart, usually in your neck or groin. They then use an imaging system to guide the electrode to your heart. Once there, the electrode can measure your heart's electrical signals.\n\n【46】Your doctor will give you a numbing medication before the surgery to keep you from feeling pain. You might also get a sedative to help relax you. The procedure may take 1-4 hours, and you'll rest in a recovery room for 4-6 hours after that.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:52:17", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:53:48", "cost": 90.553}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:02", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:53:47", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:52:17"}

It’s also known as celiac sprue, nontropical sprue, or gluten-sensitive enteropathy.\n\n【2】Gluten is a protein in wheat, barley, rye, and other grains. It’s what makes dough elastic and gives bread its chewy texture.\n\n【3】When someone with celiac disease eats something with gluten, their body overreacts to the protein and damages their villi, small finger-like projections found along the wall of their small intestine.\n\n【4】When your villi are injured, your small intestine can’t properly absorb nutrients from food. Eventually, this can lead to malnourishment, as well as loss of bone density, miscarriage, infertility or even neurological diseases or certain cancers.\n\n【5】If your celiac disease isn’t better after at least a year without gluten, it’s called refractory or nonresponsive celiac disease.\n\n【6】Most people with celiac disease never know that they have it. Researchers think that as few as 20% of people with the disease get the right diagnosis. The damage to your intestine is very slow, and symptoms are so varied that it can take years to get a diagnosis.\n\n【7】Celiac disease isn’t the same thing as gluten intolerance or gluten sensitivity. People with gluten intolerance may have some of the same symptoms and may want to avoid gluten. But they don’t show an immune response or damage to the small intestine.\n\n【8】Celiac Disease Symptoms\n-----------------------\n\n【9】Celiac disease isn’t the same thing as a food allergy, so the symptoms are different.\n\n【10】If you’re allergic to wheat but eat something with wheat in it, you may have itchy or watery eyes or a hard time breathing.\n\n【11】**Celiac disease symptoms** **in adults**\n\n【12】If you have celiac disease and accidentally eat something with gluten in it, you may have symptoms including:\n\n【13】*   Abdominal pain\n*   Anemia\n*   Bloating or a feeling of fullness\n*   Bone or joint pain\n*   Constipation\n*   Diarrhea\n*   Gas\n*   Heartburn\n*   Itchy, blistery rash (doctors call this dermatitis herpetiformis)\n*   Headaches or fatigue\n*   Mouth ulcers\n*   Nausea\n*   Nervous system injury, including numb or tingling hands or feet, balance problems, or changes in awareness\n*   Poop that’s pale, smells especially bad, or floats (steatorrhea)\n*   Weight loss\n\n【14】Celiac disease can also cause a loss of bone density and reduced spleen function (hyposplenism).\n\n【15】**Celiac disease symptoms in children**\n\n【16】Children with celiac disease are more likely to have intestinal problems, including:\n\n【17】*   Bloating or belly swelling\n*   Constipation\n*   Diarrhea\n*   Pale, foul-smelling poop\n*   Upset stomach or vomiting\n*   Weight loss\n\n【18】If celiac disease keeps a child’s body from absorbing the nutrients they need, they can have problems including:\n\n【19】*   Anemia\n*   Damaged tooth enamel\n*   Delayed puberty\n*   Failure to thrive, in infants\n*   Crankiness or mood changes\n*   Neurological problems like learning disabilities and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\n*   Slow growth and short height\n\n【20】Not everyone with celiac disease will have these symptoms. Some people don’t notice any problems, which can make diagnosis difficult.\n\n【21】**Celiac rash (dermatitis herpetiformis)**\n\n【22】About 1 in 4 people with celiac disease get an itchy, blistering rash. It happens more in adults than children, and more in men than women. It’s most common in these areas:\n\n【23】*   Buttocks\n*   Elbows\n*   Knees\n*   Scalp\n*   Lower back\n\n【24】Celiac Disease Causes and Risk Factors\n--------------------------------------\n\n【25】Research hasn’t found a definite cause of celiac disease. It tends to run in families and might be linked to certain genes. Stressful medical events such as a viral infection or surgery can trigger it. So can emotional trauma or pregnancy.\n\n【26】If one of your close family members has it, like a parent or sibling, you have a 1 in 10 chance of getting celiac disease.\n\n【27】The disease is most common among Caucasians and people who have other diseases, including:\n\n【28】*   Hashimoto’s thyroiditis\n*   Type 1 diabetes\n*   Addison’s disease\n*   Down syndrome\n*   Rheumatoid arthritis\n*   Turner syndrome (a condition in which a female is missing an X chromosome)\n*   Multiple sclerosis (MS)\n*   Autoimmune hepatitis\n*   Sjogren’s syndrome\n*   Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy\n*   IgA nephropathy\n*   Lupus\n*   Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)\n*   Chronic pancreatitis\n*   Psoriasis\n*   Scleroderma\n*   Williams syndrome\n*   Primary biliary cirrhosis\n*   Lactose intolerance\n*   Intestinal lymphoma\n*   Intestinal cancer\n\n【29】Celiac Disease Complications\n----------------------------\n\n【30】Celiac disease can be dangerous if you don’t get treatment. Complications may include:\n\n【31】*   Cancer, including intestinal lymphoma and small bowel cancer\n*   Damaged tooth enamel\n*   Infertility and miscarriage\n*   Lactose intolerance\n*   Malnutrition\n*   Nervous system problems like seizures or pain and numbness in your hands and feet (peripheral neuropathy)\n*   Pancreatic disease\n*   Weak bones\n\n【32】Celiac Disease Tests and Diagnosis\n----------------------------------\n\n【33】Doctors use blood tests and other tests to help find out if you have celiac disease:\n\n【34】*   Serology tests look for certain antibodies.\n*   Blood tests check other parts of your immune system.\n*   Intestinal fatty acid binding protein tests show if there’s damage to the intestine.\n*   A complete blood count looks for anemia (low red blood cells).\n*   C-reactive protein tests show if there’s inflammation.\n*   Metabolic panels test liver and kidney function.\n*   Vitamin D, B12, and folate tests look for vitamin deficiencies.\n*   Iron and ferritin tests look for iron deficiency.\n*   Swallowing a small camera can show problems in your digestive tract.\n*   Imaging tests show signs in the intestine, like wall thickening or changes to blood vessels.\n*   Genetic testing looks for human leukocyte antigens to rule out celiac disease.\n\n【35】If you're on a gluten-free diet, you'll need to come off it before having the antibody test so the results will be correct.\n\n【36】If blood and other tests show that you might have celiac disease, you’ll probably need to have an endoscopy. This procedure lets your doctor look at your small intestine and take a bit of tissue to see whether it’s damaged.\n\n【37】If you have a rash, doctors will take a small sample of your skin to look for signs it’s caused by celiac disease. This rash is easy to confuse with other skin problems.\n\n【38】Celiac Disease Treatment and Diet\n---------------------------------\n\n【39】No drugs treat celiac disease. The best thing you can do is change your diet.\n\n【40】Unless they’re labeled as gluten-free, don’t eat foods that are typically made with grains, including:\n\n【41】*   Beer\n*   Bread, cake, and other baked goods\n*   Cereals\n*   Pasta or noodles\n*   Crackers\n*   Breading\n*   Pancakes\n*   Sauces and gravies\n\n【42】These grains always have gluten:\n\n【43】*   Wheat\n*   Wheatberries\n*   Durum\n*   Semolina\n*   Spelt\n*   Farina\n*   Farro\n*   Graham\n*   Einkorn wheat\n*   Rye\n*   Barley\n*   Malt\n*   Brewer’s yeast\n*   Wheat starch\n\n【44】People with celiac disease need to check labels carefully. Many processed foods sometimes have gluten:\n\n【45】*   Granola or energy bars\n*   French fries\n*   Potato chips\n*   Lunch meats\n*   Candy or candy bars\n*   Soup\n*   Salad dressings and marinades\n*   Meat substitutes such as seitan or veggie burgers\n*   Soy sauce\n\n【46】These foods are always gluten-free:\n\n【47】*   Fruits\n*   Vegetables\n*   Meat and poultry\n*   Fish and other seafood\n*   Dairy\n*   Beans and nuts\n\n【48】Gluten-free starches and grains include:\n\n【49】*   Rice\n*   Corn or maize\n*   Soy\n*   Potato\n*   Tapioca\n*   Beans\n*   Sorghum\n*   Quinoa\n*   Millet\n*   Amaranth\n*   Flax\n*   Chia\n*   Nut flours\n\n【50】Common products like medications and toothpastes can also contain gluten, so it’s important to check the label.\n\n【51】If you have a serious lack of nutrients, your doctor may have you take gluten-free vitamins and mineral supplements and will give you medication if you have a skin rash.\n\n【52】After you’ve been on a gluten-free diet for a few weeks, your small intestine should begin to heal, and you’ll start to feel better.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:07:26", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:08:15", "cost": 48.935}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:01", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:08:16", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:07:26"}

It is similar to a natural chemical in the body (prostaglandin) and works by regulating the flow of fluid within the eye which results in lower pressure. Lowering high pressure inside the eye helps to prevent blindness.\n\n【2】### How to use Xalatan Drops\n\n【3】Apply this medication in the affected eye (s) as directed by your doctor, usually once daily in the evening. Do not use latanoprost more often because it will not work as well.\n\n【4】To apply eye drops, wash your hands first. To avoid contamination, do not touch the dropper tip or let it touch your eye or any other surface.\n\n【5】If you are wearing contact lenses , remove them before using this medication. Wait at least 15 minutes before replacing your contact lenses .\n\n【6】Tilt your head back, look upward, and pull down the lower eyelid to make a pouch. Hold the dropper directly over your eye and place one drop into the pouch. Look downward, gently close your eyes , and place one finger at the corner of your eye (near the nose). Apply gentle pressure for 1 to 2 minutes before opening your eyes . This will prevent the medication from draining out. Try not to blink or rub your eye. Repeat these steps if your dose is for more than one drop. If directed to use this medication in both eyes , repeat these steps for your other eye. Do not rinse the dropper. Replace the dropper cap after each use.\n\n【7】Use this medication regularly in order to get the most benefit from it. Remember to use it at the same time each day. Keep using latanoprost even if you feel well. Most people with glaucoma or high pressure in the eye do not feel sick.\n\n【8】If you are using another kind of eye medication (such as drops or ointments), wait at least 5 minutes before applying other products.

If you are using latanoprost in only one eye, only that iris may change color. This color change may be permanent but the long-term effects are uncertain. Notify your doctor if this occurs and schedule regular eye exams to monitor it.\n\n【12】Remember that this medication has been prescribed because your doctor has judged that the benefit to you is greater than the risk of side effects. Many people using this medication do not have serious side effects.\n\n【13】Tell your doctor right away if you have any serious side effects, including: eye pain , suspected eye infection (unusual redness or swelling of eyes ), rapid vision changes (such as loss of vision).\n\n【14】A very serious allergic reaction to this drug is rare.

These are under your tongue and on each side of your jaw below the jawbone. But it also can occur in other parts of your mouth and throat or other areas of your body, such as your sweat glands or tear glands.\n\n【1】Of the 1.9 million people who get cancer each year in the U.S. about 1,300 of them have adenoid cystic carcinoma. It affects more women than men, and it can happen at any age typically between your teens and your 80s.\n\n【2】It tends to grow slowly, so it sometimes can spread to other parts of your body before you notice any symptoms. It can come back in places where it's been treated before or spread to your lungs, liver, or bones, where it's more serious.\n\n【3】Doctors don't know what causes adenoid cystic carcinoma. It may be linked to some carcinogens, like pollution or asbestos.\n\n【4】Symptoms\n--------\n\n【5】The first sign may be a lump inside your mouth under your tongue or inside your cheek. These lumps usually grow slowly and don't hurt. You might have some trouble swallowing, or your voice might sound hoarse.\n\n【6】This type of cancer can spread along nerves, so you might have some pain or numbness in your face. If you notice any of these symptoms, see your doctor.\n\n【7】Diagnosis\n---------\n\n【8】If your doctor thinks you might have adenoid cystic carcinoma, the first step is often a biopsy. They'll take a small sample of the tumor, either after making a small cut or with a needle. A pathologist, a doctor who specializes in the study of diseases, will study the sample to look for signs of cancer.\n\n【9】These kinds of tumors can take different forms. They can be solid or round and hollow like a tube, or cribriform, which means they have holes in them like Swiss cheese. The solid tumors usually grow faster.\n\n【10】Your doctor might want to find out the size and location of a tumor or look for signs the cancer has spread. You might have one of these tests:\n\n【11】*   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): Powerful magnets and radio waves are used to make detailed images.\n*   CT scan (computerized tomography): Several X-rays taken from different angles are put together to show more information.\n*   PET scan (positron emission tomography): Radiation is used to make 3-dimensional color images.\n\n【12】Treatment\n---------\n\n【13】The usual treatment for adenoid cystic carcinoma is surgery followed by radiation treatments.\n\n【14】When you have surgery, your doctor will remove not only the tumor but also some of the healthy tissue around it. They'll look at that tissue to make sure the cancer hasn't spread beyond the tumor.\n\n【15】Unlike many other cancers, which can go to other parts of your body through your lymph nodes, adenoid cystic carcinoma spreads along your nerves. Your doctor will look at your nerves to make sure the cancer isn't in the area around them and will try to remove any cancerous tissue without damaging them.\n\n【16】Sometimes, part of a nerve may have to be removed to get all the cancer out. That can mean you won't be able to move part of your face or it might droop. Your doctor may try to reconnect the damaged nerve with part of another nerve so you can move the affected area.\n\n【17】Other times, part of your windpipe or voice box has to be removed.\n\n【18】If your doctor can't take out the entire tumor without hurting important organs, or if they're worried the cancer has spread somewhere they haven't seen, you may have radiation treatments. There are three main kinds:\n\n【19】*   External beam radiation focuses high-energy X-rays or protons on cancer cells to destroy them. Your doctor will try to do as little damage as possible to the surrounding parts of your body.\n*   Internal radiation therapy is also known as brachytherapy. Your doctor will put small radioactive \"seeds\" at or near the tumor. This is often used when cancer has spread to the lungs. The radioactivity of the seeds lessens after a few weeks.\n*   Neutron therapy can target small tumors by heating up the cells with 100 times more energy than regular radiation treatment. That often kills cancer cells while letting the normal cells around them recover.\n\n【20】Radiation therapy focused on your head and neck has side effects that can include dry mouth, difficulty swallowing, or soreness around the area that's being treated. It can also damage your teeth. Check with your doctor about these side effects and ask what they can do to help you with them.\n\n【21】What to Expect\n--------------\n\n【22】It can be hard to get rid of the cancer entirely. Tumors may come back years later, either in the same place or, more likely, somewhere else -- usually in your lungs. Almost 90% of people who have adenoid cystic carcinoma live at least 5 years after their diagnosis.\n\n【23】After your treatment, you'll need regular checkups to look for signs of new tumors. This can involve X-rays, CT scans, or MRIs, depending on your diagnosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 10:56:08", "endTime": "2024/08/21 10:56:57", "cost": 48.77}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:01", "update_time": "2024-08-20 18:56:56", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 18:56:06"}

That starts by knowing what causes you to cough, wheeze, and grasp for breath. While there’s no cure, there are steps you can take to keep your asthma in control and prevent an attack.\n\n【1】1\\. Identify Asthma Triggers\n----------------------------\n\n【2】Certain asthma triggers can set off a cascade of asthma symptoms. These include:\n\n【3】*   Air pollution\n*   Allergies\n*   Cold air\n*   A cold or flu virus\n*   Exercise\n*   Sinusitis\n*   Smoke\n*   Fragrances \n*   Pets\n*   Dust mites\n*   Pests, such as cockroaches\n\n【4】It’s vital to learn to identify your asthma triggers and take steps to avoid them.\n\n【5】Keep track of your symptoms in an asthma diary for several weeks. Detail all the environmental and emotional things that affect your asthma. When you have an asthma attack, check the diary to see which thing, or combination of things, might have led to it. Some common asthma triggers, like molds and cockroaches, aren’t always obvious. Ask your asthma specialist about tests to find the allergens you respond to. Then take steps to avoid them.\n\n【6】If you have exercise-induced asthma, are planning a heavy workout, or plan to exercise in cold, humid, or dry air, take steps to prevent an asthma attack. Follow your doctor's advice on asthma treatment (usually by using an asthma inhaler containing the drug albuterol before you exercise). \n\n【7】Regular physical activity is crucial for your overall health, including your lungs. One recent study found that people with asthma who exercised for 30 minutes a day were two and a half times more likely to have control over their symptoms, compared with those who didn't exercise at all.\n\n【8】If intense running or training is too tough for you, try activities like hiking, biking, and yoga. Swimming can be a great sport for people with asthma, since the warm, moist air around most pools usually doesn’t trigger symptoms.\n\n【9】Kids with asthma need to exercise and play sports, too. Just be sure your child takes their medicine as prescribed and has a quick-relief inhaler nearby at all times.\n\n【10】While food and drinks are not common asthma triggers, some – like beer, wine, potatoes, dried fruit, and shrimp – may contain compounds called sulfites that can make asthma worse for some people. So can some medicines, like aspirin and other pain relievers, or prescription drugs, such as some common high blood pressure meds (beta-blockers or ACE inhibitors). If you take these drugs and think they're affecting your asthma, ask your doctor if there are other options you can try.\n\n【11】2\\. Stay Away From Allergens\n----------------------------\n\n【12】If you have allergies and asthma, it’s important to keep your distance from allergens (things you’re allergic to). Allergen exposure can increase the inflammation in your airways for a while, making an attack more likely.\n\n【13】3\\. Avoid Smoke of Any Type\n---------------------------\n\n【14】Smoke and asthma are a bad mix. Limit exposure to all sources of smoke, including tobacco, incense, candles, fires, and fireworks. Don’t allow smoking in your home or car, and avoid public places that permit it. If you smoke cigarettes, get help to quit. Smoking always makes asthma worse.\n\n【15】4\\. Prevent Colds\n-----------------\n\n【16】Do what you can to stay well. Avoid close contact with people who have a cold or the flu, because catching it will make your asthma symptoms worse. Wash your hands well if you handle items that someone with a respiratory infection may have touched.\n\n【17】5\\. Allergy-Proof Your Home\n---------------------------\n\n【18】Whether you’re at home, work, or traveling, there are things you can do to allergy\\-proof your environment and lower your chances of an asthma attack: \n\n【19】**Wash your pillow every week in hot water – at least 130 F – to kill mites.** You can also use cold or warm water with bleach. Wash sheets and blankets every week, too, as well as any stuffed toys your child sleeps with. Use a dehumidifier or an air conditioner to keep the humidity in your home between 30% and 50%, and remove carpet from the bedroom.\n\n【20】**Regular vacuuming can help keep dust mites at bay.** But if you have asthma, you may want to ask someone else to do it for you. A vacuum stirs up small particles that can irritate your lungs. So, if possible, stay away while it's happening and for a short time afterward. \n\n【21】**Control pests in your home.** They're often where food is. Try these tips to get rid of them:\n\n【22】*   Remove as many water and food sources as you can.\n*   Clean dishes, crumbs, and spills right away.\n*   Store food in airtight containers.\n*   Keep trash in a closed container.\n*   Vacuum or sweep areas that might attract cockroaches or mice every 2-3 days.\n*   Clean and get rid of clutter on counters, sinks, tables, and floors.\n*   Seal cracks or openings in cabinets, walls, baseboards, and around plumbing.\n*   Use pesticide baits and traps, but keep them away from children \n*   Avoid using sprays and foggers, as these can trigger asthma attacks.\n\n【23】**Reserve a smoke-free hotel room.** If you can, bring your own bedding and pillows in case the hotel only supplies feather pillows and down comforters. They can house dust mites and cause asthma symptoms.\n\n【24】Don’t eat in restaurants that are smoky or allow cigarette smoking. \n\n【25】6\\. Get Your Vaccinations\n-------------------------\n\n【26】Get a flu shot every year to protect against the flu virus, which can worsen your asthma for days or weeks. Asthma makes you more likely to have complications from the flu, like pneumonia, and to be hospitalized because of it. The CDC recommends pneumonia shots PCV15 or PCV20 for adults age 65 or older. Adults ages 19-64 with certain medical conditions or risk factors should also get one. Ask your doctor if you should. \n\n【27】You also have a higher chance of getting pneumococcal pneumonia, a common type of bacterial pneumonia. And you need a Tdap vaccine to protect you against tetanus, diphtheria, and whooping cough, along with a zoster vaccine to keep you safe from shingles.\n\n【28】7\\. Consider Immunotherapy Allergy Shots\n----------------------------------------\n\n【29】If your doctor finds that you have allergies, allergy shots (immunotherapy) may help prevent allergy symptoms and keep your asthma from getting worse. With allergy shots, the doctor injects small doses of allergens under your skin on a regular schedule. Over time, your body may get used to the allergen and respond less when you’re exposed. This can help keep your asthma under control.\n\n【30】8\\. Take Asthma Medications as Prescribed\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【31】Long-term asthma medications are designed to prevent symptoms and attacks. You need to take them every day, even if you don’t have symptoms. They’ll ease inflammation in your airways and keep your asthma under control, so it’s less likely to flare up. If side effects bother you, talk to your doctor about switching to another treatment.\n\n【32】9\\. Follow Your Asthma Action Plan\n----------------------------------\n\n【33】Take your meds, even when you feel OK. Keep an inhaler on you. If you notice symptoms, check your plan for instructions on what medications to take. During an attack, the plan can tell you what meds will help and when it’s time to call the doctor.\n\n【34】10\\. Use a Home Peak Flow Meter\n-------------------------------\n\n【35】The meter shows how well air is moving through your lungs. During an attack, your airways narrow. The meter can let you know this is happening hours or days before you have any symptoms. This gives you time to take the medications listed in your treatment plan and possibly stop the attack before it starts.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 14:43:32", "endTime": "2024/08/21 14:43:43", "cost": 11.008}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:01", "update_time": "2024-08-20 22:43:43", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 22:43:32"}

{"id": 2252368, "user_id": "65e7dd234a08e7753ad36f9f", "user_name": "黄艳玲", "task_id": 1612, "source_info": {"seq_id": "3fb4de64-c603-4990-8997-ee19b8fdb77f", "title": "What Are the Treatments for Parkinson's Disease?", "text": "【0】What Are the Treatments for Parkinson's Disease?\nIf you have Parkinson's disease, you have a lot of choices for treatment. There's no cure, but medicine and sometimes surgery can help.\n\n【1】Medicine can often keep your symptoms in check for years. Your doctor may suggest you try one of these drugs:\n\n【2】**Levodopa****.** You may hear your doctor call this L-dopa. It's a drug that doctors prescribe most often for Parkinson's.\n\n【3】When you have Parkinson's, your brain gradually stops making dopamine -- a chemical that helps send signals in your brain. Levodopa may improve your symptoms because it is converted to dopamine in the brain.\n\n【4】To curb nausea and other possible side effects from levodopa, doctors usually suggest you take a drug called carbidopa along with it. It comes as a combination drug containing both medicines. Examples include: Duopa, Rytary and Sinemet.\n\n【5】Rarely, some people can't handle carbidopa and need to take levodopa alone. If that's the case for you, it's important not to take it at the same time as food or vitamins that have vitamin B6, which can affect how well your medicine works.\n\n【6】It is possible for symptoms to return in between doses in something called OFF periods. For these instances, your doctor may prescribe an infusion of levodopa through a tube called duopa, a powder form of levodopa (INBRIJA), which can be inhaled, or the new medication istradefylline (Nourianz).\n\n【7】Most doctors try to delay starting people on levodopa as long as possible because the drug tends to stop working as well after a while. Sometimes, if you've been taking levodopa for several years, the medicine's effects can wear off and you develop movement problems called \"motor fluctuations.\" These problems can happen gradually or suddenly.\n\n【8】Safinamide (Xadago) is an add-on medicine that may be prescribed when those taking levodopa and carbidopa have a breakthrough of Parkinson’s symptoms that were previously under control. Studies show that adding this drug may help individuals experience longer times with reduced or no symptoms. The most common side effects are trouble falling or staying asleep, nausea, falls, and uncontrolled, involuntary movements.\n\n【9】**Dopamine agonists.** These are drugs that imitate the action of dopamine in your brain. Some examples are pramipexole (Mirapex), ropinirole (Requip), and rotigotine (Neupro). You can take them alone or with L-dopa to treat the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease.\n\n【10】**COMT inhibitors.** You take these drugs, such as entacapone (Comtan), opicapone (Ongentys) and tolcapone (Tasmar), along with levodopa. They add to the amount of time you get relief from symptoms by blocking the action of an enzyme that breaks down levodopa. Tolcapone is rarely prescribed by doctors, though, because it can cause liver damage.\n\n【11】Stalevo is a tablet that combines carbidopa/levodopa with entacapone. While carbidopa lessens the side effects of levodopa, entacapone adds to the time levodopa is active in the brain.\n\n【12】**MAO-B inhibitors.** They also block the action of an enzyme that breaks down dopamine. You can take them alone early in Parkinson's disease or with other drugs as your disease moves to a later stage.\n\n【13】MAO-B inhibitors include rasigaline ( Azilect) and selegiline (Eldepryl, Zelapar). You usually take them alone because you can get side effects when you combine them with other drugs.\n\n【14】Other medications that doctors prescribe for Parkinson's include amantadine (Gocovri), apomorphine (Apokyn), benztropine (Cogentin), and anticholinergic drugs. All can help control symptoms. Some help release dopamine from nerve cells. Others curb the effects of acetylcholine, a chemical messenger in the brain that can cause a drop in dopamine.\n\n【15】Anticholinergic drugs are often used by younger people whose most severe symptom is a tremor. If you take these drugs when you're older, you're more likely to get side effect such as:\n\n【16】*   Dizziness\n*   Confusion\n*   Dry mouth\n*   Blurry vision\n*   Nausea\n*   Trouble peeing or having bowel movements\n\n【17】Other Types of Treatment for Parkinson's Disease\n------------------------------------------------\n\n【18】Some people with Parkinson's have surgery called deep brain stimulation (DBS). In this procedure, doctors place a wire deep inside a specific spot in the brain, depending on the symptoms that need treatment. DBS can lead to dramatic improvements in many people. Other surgical options include focused ultrasound, pallidotomy, and thalamotomy.\n\n【19】Scientists are also exploring ways to place cells that make dopamine into the brain to help treat people with Parkinson's, instead of taking medicine. Some experts are trying to see if stem cells can be used for this, but research is still in an early stage.\n\n【20】Some treatments focus on the effects of the disorder, rather than the causes.

It can happen when the balance of two hormones in your body is thrown off. If you have enlarged breasts because of fat deposits, you have a different condition called \"pseudogynecomastia.\"\n\n【2】Although breasts don't develop in men the way they do in women, all boys are born with a small amount of breast tissue.\n\n【3】Boys' bodies mostly make a hormone called testosterone, which guides their sexual growth during puberty. But males also make some estrogen -- the hormone that steers sexual growth in girls.\n\n【4】When a boy is going through puberty, or when an older man's body makes less testosterone, the balance of the two hormones changes.\n\n【5】Sometimes when that happens, a higher percentage of estrogen causes male breast tissue to swell. About half of adolescent boys and as many as two-thirds of men older than 50 will have this to some degree.\n\n【6】Gynecomastia Symptoms\n---------------------\n\n【7】Your first sign of gynecomastia may be a lump of fatty tissue under the nipple. Sometimes this lump is tender or sore.\n\n【8】This might make you worry that you have breast cancer, which does occur in a small number of men. Gynecomastia is not necessarily a sign of cancer, but your doctor may run some tests to rule it out.\n\n【9】Swelling of the breasts may happen unevenly, with one becoming larger than the other. You may also have breast tenderness.\n\n【10】See your doctor if you notice that your breasts have swelling, are painful or tender, or there is a discharge from the nipple of one or both breasts.\n\n【11】Gynecomastia Causes\n-------------------\n\n【12】A lot of things can trigger the hormone imbalance that causes male breast growth, and many times the exact cause isn't known.\n\n【13】In addition to body changes such as puberty and aging, some things that can cause gynecomastia are:\n\n【14】*   Injury or diseases that affect the testicles, which make testosterone\n*   Thyroid problems, since hormones from that gland control growth and sexual development\n*   Some cancers, including tumors of the lungs, pituitary gland, or adrenal glands\n*   Obesity, which can result in more estrogen\n*   Illegal drugs, including anabolic steroids, marijuana, and heroin\n*   Kidney failure (when they can no longer clean and filter your blood)\n*   Liver disease\n\n【15】Some infant boys may get gynecomastia briefly while hormones from their mother are still in their bodies.\n\n【16】Some types of medicines can lead to gynecomastia, such as:\n\n【17】**Anti-androgens.** These are drugs that treat an enlarged prostate or prostate cancer.\n\n【18】**Anabolic steroids and androgens.** Athletes sometimes use these drugs illicitly in an effort to improve their athletic performance. The drugs also have legitimate uses for certain conditions.\n\n【19】**HIV drugs.** Gynecomastia can sometimes be a side effect of an HIV treatment called \"highly active antiretroviral therapy.\"\n\n【20】**Anti-anxiety drugs.** Medicines such as diazepam (Valium) can sometimes cause gynecomastia.\n\n【21】**Heart medications.** Drugs such asdigoxin (Lanoxin) and calcium channel blockers can lead to gynecomastia sometimes.\n\n【22】**Medicines used to empty your stomach.** For example, metoclopramide (Reglan) can have gynecomastia as a side effect.\n\n【23】**Ulcer drugs.** Some medicines that you buy over the counter for ulcers can lead to gynecomastia, such as cimetidine (Tagamet HB).\n\n【24】Some antibiotics can also cause gynecomastia. So can tricyclic antidepressants and some cancer treatments.\n\n【25】Gynecomastia Diagnosis\n----------------------\n\n【26】If your doctor suspects you have gynecomastia, they will probably examine you to make sure there are no hard lumps, oozing fluid, or skin problems that could be signs of cancer.\n\n【27】They will also likely ask you questions about your medical history that might include:\n\n【28】*   Have you had illnesses such as mumps, kidney ailments, or liver disease?\n*   What drugs have you taken -- legal or illegal?\n\n【29】You might also be given tests. They could include:\n\n【30】*   Blood tests or urine samples\n*   Mammogram\n*   Biopsy\n*   CT scans\n*   MRI scans\n*   Testicular ultrasounds\n\n【31】Gynecomastia Treatment\n----------------------\n\n【32】Most cases slowly get better on their own without treatment.\n\n【33】When you have gynecomastia, your doctor might refer you to a specialist known as an endocrinologist, who treats problems related to hormones and how they affect your body.\n\n【34】How your condition is treated may depend on your age, your health, how long your condition may last, and how well you respond to certain drugs.\n\n【35】If gynecomastia happens during puberty, it usually goes away on its own. This might take anywhere from 6 months to 3 years.\n\n【36】If it turns out your hormones are out of balance because of another health problem, you'll want to treat that underlying condition.\n\n【37】You might be given medication to address the hormone imbalance that's causing breast growth.\n\n【38】In some cases, you might need surgery. Your doctor may recommend techniques such as:\n\n【39】*   Liposuction (removal of extra breast fat)\n*   Mastectomy (removal of breast gland tissue)\n\n【40】Gynecomastia Prevention\n-----------------------\n\n【41】There are steps you can take to lower your chances of having gynecomastia.

But most kids tend to show a combination of these key signs:\n\n【5】*   **Inattention.** Your child may have trouble paying attention or is easily distracted.\n*   **Impulsivity.** Your child acts without thinking, such as interrupting others.\n*   **Hyperactivity.** Your child is constantly in motion, overactive, or talks too much. \n\n【6】You may notice squirming, fidgeting, and other signs of hyperactivity in your kid before you notice inattention or impulsivity.\n\n【7】Symptoms may include:\n\n【8】*   Trouble with finishing tasks\n*   Losing things often\n*   Lots of energy\n*   Running or climbing at inappropriate times\n*   Forgetfulness\n*   A hard time waiting their turn\n\n【9】Learn more about the symptoms of ADHD in children .\n\n【10】Childhood ADHD Types\n--------------------\n\n【11】Your child's symptoms largely determine which of the three main types of ADHD they have:\n\n【12】*   **Mainly hyperactive and impulsive type.** Children show both hyperactive and impulsive behavior.\n*   **Mainly inattentive type.** This was formerly called attention deficit disorder (ADD). Children with these symptoms have trouble paying attention. You might not notice their symptoms as quickly as with the first type.\n*   **Combined type (inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive).** Children with this type of ADHD have several symptoms from the first two types. This is the most common form of ADHD.\n\n【13】Find out more about the types of ADHD in children .\n\n【14】Causes of ADHD in Children\n--------------------------\n\n【15】Doctors don't know exactly what causes ADHD. But it's known to run in families. One out of 4 kids with ADHD also have a parent with ADHD.\n\n【16】Research has shown that children with ADHD may have differences in:\n\n【17】*   Areas of the brain that control social skills, attention, and movement\n*   Chemicals that control communication in the brain \n\n【18】Experts also believe that the brains of children with ADHD tend to mature later than those of kids without the condition. \n\n【19】Studies have found no evidence that ADHD could be caused by:\n\n【20】*   Sugar\n*   Vaccines\n*   Poor parenting\n*   TV or video games\n\n【21】ADHD in Children: Risk Factors\n------------------------------\n\n【22】Scientists are also studying whether these things are linked to higher chances of ADHD in children:\n\n【23】*   Alcohol or tobacco use during pregnancy\n*   Premature birth\n*   Brain injury\n*   Exposure during pregnancy to certain environmental risks (like lead)\n*   Low birth weight\n\n【24】**ADHD in children epidemiology**\n\n【25】*   About 1 in 10 children in the U.S. have been diagnosed with ADHD.\n*   Boys are more than twice as likely as girls to be diagnosed. Some researchers think girls may be underdiagnosed because they're more likely to have the inattentive type of ADHD rather than the more visible hyperactive or impulsive type.\n*   Six in 10 children with ADHD also have another mental, emotional, or behavioral disorder. \n\n【26】ADHD in Children Diagnosis\n--------------------------\n\n【27】There isn't a simple test for ADHD. Your doctor or a specialist will make a diagnosis based on a physical exam, medical history, and your child's symptoms.\n\n【28】Your child may get an ADHD diagnosis if they meet all of these conditions: \n\n【29】*   They have at least six ADHD symptoms, such as fidgeting a lot or being easily disrupted.\n*   The symptoms last for 6 months or longer.\n*   These symptoms cause issues for your child in more than one setting, such as home, school, and socially.\n*   Their symptoms started before age 12.\n\n【30】Childhood ADHD Treatment\n------------------------\n\n【31】Studies show that long-term treatment with a combination of behavioral therapy and medications works better than medication alone.\n\n【32】For children under age 6, behavioral therapy is the recommended treatment. As they grow older, their doctor may prescribe medications as well.\n\n【33】**Behavioral treatments for children with ADHD**\n\n【34】A therapist or counselor can teach children techniques to help them better manage their behaviors. They can also teach parents skills to help them manage their children's behavior. These include: \n\n【35】*   Creating more structure and clear expectations\n*   Encouraging routines \n*   Rewarding good behaviors and discouraging negative behaviors\n\n【36】School-age children also get therapy to help them with things like:\n\n【37】*   Time management\n*   Organization\n*   Planning ahead\n\n【38】Social skills training is another form of ADHD treatment that may benefit your child. This trains them in behaviors that help them develop and maintain social relationships.\n\n【39】**Drug treatments for ADHD in children**\n\n【40】A class of drugs called psychostimulants (or sometimes just stimulants) is an effective treatment for many children with ADHD. These medicines help children focus their thoughts and ignore distractions. Some nonstimulant medications also work in similar ways to treat ADHD. Some stimulant drugs include:\n\n【41】*   **Amphetamines,** such as dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine), dextroamphetamine-amphetamine (Adderall XR, Mydayis), and lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse)\n*   **Methylphenidates,** such as methylphenidate (Concerta, Daytrana, Ritalin) and dexmethylphenidate (Focalin)\n\n【42】Many ADHD medicines are available in short-acting (immediate-release), long-acting, and intermediate-acting (in between short and long) forms.\n\n【43】It may take some time for you and your a doctor to find the best medication, dosage, and schedule for a child with the condition. And medications don't work for all children with ADHD.\n\n【44】ADHD drugs sometimes have side effects such as headaches or appetite loss. But usually, side effects are mild and don't last long.\n\n【45】**Alternative treatments**\n\n【46】No alternative treatments have been proven to help relieve ADHD symptoms. But some people report benefits from: \n\n【47】*   **Yoga.** This gentle form of exercise could help your child relax and learn discipline. Some yoga studios offer classes specifically for children.\n*   **Meditation.** Whether they do it with an instructor or through a device, this may help your child feel calmer.\n*   **Neurofeedback training.** In this type of training, your child focuses on a task while a doctor scans their brain activity using an electroencephalograph (EEG). They use feedback from the machine to help the child be aware of when they're losing focus. \n\n【48】**Which treatment is best for my child?**\n\n【49】No single treatment is right for every child with ADHD. Your doctor will consider your child's needs and history and work with you to find the best solution.\n\n【50】For example, a treatment that gives your child side effects may be the wrong choice. If a child with ADHD also has anxiety or depression, a treatment combining medication and behavioral therapy might be best.\n\n【51】About 3 in 4 children with ADHD in the U.S. get treatment for their condition. Researchers find that:\n\n【52】*   About 30% use medications alone for treatment\n*   About 15% get behavior treatment alone\n*   About 32% get both meds and behavior treatment for their ADHD\n\n【53】Learn about the latest treatment options for children with ADHD .\n\n【54】ADHD Health Disparities\n-----------------------\n\n【55】Research doesn't always agree on which racial and ethnic groups are most likely to have childhood ADHD. The CDC says that roughly 17% of Black children, 15% of White children, and 14% of Hispanic children have been diagnosed with ADHD or a learning disorder. But other research has found that Black children are _less_ likely to be diagnosed with ADHD than White children. There's evidence that Black and Hispanic children with ADHD are less likely to get treatment, too.\n\n【56】Because doctors use input from parents and teachers to diagnose ADHD, personal opinions and biases play a role. Other reasons for disparities could include:\n\n【57】*   Teachers may be more likely to identify symptoms in certain groups.\n*   Parents may fear that an ADHD diagnosis could result in stigma and increase racism against their children.\n*   Families may distrust the health care system or lack access to health care.\n\n【58】Research has also found that both boys and girls who live in families with incomes below the poverty line are more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD.\n\n【59】Complications of ADHD in Children\n---------------------------------\n\n【60】ADHD that goes untreated can lead to lifelong complications. These include:\n\n【61】*   Substance use disorder\n*   Trouble getting and holding a job\n*   Eating disorders\n*   Other mental health issues such as depression or anxiety\n*   Unstable relationships \n*   Poor academic performance \n*   Risky behaviors that could led to automobile accidents or legal problems\n*   Sleep issues \n\n【62】Living With Childhood ADHD\n--------------------------\n\n【63】Healthy foods, regular exercise, setting rules, and positive reinforcement are important for all children. But that's especially true for kids who have ADHD.\n\n【64】**Diet for ADHD in children**\n\n【65】There's little scientific evidence that any certain food or diet can help with ADHD. But we do know that a healthy, balanced diet helps keep a child's body and brain working well. And since ADHD medications can lower appetite, children who take these meds may have a harder time eating well.   \n\n【66】While certain vitamin or mineral supplements might improve symptoms in children who are deficient in these nutrients, there's no evidence they can help others. Talk to your child's doctor before giving them a dietary supplement.\n\n【67】**Managing ADHD in children**\n\n【68】Support groups and parenting skills training can help you learn more about ADHD and how to parent a child with the condition.\n\n【69】In general, Here are a few tips for helping your child's ADHD:\n\n【70】*   Try to make sure your child gets the right amount of sleep for their age.\n*   Watch for signs that your child may be stressed or overstimulated and intervene.\n*   Reward or praise good behaviors, and set clear boundaries about unacceptable behaviors.\n*   Keep playtimes and other social interactions short to help your child retain self control.\n*   Talk to your child's teacher and school administrators about your child's ADHD. They can help you decide whether accommodations would help and tell you how to apply for them.\n*   Regular exercise (30-60 minutes a day) helps many kids with ADHD manage some of their symptoms.\n*   If your child is mature and motivated enough to work with an ADHD coach, these professionals can help them learn practical skills and work toward their goals.\n\n【71】**Childhood ADHD costs**\n\n【72】If your child has been diagnosed with ADHD, you might have certain additional costs, such as:\n\n【73】*   Visits to doctors and mental health specialists\n*   Medications\n*   Coaching\n*   Tutoring\n*   Expenses due to accidents or injuries\n\n【74】 According to one study, parents with private insurance can expect extra health care expenses of $2,857-$3,922 a year for a child with ADHD, depending on the child's age. Those with Medicare will pay $2,712 to $3,509 more than they would for a child without the condition.\n\n【75】**Childhood ADHD and mental health**\n\n【76】Having ADHD doesn't mean your child has mental health issues. But children with ADHD are at higher risk of having other mental health conditions, including:\n\n【77】*   Depression\n*   Anxiety\n*   Personality disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)\n\n【78】Some mental health disorders might be related to the effects of ADHD. For example, problems at school could trigger depression. In these cases, treating ADHD might be enough to resolve the issue. But if your child has a mental health disorder along with ADHD, they'll need treatment for both conditions.\n\n【79】Childhood ADHD Prognosis\n------------------------\n\n【80】For about 7 out of 10 children, ADHD symptoms last into their teens and early adulthood. By age 25, symptoms lessen for 16% of them, while 9% of children no longer have symptoms at all. But for about 35% to 65% of children, ADHD is a lifelong condition. \n\n【81】**Is ADHD in children curable?**\n\n【82】There's no cure for ADHD, but with the right treatment, symptoms can be more manageable. While not all medications work for every child, certain stimulant meds have been shown to reduce ADHD symptoms in kids by about 70% to 80%.\n\n【83】**What to expect with ADHD in children**\n\n【84】With the right treatment, the long-term outlook for most kids with ADHD is positive. Some learn to deal with their symptoms so well that they no longer qualify for an ADHD diagnosis by the time they're adults. \n\n【85】For others, ADHD lasts a lifetime. But with treatment and symptom management, many lead healthy, fulfilling lives. \n\n【86】ADHD can also have positive aspects, such as:\n\n【87】*   High energy\n*   Creativity\n*   The ability to focus intently (hyperfocus) on things you're really interested in\n\n【88】Conditions Similar to ADHD in Children\n--------------------------------------\n\n【89】Several other conditions have symptoms that are similar to those of ADHD in children. And many of them are more likely to affect kids who also have AHDD. They include \n\n【90】*   Learning disabilities such as dyslexia (problems with reading) or dysgraphia (problems with writing)\n*   Mood disorders such as depression or bipolar disorder\n*   Anxiety disorders\n*   Language disorders, in which children have trouble expressing themselves or understanding others\n*   Behavior disorders such as conduct disorder or oppositional defiance disorder (ODD), in which a child is often angry, defiant, or aggressive\n\n【91】Takeaways\n---------\n\n【92】Kids with ADHD have issues with focus and attention that may last their whole lives. But treatment, a healthy lifestyle, and support from parents can help them manage their symptoms.

Even high stress from serious illness, job loss, a death in the family, or a painful life event can be a natural part of life. You may feel down or anxious, and that’s normal too for a while.\n\n【1】Talk to your doctor if you feel down or anxious for more than several weeks or if it starts to interfere with your home or work life. Therapy, medication, and other strategies can help.\n\n【2】In the meantime, there are things you can learn to help you manage stress before it gets to be too much. These tips may help you keep stress at bay:\n\n【3】*   Keep a positive attitude.\n*   Accept that there are events that you cannot control.\n*   Be assertive instead of aggressive. Assert your feelings, opinions, or beliefs instead of becoming angry, defensive, or passive.\n*   Learn to manage your time more effectively.\n*   Set limits appropriately and say no to requests that would create excessive stress in your life.\n*   Make time for hobbies and interests.\n*   Don't rely on alcohol, drugs, or compulsive behaviors to reduce stress. Drugs and alcohol can stress your body even more.\n*   Seek out social support. Spend enough time with those you love.\n*   Seek treatment with a psychologist or other mental health professional trained in stress management or biofeedback techniques to learn more healthy ways of dealing with the stress in your life.\n\n【4】There’s a lot more you can do to help manage stress. Consider these lifestyle changes:\n\n【5】Exercise\n--------\n\n【6】To start with, physical activity can help improve your sleep. And better sleep means better stress management. Doctors don’t yet know exactly why, but people who exercise more tend to get better deep “slow wave” sleep that helps renew the brain and body. Just take care not to exercise too close to bedtime, which disrupts sleep for some people.\n\n【7】Exercise also seems to help mood. Part of the reason may be that it stimulates your body to release a number of hormones like endorphins and endocannabinoids that help block pain, improve sleep, and sedate you. Some of them (endocannabinoids) may be responsible for the euphoric feeling, or “runner’s high,” that some people report after long runs.\n\n【8】People who exercise also tend to feel less anxious and more positive about themselves. When your body feels good, your mind often follows. Get a dose of stress relief with these exercises:\n\n【9】*   Running\n*   Swimming\n*   Dancing\n*   Cycling\n*   Aerobics\n\n【10】If you don't have the time for a formal exercise program, you can still find ways to move throughout your day. Try these tips:\n\n【11】*   Bike instead of driving to the store.\n*   Use the stairs instead of the elevator.\n*   Park as far as you can from the door.\n*   Hand-wash your car.\n*   Clean your house.\n*   Walk on your lunch break.\n\n【12】Diet\n----\n\n【13】The benefits of eating health foods extend beyond your waistline to your mental health. A healthy diet can lessen the effects of stress, build up your immune system, level your mood, and lower your blood pressure. Lots of added sugar and fat can have the opposite effect. And junk food can seem even more appealing when you’re under a lot of stress.\n\n【14】To stay healthy and on an even keel, look for complex carbohydrates, lean proteins, and fatty acids found in fish, meat, eggs, and nuts.\n\n【15】Antioxidants help too. They protect your cells against damage that chronic stress can cause. You can find them in a huge variety of foods like beans, fruits, berries, vegetables, and spices such as ginger.\n\n【16】Stick to a healthy diet with a few simple tips. Make a shopping list. Carry healthy snacks with you when you leave the house. Stay away from processed foods, and try not to eat mindlessly.\n\n【17】Scientists have pinpointed some nutrients that seem to help lessen the effects of stress on the body and mind. Be sure to get enough these as part of a balanced diet:\n\n【18】*   Vitamin C\n*   Magnesium\n*   Omega-3 fatty acids\n\n【19】Sleep\n-----\n\n【20】A common side effect of stress is that you may struggle to fall asleep. If this happens three times a week for at least 3 months, you may have insomnia, an inability to fall and stay asleep. Lack of sleep can also add to your stress level and cause a cycle of stress and sleeplessness.\n\n【21】Better sleep habits can help. This includes both your daily routine and the way you set up your bedroom. Habits that may help include:\n\n【22】*   Exercise regularly.\n*   Get out in the sunlight.\n*   Drink less alcohol and caffeine close to bedtime.\n*   Set a sleep schedule.\n*   Don’t look at your electronics 30-60 minutes before bed.\n*   Try meditation or other forms of relaxation at bedtime.\n\n【23】The role of your bedroom in good sleep hygiene also is important. In general, your room should be dark, quiet, and cool. Your bed also plays an important role. Your mattress should provide support, space and most of all, comfort.\n\n【24】Relaxation Techniques\n---------------------\n\n【25】**Yoga****.** This is a form of exercise, but it can also be a meditation. There are many types of yoga. The ones that focus on slow movement, stretching, and deep breathing are best for lowering your anxiety and stress.\n\n【26】**Meditation.** It has been around for over 5,000 years for a reason. Meditation works well for many people and has many benefits. It can lower stress, anxiety, and chronic pain as well as improve sleep, energy levels, and mood. To meditate, you will need to:\n\n【27】1.  Find a quiet place.\n2.  Get comfortable (sitting or lying down).\n3.  Focus your attention on a word, phrase, object, or even your breath.\n4.  Let your thoughts come and go and do not judge them.\n\n【28】**Deep breathing.** When you practice deep breathing, you turn on your body’s natural ability to relax. This creates a state of deep rest that can change how your body responds to stress. It sends more oxygen to your brain and calms the part of your nervous system that handles your ability to relax.\n\n【29】Try belly breathing. Get comfortable, close your eyes, and place one hand on your stomach and the other on your chest. Take a deep breath in through your nose. You should feel your belly rise more than your chest. Now, exhale through your nose and pay close attention to how your body relaxes. Repeat.\n\n【30】**Biofeedback****.** Learn how to manage your heart rate, muscle tension, and blood pressure when stress hits. Biofeedback gives you information about how your body reacts when you try to relax. Sensors are placed on your body that call out changes in everything from your brain-wave pattern to your muscle tone. Working with a biofeedback therapist, you can start to take control of the signals by changing how your body reacts to the sensor.\n\n【31】**Connect with people.** Spend time with a friend or family member who will listen to you. It is a natural way to calm you and lower your stress. When you connect with people in person, your body releases a hormone that stops your fight-or-flight response. You relax.\n\n【32】**Behavior.** How you respond to people directly impacts your stress levels. Manage your response with these tips:\n\n【33】*   Try not to overcommit yourself\n*   Share the responsibility\n*   Count to 10 before you respond\n*   Walk away from a heated situation\n*   Distract yourself with music or podcasts\n\n【34】**Inner voice.** Nothing affects your stress levels like the voice inside your head. The good news is you are in control. You can exchange negative thoughts for positive ones. There are more benefits to positive self-talk than reducing stress. These include a longer life, lower levels of depression, greater resistance to the common cold and cardiovascular disease, and better coping skills for when hard times hit.\n\n【35】**Laugh therapy.** When you laugh, you take in more oxygen. Your heart, lungs, and muscles get a boost and your body releases those feel-good hormones. Laughter also improves your immune system, lessens pain, and improves your mood for long periods time.\n\n【36】**Talk therapy****.** Long-term talk therapy helps some people deal with stress. One approach, cognitive behavioral therapy, helps you change negative thought patterns. Your therapist can guide you toward other approaches that might be helpful.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 10:57:53", "endTime": "2024/08/21 10:59:56", "cost": 122.213}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:01", "update_time": "2024-08-20 18:59:56", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 18:57:53"}

Most of the time, genes that lead to the disease mutate sometime during your life and aren’t an inherited problem.\n\n【2】But in about 5% to 10% of cases, the cause is hereditary. This means that the cancer is due to a gene change, called a “mutation,” that’s passed down from a parent.\n\n【3】Researchers have identified hundreds of genes linked to breast cancer, but some seem to play more of a role than others.\n\n【4】Just because you have an inherited gene mutation doesn’t mean you’ll definitely get breast cancer. It only means you have a greater chance of it happening.\n\n【5】How Are Gene Mutations Inherited?\n---------------------------------\n\n【6】If you inherit a gene mutation for breast cancer, it means that you got it from one or both of your parents.\n\n【7】Many mutations, such as those found in the well-known BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, are passed down in what’s called an autosomal dominant pattern. This means that inheriting one bad gene from one parent may lead to an increased chance of disease.\n\n【8】If one of your parents has an autosomal dominant gene mutation, there’s a 50% chance you’ll inherit it. This is why we see the disease in many relatives, but not all of them.\n\n【9】Genetic Testing for Breast Cancer Genes\n---------------------------------------\n\n【10】Genetic testing for breast cancer.\n\n【11】Genetic tests can tell you if you have an inherited gene mutation for breast cancer. You can have a test that looks for an individual gene abnormality or a larger panel test that examines several genes at one time. Experts usually recommend gene testing if you have breast cancer or strong risk factors, such as a family history of hereditary cancers. Talk to your doctor if you’d like to learn more about genetic testing.\n\n【12】Should I Be Tested for Genetic Mutations?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【13】At-risk families can take blood tests to look for mutations in these genes.\n\n【14】You may want to discuss genetic testing with your doctor if:\n\n【15】*   You have two or more blood relatives – mother, sister, aunt, cousin, or daughter – with premenopausal breast cancer or ovarian cancer diagnosed at any age.\n*   You were diagnosed with breast cancer, especially before menopause, and have a blood relative with breast or ovarian cancer.\n*   You were diagnosed with ovarian cancer and you have blood relatives who have had ovarian or breast cancer.\n*   A male in your family has or had breast cancer.\n*   You or a family member has been diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer (cancer in both breasts).\n*   You were diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer before the age of 60.\n*   You are related to someone (male or female) who has a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation.\n*   You are of Ashkenazi Jewish descent and have had breast or ovarian cancer or have blood relatives who have had breast or ovarian cancer.\n*   You may also want to consider testing if you are a Black woman. Black women are just as likely to have hereditary breast cancer mutations as white women, but tend not to get tested as frequently, putting you at a higher risk of the cancer going undetected.\n\n【16】Preparation for Genetic Testing\n-------------------------------\n\n【17】Counseling is required before having genetic testing for breast cancer. During this educational session, a health care provider will explain the benefits and risks of genetic testing and answer any questions you may have.\n\n【18】You’ll also have to sign a consent form. It’s an agreement between you and your health care provider, showing that you have discussed the tests and understand how the results might affect you and your family.\n\n【19】Here are some questions to consider when thinking about genetic testing:\n\n【20】*   Am I prepared to cope with the result? Are my family members also prepared, including my children and my spouse?\n*   What are my goals for testing?\n*   How would I use my test results? What will I do differently if the results are positive or negative?\n*   With whom will I share my results?\n*   Would a positive test result change relationships with my family?\n\n【21】The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 prevents insurance companies from denying coverage based on genetic information. This act also prevents insurance companies from using genetic information to determine that a health condition existed before application was made for insurance. In addition, many states have passed laws, or have legislation pending, addressing insurance concerns.\n\n【22】What Happens During Genetic Testing?\n------------------------------------\n\n【23】The genetic counselor will do a family pedigree to detect high-risk patterns. A family pedigree is a chart that shows the genetic makeup of a person's relatives. It’s used to analyze traits or diseases that are passed down through a family.\n\n【24】Then, you’ll have a blood test to learn whether you have a breast cancer gene. Keep in mind that the vast majority of breast cancer cases are not linked to a breast cancer gene. In addition, scientists do not know all of the genes that can cause breast cancer, so they can test you only for the known genes.\n\n【25】When someone with a cancer diagnosis and a family history of the disease is found to have an altered BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene, the family is said to have a \"known mutation.\" If there’s a link between the development of breast cancer and a breast cancer gene, then all family members willing to have genetic testing are asked to give a sample of blood. For many people, knowing their test results is important because this information may help to guide health care decisions for themselves and their families.\n\n【26】Can I Do Genetic Testing at Home?\n---------------------------------\n\n【27】Yes. There are several options for genetic testing that can be done on your own. Companies like Veritas Genetics and Color Genomics offer testing kits that look for BRCA1 and BRCA2. You will need a doctor’s approval to order the kits. Both companies can connect you with a health care provider to get the necessary approval and help explain the results. These tests are usually more affordable ($200-$300) than tests ordered through a hospital but can miss key mutations that could clue doctors into a possible breast cancer diagnosis.\n\n【28】How Do I Interpret the Genetic Test Results?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【29】A negative genetic test means that a breast cancer gene mutation was not identified. If other genetic testing has identified a mutation in your family, a negative test means you do not have the specific mutation. Therefore, your risk of cancer is the same as someone in the general population who has a family history of breast cancer.\n\n【30】If a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation has not been previously found in your family, a negative result should be interpreted cautiously. There is still a chance that you may have a higher risk for breast cancer because of changes in genes other than those that doctors can test for.\n\n【31】A positive test result means that a mutation known to raise the risk of breast and ovarian cancers was identified.\n\n【32】What Are the Pros and Cons of Genetic Testing for Breast Cancer?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【33】Genetic testing is not 100% accurate. If a test is negative, a person still has a chance of getting breast cancer. If the test is positive, there is still a chance of not getting breast cancer.\n\n【34】Genetic testing is costly, ranging from about $400 to more than $3,000, depending on the type of test. Insurance coverage varies.\n\n【35】The results of genetic tests won't be available for several weeks. The length of time it takes to get results depends on the tests performed and under what circumstances they are done.\n\n【36】Legislation has been enacted to protect people who may have a documented genetic risk of cancer from employment or insurance problems. The best thing you can do is to become involved with an established genetic registry that can counsel people who have a genetic risk for cancer.\n\n【37】But for some people, genetic testing may help you make informed medical and lifestyle decisions while easing the anxiety of not knowing your genetic background. You can also make a decision regarding prevention, with both medications and prophylactic surgery. In addition, many people take part in medical research that, in the long run, may lower their risk of death from breast cancer.\n\n【38】What Are My Options if I Have a ‘Cancer Gene’?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【39】If your genetic testing shows you have a mutation linked to cancer, there are still several steps you can take to lower your chances for developing breast cancer.\n\n【40】*   Maintain a healthy weight.\n*   Stay physically active. The American Cancer Society recommends you get at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity each week. Moderate activity can be something like a quick-paced walk, while vigorous activity would have you breaking a sweat.\n*   Limit alcohol intake.\n*   Studies show decreased risks of breast cancer for women who breastfeed for several months after giving birth.\n*   The American Cancer Society recommends choosing non-hormonal options to treat menopause symptoms instead of hormone therapy.\n\n【41】If you have an increased risk, you can also consider counseling to help navigate the emotions surrounding the test results, and speaking with a health care professional about next steps.\n\n【42】Common Breast Cancer Mutations\n------------------------------\n\n【43】Researchers have identified several key gene changes linked to breast cancer. Some of these pose a high risk, while others seem to be less significant.\n\n【44】**BRCA1 and BRCA2**\n\n【45】The BRCA1 (breast cancer gene one) and BRCA2 (breast cancer gene two) inherited gene mutations are the most common cause of hereditary breast cancer. Mistakes in these genes account for up to 10% of all breast cancers. BRCA mutations also raise your chances for ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, and, in men, prostate cancer. A BRCA mutation may raise your chances of colon cancer. Women with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation have up to a 72% chance of breast cancer during their lifetime.\n\n【46】**PALB2**\n\n【47】Normally, the PALB2 gene makes a protein that works with the BRCA2 gene protein to repair damaged DNA and stop tumor growth. But defects in the gene can lead to a higher likelihood of breast cancer. Some studies suggest that women with a PALB2 mutation have a 14% chance of breast cancer by age 50 and a 35% chance by age 70.\n\n【48】**PIK3CA**\n\n【49】The PIK3CA gene gives instructions to make a protein that’s important for many cell functions. A PIK3CA mutation isn’t inherited – you can’t pass it down to your children. Instead, it’s a mutation that you develop during your life, called a sporadic mutation. PIK3CA gene mutations are found in about 30% to 40% of breast cancers. It’s important to know your tumor’s PIK3CA status because it may affect how your doctor treats your cancer. Surgeons can remove tissue in your tumor (called a biopsy) to test your breast tumor for a PIK3CA mutation, or in some cases, a blood test can find the defect.\n\n【50】**HER2**\n\n【51】The HER2 gene makes a protein called HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2). This protein is found on the surface of all breast cells and that helps them grow. If the HER2 gene malfunctions and makes too many copies of itself, it tells cells to make too much HER2 protein. This causes the cells to grow out of control.\n\n【52】Like PIK3CA, HER2 is not an inherited gene mutation. Most breast cancer is HER2-negative. Research suggests about only 10% to 20% of cases are HER2-positive. This means there’s a change in the HER2 gene that makes breast cells grow and divide out of control. If you have invasive breast cancer, your doctor will probably test your tumor tissue for HER2 after you have a biopsy.\n\n【53】**PTEN**\n\n【54】PTEN is a gene that helps control cell growth. An inherited change in PTEN can cause Cowden syndrome, a disorder that puts you at risk for cancerous and noncancerous breast tumors and other growths. Women with a PTEN mutation have a lifetime breast cancer chance of between 25% and 50%, though some studies suggest the odds are even higher.\n\n【55】**TP53**\n\n【56】The TP53 gene helps stop the growth of cells that have damaged DNA. An inherited TP53 mutation causes Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a disorder that ups your chances of breast cancer, leukemia, brain tumors, and cancers called sarcomas. One study found women with Li-Fraumeni syndrome have a 54% chance of breast cancer by age 70.\n\n【57】**ATM**\n\n【58】The ATM gene normally helps repair damaged DNA, but some people who inherit one bad copy of the gene are at high risk for breast cancer and pancreatic cancer. Research suggests the lifetime chance of breast cancer for those who carry an ATM mutation is between 33% and 38%. Those who have a type of mutation that affects a specific location on the ATM gene have a 69% lifetime chance.\n\n【59】**CDH1**\n\n【60】CDH1 makes a protein that helps cells bind together to create tissue. People with a faulty CDH1 gene are more likely to develop a rare type of stomach cancer. Women with this mutation also have a 39% to 52% lifetime chance of invasive lobular breast cancer (breast cancer that starts in the lobules of the breast, the glands that make milk).\n\n【61】Other Genes Related to Breast Cancer\n------------------------------------\n\n【62】Researchers have discovered many other genes related to breast cancer.\n\n【63】Changes in the following genes may also raise your chances:\n\n【64】*   BARD1\n*   CHEK2\n*   NBN\n*   NF1\n*   STK11\n*   MSH2\n\n【65】The Risks of Inherited Gene Mutations\n-------------------------------------\n\n【66】Women who inherit the mutated BRCA1 gene have a 55% to 65% risk of breast cancer by age 70. Women with mutated BRCA2 have about a 45% risk. Men with a BRCA mutation are also at a higher risk of breast cancer.\n\n【67】Transgender and gender expansive people (those who don’t identify as strictly male or female) can also inherit these gene mutations. If you’re part of this community, you should consider that top surgery, which removes breast tissue, doesn’t completely remove this risk.\n\n【68】Either mutation brings a higher risk of getting breast cancer at a younger age (before menopause).\n\n【69】People who have a mutated BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene have a higher risk of a second primary breast cancer, too. Bilateral breast cancer (cancer in both breasts) is also more common in women who carry a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene.\n\n【70】These mutations also raise your risk of ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, peritoneal cancer, and pancreatic cancer. Men face a higher risk of prostate cancer.\n\n【71】WEBINAR\n\n【72】Breast Cancer: How Important Is Inherited Risk?\n\n【73】View this free expert webinar from WebMD.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【71】WEBINAR\n\n【72】Breast Cancer: How Important Is Inherited Risk?\n\n【73】View this free expert webinar from WebMD.", "content": "【0】What Are Genetic Breast Cancer Mutations?\nIs Breast Cancer Hereditary?\n----------------------------\n\n【1】If you have breast cancer, chances are it’s not caused by a faulty gene you were born with. Most of the time, genes that lead to the disease mutate sometime during your life and aren’t an inherited problem.\n\n【2】But in about 5% to 10% of cases, the cause is hereditary. This means that the cancer is due to a gene change, called a “mutation,” that’s passed down from a parent.\n\n【3】Researchers have identified hundreds of genes linked to breast cancer, but some seem to play more of a role than others.\n\n【4】Just because you have an inherited gene mutation doesn’t mean you’ll definitely get breast cancer. It only means you have a greater chance of it happening.\n\n【5】How Are Gene Mutations Inherited?\n---------------------------------\n\n【6】If you inherit a gene mutation for breast cancer, it means that you got it from one or both of your parents.\n\n【7】Many mutations, such as those found in the well-known BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, are passed down in what’s called an autosomal dominant pattern. This means that inheriting one bad gene from one parent may lead to an increased chance of disease.\n\n【8】If one of your parents has an autosomal dominant gene mutation, there’s a 50% chance you’ll inherit it. This is why we see the disease in many relatives, but not all of them.\n\n【9】Genetic Testing for Breast Cancer Genes\n---------------------------------------\n\n【10】Genetic testing for breast cancer.\n\n【11】Genetic tests can tell you if you have an inherited gene mutation for breast cancer. You can have a test that looks for an individual gene abnormality or a larger panel test that examines several genes at one time. Experts usually recommend gene testing if you have breast cancer or strong risk factors, such as a family history of hereditary cancers. Talk to your doctor if you’d like to learn more about genetic testing.\n\n【12】Should I Be Tested for Genetic Mutations?\n-----------------------------------------\n\n【13】At-risk families can take blood tests to look for mutations in these genes.\n\n【14】You may want to discuss genetic testing with your doctor if:\n\n【15】*   You have two or more blood relatives – mother, sister, aunt, cousin, or daughter – with premenopausal breast cancer or ovarian cancer diagnosed at any age.\n*   You were diagnosed with breast cancer, especially before menopause, and have a blood relative with breast or ovarian cancer.\n*   You were diagnosed with ovarian cancer and you have blood relatives who have had ovarian or breast cancer.\n*   A male in your family has or had breast cancer.\n*   You or a family member has been diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer (cancer in both breasts).\n*   You were diagnosed with triple-negative breast cancer before the age of 60.\n*   You are related to someone (male or female) who has a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation.\n*   You are of Ashkenazi Jewish descent and have had breast or ovarian cancer or have blood relatives who have had breast or ovarian cancer.\n*   You may also want to consider testing if you are a Black woman. Black women are just as likely to have hereditary breast cancer mutations as white women, but tend not to get tested as frequently, putting you at a higher risk of the cancer going undetected.\n\n【16】Preparation for Genetic Testing\n-------------------------------\n\n【17】Counseling is required before having genetic testing for breast cancer. During this educational session, a health care provider will explain the benefits and risks of genetic testing and answer any questions you may have.\n\n【18】You’ll also have to sign a consent form. It’s an agreement between you and your health care provider, showing that you have discussed the tests and understand how the results might affect you and your family.\n\n【19】Here are some questions to consider when thinking about genetic testing:\n\n【20】*   Am I prepared to cope with the result? Are my family members also prepared, including my children and my spouse?\n*   What are my goals for testing?\n*   How would I use my test results? What will I do differently if the results are positive or negative?\n*   With whom will I share my results?\n*   Would a positive test result change relationships with my family?\n\n【21】The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 prevents insurance companies from denying coverage based on genetic information. This act also prevents insurance companies from using genetic information to determine that a health condition existed before application was made for insurance. In addition, many states have passed laws, or have legislation pending, addressing insurance concerns.\n\n【22】What Happens During Genetic Testing?\n------------------------------------\n\n【23】The genetic counselor will do a family pedigree to detect high-risk patterns. A family pedigree is a chart that shows the genetic makeup of a person's relatives. It’s used to analyze traits or diseases that are passed down through a family.\n\n【24】Then, you’ll have a blood test to learn whether you have a breast cancer gene. Keep in mind that the vast majority of breast cancer cases are not linked to a breast cancer gene. In addition, scientists do not know all of the genes that can cause breast cancer, so they can test you only for the known genes.\n\n【25】When someone with a cancer diagnosis and a family history of the disease is found to have an altered BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene, the family is said to have a \"known mutation.\" If there’s a link between the development of breast cancer and a breast cancer gene, then all family members willing to have genetic testing are asked to give a sample of blood. For many people, knowing their test results is important because this information may help to guide health care decisions for themselves and their families.\n\n【26】Can I Do Genetic Testing at Home?\n---------------------------------\n\n【27】Yes. There are several options for genetic testing that can be done on your own. Companies like Veritas Genetics and Color Genomics offer testing kits that look for BRCA1 and BRCA2. You will need a doctor’s approval to order the kits. Both companies can connect you with a health care provider to get the necessary approval and help explain the results. These tests are usually more affordable ($200-$300) than tests ordered through a hospital but can miss key mutations that could clue doctors into a possible breast cancer diagnosis.\n\n【28】How Do I Interpret the Genetic Test Results?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【29】A negative genetic test means that a breast cancer gene mutation was not identified. If other genetic testing has identified a mutation in your family, a negative test means you do not have the specific mutation. Therefore, your risk of cancer is the same as someone in the general population who has a family history of breast cancer.\n\n【30】If a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation has not been previously found in your family, a negative result should be interpreted cautiously. There is still a chance that you may have a higher risk for breast cancer because of changes in genes other than those that doctors can test for.\n\n【31】A positive test result means that a mutation known to raise the risk of breast and ovarian cancers was identified.\n\n【32】What Are the Pros and Cons of Genetic Testing for Breast Cancer?\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【33】Genetic testing is not 100% accurate. If a test is negative, a person still has a chance of getting breast cancer. If the test is positive, there is still a chance of not getting breast cancer.\n\n【34】Genetic testing is costly, ranging from about $400 to more than $3,000, depending on the type of test. Insurance coverage varies.\n\n【35】The results of genetic tests won't be available for several weeks. The length of time it takes to get results depends on the tests performed and under what circumstances they are done.\n\n【36】Legislation has been enacted to protect people who may have a documented genetic risk of cancer from employment or insurance problems. The best thing you can do is to become involved with an established genetic registry that can counsel people who have a genetic risk for cancer.\n\n【37】But for some people, genetic testing may help you make informed medical and lifestyle decisions while easing the anxiety of not knowing your genetic background. You can also make a decision regarding prevention, with both medications and prophylactic surgery. In addition, many people take part in medical research that, in the long run, may lower their risk of death from breast cancer.\n\n【38】What Are My Options if I Have a ‘Cancer Gene’?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【39】If your genetic testing shows you have a mutation linked to cancer, there are still several steps you can take to lower your chances for developing breast cancer.\n\n【40】*   Maintain a healthy weight.\n*   Stay physically active. The American Cancer Society recommends you get at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity each week.

Some people are infected but don’t notice any symptoms (doctors call that being asymptomatic). Most people will have mild symptoms and get better on their own. But some will have severe problems, such as trouble breathing. The odds of more serious symptoms are higher if you’re older or have another health condition like diabetes or heart disease.\n\n【1】Here’s what to look for if you think you might have COVID-19.\n\n【2】Common Symptoms\n---------------\n\n【3】The most common things people who become ill with COVID-19 have include:\n\n【4】*   Fever or chills\n*   A dry cough and shortness of breath\n*   Feeling very tired\n*   Muscle or body aches\n*   Headache\n*   A loss of taste or smell\n*   Sore throat\n*   Congestion or runny nose\n*   Nausea or vomiting\n*   Diarrhea\n\n【5】These symptoms can start anywhere from 2 to 14 days after you’re in contact with the virus.\n\n【6】Emergency Symptoms\n------------------\n\n【7】Call a doctor or hospital right away if you have any of these issues:\n\n【8】*   Trouble breathing\n*   Constant pain or pressure in your chest\n*   Bluish lips or face\n*   Sudden confusion\n*   Having a hard time staying awake\n\n【9】If you have any of these, you need medical care as soon as possible, so call your doctor’s office or hospital before you go in. This will help them prepare to treat you and protect medical staff and other people.\n\n【10】Strokes have also been reported in some people who have COVID-19. Remember FAST:\n\n【11】*   **Face.** Is one side of the person’s face numb or drooping? Is their smile lopsided?\n*   **Arms.** Is one arm weak or numb? If they try to raise both arms, does one arm sag?\n*   **Speech.** Can they speak clearly? Ask them to repeat a sentence.\n*   **Time.** Every minute counts when someone shows signs of a stroke. Call 911 right away.\n\n【12】The antiviral drug remdesivir (Veklury) has been approved by the FDA for use in hospitalized people. Molnupiravir (Lagevrio) and nirmatrelvir with Ritonavir (Paxlovid) have been given emergency use authorization for treating COVID-19 and should be given orally as soon as possible. \n\n【13】The FDA has also authorized health care providers to use medications that aren’t yet approved for COVID-19, such as monoclonal antibodies, in some special cases.\n\n【14】COVID-19 SYMPTOM CHECKER\n\n【15】Find Out if You Have Symptoms of Coronavirus (COVID-19)\n\n【16】See what to do about your symptoms and whether to call a doctor\n\n【17】Other COVID-19 Symptoms\n-----------------------\n\n【18】COVID-19 can also cause problems including:\n\n【19】*   Pinkeye\n*   Swollen eyes\n*   Fainting\n*   Guillain-Barre syndrome\n*   Coughing up blood\n*   Blood clots\n*   Seizures\n*   Heart problems\n*   Kidney damage\n*   Liver problems or damage\n\n【20】Some doctors have reported rashes tied to COVID-19, including purple or blue lesions on children’s toes and feet. Researchers are looking into these reports so they can understand the effect on people who have COVID-19. \n\n【21】Symptoms in Children\n--------------------\n\n【22】Researchers say kids have many of the same COVID-19 symptoms as adults, but they tend to be milder. Some children may be asymptomatic, but they can still spread the virus.\n\n【23】Common symptoms in children include:\n\n【24】*   Fever\n*   Cough\n*   Shortness of breath\n\n【25】Some children and teens who are in the hospital with COVID-19 have an inflammatory syndrome that may be linked to the coronavirus. Doctors call it pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome (PMIS). Symptoms include a fever, a rash, belly pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and heart problems. It’s similar to toxic shock or to Kawasaki disease, a condition in children that causes inflammation in blood vessels.\n\n【26】When to Get Tested for COVID-19\n-------------------------------\n\n【27】Get tested for COVID-19 if:\n\n【28】*   You’ve had symptoms of the virus\n*   You’ve come into close contact with a person who has COVID-19 (take a test at least 5 days after you last saw the individual)\n*   You’ve been asked to get tested by your school, health care provider, workplace, state, local, tribal, or territorial health department (regardless of your vaccination status)\n\n【29】How to Check for Fever\n----------------------\n\n【30】Your regular body temperature may be higher or lower than someone else’s. It also changes throughout the day. Doctors generally consider a fever in an adult to be anything over 100.4 F on an oral thermometer and over 100.8 F on a rectal thermometer.\n\n【31】If you think you’ve come into contact with the virus, or if you have symptoms, isolate yourself and check your temperature every morning and evening for at least 10 days. Keep track of the readings. A fever is the most common symptom of COVID-19, but it’s sometimes below 100 F. In a child, a fever is a temperature above 100 F on an oral thermometer or 100.4 F on a rectal one.\n\n【32】What Kind of Cough Is Common in People With the Coronavirus?\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n【33】Most people with COVID-19 have a dry cough they can feel in their chest.\n\n【34】What to Do If You Think You Have Mild Symptoms\n----------------------------------------------\n\n【35】If you have milder symptoms like a fever, shortness of breath, or coughing:\n\n【36】*   Stay home unless you need medical care. If you do need to go in, call your doctor or hospital first for guidance.\n*   Tell your doctor about your illness. If you’re at high risk of complications because of your age or other health conditions, they might have more instructions.\n*   Isolate yourself. This means staying away from other people as much as possible, even members of your family. Stay in a specific “sick room,” and use a separate bathroom if you can.\n*   Wear a face mask if you have to be around anyone else. This includes people you live with. If a mask makes it hard for you to breathe, keep at least 6 feet from others and cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze. After that happens, wash your hands with soap for at least 20 seconds. The CDC states that well-fitting respirator masks (like N95s and KN95s) give better protection than cloth masks.\n*   Rest up, and drink plenty of fluids.

If they get worse, get medical help right away.\n\n【37】What Does Shortness of Breath Feel Like?\n----------------------------------------\n\n【38】Dyspnea is the word doctors use for shortness of breath. It can feel like you:\n\n【39】*   Have tightness in your chest\n*   Can’t catch your breath\n*   Can’t get enough air into your lungs\n*   Can’t breathe deeply\n*   Are smothering, drowning, or suffocating\n*   Have to work harder than usual to breathe in or out\n*   Need to breathe in before you’re done breathing out\n\n【40】You should monitor your oxygen levels, and if they dip into the 80s, contact your doctor. If your face and/or lips get a bluish tint, call 911 right away.\n\n【41】Is It COVID-19, the Flu, a Cold, or Allergies?\n----------------------------------------------\n\n| **Cold vs. Flu vs. Allergies vs. COVID-19**  | **Cold vs. Flu vs. Allergies vs. COVID-19**  | **Cold vs. Flu vs. Allergies vs. COVID-19**  | **Cold vs. Flu vs. Allergies vs. COVID-19**  | **Cold vs. Flu vs. Allergies vs. COVID-19**  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Sym**ptoms** | **Cold** | **Flu** | **Allergies** | **COVID-19** (can range from moderate to severe)  |\n| Fever | Rare | High (100-102 F), Can last 3-4 days | Never | Common |\n| Headache | Rare | Intense | Uncommon | Common |\n| General aches, pains | Slight | Usual, often severe | Never | Common |\n| Fatigue, weakness | Mild | Intense, can last up to 2-3 weeks | Sometimes | Common |\n| Extreme exhaustion | Never | Usual (starts early) | Never | Can be present |\n| Stuffy/runny nose | Common | Sometimes | Common | Has been reported |\n| Sneezing | Usual | Sometimes | Usual | Has been reported |\n| Sore throat | Common | Common | Sometimes | Has been reported |\n| Cough | Mild to moderate | Common, can become severe | Sometimes | Common |\n| Shortness of breath | Rare | Rare | Rare, except for those with allergic asthma | In more serious infections |\n\n【43】How to Protect Yourself\n-----------------------\n\n【44】Several COVID-19 vaccines are available, and they’re the best way to protect yourself and those around you unless your doctor advises otherwise. Full vaccination lowers your chances of getting COVID-19.\n\n【45】The most accessible vaccines in the U.S. are:\n\n【46】*   Pfizer: available for adults and children over the age of 6 months, primary series requires two doses, 3 weeks apart; those 6 months and older will receive a 3rd dose 8 weeks after the second dose.\n*   Moderna: available for ages 6 months and up, primary series requires two doses a month apart; everyone ages 2 and older should get a booster dose 5 months after the last dose in their primary series. A bivalent booster dose is recommended for children aged 6 months–4 years who completed the Moderna primary series and if it has been at least 2 months since their last dose.\n*   Novavax: available for those 12 and older, it requires two doses given three to eight weeks apart. Novavax can be used as a booster in people aged 12 years or older if no other COVID-19 vaccine brand is suitable for that person\n*   Johnson & Johnson: available for ages 18 and up, requires one dose; everyone ages 18 years and older should get a booster dose of either Pfizer or Moderna at least 2 months after the first dose of Johnson & Johnson\n\n【47】Talk with your doctor before getting the vaccine if you have immune system issues.\n\n【48】The CDC recently said there’s a clinical preference for people to get an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (either the Pfizer or Moderna one) or Novavax's protein-based vaccine over the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. This recommendation came after the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) discussed the latest data on vaccine effectiveness, vaccine safety, rare adverse side effects, and U.S. vaccine supply.\n\n【49】But the ACIP also said that any vaccine is better than no vaccine and the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine is still an option.\n\n【50】In addition, in the fall of 2022, CDC recommended a bivalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccine booster dose for persons aged 5 years and older to help combat the Omicron variant. The shot is administered at least 2 months after completing the primary series or after receipt of a monovalent booster dose.\n\n【51】The CDC also approved a bivalent booster for children aged 6 months–4 years who completed the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine primary series   \nAnd an updated (bivalent) Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine also became available on December 9, 2022, for children aged 6 months–4 years to complete the primary series.\n\n【52】Until you’re vaccinated, be sure to take these steps to prevent COVID-19:\n\n【53】*   Wash your hands often, for at least 20 seconds each time, with soap and water.\n*   Use an alcohol-based sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol if you don't have soap and water handy.\n*   Limit your contact with other people. Stay at least 6 feet away from others if you have to go out.\n*   Wear a well-fitted protective face mask in public places.\n*   Avoid people who are sick.\n*   Don’t touch your eyes, nose, or mouth unless you’ve just washed your hands.\n*   Regularly clean and disinfect surfaces that you touch a lot.\n\n【54】NEWSLETTER\n\n【55】Stay Up-to-Date on COVID-19\n\n【56】Sign up for the latest coronavirus news.\n\n【57】Caring for Someone Who Has COVID-19 Symptoms\n--------------------------------------------\n\n【58】If you’re taking care of someone who’s sick, follow these steps to protect yourself:\n\n【59】*   Limit your contact as much as you can. Stay in separate rooms. If you have to be in the same room, use a fan or an open window to improve airflow.\n*   Ask the person who’s sick to wear a well-fitted protective face mask when you’re around each other. You should wear one, too.\n*   Don’t share items like electronics, bedding, or dishes.\n*   Use gloves when handling the other person’s dishes, laundry, or trash. When you’re done, throw away the gloves and wash your hands.\n*   Regularly clean and disinfect common surfaces such as doorknobs, light switches, faucets, and countertops.\n*   Take care of yourself. Get enough rest and nutrition.

Problems are more likely to occur if you are dehydrated, have heart failure or kidney disease , are an older adult, or if you take certain medications (see also Drug Interactions section). Drink plenty of fluids as directed by your doctor to prevent dehydration and tell your doctor right away if you have a change in the amount of urine.\n\n【36】This drug may make you dizzy or drowsy. Alcohol or marijuana ( cannabis ) can make you more dizzy or drowsy. Do not drive, use machinery, or do anything that needs alertness until you can do it safely. Limit alcoholic beverages. Talk to your doctor if you are using marijuana (cannabis).\n\n【37】This medicine may cause stomach bleeding. Daily use of alcohol and tobacco , especially when combined with this medicine, may increase your risk for stomach bleeding. Limit alcohol and stop smoking . Consult your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n\n【38】This medication may make you more sensitive to the sun. Limit your time in the sun. Avoid tanning booths and sunlamps. Use sunscreen and wear protective clothing when outdoors. Tell your doctor right away if you get sunburned or have skin blisters /redness.\n\n【39】Before having surgery, tell your doctor or dentist about all the products you use (including prescription drugs , nonprescription drugs, and herbal products).\n\n【40】Older adults may be at greater risk for stomach/intestinal bleeding, kidney problems, heart attack, and stroke while using this drug.\n\n【41】Before using this medication, women of childbearing age should talk with their doctor(s) about the benefits and risks. Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or if you plan to become pregnant. This medication may harm an unborn baby and cause problems with normal labor/delivery. It is not recommended for use in pregnancy from 20 weeks until delivery. If your doctor decides that you need to use this medication between 20 and 30 weeks of pregnancy, you should use the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time. You should not use this medication after 30 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n【42】This medication passes into breast milk, but is unlikely to harm a nursing infant .

Examples include anti- platelet drugs such as clopidogrel , \" blood thinners \" such as dabigatran / enoxaparin / warfarin , among others.\n\n【47】Check all prescription and nonprescription medicine labels carefully since many medications contain pain relievers/fever reducers (including aspirin , NSAIDs such as celecoxib , ketorolac , or naproxen ). These drugs are similar to ibuprofen and may increase your risk of side effects if taken together. However, if your doctor has directed you to take low-dose aspirin for heart attack or stroke prevention (usually 81-162 milligrams a day), you should continue taking the aspirin unless your doctor instructs you otherwise. Daily use of ibuprofen may decrease aspirin's ability to prevent heart attack/ stroke . Talk to your doctor about using a different medication (such as acetaminophen ) to treat pain/fever. If you must take ibuprofen, talk to your doctor about taking immediate-release aspirin (not enteric \\-coated/EC) while taking ibuprofen. Take ibuprofen at least 8 hours before or at least 2 hours after your aspirin dose. Do not increase your daily dose of aspirin or change the way you take aspirin/other medications without your doctor's approval.\n\n【48】Does I-Prin interact with other drugs you are taking?\n\n【49】Enter your medication into the WebMD interaction checker\n\n【50】Check Interaction\n\n【51】Overdose\n--------\n\n【52】If someone has overdosed and has serious symptoms such as passing out or trouble breathing , call 911.

Among the conditions that produce symptoms similar to those of anxiety are hyperthyroidism or other endocrine problems, too much or too little calcium, low blood sugar, and certain heart problems. Certain medicines also can sometimes cause anxiety. A thorough evaluation by your health care provider will determine if any of these conditions are the cause of your symptoms.\n\n【2】If no other medical culprit can be found and the symptoms seem out of proportion to any situation you are facing, you may be diagnosed with an anxiety disorder.\n\n【3】What Are the Treatments for Generalized Anxiety Disorder?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n【4】**Medication for Anxiety**\n\n【5】Medication is useful for alleviating the symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder and is often prescribed in conjunction with other therapies. Some types of anxiety drugs can be habit-forming and are usually prescribed on a short-term or as-needed basis.\n\n【6】Different anxiety disorders have different medication regimens. Some are preventive and some are designed to cure the problem.\n\n【7】Antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are widely used to treat and prevent a variety of anxiety disorders. Examples of SSRIs that are commonly used to treat chronic anxiety include citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), and sertraline (Zoloft). The antidepressantsduloxetine (Cymbalta) and venlafaxine (Effexor), SNRIs (serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) which act on the brain chemicals serotonin and norepinephrine, and some of the tricyclic antidepressants like imipramine (Tofranil), may also help. Novel antidepressants such as mirtazapine (Remeron) are also prescribed at times. \n\n【8】Antihistamines (such as hydroxyzine) and beta-blockers (such as propranolol) can help mild cases of anxiety as well as performance anxiety, a type of social anxiety disorder. Antidepressants such as SSRIs or SNRIs or tricyclics need to be taken daily whether or not you have anxiety on that particular day, as prescribed by your health care provider. Antihistamines or beta-blockers are usually taken only when needed for anxiety, or immediately before an anxiety-provoking event (for example, taking propranolol shortly before giving a speech). Finally, certain anticonvulsant medicines, such as gabapentin (Neurontin) and pregabalin (Lyrica), are also beginning to show value in treating some forms of anxiety in initial research studies\n\n【9】If you have acute anxiety (panic attack), you will likely need to take an anti-anxiety medicine as well. The most prominent of anti-anxiety drugs for the purpose of immediate relief are those known as benzodiazepines; among them are alprazolam (Xanax), clonazepam (Klonopin), chlordiazepoxide (Librium), diazepam (Valium), and lorazepam (Ativan). They have drawbacks: Benzodiazepines sometimes cause drowsiness, irritability, dizziness, memory and attention problems, and physical dependence. Nonetheless, in recent decades they have largely replaced barbiturates because they tend to be safer if taken in large doses.\n\n【10】Another anti-anxiety drug is buspirone (Buspar). It has fewer side effects than benzodiazepines and is not associated with dependence. Buspar, however, can have its own side effects and may not always be as effective when a person has taken benzodiazepines in the past.\n\n【11】**Therapy for Anxiety**\n\n【12】Psychotherapy, with or without medication, is often considered a fundamental aspect of treatment for generalized anxiety disorder.\n\n【13】Several specific forms of psychotherapy have been described in research studies as helpful for alleviating the symptoms of GAD. Two -- psychodynamic psychotherapy and supportive-expressive therapy -- focus on anxiety as an outgrowth of feelings about important relationships. Another form of psychotherapy, called cognitive-behavioral therapy, involves learning behavioral relaxation techniques as well as restructuring patterns of thinking that foster anxiety.\n\n【14】Biofeedback is another helpful tool. In a series of sessions with a therapist, you watch your own brain-wave patterns on an electroencephalograph and gradually learn to control the waves. This teaches you to achieve a more relaxed state at will. Practitioners estimate that after about a dozen sessions, you will be able to exert control over mental activity without the help of the therapist or monitoring instrument.\n\n【15】**Lifestyle Modifications to Alleviate Anxiety**\n\n【16】Daily exercise can be another helpful treatment for anxiety symptoms. If you find that exercise works for you, push yourself to go for brisk walks or undertake an active sport that you enjoy. Get your heart rate into the target range for your age for at least 30 minutes each time you exercise.\n\n【17】Since anxiety is often accompanied by shallow breathing, deep breathing exercises can also be helpful. Try the following form of yoga breathing:\n\n【18】*   Lie on your back in a comfortable place.\n*   Breathe in slowly through your nose, using your diaphragm to suck air into your lungs while allowing your abdomen to expand. (Put your hand on your abdomen just below the navel to make sure the abdomen is being pushed up and out by the diaphragm.) After the abdomen is expanded, continue to inhale as deeply as possible.\n*   When you breathe out, reverse the process: Contract the abdomen while exhaling slowly and completely.\n*   Repeat several times.\n\n【19】Progressive relaxation is another helpful technique. It begins by tensing and then relaxing one part of the body, usually beginning with the toes. When this part of the body is relaxed, another part of the body is tensed and relaxed until the entire body is free of tension.\n\n【20】Relaxing visualization can also help. A therapist or meditation trainer suggests relaxing images for a person to hold in mind. Once the image is in place, the person imagines soothing sensations such as pleasant scents and sounds. Eventually, people can learn to do this themselves when they anticipate -- or find themselves in -- stressful situations.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "webmd", "batch_name": "20230818", "version": "version0"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/08/21 11:10:54", "endTime": "2024/08/21 11:11:08", "cost": 13.226}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-08-19 23:05:01", "update_time": "2024-08-20 19:11:07", "grab_time": "2024-08-20 19:10:53"}

A stroke, sometimes called a \"brain attack,\" occurs when blood flow to an area in the brain is cut off. The brain cells, deprived of the oxygen and glucose needed to survive, die. If a stroke is not caught early, permanent brain damage or death can result.\n\n【1】How Does a Stroke Occur?\n------------------------\n\n【2】There are two types of stroke.\n\n【3】*   **Ischemic stroke** is similar to a heart attack, except it occurs in the blood vessels of the brain. Clots can form in the brain's blood vessels, in blood vessels leading to the brain, or even in blood vessels elsewhere in the body and then travel to the brain. These clots block blood flow to the brain's cells. Ischemic stroke can also occur when too much plaque (fatty deposits and cholesterol) clogs the brain's blood vessels. About 80% of all strokes are ischemic.\n*   **Hemorrhagic (heh-more-raj-ik) strokes** occur when a blood vessel in the brain breaks or ruptures. The result is blood seeping into the brain tissue, causing damage to brain cells. The most common causes of hemorrhagic stroke are high blood pressure and brain aneurysms. An aneurysm is a weakness or thinness in the blood vessel wall.\n\n【4】What Are the Symptoms of Stroke?\n--------------------------------\n\n【5】The most common symptoms of a stroke are:\n\n【6】*   Weakness or numbness of the face, arm, or leg on one side of the body\n*   Loss of vision or dimming (like a curtain falling) in one or both eyes\n*   Loss of speech, difficulty talking, or understanding what others are saying\n*   Sudden, severe headache with no known cause\n*   Loss of balance or unstable walking, usually combined with another symptom\n\n【7】What Should I Do If I Experience Stroke Symptoms?\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n【8】Immediately call 911 if you or someone you know has symptoms of a stroke. Stroke is a medical emergency. Immediate treatment can save your life or increase your chances of a full recovery.\n\n【9】Is it Possible to Prevent a Stroke?\n-----------------------------------\n\n【10】Up to 50% of all strokes are preventable. Many risk factors can be controlled before they cause problems.\n\n【11】**Controllable Risk Factors for Stroke:**\n\n【12】*   High blood pressure\n*   Atrial fibrillation\n*   Uncontrolled diabetes\n*   High cholesterol\n*   Smoking\n*   Excessive alcohol intake\n*   Obesity\n*   Carotid or coronary artery disease\n\n【13】**Uncontrollable Risk Factors for Stroke:**\n\n【14】*   Age (>65)\n*   Gender (Men have more strokes, but women have deadlier strokes)\n*   Race (African-Americans are at increased risk)\n*   Family history of stroke\n\n【15】Your doctor can evaluate your risk for stroke and help you control your risk factors. Sometimes, people experience warning signs before a stroke occurs.\n\n【16】These are called transient ischemic attacks (also called TIA or \"mini-stroke\") and are short, brief episodes of the stroke symptoms listed above. Some people have no symptoms warning them prior to a stroke or symptoms are so mild they are not noticeable. Regular check-ups are important in catching problems before they become serious.
