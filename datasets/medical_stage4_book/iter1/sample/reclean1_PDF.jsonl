Homunkulus， vicudun farkli noktalarinin beyin yuzeyinde nasil haritalandigini， sanateinin mizahi bir yolla tarifidir. Cok komik sekilde deforme edilmis ozellikler， dudaklar ve dil gibi belli vucut kisimlarinin asiri temsil edildigini gostermeye yonelik bir gabadir.\n【save__datas】\t【28】\tSekil 1.1 Penfield homunkulusunun -beyindeki adamcigin- iicboyutlu garip bir modeli， viicudun boliimlerini temsil ediyor. Agzin ellerin ne kadar biiyiik cizildigine dikkat edin.\n【save__datas】\t【29】\tBu harita， gereek insan beyninden elde edilen bilgiyle cizilmistir. 1940'lar ve 1950'ler suresince， Kanadali harika beyin cerrahi Wilder Penfield， lokal anestezi altindaki hastalarla etrafli beyin ameliyatlari gerceklestirdi (bir sinir dokusu kutlesi olmasina ragmen， beyinde agri reseptoru yoktur). Cogunlukla ameliyat sirasinda beynin buyuk bolumi aciktaydi ve Penfield daha once hie denenmemis deneyleri yapma firsati yakaladi. Hastalarin beyinlerinin belirli bolgelerini bir elektrot yardimiyla uyardi ve ne hissettiklerini sordu. Elektrot sayesinde her tūr duyu， goruntu， hatta ani ortaya gikti ve bunlardan sorumlu beyin bolgeleri haritalandirildi.\n【save__datas】\t【30】\tOrnegin，eeger maymunun somatoduyusalkorteksine bir elektrottyerlestirir vVe maymunun belirli bir vucut bolgesine dokunursaniz， hucrede sinyal ateslenecektir. Her hucrenin vucut yuzeyinde yanit verdigi kendi alan -kendi kuguk deri yamasi- vardir. Biz buna hucrenin reseptif alani diyoruz. Beyinde tum vicut yuzeyinin bir haritasi bulunur； vucudun her yaris1 beynin diger tarafinda haritalanmistir.\n【save__datas】\t【31】\tBeynin duyusal alanlarinin ayrintili islevi ve yapisi incelemek icin hayvanlar makul deneklerdir， ama bir sorun var： Onlar konusamaz， yani Penfield’in hastalari gibi， nIe hissettiklerini arastirmaciya soyleyemezler. Sonueta bu tur deneylerde hayvanlar kullanilirken is in buyuk ve ōnemli bir boyutu ele alinamamaktadir.\n【save__datas】\t【32】\tBu ayikar kisitliliga ragmen， dogru deneyler sayesinde bireok sey ogrenilebilir. Ornegin， dikkat ettigimiz gibi， onemli bir soru“insan dogasi mi yetistirme mi” meselesiyle iliskilidir：Beyin yuzeyindeki bu vucut haritalari sabit mi， yoksa dogduktan sonra cocukluktan delikanliliktan gecip ileri yaslarimiza ulasirken edinilen deneyimlerle degisebilir mi? Ayrica bu haritalar dogumdan itibaren beyinde varsa， erigkinlikte ne oleuye kadar ayarlama yapilabilir?\n【save__datas】\t【33】\tTim Pons ve arkadaylarini arastirmaya baslamak igin harekete gegiren bu sorulardi. Stratejileri dorsal (duyusal) rizotomi -koldan gelen duyusal bilgiyi omurilige tasiyan tum sinir liflerinin kesilmesi islemi- yapilan maymunlarda beyin sinyallerini kaydetmekti. Ameliyattan11 yil sonra， hayvanlari anesteziye aldilar， kafataslarini actilar ve somatoduyusal haritadan kayitlar yaptilar. Maymunun feleli kolu beyine sinyaller gondermedigi igin， maymunun kullanilmayan koluna dokundugunuzda herhangi bir sinyal kaydetmeyi ve beynin “al alani\"ndan kayit yapmayi beklemezsiniz. Feleten etkilenen el ile iliykili buyuk bir sessiz korteks bolgesi olmalidir.\n【save__datas】\t【34】\tGereekten de arastirmacilar kullanilmayan ele vurduklarinda bu bolgede bir etkinlik gorulmedi. Fakat sasirtici olan maymunun yuzine dokunduklarinda beyinde “olu”el bolgesine denk gelen hucreler (yuz bolgesiyle iliskili olan hucrelerle birlikte， ki bunlarin zaten ateslemesi beklenir) guelu bir bicimde sinyal ateslemeye basladilar. Maymunun yūzinden gelen duyusal bilginin kortekste sadece yuz alanina gitmedigi， ayni zamanda feleli elin alanini da isgal ettigi goruldu!\n【save__datas】\t【35】\tBu bulgunun anlami ook sasirticidir： Haritayi degistirebileceginiz anlamina gelir； eriskin bir hayvanin beyin devrelerini degistirebileceginiz ve bir santimetre veya daha uzaga giden baglantilarda ayarlama yapabileceginiz anlamina gelir.\n【save__datas】\t【36】\tVucudunun hangi bolgesine dokunuldugunu gostermesiniibbir yana birakin， bir maymunu cok basit bir gorev icin bile egitmek yillar alir. Bu durumda maymun kullanmanin gerekli olmadigin dusúndum. Kolunu kaybetmis bir hastanin yuzine dokunarak ayni soruyu neden yanitlamayalim?\n【save__datas】\t【37】\tSteve Macken， kolunu kaybetmesine yol acan korkutucu olaylari daha dūn gibi hatirliyor. Karsi seritte bir arac hemen onunde yoldan ciktiginda， futbol antrenmanindan eve donuyordu， yorgundu ve idman nedeniyle acikmisti. Frenler aci aci ottu. Arabasi donerek kontrolden cikarken Steve de surucu koltugundan cevre yolunun kenarindaki buz giceklerinin uzerine firladi. Steve havaya firladiginda geri donup baktiginda -Freddy Krueger filmlerinden bir sahneymis gibi- vucudundan kopmus olan elinin hala arabanin iginde oldugunu gormustu\n【save__datas】\t【38】\tBu tuyler urpertici kazanin sonucunda， Steve sol kolunu dirsegin hemen uzerinden kaybetti. On yedi yasindaydi ve liseyi bitirmesine sadece ug ay kalmisti.\n【save__datas】\t【39】\tSonraki haftalarda， kolunu kaybettigini bilmesine ragmen， dirseginin altinda kolunun hayaletvari varligini hala hissedebiliyordu. Her bir “parmagini”hareket ettirebiliyor， kolunun uzanabilecegi yerdeki nesnelere“uzanabiliyor”ve onlari“yakalayabiliyordu”. Aslinda hayalet kolu， darbeleri savusturmak， dusen nesneleri yakalamak， kuguk kardesinin sirtini sivazlamak gibi gercek kolunun otomatik olarak yapabilecegi her seyi yapabilir gibiydi. Steve solak oldugu igin， telefon caldiginda elinin hayaleti ahizeye uzanabiliyordu.\n【save__datas】\t【40】\tSteve cildirmamisti. Kaybettigi kolunun hala varligini hissetmesi klasik bir hayalet uzuv-uzun zaman once kazada kaybedilen veya ameliyatla alinan kol ya da bacagin hastanin zihninden suresiz olarak gikmamasi- ornegidir. Bazilari anesteziden uyanir ve kollarinin feda edilmek zorunda kalindigi sōylendiginde， buna kuskuyla bakarlar， cunku gok anli bigimde hala varligini hissediyorlardir. Sadece ortunun altina baktiklarinda uzuvlarinin gercekten gittigini fark ederler. Bunun da otesinde， bazi hastalar hayalet kollari， elleri veya parmaklarinda muthis bir agri hisseder， oyle ki intihari bile dusinurler. Bu agri sadece aman vermez degil， tedavi edilemez bir agridir； nasil olustugu ve ustesinden nasil gelinecegine dair kimsenin azicik bile olsa fikri yoktur.\n【save__datas】\t【41】\tHayalet uzuv agrisinin ciddi bir klinik sorun olusturdugunun farkindayim. Eklem iltihabi agrisi ya da bel agrisi gibi gereek bir vucut parcasinin kronik agrisinin tedavisi yeterince zordur， fakat olmayan bir uzvun agrisin nasil tedavi edersiniz? Bir bilimci olarak， ilk etapta bu\n【save__datas】\t【42】\t1 Makale boyunca kullanilan hasta isimleri asil kisi/kisilere ait degildir.--connect--【43】fenomenin neden ortaya ciktigini da merak ediyordum. Neden bir kol， alindiktan sonra hastanin zihninde uzun sure kalmaktadir? Akil neden uzvun kaybedildigini kabul ederek vicut imgesi“yeniden sekillendirmez\"? Bu fenomenin incelenmesinin， beynin ani ve devasa kayiplarla nasil basa giktigini anlamamiza yardimci olmanin yani sira kalitim mi yoksa cevre mi gibi daha temel bir tartismayi -zihnimizin diger yōnleri gibi vicut imgesinin de ne olcuye kadar genlerle belirlendigi ve ne olcuye kadar deneyimlerle duzenlendigi meselesine de- iik tutacagini fark ettim.\n【save__datas】\t【44】\tBeth Brieter， caresiz durumdaydi.“Doktor，”dedi， “bana yardim edebileceginizi umit ediyorum.\"Kayip koluna dogru bakti.“On yil once kaybettim. Fakat o zamandan beri hayalet dirsegim， bilegim ve parmaklarimda korkung agrilar var” Ilerleyen sohbetimizde bu on yil boyunca Beth'in hayalet kolunu hie oynatamadigini kesfettim. Her zaman tuhaf bir konumda sabit duruyordu. Beth ogrenilmis feleten mi mustaripti? Eger oyleyse， bizim sanal gerceklik kutusunu kullanarak hayalet uzvunu canlandirip yeniden hareket kazandirabilir miydik?\n【save__datas】\t【45】\tBeth’ten sag elini kutudaki aynanin sag tarafina yerlestirmesini ve sol elinin (hayalet elinin) de sol tarafta oldugunu hayal etmesini istedim.“Sag ve sol kollarini ayni anda hareket ettirmeni istiyorum”diye talimat verdim.\n【save__datas】\t【46】\t“Bunu yapamam”dedi Beth. “Sag kolumu hareket ettirebiliyorum fakat sol kolum hareketsiz. Her sabah uyandigimda， hayalet kolumu hareket ettirmeye calisiyorum， cunku komik bir konumda kalakaldi ve hareket etmesinin agriyi azaltacagini hissediyorum. Fakat”dedi， gorunmez koluna bakarak， “kucuk bir hareket kivilcimi bile olusturamadim.”\n【save__datas】\t【47】\t“Tamam， Beth， fakat yine de denemelisin”\n【save__datas】\t【48】\tBeth vucudunu dondurdu， omzunu kaydirarak cansiz hayalet kolunu kutunun icine“yerlestirdi”. Sonra sag elini aynanin diger tarafina koydu ve senkron hareketler yapmaya ealisti. Aynaya baktiginda once nefesini tuttu ve artindan “Tanrim! Tanrim， doktor! Bu inanilmaz. Akillara durgunluk verici!\" diye ciglik atti. Bir cocuk gibi hoplayip zipliyordu.“Sol kolum yeniden yerinde. Sanki geemisteki gibiyim. Bunca yil sonra tum bu anilarim tekrar hizla canlaniyor. Kolumu tekrar hareket ettirebiliyorum. Dirsegimi， bilegimi tekrar oynatabiliyorum. Her yeri hareket ediyor.”\n【save__datas】\t【49】\tBiraz sakinlestikten sonra “Pekala Steve simdi gozlerini kapat\"dedim.\n【save__datas】\t【50】\t“Tanrim!”Acikcasi hayal kirikligina ugramiti.“Yeniden dondu. Sag elimin hareketini hissediyorum， fakat hayalet kolum hareketsiz.”\n【save__datas】\t【51】\t“Gozlerini ag.”\n【save__datas】\t【52】\t“Oh， evet. Simdi tekrar hareket ediyor.”\n【save__datas】\t【53】\tSanki Steve'in hayalet uzvunu hareket ettiren sinir devrelerinde gegici bir bastirma veya engellenme vardi ve gorsel geribildirim bu engellemeyi ortadan kaldirmisti. Daha da ilging olani， onceki on yil boyunca hie hissedilmemis olmasina ragmen， kol hareketine dair bu bedensel duyulari aninda canlanmisti.\n【save__datas】\t【54】\tSteve'in tepkisi heyecan vericiydi ve ogrenilmis felele ilgili hipotezim icin destekleyici bilgi sagliyordu， ama o gece eve gittigimde kendi kendime sordum： “Eee， simdi ne oldu? Bu adamin hayalet uzyunu tekrar hareket ettirdik， fakat biraz dusinunce tamamen yararsiz bir beceri； bazen biz tip arastirmacilarinin uzerinde calismakla suclandigi gizli sakli bir seye benziyor.” Bir kisinin hayalett uuzvunuhareket ettirmesini sagladigim igin bir odul kazanamayacagimi fark ettim.\n【save__datas】\t【55】\tFakat ogrenilmis fele belki de daha yaygin bir olaydir. Gereek uzuvlari feleli kisilerde de， ornegin inme sonrasi oluyordur belki. Insanlar inme sonrasi neden kollarinin kullanimini kaybediyorlar? Beyni besleyen bir damar tikandiginda， beynin on bolumūnden omurilige uzanan lifler oksijensiz kalip zedelenir ve kol fele olur. Fakat inmenin erken donemlerinde， beyin siser ve gecici olarak bazi sinirlerin olmesine， bazilarinin da afallayip iletis imi kesmesine\n【save__datas】\t【56】\t2Sonra Steve'e her iki elinin isaret parmagi ile basparmagini oynatmasini ve eszamanli olarak aynaya bakmasini--connect--【57】istedim， fakat bu kez hayalet bas ve isaret parmaklari felcli kaldilar， canlanmadilar. Bu onemli bir gozlemdi；cunki--connect--【58】daha onceki sonuclarin sadece deney ortamindan kaynaklanan hatali ve uydurma bir sonucu olma olasiligini dislamakta.Eger uydurma olsaydi， neden tum eli ve dirsegini oynatirken parmaklarini tek tek oynatamasin.3Ogrenilmis felc kavrami cok kiskirticidir ve feleli hayalet uzuvlari tedavi etmenin otesinde anlamlari olabilir. Ornek olarak， yazar krampini ele alalim (fokal distoni). Hasta， parmaklarini oynatabilir， burnunu kasiyabilir veya sorunsuz bir bicimde kravatini baglayabilir， fakat nedense eliyle yazi yazamaz. Bu durumu aciklamaya yonelik kuramlar arasinda kas kramplarindan tutun da\"histerik felce”kadar bir suru gōrus var. Fakat bu da bir tur--connect--【59】ogrenilmis felc ornegi olabilir mi? Oyle ise ayna kullanmak gibi basit bir hile bu hastalarda kullanila bilir mi? Ayni--connect--【60】sav， aleni felc ile uzvun hareket ettirilmesine isteksizlik -bir tur zihinsel engel-arasinda uzanan diger sendromlara da uygulanabilir mi? ideomotor apraksi -huner gerektiren hareketleri emirle yapamama {hasta bagimsiz olarak mektup yazabilir， fakat yapmasi istenildiginde cayin sekerini karistiramaz veya gile gile demek icin elini sallayamaz)-feleli hayalet uzvun ogrenilmesi anlaminda kesinlikle “ogrenilmemistir\". Fakat bir tur gecici sinirse engellemeye bagli olabilir? Oyle ise， gorsel geribildirim bu engeli asmaya yardimci olur mu? Son olarak da Parkinson hastaligi var； kaskati kesilme， siddetli titreme ve yuz de dahil {maske benzeri ifade) tum beder hareketlerinde azalma (akinezi) gorulur. Bu hastaligin erken doneminde， kaskati kesilme ve titreme sadece bir ell etkiler， dolayisiyla saglam elin yansimasi kullanilarak ayna teknigi denenebilir. Gorsel geribildirimin Parkinson hastaligini etkiledigi bilindigi icin (ornegin， hasta normalde yuruyemez， ama zeminde siyah beyaz kareler varsa yuruyebilir)， belki de ayna teknigi onlara da yardimci olabilir.--connect--【61】neden olur. Kolun islevsiz kaldigi bu sure boyunca beyin su geribildirimi alir：“Hayir， kol hareket etmiyor.”Sisme azaldigindaysa， hastanin iyilesmeyip beyninin bir tur ogrenilmis felce saplanip kalmasi mumkundur. Ayna duzenegi， felcin en azindan ogrenmeye bagli olan bu kismini yenmeye yardimci olabilir mi? (Ama sinir liflerinin gercekten yok olmasindan kaynaklanan felci duzeltmek icin， kimse aynalarla bir sey yapamaz.)\n【save__datas】\t【62】\tAyna teknigi ile feleli bir insanin beynini kandirmak bu bulgulara gore mumkun oluyor.“Hayalet uzvun felci ile kismen feleli biri igin gegerli midir?” sorusuna ise yōyle cevap verebiliriz： Beynin hayalet uzuv diye nitelendirdigimiz amputasyon sonrasi varligina inanilan uzuv beyin igin hala orada demektir. Yani beyin hayalet uzuv ile gereek uzvu ayni olarak ele aliyor. Bu da feleli hayalet uzuv ve kismen feleli uzuvlar igin beyni kandirmanin ayni olcumde oldugunu gosteriyor. Kismen feleli bir hastayi aynanin karsisina getirdigimizde eszamanli hareketler ettirirsek beyin bunu “Feleli taraf hareket ediyor”olarak algilayacaktir. Yani gorsel geribildirim alacak ve “Hayir， bu kisim hareket etmiyor\"telkinini geride birakacaktir. Peki， gunumuzde feleli hastalarda ayna tedavisi uygulanmasina ragmen neden Beth’inki gibi erken cevaplar alamiyoruz. Kim bilir belki de aynada bir sorun vardir. Cozum onerimiz var， fakat bunu daha detayli arastirmalardan sonra belgelendirmek， hastanin aksi bir durumla -hayal kirikligi- karsilasmamasi igin cabamizdir.\n【save__datas】\t【63】\tSimdi tum bunlarin ne anlama geldigini bir dusunūn. Tum bu hayatiniz boyunca“benliginiz\"in en azindan olume dek ayni kalan ve dengeli tek bir bedene demirlenmis oldugunu varsayarak etrafta dolandiniz.

Mom &Dad -you are my true inspiration. Thank you for helping me get through the most difficult phase of my life.

Dr. Smith， your advice on both research and the contents of this book are invaluable.\n【cont_pre_fil】\t【22】\tSpecial thanks go out to all my friends for supporting me and encouraging me throughout this writing experience.\n【len<10_filter】\t【23】\tPreface\n【cont_pre_fil】\t【24】\tI have always been a firm believer that every human being is put on this Earth to fulfill his or her destiny and contribute to society in his or her own way. While there will always be certain obstacles that momentarily prevent us from achieving greatness， with dedication and commitment， we can always emerge victorious in the end.\n【cont_pre_fil】\t【25】\tMy life has been no different， filled with battles at various stages in life - one of the biggest battles being Bell's palsy. At 34， I’m having the time of my life. But having to deal with“Bell’s Palsy” wasn’t always easy. I knew I had to be strong to fit in and define my presence in this world. I wish that this book existed when I first started looking for information on Bell’s palsy. I had to scour through countless books， message boards and various other literature to find valuable information on this condition back then. That’s why I have written this book， which contains everything you need to know about Bell’s palsy， all in one place.\n【cont_pre_fil】\t【26】\tEarlier in my life， I couldn’t be bothered about how my face looked or what anyone said about me. Like every other happy-go-lucky child， I was busy having fun and looking forward to my next trip to the park.\n【cont_pre_fil】\t【27】\tUnfortunately， Bell’s palsy is a condition that you firstly can’t hide and secondly， cannot be oblivious about. A drooping face is certainly not normal for anyone to have or see. Staying in foster care didn’t help much and there was barely any improvement in my condition. I’m grateful to my parents who adopted me at 11 months and brought me home. Today， after 34 years， I don’t want to blame anyone. What would have happened had I received timely medical attention? Would this condition have gone away in a few weeks? Was there a chance of full recovery? I really don’t know the answers.\n【cont_pre_fil】\t【28】\tBut what I do know is that I'm writing this book to let people know that vast improvement， even 100% recovery is possible with the right treatment and management procedures. With great advancement in medicine and various treatment options available， you may not have to live with Bell’s palsy forever.\n【cont_pre_fil】\t【29】\tMost of the time， I don’t even think of my palsy as a disadvantage because it taught me to exhibit other strengths of mine. However， my journey wasn’t the smoothest. My insecurities were real. The issue was that I had a huge adjustment to make. What I saw in the mirror was a person with an unusual smile. I was--connect--【30】worried when I stepped outside to meet new people. I felt uncomfortable， and， therefore， avoided getting photographs taken since I had trouble controlling my facial expressions.\n【cont_pre_fil】\t【31】\tIt might seem bizarre to you， but not all people want to befriend a person with a collapsed face. The impact Bell’s palsy has on a person’s self-confidence， and self-esteem is undoubtedly devastating. With this condition， you always stand out from the crowd， and many people don’t fully understand it， which is why they may try to avoid it or you altogether.\n【cont_pre_fil】\t【32】\tBecause I grew up with the condition， I want others with the same ailment to know that there is light at the end of the tunnel. There is no need to feel isolated because I’ll teach you how to cope with Bell’s palsy， from understanding the condition， to managing and treating it， and knowing how to act and react around others.\n【save__datas】\t【33】\tDon’t be saddened by any negative comments thrown your way. Remember， you can still stand strong without the validation of others. It is comforting to know that people who suffer from Bell’s palsy can completelyrecover from the condition. This means they can fully control their facial expressions again. However， there’s a lot to learn about this ailment before making an effort to cure it or deal with it. So let’s get going and develop a clearer picture about the causes， symptoms， treatment and management of Bell's palsy.\n【len<10_filter】\t【34】\tContents\n【len<10_filter】\t【35】\tPreface\n【cont_filter】\t【36】\tChapter One： Introduction\n【cont_filter】\t【37】\tWhat Do We Know about Bell’s Palsy?\n【cont_filter】\t【38】\tIs There a Difference between Facial Paralysis and Bell's Palsy?\n【cont_filter】\t【39】\tWhat Really Happens?\n【cont_filter】\t【40】\tThe Muscles Used for Facial Expressions\n【cont_filter】\t【42】\tPrognosis and Chances of Recovery\n【cont_filter】\t【43】\tWhat about Recurrence?\n【cont_filter】\t【44】\tLiving with the Condition：\n【cont_filter】\t【45】\tFacing the Camera\n【cont_filter】\t【46】\tList of celebrities with Facial palsy\n【cont_filter】\t【47】\tChapter Two： Causes， Symptoms and Diagnosis\n【cont_filter】\t【48】\tAnatomy of the 7th Cranial Nerve\n【cont_filter】\t【49】\tWhat are the Known Causes?\n【cont_filter】\t【50】\tHow Do Your Facial Nerves Work?\n【cont_filter】\t【51】\tSymptoms of Bell's Palsy\n【cont_filter】\t【52】\tHow Does Bell's Palsy Affect Facial Muscle Function?\n【cont_filter】\t【53】\tDiagnosis\n【cont_filter】\t【54】\tConditions that Need to Be Ruled Out\n【cont_filter】\t【55】\tPhysical Evaluation\n【cont_filter】\t【56】\tFrequently Asked Questions\n【cont_filter】\t【57】\tChapter Three： Kid's Health and Facial Palsy\n【cont_filter】\t【58】\tBell's Palsy Causes in Children\n【cont_filter】\t【59】\tSymptoms of Bell's Palsy in Children\n【cont_filter】\t【60】\tHow to Help People with Bell's Palsy\n【cont_filter】\t【61】\tChapter Four： Bell's Palsy during Pregnancy\n【cont_filter】\t【62】\tTreating Bell's Palsy during Pregnancy\n【cont_filter】\t【63】\tHow Long Will It Take for the Symptoms to Go Away Completely?\n【cont_filter】\t【64】\tCan My Baby Be Affected during Delivery?\n【cont_filter】\t【65】\tIs Bell's Palsy Hereditary?\n【cont_filter】\t【66】\tChapter Five： Complications and Myths about Bell's Palsy\n【cont_filter】\t【67】\tClearing Myths about Bell's Palsy\n【cont_filter】\t【68】\tFacial Palsy and Synkinesis\n【cont_filter】\t【69】\tSynkinesis： Basics You Need to Know\n【cont_filter】\t【70】\tThe Look and Feel\n【cont_filter】\t【71】\tWhat are the Common Symptoms of Synkinesis?\n【cont_filter】\t【72】\tCan You Predict Svnkinesis?\n【cont_filter】\t【73】\tWhat Are Your Treatment Options?\n【cont_filter】\t【74】\tChapter Six： Treating Bell's Palsy -Non-Surgical Options\n【cont_filter】\t【75】\tOral Medication\n【cont_filter】\t【76】\tAntiviral Drugs\n【cont_filter】\t【77】\tTreatment with Botulinum Toxin\n【cont_filter】\t【78】\tPhysical Therapy\n【cont_filter】\t【80】\tElectrical Stimulation\n【cont_filter】\t【81】\tBiofeedback Therapy\n【cont_filter】\t【82】\tFacial Rehabilitation\n【cont_filter】\t【83】\tB-Vitamins Therapy\n【cont_filter】\t【84】\tSpeech Therapy\n【cont_filter】\t【85】\tAlternative Treatments for Bell's Palsy\n【cont_filter】\t【86】\tChapter Seven： Correction with Surgery\n【cont_filter】\t【87】\tOculoplastic Surgery\n【cont_filter】\t【88】\tEvelid Surgery\n【cont_filter】\t【89】\tUpper Evelid Surgery\n【cont_filter】\t【90】\tLower Evelid Surgery\n【cont_filter】\t【91】\tEyebrow Surgery\n【cont_filter】\t【92】\tEve Care during Bell’s Palsy\n【cont_filter】\t【93】\tCosmetic Reconstructive Options to Regain Facial Muscle Function\n【cont_filter】\t【94】\tFacial Nerve Decompression\n【cont_filter】\t【95】\tHypoglossal and Facial Nerve Graft Repair\n【cont_filter】\t【96】\tChapter Eight： Bell Palsy Exercises\n【cont_filter】\t【97】\tEarly Stages of Recovery\n【cont_filter】\t【98】\tOther Exercises\n【cont_filter】\t【99】\tExercises to Assist Speech Therapy Specialized Facial Exercise Program to Improve Speech\n【cont_filter】\t【100】\tHelpful Illustrations\n【cont_filter】\t【101】\tChapter Nine： Useful Diet and Lifestyle Considerations\n【cont_filter】\t【102】\tChapter One： Introduction\n【cont_filter】\t【103】\tWhat Do We Know about BelP's Palsy?\n【cont_filter】\t【104】\tThe Science behind the Name\n【temp_cont_filter】\t【105】\tThe term Bell’s palsy comes from Sir Charles Bell， a renowned 19th century Scottish anatomist and surgeon who discovered that the condition is caused by the dysfunction of the 7th facial nerve.\n【cont_filter】\t【106】\tSir Charles Bell\n【save__datas】\t【108】\tSir Charles Bell returned to Scotland after living and working in London for almost 30 years. He ended his teaching career as a professor of surgery at the place he studied -University of Edinburgh. Bell also was an expert surgeon. In fact in 1815， he served in the British Army at the famous Battle of Waterloo. He’s also recognized for his medical illustration in neurology. The essays written by Sir Charles Bell on the anatomy of expression in painting are still considered a classic piece of art history.\n【save__datas】\t【109】\tIs There a Difference between Facial Paralysis and Bell’s Palsy?\n【save__datas】\t【110】\tPeople who lose the ability to move one side of their face are said to be victims of ‘facial paralysis.’ It is a general term and is frequently used when the facial muscles become paralyzed due to the facial nerve being injured. Facial paralysis--connect--【111】also occurs when the facial nerve suffers any kind of trauma through a stroke， infection， or tumor.\n【save__datas】\t【112】\tCredit： ‘Bell’s palsy’by James Heilman MD from Wikipedia Commons(https：//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File：Bellspalsy.JPG) under the Creative\n【save__datas】\t【113】\tCommons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported License\n【save__datas】\t【114】\tFacial paralysis is characterized by a non-symmetrical face； the person is unable to move some/all of the muscles on the affected side. Since facial muscles cannot be controlled in paralysis， routine activities such as chewing， sipping， swallowing and speaking become difficult.\n【save__datas】\t【115】\tBell’s palsy perhaps， is the most common form of facial paralysis you will come across. We will discuss the symptoms， causes， and diagnosis of Bell’s palsy in detail later in the book， but for now remember this.\n【save__datas】\t【116】\tBell's palsy patients have facial paralysis， but not everyone with facial paralysis has Bell’s palsy. A person is diagnosed with Bell’s palsy only when facial paralysis is not associated with any medical condition such as stroke， autoimmune disease， trauma or tumor.\n【save__datas】\t【117】\tWhat Really Happens?\n【save__datas】\t【118】\tThe term‘‘palsy’ in Bell’s palsy generally refers to the weakness of facial muscles. When your facial nerve stops functioning， the muscles in your face fail to receive the much-needed electrical signals to function properly. This lack of\n【save__datas】\t【119】\t‘electrical communication’results in paralysis of the affected side of the face -this may include your eyes， mouth as well as other facial muscles. What’s scary about it is the fact that this loss of facial muscle control (facial paralysis) occurs rapidly-it can even happen overnight!\n【save__datas】\t【120】\tSadly， medical research cannot predict the degree or extent of facial paralysis or muscle weakness. Quite often， only the lower half of the face is affected. At times， Bell’s palsy can affect the whole side of the face or even worse， both sides of the face can become paralyzed. Bell’s palsy on both sides of the face， however， is extremely rare. Now moving forward， let’s see what the muscles in our face can do.\n【save__datas】\t【121】\tThe Muscles Used for Facial Expressions\n【save__datas】\t【122】\tYou will be surprised with the long list of functions your facial muscles perform. The 7th cranial nerve is responsible for controlling the following muscles and their corresponding functions.\n【save__datas】\t【123】\t1\\. Occipitofrontalis muscle-raising the eyebrows\n【save__datas】\t【124】\t2\\. Zygomaticus - raises the corners of the mouth during ‘open mouth’smiling. Surprisingly， a variation in the structure of this muscle causes‘dimples.’\n【save__datas】\t【125】\t3\\. Risorius -Closed mouth smiling\n【save__datas】\t【126】\t4\\. Corrugator supercilii-frowning\n【save__datas】\t【127】\t5\\. Orbicularis oculi -closing the eyes\n【save__datas】\t【128】\t6\\. Orbicularis oris -used for closing the mouth and‘pouting’\n【save__datas】\t【129】\t7\\. Levatorlabii-lifting upper lip\n【save__datas】\t【130】\t8\\. Depressorlabii- helps pull lower lip down\n【save__datas】\t【131】\t9\\. Mentalis -helps stick bottom lip out\n【save__datas】\t【132】\t10\\. Nasalis -helps ‘wrinkle’the nose\n【save__datas】\t【134】\tBell's palsy affects 0.02% of the population. The incidence increases with age and people with certain medical conditions are simply more prone than others. The disorder has been linked to cold sores， flu-like illness， diabetes， tumors， skull and facial injuries and Lyme disease.\n【save__datas】\t【135】\tBell's palsy， as we've discussed， tends to appear suddenly out of the blue -symptoms may start appearing without even the slig htest warning. So you may go to bed with a perfectly symmetrical face and when you wake up the next morning； you may notice that your face has collapsed on one side.\n【save__datas】\t【136】\tSome people feel numbness or weakness in their facial muscles a day or two before the symptoms first appear. If you notice pain behind your ear or normal sounds seem uncomfortably loud， do get it checked immediately.\n【save__datas】\t【137】\tThe signs and symptoms of Bell’s palsy tend to reach their peak within a day or two after appearing. Most patients feel that they are having a stroke， but here’s something you need to remember. In the case of stroke， muscle weakness is also felt in other parts of the body， not just your face.\n【save__datas】\t【138】\tPrognosis and Chances of Recovery\n【save__datas】\t【139】\tThe prognosis for Bell’s palsy is generally good； however， recovery times may vary from person to person. The extent of nerve damage is what determines how SOOoIn the condition will go away. Most people start to get better within two weeks with complete recovery in about 3 to 6 months. A small number of people may take longer to recover.\n【save__datas】\t【140】\tThe National Health Service UK states that 7 out of 10 people make a complete recovery. As mentioned earlier， the time will depend on the amount of nerve damage. The remaining 3 out of 10 people are stuck with the condition in severe cases， however， the majority of cases are treatable.\n【save__datas】\t【141】\tWhat about Recurrence?\n【save__datas】\t【142】\tIn rare cases， Bell’s palsy may recur either on the same or the opposite side of the face and why it does so is another guessing game. Again， potential viruses might have an important role to play.\n【save__datas】\t【143】\tThe following is a list of infections that might cause a recurrence of Bell's palsy.\n【save__datas】\t【144】\t1\\. Cold sores\n【save__datas】\t【145】\t2\\. Genital herpes\n【save__datas】\t【146】\t3\\. Chickenpox\n【save__datas】\t【147】\t4\\. Shingles\n【save__datas】\t【148】\t5\\. Epstein-Barr syndrome\n【save__datas】\t【149】\t6\\. Cytomegalovirus infections\n【save__datas】\t【150】\t7\\. Respiratory illnesses， particularly upper respiratory tract infections\n【save__datas】\t【151】\t8\\. Rubella\n【save__datas】\t【152】\t9\\. Mumps\n【save__datas】\t【153】\t10\\. Influenza\n【save__datas】\t【154】\tThe bad news is that the herpes simplex virus， adenovirus， and herpes zoster virus cannot be eradicated from the body even after you are cured. Simply put， if you had chicken pox， measles or mumps at a young age， the virus may remain dormant for years and reactivate suddenly to cause Bell’s palsy. This， however， doesn't mean you will necessarily be affected.\n【save__datas】\t【155】\tLiving with the Condition：\n【save__datas】\t【156】\tBell’s palsy is rarely counted as a life-threatening condition， but it is certainly socially difficult to endure. The characteristic one-sided facial droop slowly worms its way into the subconscious of the sufferer and creates persistent feelings of hopelessness and being ‘socially unacceptable.’ These insidious feelings affect all kinds of interactions from personal relationships to your circle of friends and even boardroom presentations.\n【save__datas】\t【157】\tWhat makes Bell's palsy ssoo bbaafffflliinngg iiss that researchers are still tryingto determine the exact cause. Moreover， there is novaccine for prevention.\n【save__datas】\t【158】\tHowever， all is not lost since we already know that the condition can be treated.\n【save__datas】\t【159】\tI can understand the feelings of abandonment， but remember； there is hope. I never received the recommended treatment in foster care. Additionally， being bullied at school took a toll on my social life. It was a frightening time for me because I felt like an outcast with only a few friends. I had a hard time overcoming the thought that most people didn’t want to spend time with me.\n【save__datas】\t【160】\tDespite the fact that most people with Bell’s palsy are highly social and love to make new friends， they may prefer ‘staying behind closed doors’. I too felt the same way at a young age， but things are different now. The love and support of my parents helped me overcome hurdles and lead a good life. Today， facial paralysis does not stop me from being ‘myself.’\n【save__datas】\t【161】\tWho Can Be Affected?\n【save__datas】\t【162】\tBell's palsy is listed as a rare medical occurrence that only occurs in 1 in 5，000people every year. It can strike anyone； either men or women aged between 15and 45 years are more commonly affected.\n【save__datas】\t【163】\tIn the past， Bell’s palsy was simply thought to be a case of unusual appearance. Since viral infections may cause the condition， it is more likely to affect individuals with a compromised immune system.\n【save__datas】\t【164】\tBell’s palsy sadly is also rated as the most common cause of one-sided facial muscle weakness in children. However， the majority of sufferers are adults.\n【save__datas】\t【165】\tThe severity of symptoms or recovery rate doesn’t seem to vary a great deal across both genders. Neither does race nor ethnicity make a difference as far as being at risk is concerned. So the good news is that regardless of where your ancestors are from， you are not specifically more at risk to get Bell’s palsy. However， the flip side is that since the disease has no bounds， anyone can be affected by it.\n【save__datas】\t【166】\tAre You at Risk?\n【save__datas】\t【167】\tAbout 40，000 people are affected with the disorder in the United States annually. While Bell's palsy can happen at almost any age， studies have identified groups that are at higher risk for developing the condition.\n【save__datas】\t【168】\t1\\. Expecting Mothers\n【save__datas】\t【169】\tPregnant women， especially during the third trimester of pregnancy or moms who have recently given birth are at greater risk of developing Bell’s palsy. The condition however does not appear to have any effect on the developing fetus.\n【save__datas】\t【170】\t2\\. Diabetics\n【save__datas】\t【171】\tDiabetes is seen as a potential trigger for Bell’s palsy. Researchers believe that the condition is related to the damage of blood vessels caused by diabetes.\n【save__datas】\t【172】\t3\\. Patients with upper respiratory tract infections\n【save__datas】\t【173】\tPatients with URIs， Upper Respiratory Tract Infections such as cold or flu are also at greater risk of developing Bell’s palsy. The exact reason is unknown， but researchers have linked it to a weakened immune system that allows dormant viruses to attack the 7th cranial nerve.\n【save__datas】\t【174】\tList of celebrities with Facial palsy\n【save__datas】\t【175】\tGeorge Clooney\n【save__datas】\t【176】\tTwice voted the ‘Sexiest Man alive’， Oscar winning actor George Clooney suffered from Bell's palsy while he was a freshman in high school. Fortunately， he recovered from the condition within a year. However， while recalling his time with the condition； the actor described it as the worst time of his life.\n【save__datas】\t【177】\tHis schoolmates laughed at and mocked him. It was devastating as his left eye closed and he also faced difficulty eating and drinking properly. He got the nickname ‘Frankenstein’ during this period because of his face. But his experience with this condition made him stronger.\n【save__datas】\t【178】\tPierce Brosnan\n【save__datas】\t【179】\tFamous for his dapper good looks and his role in the ‘James Bond’ film franchise， the Irish actor Pierce Brosnan had to battle Bell’s palsy as well. He fell victim to the condition in 1984.\n【save__datas】\t【180】\tFacial paralysis occurred in the dressing room just before his appearance on an American show， namely the ‘Tonight Show’. He failed to close one of his eyes and felt his face go numb， but the actor recovered from the condition within a few months.\n【save__datas】\t【181】\tSylvester Stallone：\n【save__datas】\t【182】\tOne of the greatest action stars of all times and best known for portraying Rocky， Sylvester Stallone is also a sufferer of Bell’s palsy since birth. The condition was caused due to birth complications resulting in facial disfigurement and slurred speech. However， Stallone is an inspiration as he not only overcame his adversity， but also achieved greatness.\n【save__datas】\t【183】\tThe use of forceps at birth had injured his nerve， paralyzing the lower left half of his face. However， this action hero used this to his advantage and today he is distinguished for his snarling look that has become his trademark.\n【save__datas】\t【184】\tRoseanne Barr\n【save__datas】\t【185】\tThis Emmy award winning actress and acclaimed comedian was affected by Bell's palsy at the tender age of three. She describes in her autobiography that she felt as if her face had frozen. Barr's left side of her face was affected with the condition. Barr’s case was that of temporary Bell’s palsy， and she made a remarkably quick recovery.\n【len<10_filter】\t【186】\tJim Ross\n【save__datas】\t【187】\tKnown as the voice of WWE， the famous professional wrestling commentator has been fighting Bell’s palsy since 1994. It was in 1998 that Ross’s mother passed away， and the tragedy was followed by a second Bell’s palsy attack.\n【save__datas】\t【189】\tGlenda McKay\n【save__datas】\t【190】\tThis popular British actress is well known for her role in the popular UK television soap opera， Emmerdale， as ‘Rachel Hughes’. In addition to being a talented actor， Glenda McKay is also a theater artist， teacher and a qualified aerobics instructor.\n【save__datas】\t【191】\tThe Emmerdale star played her character from 1988 to 1999， and it was during the filming of this soap that she was diagnosed with Bell’s palsy.\n【save__datas】\t【192】\tAccording to McKay， the onset of the condition was sudden. Whilst she was busy filming， the actress felt that her mouth had drooped. She thought it was a stroke possibly - sadly most patients mistaken a collapsed face for a stroke. Towards the end of the shoot， McKay recalls that the symptoms became worse. She was unable to apply lipstick and other makeup.\n【save__datas】\t【193】\tIn various interviews， the actress commented that she was worried about her career ending abruptly and thought that the condition would remain with her for the rest of her life.\n【save__datas】\t【194】\tFortunately for McKay， she began to recover within a few months. Steroid medication worked well for her and helped her condition improve tremendously.\n【save__datas】\t【195】\tRick Savage\n【save__datas】\t【196】\tBrilliant bassist and member of the renowned metal band Def Leppard， Rick Savage is another celebrity who dealt with Bell’s palsy. Popularly known as‘Sav，' Rick was extremely popular among female fans largely because of his good looks. He was also called the pretty boy of this English band.\n【save__datas】\t【197】\tIn 1994， Rick Savage was diagnosed with Bell’s palsy. The condition ‘froze’one side of his face and his facial muscles weakened. According to Savage， his face felt as if it had melted. His reputation as a sex symbol received a serious blow. He resorted to various treatments including steroids， but he believes it was acupuncture that helped him recover rapidly.\n【save__datas】\t【198】\tRick Savage has managed to recover from this condition， but some symptoms are still visible. These effects can be observed clearly when he seems fatigued and weary. Rick once commented that it was difficult to not be able to do everyday things such as eat properly and not sleep without covering his eye with an eye patch. However， Rick also had to witness the tragedy that his fellow band member Rick Allen went through when he lost his arm. This helped Savage deal with his condition.\n【save__datas】\t【199】\tAlexis Denisof\n【save__datas】\t【200】\tAlexis Denisof is a famous American actor who has worked extensively in theater， television productions as wellas movies.However， he is largely recognized for his great role in ‘Buffy the Vampire Slayer’， a television series.\n【save__datas】\t【201】\tIn 1999， three weeks before the filming of ‘Angel’ Season Five， Alexis was affected by Bell’s palsy. According to Joss Whedon， who was directing the series， Denisof found it hard to speak and move the left side of his face， which was paralyzed due to the condition.\n【save__datas】\t【202】\tThe actor was concerned that he would not be able to shoot the first episode properly. However， he began to recover by that time， but considering the immobility problem with his left side， the director chose to do things differently. Most of Denisof’s shots were kept on his right side during the filming of the episode.\n【save__datas】\t【203】\tRalph Nader\n【save__datas】\t【204】\tIncluded in Time Magazine’s list of 100 Most Influential Americans in the Twentieth Century， Ralph Nader is not just a political activist. He is one of the top consumer advocates， an author and a lawyer.\n【save__datas】\t【205】\tThe reason he is included in our list is that Nader has also suffered from Bell's palsy. The 1980s were difficult for him. In 1986， he lost his older brother who died of prostate cancer. In the same phase， Ralph Nader developed this condition which adversely affected the left side of his face.\n【save__datas】\t【206】\tFor several months， Nader had to put up with half of his face being paralyzed and a droopy eyelid. Due to Bell’s palsy， he also suffered from excessive tearing and could not blink his left eye. Nader started wearing sunglasses to hide these effects， but he dealt with the condition fearlessly.\n【save__datas】\t【207】\tGraeme Garden\n【save__datas】\t【208】\tFamous British television presenter， comedian， actor and author， Graeme Garden was also diagnosed with Bell’s palsy. In December 2002， Garden felt some changes in his face. He commented that he was unable to whistle. And after that he noticed that the left side of his face started to go numb.\n【save__datas】\t【209】\tGarden， while recalling his experience with this condition commented that it became embarrassing to eat and drink. Smiling too became uncomfortable for him because it looked like a half smile rather than a full one.\n【save__datas】\t【210】\tHe also pointed out that it was tremendously difficult to articulate sounds， especially the sounds of the letter F and P. However； he managed to recover from the condition down the road.\n【save__datas】\t【211】\tJean Chretien\n【save__datas】\t【212】\tJean Chretien served as the Prime Minister of Canada from 1993-2003. Apart from his political career， he is also a renowned lawyer and author. The former Canadian Prime Minister developed Bell’s palsy at a very young age， when he was merely 12 years old. Unfortunately， that resulted in permanent paralysis of the left side of his face.\n【save__datas】\t【213】\tAlthough Bell’s palsy improves within weeks or months in most people， certain individuals might suffer from lingering effects and Chretien’s case is one example. It was never easy for a boy entering his teen years to experience a droopy and numb face. However， even after being afflicted by Bell’s palsy， Jean Chretien excelled in life and went on to become Canada's 20th Prime Minister. He is also the recipient of several prestigious awards and honors.\n【save__datas】\t【214】\tChapter Two： Causes， Symptoms and Diagnosis\n【save__datas】\t【215】\tThis particular section gives a more detailed description of the anatomy of the7th cranial nerve to help you understand the disorder.\n【save__datas】\t【216】\tAnatomy of the 7th Cranial Nerve\n【save__datas】\t【217】\tFacial muscles control the expressions of your face， from making you smile to making you frown. This is why these muscles are so important， since they help us understand each other better and decipher non-verbal cues. These muscles are controlled by the facial nerve， also known as the 7th cranial nerve.\n【save__datas】\t【218】\tThe 7th nerve branches out from the brainstem into an extremely narrow canal in your skull called the Fallopian canal. It then exits the skull at a point right behind your ear. The anatomy， as you can guess is not so simple. The 7th nerve then spreads out from behind the ear and splits into several branches to control the muscles on each side of the face.\n【save__datas】\t【219】\tWhat are the Known Causes?\n【save__datas】\t【220】\tSome viruses are thought to cause Bell's palsy but what exactly triggers the response is unknown. Studies suggest that environmental factors， trauma， stress and metabolic disorders might contribute to the reactivation of the already existing ‘dormant virus.’The nerve swells and becomes inflamed in response to the viral infection - this is one of the reasons steroids are known to reduce inflammation and swelling， and are useful in treating Bell’s palsy.\n【save__datas】\t【221】\tOther popular treatment methods include：\n【save__datas】\t【222】\t1\\. Antiviral medications to treat viral infection\n【save__datas】\t【223】\t2\\. Analgesics or painkillers to relieve pain (if present)\n【save__datas】\t【224】\t3\\. Physical therapy to stimulate the affected facial nerve Alternative treatments used include：\n【save__datas】\t【225】\t1\\. Electrical stimulation\n【save__datas】\t【226】\t2\\. Acupuncture\n【save__datas】\t【227】\t3.Vitamin B therapy\n【save__datas】\t【228】\t4\\. Biofeedback therapy\n【save__datas】\t【229】\t5\\. Facial rehabilitation\n【save__datas】\t【230】\tYour physiotherapist will also teach you a number of facial exercises that will strengthen the muscles in your face. Physical exercises have shown impressive results in improving coordination and the range of ‘facial muscle’movement.\n【save__datas】\t【231】\tWhy does a dormant virus attack that nerve in particular? This is something scientists are working day and night to try and figure out.\n【save__datas】\t【232】\tHow Do Your Facial Nerves Work?\n【save__datas】\t【233】\tEach side of your face is controlled by its own facial nerve. Simply put， if your left 7th cranial nerve is affected， the effects will be seen only on the left side of your face.\n【save__datas】\t【234】\tThe 7th cranial nerve allows you to move your forehead， close your eyelids， blink your eye， open and close your mouth and smile and frown.\n【save__datas】\t【235】\tOther important functions of the 7th cranial nerve include carrying impulses to a small muscle in your middle ear and controlling saliva and tear production. The amount of saliva you secrete and the volume at which you perceive sound is also controlled directly by the 7th cranial nerve.\n【save__datas】\t【236】\tCredit： Facial Nerve'by Maen K.

Interestingly， taste sensations in two-thirds of your tongue are also sent to the brain via the same nerve.\n【save__datas】\t【239】\tIt is estimated that the 7th cranial nerve branches into 7000 nerve fibers to control a wide range of facial muscle and neck activity. As mentioned earlier， a healthy facial nerve is responsible for maintaining healthy facial muscles.\n【save__datas】\t【240】\tSymptoms of Bell's Palsy\n【save__datas】\t【241】\tSince a critical controlling nerve is out of order in Bell’s palsy， the forehead smoothens and the corner of the mouth droops. The eyelid does not close on the affected side， and eye irritation often results from continuous exposure to air and external elements. Patients also complain of food and saliva spilling from the affected corner of the mouth.\n【save__datas】\t【242】\tThe characteristic drooping of the mouth is upsetting since it makes your face look ‘different’. Along with facialparalysis， Bell’s palsy patientsmay experience a loss of taste on the affected side. Some patients also report hearing sounds louder than usual， and this is often accompanied with pain in the ear area.\n【save__datas】\t【243】\tHow Does Bell's Palsy Affect Facial Muscle Function?\n【save__datas】\t【244】\tThe symptoms can vary greatly among different patients， but here is a quick overview of what may happen.\n【len<10_filter】\t【245】\tForehead\n【save__datas】\t【246】\tYou may lose the ability to wrinkle your forehead and frown\n【save__datas】\t【247】\tEffects on the Eyes include：\n【save__datas】\t【248】\t1\\.

What’s even more surprising is that people are diagnosed with the condition after the doctor is unable to figure out what caused facial paralysis in the first place.\n【save__datas】\t【280】\tMedical expert’s suspect that viral infections such as those caused by the herpes virus lead to the swelling of the 7th cranial nerve. This inflammation and swelling of the 7th nerve disrupts the signals sent from and to facial muscles.\n【save__datas】\t【281】\tOther factorssuch as herpes zoster virus (responsible for chickenpox)， mononucleosis (Epstein-Barr syndrome)， emotional stress and environmental factors can cause inflammation of the facial nerve， therefore， they are also listed as potential causes.\n【save__datas】\t【282】\tStress and lack of sleep have been linked to the reactivation of the herpes virus. Prolonged stress or emotional trauma can also weaken the immune system， which gives the herpes virus a chance to grow stronger and infect the nerve.\n【save__datas】\t【283】\tThere are different types of herpes viruses that can cause irritation and swelling of the facial nerve. These include the herpes simplex virus (HSV)， including herpes type 1， which causes cold sores， herpes type 2 which causes genital herpes and varicella-zoster virus， which causes chickenpox and shingles.\n【save__datas】\t【284】\tThe Herpes family or Herpes viruses share some common characteristics. They have a long life， and perhaps the most dangerous trait is going into a dormant phase. Shockingly， the herpes viruses can remain dormant for decades after the initial infection. The reason 60-70% of Bell’s palsy cases show signs of herpes infection is that the viruses have a special affinity for nerve tissue.\n【save__datas】\t【285】\tSimply put， you might not be aware that the herpes virus is present inside your body.\n【save__datas】\t【286】\tHSV-1 in particular is a virus several people have been exposed to. It can easily spread through kissing or sharing utensils and towels. Medical researchers are--connect--【287】amazed by the diversity of infections herpes viruses cause. You will be surprised to know that chickenpox， cold sores and sexually transmitted diseases are all caused by Herpes viruses.\n【save__datas】\t【288】\tDiagnosis\n【save__datas】\t【289】\tWhile Bell’s palsy is believed to be caused by the inflammation of the facial nerve， other conditions can produce facial paralysis identical to what you observe in a sudden Bell's palsy attack.\n【save__datas】\t【290】\tYou should visit the nearest hospital or call an ambulance immediately if you or someone around you develops facial paralysis. Studies have shown that Bell’s palsy can be managed more effectively if the treatment is started within 72 hours of the development of the first symptoms.\n【save__datas】\t【291】\tThe doctor will ask you in detail about your medical history and perform a thorough examination to determine the cause. Usually， the questions and diagnostic tests help doctors rule out the possibility of other conditions that can cause facial paralysis.\n【save__datas】\t【292】\tConditions that Need to Be Ruled Out\n【save__datas】\t【293】\tSeveral other conditions， as mentioned earlier， also result in facial paralysis. This is the most striking characteristic of Bell’s palsy. Your doctor will recommend a series of tests and look for any evidence that might confirm that your symptoms point towards Bell's palsy.\n【save__datas】\t【294】\tHere are some medical conditions that might cause facial nerve paralysis：\n【save__datas】\t【295】\t1\\. Lyme disease： a particular bacterial infection caused by ticks. Patients with Lyme disease also complain about rashes and joint pain.\n【save__datas】\t【296】\tThis disease is common in North America and Europe. Deer ticks， which feed on the blood of animals and humans， play an important part in spreading the bacteria ‘Borrelia burgdorferi’. The risk of getting infected is more if you spend a great deal of time in grassy or woody areas. You also need to be extra careful if you live in an area where Lyme disease is prevalent.\n【save__datas】\t【297】\t2\\. Moebius syndrome： a rare congenital birth defect.\n【save__datas】\t【298】\t3\\. Abnormal tissue growth or tumors.\n【save__datas】\t【299】\t4\\. Stroke.\n【save__datas】\t【300】\t5\\. Middle ear infections.\n【save__datas】\t【301】\t6\\. Cholesteatoma- unusual collection of skin cells in the middle ear.\n【save__datas】\t【302】\t7\\. Head and skull injuries.\n【save__datas】\t【303】\tPhysical Evaluation\n【save__datas】\t【304】\tYour doctor will examine your head， ears and neck closely. This physical examination will also include careful inspection of the ear canal， salivary glands and facial muscles. Your doctor will check the muscles in your face to confirm whether only the facial nerve has been affected with palsy. If there is no evidence of other medical conditions， your doctor will confirm Bell's palsy. However. testsImayberecommendedbefore starting treatment.\n【save__datas】\t【305】\tFrequently Asked Questions\n【save__datas】\t【306】\tYour doctor may ask a series of questions for further evaluation of your condition. Below are the most likely questions you can expect during your visit.\n【save__datas】\t【307】\t1\\. Are your facial muscles feeling weak?\n【save__datas】\t【308】\t2\\. Can you close your eyelids completely?\n【save__datas】\t【309】\t3\\. Do you have watery eyes?\n【save__datas】\t【310】\t4\\. Can you raise your eyebrows?\n【save__datas】\t【311】\t5\\. Do you have ear pain?

Is there any change in your sense of taste?\n【save__datas】\t【315】\t9\\. When did your symptoms develop?\n【save__datas】\t【316】\t10\\. Have you had an upper respiratorytract infection， for example， a cold recently?\n【save__datas】\t【317】\t11\\. Have you been vaccinated recently?\n【save__datas】\t【318】\tQuestions You Can Ask Your Doctor\n【save__datas】\t【319】\t1\\. Are there any other symptoms I should look out for?\n【len<10_filter】\t【320】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【321】\tWhat tests will be involved in diagnosing my condition?\n【save__datas】\t【322】\t3..

Do I need to come for a follow-up visit and if so， when?\n【save__datas】\t【329】\t10\\. Do I need to take any precautions?\n【save__datas】\t【330】\tFurther Diagnostic Testing\n【save__datas】\t【331】\tIn case your doctor is still uncertain， you may be referred to an ear， nose and throat (ENT) specialist and a neurologist for further testing. You may have to get electromyography and imaging scans to check for facial nerve damage and complications.\n【save__datas】\t【332】\tYour doctor may also suggest the following lab tests：\n【save__datas】\t【333】\t1\\. Hearing test if you have problems hearing\n【save__datas】\t【334】\t2\\. Computed tomography scan of the head if your medical history and condition show signs of a stroke or tumor\n【save__datas】\t【335】\tElectromyography\n【save__datas】\t【336】\tDuring electromyography (EMG)， a very thin needle will be inserted to pass a mild electric current through the skin and into your facial muscle. A machine called an oscilloscope then measures the electrical activity in your muscles and--connect--【337】nerves. Though the test doesn’t sound pleasant， it is not very painful. This information is useful to assess the extent of any nerve damage if present.\n【save__datas】\t【338】\tEMG measures the difference between the two action potentials generated by your facial muscles on both sides of the face. These potentials are generated in response to the stimulation of the facial nerve by the tiny electric current.\n【save__datas】\t【339】\tImaging Scans\n【save__datas】\t【340】\tImaging scans including MRIs and a CT scan of the brain may be recommended to make sure that your problem (facial paralysis) is not caused by a stroke， an infection or a tumor. The doctor usually detects other signs of stroke， infections and tumors during the physical examination. A facial CT scan may be used to rule out possibilities of facial fractures.\n【save__datas】\t【341】\tChapter Three： Kid's Health and Facial Palsy\n【save__datas】\t【342】\tAlthough Bell’s palsy is more common in adults， children and adolescents can also fall victim to it.\n【save__datas】\t【343】\tThe condition affects children in a different manner because they are often unable to understand why it has come about or how to treat it. However， children too can recover completely and quickly when given timely treatment. Sadly， a very small number of young children may suffer from the disease permanently.\n【save__datas】\t【344】\tBell's Palsy Causes in Children\n【save__datas】\t【345】\tPeople may assume that most Bell’s palsy causes are the same in children as they are in adults. However， this is not always true. Bell’s palsy in children isn’t common， but it occurs due to a variety of factors. It is believed that when the facial nerve becomes inflamed or swollen， the irritation causes Bell’s palsy. However， the specific trigger for inflammation is not established. The different reasons that may cause this condition in children and teenagers are：\n【save__datas】\t【346】\t1\\. Birth trauma：\n【save__datas】\t【347】\tInfants can fall victim to Bell’s palsy as a result of trauma during birth. This could happen due to a difficult forceps delivery in several cases.\n【save__datas】\t【348】\t2\\. Viral Infection：\n【save__datas】\t【349】\tResearch links Bell's palsy with viral infections such as herpes， which is known to cause cold sores. The herpes virus however is just one suggested trigger. Several other viruses are believed to play an important part in triggering the inflammatory response.\n【save__datas】\t【350】\t3\\. Infectious diseases：\n【save__datas】\t【351】\tLyme disease is also one of the causes of Bell’s palsy in children， especially those living in wooded areas. It is worth noting that not everyone who gets affected by these infectious diseases or infections develops Bell’s palsy. A lot of kids don’t. Therefore， washinghands should be a regular practice among--connect--【352】children so that the spread of viruses can be prevented.\n【save__datas】\t【353】\t4\\. Injury to the face：\n【save__datas】\t【354】\tAn injury or head trauma (such as skull fracture) causing damage to the facial nerve can also cause this condition in children.\n【save__datas】\t【355】\t5\\. Middle Ear Infection， Diabetes：\n【save__datas】\t【356】\tChildren who have diabetes are prone to flu and cold， and those with a compromised immune system are at a greater risk of being affected by Bell's palsy.\n【save__datas】\t【357】\t6\\. Tumor：\n【save__datas】\t【358】\tA tumor could exert pressure on the facial nerve， thereby triggering Bell’s palsy in kids. In the case of a blood clot， a stroke could also cause Bell’s palsy to develop in children.\n【save__datas】\t【359】\tSymptoms of Bell’s Palsy in Children\n【save__datas】\t【360】\tThe signs and symptoms of this condition differ from person to person and vary in severity from mild weakness to paralysis in one or both sides of the face.\n【save__datas】\t【361】\tSymptoms of Bell’s palsy show up suddenly. Sometimes， they begin gradually and could take a period of a few days or even weeks. However， it is seen that most symptoms that appear unexpectedly tend to peak in almost 48 hours.\n【save__datas】\t【362】\tIf your kid is showing any of these symptoms， contact your health practitioner without any delay.\n【save__datas】\t【363】\t1\\. Pain around the jaw\n【save__datas】\t【364】\t2\\. Stiffness or twitching on the affected side of the face\n【save__datas】\t【365】\t3.. Trouble closing the eye on the affected side\n【save__datas】\t【366】\t4\\. Difficulty smiling\n【save__datas】\t【367】\t5\\. Drooping of the corner of the mouth or eyelid\n【save__datas】\t【368】\t6\\. Trouble eating and drinking\n【save__datas】\t【369】\t7\\. Changes in the amount of tears and saliva\n【save__datas】\t【370】\t8\\. Headache\n【save__datas】\t【371】\t9\\. Trouble speaking， causing slurred speech\n【save__datas】\t【372】\t10\\. Earache. There is also hypersensitivity to sound in the affected ear\n【save__datas】\t【373】\t11\\. Numbness of the mouth\n【save__datas】\t【374】\t12\\. Strange taste sensations\n【save__datas】\t【375】\tWhat if My Child Shows These Symptoms?\n【save__datas】\t【376】\tAs mentioned earlier， seek medical attention immediately or callemergency when you notice the first symptoms.\n【save__datas】\t【377】\tAfter a medical examination， the doctor may advise therapy or medication for your child. If a kid is facing difficulty closing their eyelid， the doctor may suggest appropriate eye drops.\n【save__datas】\t【378】\tChildren with Bell’s palsy may also have difficulty speaking--connect--【379】ga--connect--【380】and trouble showing facial expressions. Make sure that the child is receiving sufficient care to cope with these issues. Look for specialist advice from related health professionals.\n【save__datas】\t【381】\tBell’s palsy has an adverse impact on the child's confidence. Young sufferers experience low self-esteem， become introverted and avoid seeing people. You could invite your child’s friends to your home. This will also help expand your child's social circle and give them more confidence to interact with others.\n【save__datas】\t【382】\tYou should remain very patient with your child who might become obsessed with his/her face， asking you repeatedly if their face shows any signs of improvement. It is vital that you explain to your child that they will most likely completely recover from Bell’s palsy within a few months.\n【save__datas】\t【383】\tRemember， be supportive and don’t let your child feel different. A child will not appreciate people feeling sorry for him/her as this will make them feel inferior.\n【save__datas】\t【384】\tSchool going children have a difficult time coping with Bell’s palsy since some children will pick on them and start teasing them about their condition. They could get bullied at school which can be a heartbreaking experience.\n【save__datas】\t【385】\tExplain to your child how to approach andanswer questions about their condition. Children can be vulnerable to bullies， so you can contact your child’s teacher and tell him or her about the condition so that they keep an eye out.\n【save__datas】\t【386】\tTeachers usually accommodate children with Bell's palsy， and they can help the affected child feel comfortable in the classroom. It is necessary to speak to the child’s school to be certain they are sensitive to the kid’s needs and differences.\n【save__datas】\t【387】\tAs parents， there are certain things you need to be careful about.\n【save__datas】\t【388】\t1\\. Kids recover quickly from Bell’s palsy. For some children， it may take only a couple of weeks to recover completely. They might experience none of the emotional suffering or pain grownups do.\n【save__datas】\t【389】\t2\\. However， some children take longer to get well and may need other treatments such as medicine， therapy， or even surgery. Hence， parents should assess the condition and ask the doctor to decide whether the child is ready to go to school or if he/she needs time to heal and take a break.\n【save__datas】\t【390】\t3\\. If a child goes to school， it is vital to inform the teacher that the child might get tired and that his/her eye needs to be protected. An eye patch is essential to prevent dirt and debris from getting into the eye. If a child wants to go swimming， you need to get some good quality swimming goggles. It is best to let your child do whatever they want， just make sure you have all your bases covered in terms of protecting them both physically and emotionally.\n【save__datas】\t【391】\t4\\. Going out in the sun is problematic for children suffering from Bell’s palsy since it’s difficult to shut the affected eye. Remind the child to wear sunglasses to protect their eye. Sunglasses are also necessary for windy days. Make sure you apply eye drops to your child's eye several times throughout the day. It is also advisable to use an eye patch while the child sleeps. This helps keep the eye moist.\n【save__datas】\t【392】\t5\\. Some children experience pain in the face. A moist warm washcloth applied to the affected side of the face may assist in reducing the pain. You should also encourage your child to practice facial exercise as advised by your doctor. It helps speed up recovery.\n【save__datas】\t【393】\tBell's palsy： Problems Faced by Teenagers\n【save__datas】\t【394】\tThe teen years are an important part in any individual's life. For some it is time--connect--【395】for self-discovery， for others it could be a time of disorientation. Coping with Bell's palsy on the path to adulthood can be a testing time for teenagers. They may face problems such as：\n【save__datas】\t【396】\t1\\. Feelings of Low Self-Worth\n【save__datas】\t【397】\tTeenagers with Bell’s palsy suffer from low self-esteem. Feeling incapable to express amusement without being stared at by others affects their confidence. They feel uncomfortable meeting new people. They tend to remain socially distant because they believe they will be unable to interact with people normally.\n【save__datas】\t【398】\t2\\. Feeling of Being Alone\n【save__datas】\t【399】\tBell’s palsy is a rare illness. It affects 1 in 5，000 people each year. As a teenager with Bell’s palsy， they feel they are different from everyone else. It may be possible that they may be the only teenagers in their surroundings with Bell's palsy. This creates an overwhelming feeling of being alone. They feel that even their friends and family do not realize what they are going through.\n【save__datas】\t【400】\t3\\. Sense of Poor Body Image\n【save__datas】\t【401】\tIt's common for teenagers to look at theirpeers and compare their own appearance. Differences in facial appearance caused by Bell’s palsy can have a very powerful impact on a teenager because they become self-conscious and are embarrassed about the way they look.\n【save__datas】\t【402】\t4\\. Feelings of Depression and Grief\n【save__datas】\t【403】\tDealing with feelings of a negative body image and low self-worth can lead to the point of depression amongteenagers. A teenager who has suddenly developed Bell's palsy might have a sense of grief take over. They feel that they could have looked so attractive if this condition had not developed.\n【save__datas】\t【404】\tFurthermore， since ‘selfies’and photographs have become such an integral part in a teenager’s life， those affected with Bell’s palsy feel uncomfortable when being included in pictures. Whether it be a homecoming dance or a prom， teenagers with Bell's palsy may avoid large gatherings because they feel like they will be made fun of or stared at.\n【save__datas】\t【405】\t5\\. Become Withdrawn and Exceedingly CautioustoExpressTheir Feelings\n【save__datas】\t【406】\tFinding it difficult to express feelings of joy freely can be devastating for a teenager. They try to hide their face while smiling or talking. They become socially introverted and less outgoing. The only reason being - they don’t want others to notice their collapsed face.\n【save__datas】\t【407】\tBell's palsycan2affect day tto daylifeaspects； eating， interactingand communicating. Teenagers become self-conscious and avoid outings and dining out with friends and family thinking people might be looking at them.\n【save__datas】\t【408】\tHow to Help People with Bell’s Palsy\n【save__datas】\t【409】\tSince I had facial paralysis at a young age， people around me were used to what I looked like. Not everyone had harsh things to say about my appearance， but clearly， even the ‘most--connect--【411】concerned1friends' were unaware ofthe full psychological impact Bell's palsy had on me.\n【save__datas】\t【412】\tOthers may not necessarily know how to act or react around people with Bell's palsy.\n【save__datas】\t【413】\tRaising awareness about the condition is vital. Before helping a loved one with Bell's palsy， it is important to understand what the condition is， how it is caused， and how it psychologically affects an individual. That’s why I have written this book!\n【save__datas】\t【414】\tImagine you wake up one morning to find that you’ve developed facial paralysis. For a teenager or young adult who is taking their first step into a new career， college， or entering a new group of friends， this experience is devastating. Instead of socializing more or exploring new opportunities in life， teenagers and young adults who develop Bell’s palsy hide from their peers.\n【save__datas】\t【415】\tSadly， children， teenagers and even young adults have problems“getting over it and moving on”. The grief can be short-term or long-term depending on the severity of the condition. I can understand the feelings of helplessness and sadness at particular moments such as family or other social gatherings.\n【save__datas】\t【416】\tA great way to support your child could be acknowledging their pain and then presenting your thoughts on how to reduce it. Remember， those suffering from\n【save__datas】\t【417】\tBell's palsy need emotional support more than any other therapeutic option. We shall be looking at this in particular in our last section，“Providing Moral Support to Patients with Bell’s Palsy.”\n【save__datas】\t【418】\tAs a friend， it is important that we talk to these teenagers the same way we did before they had the condition. This lets them recognize that our feelings and values for them haven’t changed. They are the same person they were before the illness. The worst thing you can do is feel sorry for them. This will not only shatter their confidence but also make them feel inferior.\n【save__datas】\t【419】\tEducate yourself about the emotional issues that children and teenagers with Bell’s palsy face. This will help you provide strong and effective emotional support.\n【save__datas】\t【420】\tIt's always a nice idea to network with parents whose kids have Bell’s palsy. You may also surf the internet or look in your local community to find support groups. Through this， teenagers can share their feelings and problems with people who are in a similar position. It will help them recognize that they are not alone dealing with this condition. Also， meeting someone who can relate to their problems can truly enhance their self-esteem.\n【save__datas】\t【421】\tChapter Four： Bell's Palsy during Pregnancy\n【save__datas】\t【422】\tExpecting mothers develop Bell's palsy more frequently， and the reasons are not completely understood. It has been observed that the risk is highest during the third trimester and several weeks after delivery. Luckily， the prognosis for expecting moms is generally good. If a woman is affected with Bell’s palsy during pregnancy， there is no effect on the developing fetus.\n【save__datas】\t【423】\tThe symptoms among expecting mothers are the same as described earlier in this book.\n【save__datas】\t【424】\tTreating Bell's Palsy during Pregnancy\n【save__datas】\t【425】\tWe will look at the treatment methods in more detail later in this book， but for now， let’s take a quick look at how Bell's palsy can be treated during pregnancy. You can address symptoms such as pain with pain killers； however， steroids and popular antiviral medication are not recommended.\n【save__datas】\t【426】\tHow Long Will It Take for the Symptoms to Go Away Completely?\n【save__datas】\t【427】\tWell， you will notice a gradual improvement， but recovery times ca depending on the extent of nerve damage. Most pregnant women who develop Bell’s palsy recover completely in less than six months. In some cases， the recovery time may be longer - this often happens if the patient develops complete facial paralysis.\n【save__datas】\t【428】\tPregnant women who develop Bell's palsy are monitored closely for changes in blood pressure. This is because expecting moms suffering from Bell's palsy are also at an increased risk of developing preeclampsia.\n【save__datas】\t【429】\tPreeclampsia is a serious complication in pregnant women and is characterized by high blood pressure. The increase in blood pressure can cause tremendous damage to vital organs， particularly the kidneys. Preeclampsia is usually spotted after 20 weeks of pregnancy. It can even happen in women who had normal blood pressure during the early weeks of pregnancy.\n【save__datas】\t【430】\tIf left untreated， preeclampsia might lead to serious complications for both the mother and the baby. This condition only has one cure -delivering the baby. That being said； the pregnancy obviously has to be in its final stage for the delivery to take place.\n【save__datas】\t【431】\tYou can talk to your doctor to find out more about preeclampsia. Be sure to monitor your condition and your baby’s condition closely to ensure a safe and happy delivery.\n【save__datas】\t【432】\tCan My Baby Be Affected during Delivery?\n【save__datas】\t【433】\tTrauma during birth is one of the leading causes of Bell's palsy in children； however， the condition cannot be transferred. Simply put， if you suffer from Bell's palsy during pregnancy， your baby will not be born with it.\n【save__datas】\t【434】\tPhysical injury to the facial nerve can result during ‘assisted’delivery. If your baby needs help to move out of the birth canal， your doctor may recommend forceps delivery. The curved ends of the instrument are generally harmless， but in rare cases， they may exert excessive pressure on the baby's head. Any type of compression to the 7th cranial nerve， as you know， can result in the weakness of facial muscles.\n【save__datas】\t【435】\tIn most cases， injury caused by forceps is temporary， and symptoms of facial paralysis go away within a few months. But there have been cases in which the facial paralysis persists for a longer duration.\n【save__datas】\t【436】\tBell's palsy due to birth trauma is usually diagnosed by a healthcare provider while the baby is in the hospital. Mild cases， such as those involving just the lower lips may be noticed after a few days. If you suspect facial weakness or notice little or no movement on one side of your baby's face， make an appointment with your baby's pediatrician immediately.\n【save__datas】\t【437】\tThe doctor will carry out a physical examination to determine the exact reason for facial muscle weakness. Further diagnostic tests might be carried out to rule out other common causes of facial palsy such as congenital birth defect， infections and tumor.\n【save__datas】\t【438】\tBecause symptoms caused by birth trauma generally improve on their own within a few months， a team of medical specialists will closely monitor your baby to decide whether medical intervention is needed or not.\n【save__datas】\t【439】\tIs Bell's Palsy Hereditary?\n【save__datas】\t【440】\tPresently， there is no strong medical evidence suggesting that Bell's palsy is hereditary， however research is still underway.\n【save__datas】\t【441】\tChapter Five： Complications and Myths about Bell’s Palsy\n【save__datas】\t【442】\tClearing Myths about Bell's Palsy\n【save__datas】\t【443】\tJust like with any other disease， there are countless myths surrounding Bell's palsy. Here， we've cleared three of the most common myths about this condition. Remember， it's important that we clear up inaccuracies about Bell’s palsy to make a better effort at understanding the problem and helping others learn about it.\n【save__datas】\t【445】\tEvery case of facial paralysis must be Bell's palsy\n【len<10_filter】\t【446】\tFact：\n【save__datas】\t【447】\tIf you recall the section on Bell’s palsy causes and symptoms， we’ve seen that many other conditions such as stroke， tumor， Lyme disease and congenital birth defects can also cause facial paralysis.\n【save__datas】\t【448】\tSo the doctor will tell the patient they have Bell’s palsy when facial paralysis or muscle weakness occurs because of an unknown cause.\n【save__datas】\t【450】\tInfluenza immunization can trigger Bell's palsy\n【len<10_filter】\t【451】\tFact：\n【save__datas】\t【452】\tThere is no scientific evidence that the flu vaccine triggers Bell’s palsy. However， some individuals claim that Bell’s palsy was caused after flu vaccination in their case. Medical experts suggest that flu vaccination might trigger antibodies that attack normal cells. The 7th cranial nerve may also be affected， which then causes facial paralysis. Research is underway to see if this is actually the cause.\n【save__datas】\t【454】\tAll Bell's palsy patients are infected by the herpes simplex virus.\n【len<10_filter】\t【455】\tFact：\n【save__datas】\t【456】\tWhile medical experts are unable to identify the real cause(s) of Bell's palsy， the herpes simplex virus is still rated as one of the prime suspects. The virus is known to cause swelling and inflammation of the 7th cranial nerve； however， not all Bell’s palsy patients have the herpes simplex virus. It is important that healthcare providers conduct a comprehensive diagnosis before starting--connect--【458】any treatment method.\n【save__datas】\t【459】\tComplications of Bell’s palsy\n【save__datas】\t【460】\tOnly two in ten patients experience long-term problems and complications resulting from Bell's palsy. Once again， complications that might occur depend on the extent of damage to the 7th cranial nerve.\n【save__datas】\t【461】\tThe most likely complications of Bell’s palsy include：\n【save__datas】\t【462】\t1\\. Contracture\n【save__datas】\t【463】\tThis is a condition where your facial muscles arepermanentlyttense. Contracture can lead to facial scarring - the eye may become smaller， and cheeks may become bulky on the affected side.\n【save__datas】\t【464】\t2\\. Reduced or complete loss of taste\n【save__datas】\t【465】\tThis is more likely to happen if the 7th cranialnerve doesn’t repair properly.\n【save__datas】\t【466】\t3\\. Slurred speech or difficulty speaking\n【save__datas】\t【467】\tThis complication mainly occurs due to damage to facial muscles.\n【save__datas】\t【468】\t4\\. Eye-mouth synkinesis\n【save__datas】\t【469】\tYour eye may wink involuntarily， especially when youare smiling， laughing or eating. This winking can become so sudden and severe that your eye can close completely.\n【save__datas】\t【470】\t5\\. Drying of the eye and corneal ulceration\n【save__datas】\t【471】\tCorneal ulceration is likely to happen when the thin protective tear film in the eye becomes less effective. An ulcer is more commonly seen if the patient is unable to shut their eye completely. Dry eyes occur as a result of reduced tear production. Both corneal ulceration and dry eyes may lead to further eye infections.\n【save__datas】\t【472】\t6\\. Excessive tear production\n【save__datas】\t【473】\tSome people experience excessive tear production. Tearing is initiated spontaneously while eating and laughing and is also known as 'crocodile tears.\n【save__datas】\t【474】\t7\\. Ramsay Hunt syndrome\n【save__datas】\t【475】\tIf Bell’s palsy is caused by the varicella-zoster virus， there is a possibility that patients may develop Ramsay Hunt syndrome. This condition is extremely rare， and only less than 2% of patients with Bell’s palsy are at risk of being affected. Ramsay Hunt syndrome is characterized by the presence of blisters on the tongue and inside the ears. The condition generally responds to steroids and antiviral medication.\n【save__datas】\t【476】\tLong-term complications of Bell's palsy are more likely if：\n【save__datas】\t【477】\t1\\. You suffer from complete paralysis， i.e. there is no movement on either side of your face.\n【save__datas】\t【478】\t2\\. Your facial nerve is badly damaged.\n【save__datas】\t【479】\t3\\. You have diabetes and hypertension (high blood pressure).\n【len<10_filter】\t【480】\t4.\n【save__datas】\t【481】\tYou are over 60 years of age.\n【save__datas】\t【482】\t5.. You are pregnant.\n【save__datas】\t【483】\t6.. You show no signs of recovery even after six weeks.\n【save__datas】\t【484】\tFacial Palsy and Synkinesis\n【save__datas】\t【485】\tWhat is Synkinesis?\n【save__datas】\t【486】\tSynkinesis is said to occur when your facial muscles move unwantedly. The--connect--【487】condition is very common in people who are recovering from prolonged facial palsy.\n【save__datas】\t【488】\tWhat Really Happens?\n【save__datas】\t【489】\tTechnically， the term synkinesis means simultaneous movement and is a result of abnormal facial nerve regeneration. Certain facial muscles contract with the working’muscles， which leads to uncontrollable expressions.\n【save__datas】\t【490】\tUnfortunately， the 7th cranialrnerve is poorly insulated during the recovery phase. Healthy and uninjured nerves， on the other hand， are properly insulated by a thin layer of specialized ‘fat'cells called the myelin sheath.\n【save__datas】\t【491】\tSince the facial nerve has faulty insulation， messages specifically intended for one particular set of muscles are also picked up by another muscle. This is what results in the movement of more than one muscle at the same time. For example， your eye might close when you try to smile. Even though these movements are temporary， they sadly tend to become a habit. Some people continue to show‘linked movements’even after they recover from Bell's palsy.\n【save__datas】\t【492】\tWhat Are the Causes?\n【save__datas】\t【493】\tYour body’s natural healing mechanism is also partially responsible for these unwanted movements. Simply put， the recovering nerve fibers are implanted into different unwanted muscle groups that produce the undesirable simultaneous facial responses.\n【save__datas】\t【494】\tSynkinesis can also happen when the facial nerve is reconnected to a wrong group of facial muscles after surgery. Most surgical treatment options for Bell's and facial palsy involve cutting the 7th cranial nerve and sewing it with a healthy group of facial muscles. Sometimes， when the nerve fibers are reattached to the muscles， they connect to the wrong group of facial muscles causing abnormal facial movement.\n【save__datas】\t【495】\tSurprisingly， the muscles in your face tend to work together while facial nerves are recovering. The different groups of muscles join forces to help accomplish a task such as smiling or blinking an eye. Because all muscle groups are working together， it is hard to coordinate specific facial movements.\n【save__datas】\t【496】\tYour facial muscles also fail to follow the assigned sequence of activity； hence small movements happen as one “large’movement which obviously doesn’t look natural. Muscles affected by facial palsy also forget which movement should--connect--【497】happen first and start competing with the good muscles. Sometimes the affected muscles are overworked in this ‘tug of war’resulting in short， stiff muscle fibers.\n【save__datas】\t【498】\tSynkinesis： Basics You Need to Know\n【save__datas】\t【499】\t1\\. Symptoms of synkinesis only show on the side of the face affected by Bell's palsy.\n【save__datas】\t【500】\t2\\. Facial palsy patients notice symptoms largely in the cheek， chin， and eye and neck area.\n【save__datas】\t【501】\t3\\. Even the mild symptoms appear more prominent when the good side is compared to the affected side of the face.\n【save__datas】\t【502】\tThe Look and Feel\n【save__datas】\t【503】\tThe condition may show up in different ways. The most common observations include：\n【save__datas】\t【504】\t1\\. The eye squints whenever you smile.\n【save__datas】\t【505】\t2\\. Your cheek might rise as you try to close your eyes.\n【save__datas】\t【506】\t3\\. Your neck feels tight when you try to whistle.\n【len<10_filter】\t【507】\t4.\n【save__datas】\t【508】\tFacial twitching， especially in the neck and chin area becomesSmore common.\n【save__datas】\t【509】\t5\\. Facial muscles typically in the forehead and eyebrow area become tight， causing discomfort. You mayfind it difficult to mnove tight and stiff muscles.\n【save__datas】\t【510】\t6\\. Even when the affected side of the face is relaxed， the mouth appears to be pulled up. Your cheek may appear bulky， and the eyes might squint.\n【save__datas】\t【511】\tWhat are the Common Symptoms of Synkinesis?\n【save__datas】\t【512】\tMost patients who develop synkinesis believe that their muscles are weak， especially if they become too tight. Following are the characteristic symptoms you would notice during synkinesis.\n【save__datas】\t【513】\tFacial muscles on the affected side become tighter than the muscles on the good--connect--【514】side.\n【save__datas】\t【515】\tThis simply means that the facial muscles on the affected side have a higher tone. The muscles can work twice or three times more than the good muscles as you try to move them. This is one of the reasons your mouth is pulled upwards， and cheeks appear bulky even when you are resting.\n【save__datas】\t【516】\tContinuous overwork might cause your facial muscles to become short and tight.\n【save__datas】\t【517】\tOverworked muscles are under constant stress and become extremely difficult to move. Patients with synkinesis cannot move and control the facial muscles correctly when they want to express themselves.\n【save__datas】\t【518】\tCan You Predict Synkinesis?\n【save__datas】\t【519】\tWill you always feel some kind of tightening or pain in your facial muscles? Well， synkinesis is somewhat predictable； however， the severity of the symptoms can differ greatly among patients.\n【save__datas】\t【520】\tBefore we discuss the predictable pattern， let us first differentiate between true paralysis (weak muscles) and synkinesis. For this quick test， all you need to do is stand in front of a mirror. What do you see? If your facial tone is normal and you can observe noticeable movements， the abnormal movements are a result of facial synkinesis.\n【save__datas】\t【521】\tMost patients recovering from facial palsy and Bell’s palsy experience eye closure， in particular， when they try to smile. Sometimes， the eyelids tend to twitch or close suddenly while the patient is trying to laugh.\n【save__datas】\t【522】\tSynkinesis also affects patients who have reacquired their facial tone. The patients are unable to pull the affected corner of the mouth upwards when they smile - people assume that their mouth is not moving due to muscle weakness， i.e. loss of muscle tone. The reason， on the other hand， is synkinesis or simultaneous movement， not facial paralysis.\n【save__datas】\t【523】\tThe inability to move corners of the mouth is obvious because muscles that droop towards the corner of mouth， i.e. zygomaticus major and minor， work simultaneously with depressor anguli oris， platysma， and mentalis， i.e. muscles responsible to elevate the corner of your mouth.\n【save__datas】\t【524】\tOther characteristic patterns of synkinesis include narrowing of the eyes and increased muscle tone (tightness， spasm and contracture) in the chin. In addition--connect--【525】to abnormal movement patterns around the eyes， chin and mouth， synkinesis also causes the affected cheek to become tight and bulky.\n【save__datas】\t【526】\tWhat Are Your Treatment Options?\n【save__datas】\t【527】\tThree popular methods namely physical therapy， Botox injections (botulinum toxin)) and surgery are employed by doctors to treat synkinesis. The choice of treatment method depends on the severity of the symptoms. Your doctor can start the treatment any time after synkinesis has occurred. Interestingly， successful treatment of synkinesis is possible even if therapy is started years after the patient has suffered Bell's or facial palsy.\n【save__datas】\t【528】\tPhysical Therapy -Neuromuscular Retraining\n【save__datas】\t【529】\tPhysical therapy for the treatment of synkinesis is very different from the therapy utilized for other medical complications such as lower back pain and arthritis. Facial physical therapy or neuromuscular retraining during synkinesis is very similar to learning to sing with a hoarse voice.\n【save__datas】\t【530】\tAny singer with a hoarse voice will learn to adjust their vocal cords to overcome poor sound. Similarly， patients with Bell’s palsy or facial palsy focus on coordinating different muscles to achieve controlled， synchronized and natural looking facial muscle movements. This physical therapy is extremely useful in overcoming the activity of unwanted muscles.\n【save__datas】\t【531】\tMore information on physical therapy can be found under the treatment section， but here’s a quick overview to help you understand synkinesis better.\n【save__datas】\t【532】\tYour healthcare provider will refer you to a qualified therapist who will then identify the muscles that show linked movements or are contracting abnormally. Facial muscles that fail to follow the ‘natural--connect--【534】sequence’of activity are also identified.\n【save__datas】\t【535】\tSmall and simple exercises， usually， are then suggested in order to retrain your muscles at the neurologic level. Facial and neck muscles on the affected side are massaged and stretched， however patients are advised not apply excessive force. Remember， you have to re-train overactive， stiff muscles so that your facial muscles become coordinated， and this might take some time. Almost 90% of the physical therapy involves personalized exercises that can be done at home. You can always refer to your healthcare provider if you have specific questions related to physical therapy.\n【save__datas】\t【536】\tBotox Injections\n【save__datas】\t【537】\tThe second most popular therapy for synkinesis is the use of Botox or(botulinum toxin-A) injections. Your therapist may use Botox in combination with facial physical therapy in some cases.\n【save__datas】\t【538】\tBotox injections work by calming down overactive muscles. Overworked muscles in the eyes (orbicularis)， neck (platysma)， and chin (mentalis)are usually targeted. Your therapist will inject the botulinum toxin in the tight areas to restore facial symmetry. Often， healthcare providers also use Botox on the normal side of the face (forehead， lower lips and corners of the eye) to make the face symmetrical.\n【save__datas】\t【539】\tSurgical Treatment\n【save__datas】\t【540】\tSurgical treatment of synkinesis is only utilized when the other two methods (i.e. physical therapy and Botox) fail to give the desired results.\n【save__datas】\t【541】\tSelective neurolysis is the latest surgical innovation in the treatment of synkinesis. During this surgery， a certified surgeon will release the platysma muscle and decrease activity of the facial nerves that pull the mouth down. This surgical intervention will allow the corners of the mouth to move upwards again.\n【save__datas】\t【542】\tOther surgical treatments of synkinesis involve eyelid surgery and facelift. Your doctor is in the best position to determine whether or not you are the right candidate for synkinesis surgery.\n【save__datas】\t【544】\tThe treatment used during Bell's palsy depends on the cause and severity of the symptoms. It can range from simple lubricating eye drops and steroid medication to eyelid weights for people having difficulty closing their eye. A combination of anti-viral medication and oral steroids is known to improve the chances of recovery among Bell’s palsy patients.\n【save__datas】\t【545】\tEven without any formal treatment， a lot of people completely recover from Bell’s palsy. Nonetheless， there are various therapeutic options that help reduce the risk of complications. There is a dispute among researchers about the most effective cure for Bell’s palsy. But most doctors use a combination of antiviral medications and steroids for the treatment.\n【save__datas】\t【546】\tOral Medication\n【save__datas】\t【547】\tPrednisolone\n【save__datas】\t【548】\tThe primary concern in the management of Bell's palsy is to remove the origin of the injury to the facial nerve without delay. In this regard， Prednisolone is found to be very effective as stated by numerous studies. This is a prescription drug often used to treat inflammation and swelling. You may have seen it used in medication such as Orapred， Millipred， Omnipred， Econopred， or Flo-Pred. As time goes on， damage to the nerve can increase. Thus， it is advisable to use steroids within 72 hours of the symptoms appearing.\n【save__datas】\t【549】\tEarly treatmentwithPPrednisolonehhelps reduceinflammation.， thereby improving the chances of complete recovery from Bell’s palsy. Prednisolone is typically prescribed for a 10-day course in which patients generally take two tablets a day.\n【save__datas】\t【550】\tPregnant women and mothers who are breastfeeding are advised to consult their doctor before taking Prednisolone. Not all who take steroids have side effects. However， some patients may experience mood swings， depression and anxiety. Consult your doctor immediately if you experience any of the following side effects：\n【save__datas】\t【551】\t1\\. Headache\n【save__datas】\t【552】\t2\\. Indigestion\n【save__datas】\t【553】\t3\\. Dizziness\n【save__datas】\t【554】\t4\\. Increased appetite\n【save__datas】\t【555】\t5\\. Nausea\n【save__datas】\t【556】\t6\\. Oral thrush\n【save__datas】\t【557】\t7\\. Loss of sleep\n【save__datas】\t【558】\tPrednisolone is available in tablet， liquid and concentrated form that can be taken orally. It is recommended that you take Prednisone with food as advised by your doctor.\n【save__datas】\t【559】\tOften， patients are prescribed to take Prednisone one to four times a day. Your personal dosage will depend on the severity of the symptoms and how well you respond to the treatment.\n【save__datas】\t【560】\tPrecautions to Remember\n【save__datas】\t【561】\t1\\. Follow the directions carefully when taking Prednisone and do not change the dosage. Remember， you cannot take more or less steroid medication to speed up recovery. If your doctor prescribes a concentrated solution of Prednisone， it may be taken with liquid.\n【save__datas】\t【562】\t2\\. Do inform your doctor if you are taking grapefruit or grapefruit juice because it may cause a negative reaction when consumed with Prednisone. Another thing you need to remember is that your dose of Prednisone can be changed during the treatment.\n【save__datas】\t【563】\t3\\. Never stoptakingsteroid medication without informing your doctor. Remember， if you stop taking Prednisone suddenly， your body may not have enough natural ‘defense’substances to function normally.\n【save__datas】\t【564】\t4\\. Abrupt withdrawal of steroid medication might produce symptoms such as fatigue， weight loss， mouth sores， changes in skin color and upset stomach. If you experience any of these symptoms， contact your doctor immediately.\n【save__datas】\t【565】\t5\\. Steroid medication is known to decrease your ability to fight infections， So--connect--【566】make sure you stay away from people who are sick during the course of your therapy. Try to wash your hands often. Be sure you avoid people who are suffering from chickenpox and measles.\n【save__datas】\t【567】\t6\\. You might be instructed to follow a diet rich in potassium and calcium while taking Prednisone. Your doctor may also ask you to reduce your salt intake. If needed， you might be asked to take a calcium or potassium supplement along with Prednisone.\n【save__datas】\t【568】\tAntiviral Drugs\n【save__datas】\t【569】\tAs viral infections have a role in the etiology of Bell’s palsy， antiviral drugs are also used to treat the condition. Although antiviral drugs， if taken alone， have no impact on recovery， they are used in combination with Prednisolone for greater effectiveness.\n【save__datas】\t【570】\tAcyclovir (Zovirax) and valacyclovir (Valtrex)are sometimes used to treat Bell’s palsy. They are known to prevent the development of infection if a virus is identified to have caused the inflammation of the facial nerve. It is worth mentioning that this treatment is offered only if the condition is severe.\n【save__datas】\t【571】\tTreatment with Botulinum Toxin\n【save__datas】\t【572】\tThere are a number of neurotransmitters (special chemical substances) inside your body that control the transmission of electrical signals. Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter responsible for transmitting electrical messages that help facial muscles contract.\n【save__datas】\t【573】\tFacial paralysis caused by Bell’s palsy is sudden； however， you never know how longthese effects may last. Botulinum toxin or simply Botox injections help paralyzed muscles relax and restore facialsymmetry. Botulinum toxin is a protein produced by bacterium Clostridium botulinum and this toxin blocks the release of acetylcholine.\n【save__datas】\t【574】\tYour doctor will inject the toxin into affected muscles on the paralyzed side， causingtthem to relax as I mentioned earlier in the treatment of synkinesis section. The result is a more symmetrical face. A very fine needle is used during the procedure； therefore， you will experience very little pain.\n【save__datas】\t【575】\tSometimes， Botox injections are also used on the normal side of the face to restore symmetry. What you need to remember is that Botox is a temporary solution and results may vary with each individual. You may have to repeat the--connect--【576】treatment if the symptoms don’t subside. Your doctor will be in a better position to guide you about this.\n【save__datas】\t【577】\tPhysical Therapy\n【save__datas】\t【578】\tPhysical therapy such as biofeedback， facialexercises， thermotherapy and massages are used to speed up recovery from Bell’s palsy. Not only does it prevent facial drooping from occurring again， but it also helps facial muscles regain their strength.\n【save__datas】\t【579】\tAfter a thorough physical examination， a physical therapist identifies the weaknesses caused by this condition.\n【save__datas】\t【580】\tPhysical therapy helps patients perform daily activities since it retrains muscles into working the way you want them to work. Physical therapy is intended to help people relearn their facial movements and is commonly referred to as initiation exercises.\n【save__datas】\t【581】\tOnce patients have successfully overcome the challenging period of relearning， physical therapy is used to make muscles frelearn'certain movements. Exercise strengthens facial muscles so that they can perform the same functions as they were able to before the onset of Bell's Palsy.\n【save__datas】\t【582】\tCognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT)\n【save__datas】\t【583】\tCognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) is a type of emotional therapy used to treat a wide range of issues. Teenagers and adults suffering from Bell’s palsy can receive psychological therapy to overcome their emotional difficulties.\n【save__datas】\t【584】\tBell’s palsy， as you can guess， limits a person’s positive thoughts and slowly replaces them with negative emotions. Young adults in particular feel depressed and miserable in this challenging situation. CBT helps Bell's palsy sufferers respond more positively to the situation. The therapist talks to you and explains how your thoughts are affected by what you think and feel. Simply put， you will learn how negative thoughts and assumptions can be converted into more positive ones.\n【save__datas】\t【585】\tWhat you need to remember is that cognitive behavior therapy is not an instant solution or fix. It may take some time before a Bell’s palsy patient can look at their situation from a positive， fresh perspective.\n【save__datas】\t【586】\tPatients with Bell’s palsy ffind it difficult tothink (cognitive)andact\n【save__datas】\t【587】\t(behavioral) the same way they used to before being affected. However， events occurring in the present are far more important than what has taken place in the past. There is substantial evidence that CBT helps people overcome depression， anxiety， low self-esteem and negative thoughts.\n【save__datas】\t【588】\tBell’s palsy sufferers often feel anxious while interacting with others and experience constant depressing thoughts. They are reluctant to meet new people， and this behavior is seen in almost every patient， no matter what the cause. Some patients just want to hide so that they no longer have to face anyone. What's really upsetting is the fact that this emotional trauma is severe in teenagers and young adults.\n【save__datas】\t【589】\tBecause of the impact Bell’s palsy has on a person’s appearance， the best course of action would be to see how patients feel about themselves. Remember， dealing with emotional elements is as important as treating physical symptoms. CBT can be implemented more successfully if the therapist is well aware of the patient’s behavior， thoughts and feelings.\n【save__datas】\t【590】\tWhat Happens during Cognitive Behavioral Therapy?\n【save__datas】\t【591】\tA certified therapist will first decide whether or not CBT will be useful in your case. Your first assessment session will most likely identify your feelings and thoughts about having Bell’s palsy. CBT sessions are usually between six and twelve weeks.\n【save__datas】\t【592】\tThe first step， as mentioned earlier， is to identify your feelings and thoughts. Your therapist will then help you break them into smaller parts so you can easily evaluate how these emotions are affecting you.\n【save__datas】\t【594】\tCBT involves five differentaspects， namely； situation， thoughts， emotions， actions and physical feelings.\n【save__datas】\t【595】\tSituation as you can guess is the problem or event that you are facing. If you are facing any difficult situation， your brain is bombarded with emotions， thoughts and feelings， all of which compel you to take action. This action is how you respond. It can be helpful or unhelpful.\n【save__datas】\t【596】\tFor example：\n【save__datas】\t【597】\tYou enter a place where not many people know you. Suddenly， everyone starts looking at your face. At this point， you can have two types of thoughts.\n【save__datas】\t【598】\tUnhelpful： People only see my facial disfigurement.\n【save__datas】\t【599】\tHelpful： They are looking to see if they know me.\n【save__datas】\t【600】\tWhen your thoughts are unhelpful， the most obvious emotions will be sadness， anger and frustration. You will want to go home and avoid further interaction with new people.\n【save__datas】\t【601】\tOn the other hand， if you have helpful thoughts in your head， you will be excited to find out whose present at the place you have just arrived at. Since you will be feeling confident， there will be no hesitation in introducing yourself and finding out if anyone knows you.\n【save__datas】\t【602】\tCan you see the difference your thoughts can have onyour responses? Remember， the more effort you put into identifying your positive feelings， the easier it will be to cope with Bell's palsy.\n【save__datas】\t【603】\tYour cognitive behavioral therapist will advise you to maintain a diary. Whenever you feel depressed， write down the situation and thoughts and explore them with your therapist in the next CBT session.\n【save__datas】\t【604】\tUnfortunately， many people with Bell’s palsyassume that others find them unattractive. This is one of the reasons Bell’s palsy patients have problems combating negative thoughts and ideas. Try to think positively as this will help you manage different feelings and situations with a great deal of ease.\n【save__datas】\t【605】\tElectrical Stimulation\n【save__datas】\t【606】\tElectrical stimulation is also a popular technique used to treat Bell’s palsy. When you smile， raise your eyebrow or simply close your eyes， your 7th facial nerve is at work.\n【save__datas】\t【607】\tPatients with Bell's palsy may experience difficulties such as the inability to express emotion on the affected side of the face. There are problems closing the eyes， and the mouth may collapse on one side. The facial nerve in Bell's palsy either gets inflamed or compressed due to the condition. That is why the electrical impulses fail to travel along the damaged facial nerve to reach the muscles that need to move.\n【save__datas】\t【608】\tThe ineffective communication between the brain and facial muscles causes the muscles to become droopy and weak. Electrical stimulation aims at imitating the function of electrical impulses through the use of a mild current. This passage of--connect--【609】current is thought to assist the restoration of nerve function and overall muscle tone.\n【save__datas】\t【610】\tElectrical stimulation should be carried out under the supervision of a specialist. Without the guidance of an expert， patients are advised not to attempt it in any case. The technique may cause problems if it is carried out without adequate supervision.\n【save__datas】\t【611】\tIt's important to keep in mind that the facial nerve is capable of recovering naturally. Therefore， therapists and medical experts give time for the nerve to heal without any intervention. Meanwhile， patients are encouraged to carry out facial massages tenderly that will assist blood circulation and maintain muscle health. At the start of the recovery phase， patients must try to focus more on massaging their face and protecting their eye. They can gently massage their face in a circular motion by using their fingers.\n【save__datas】\t【612】\tOnce the facial nerve starts recovering， it begins to emit electrical signals in the facial muscles.\n【save__datas】\t【613】\tIf the facial muscles are unable to regain their natural tone， patients can go ahead with electrical stimulation after consulting a certified healthcare professional.\n【save__datas】\t【614】\tAs mentioned earlier， the technique has to be carried out very carefully. Failure to do so can result in overstimulation of the muscles. This can be a painful experienceforpatientssincemusclesbecomestiff and can twitch uncontrollably.\n【save__datas】\t【615】\tElectrical stimulation helps improve the contraction of muscles， which helps achieve facial symmetry.\n【save__datas】\t【616】\tBiofeedback Therapy\n【save__datas】\t【617】\tFacial paralysis， at some point， causes a disruption in nerve signals sent to the facial muscles. When this confusion continues to exist， there are interruptions in the feedback sent to the brain about the affected side of the face. Since your mind is always busy， it ultimately forgets about the lack of communication on the affected side of the face. It only relies on the good side and you may notice that the facial muscles that remain unaffected slowly begin to dominate.\n【save__datas】\t【618】\tWhat Is Biofeedback?\n【save__datas】\t【619】\tBell’s palsy rehabilitation via biofeedback is all about getting your entire face--connect--【620】back into action， but you need a little help from outside.\n【save__datas】\t【621】\tBiofeedback is a method through which people can learn to control their body's functions. Biofeedback involves usingsensors placed strategically over the human body. These sensors help receive feedback about the body， hence， the term biofeedback. This feedback assists people in making minor changes to their body over time， such as relaxing specific muscles to reduce the intensity of pain. In short， biofeedback allows you to use your thoughts to control certain aspects of your body， such as muscles.\n【save__datas】\t【622】\tDuring recovery， Bell’s palsy patients reach a stage where their face feels incredibly tight. The eye may shut without any indication while eating or talking. Some patients also feel that they are making funny faces when smiling. It is the faulty communication system between your face and brain that is letting you down. Biofeedback allows you to learn how to control muscles to display the expression you want.\n【save__datas】\t【623】\tWhat Are the Different Types of Biofeedback?\n【save__datas】\t【624】\tThere are three most commonly used forms of biofeedback therapy including：\n【save__datas】\t【625】\t1\\. Electromyography (EMG) used to measure muscle tension.\n【len<10_filter】\t【626】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【627】\tThermal biofeedback used to measure skin temperature.\n【save__datas】\t【628】\t3\\. Electroencephalography (EEG) or neuro-feedback used to measure brain wave activity.\n【save__datas】\t【629】\tWhat Happens during Biofeedback Therapy?\n【save__datas】\t【630】\tA typical biofeedback session will involve attaching tiny electrodes to your skin. These electrodes then send information to a small box that translates the signals your body is giving out. You will see lines that vary in pitch on a computer screen. The biofeedback therapist in charge will then guide you through some mental exercises. Soon， with trial and error， you will learn exercises that can bring about the activity you want on the affected side of your face.\n【save__datas】\t【631】\tYou will also be taught relaxation techniques and exercises that need to be done at home for at least 5 - 10 minutes every day.\n【save__datas】\t【632】\tAre There Any Risks Associated with Biofeedback Sessions?\n【save__datas】\t【633】\tEach biofeedback session usually lasts less than 60 minutes. The number of sessions you require depends on the severity of the condition.\n【save__datas】\t【634】\tThis therapy is considered safe. No side effects have been reported to date. What’s even better is that you don’t need any specialpreparation for the treatment.\n【save__datas】\t【635】\tIf you’re looking to find a qualified biofeedback therapist， start by asking your healthcare provider or another healthcare professional. Your doctor is in a better position to recommend someone who has experience in the same area.\n【save__datas】\t【636】\tWill My Movements Be Natural?\n【save__datas】\t【637】\tSomeIpeople worry if they will ever be able to portrayfacialexpressions normally again； the same way they were able to before Bell's palsy.\n【save__datas】\t【638】\tRemember， biofeedback sessions will help you discover ways you can control muscles on the affected side of the face and after some time， you can smile without having to think about it.\n【save__datas】\t【639】\tIs This Treatment Only for Bell's Palsy?\n【save__datas】\t【640】\tOf course not! There is massive evidence relating to the use of this technique for other medical conditions and different muscle groups in your body. You can always askvour doctor whether biofeedbackissomethingyvou should incorporate into your treatment.\n【save__datas】\t【641】\tFacial Rehabilitation\n【save__datas】\t【642】\tFacial rehabilitation therapy is another known method used to promote recovery among patients affected by Bell’s palsy. It incorporates various methods such as facialeexercise； massages and stretching techniques that help people relearn facial movements and develop stronger movement control as well.\n【save__datas】\t【643】\tSuccessful treatment and the subsequent choice of therapy for Bell’s palsy depends on determining the cause of the condition. Once the diagnosis is confirmed， it is also important to assess the severity of the symptoms and how long you've had this condition before any therapy is started.\n【save__datas】\t【644】\tAn expert of facial rehabilitation will assess your diagnosis and will refer you to a speech or language therapist depending on your symptoms and present situation.\n【save__datas】\t【645】\tWhat Will You Experience?\n【save__datas】\t【646】\tWondering what happens in this rehabilitation therapy? Here are a few things that you can expect from a specialized therapist：\n【save__datas】\t【647】\t1\\. Initial sessions with the therapist will involve the assessment of symptoms and condition. Patients may be asked about their existing symptoms， and they will also be asked what improves or worsens their condition.\n【save__datas】\t【648】\t2\\. Medical history can also be reviewed to help the therapist evaluate the patient’s condition. From these assessment results， the specialist will be able to develop an individualized plan for therapy.\n【save__datas】\t【649】\t3\\. Typically， facial electromyography (EMG)is an essentialpart in the diagnosis of patients with Bell’s palsy. It helps detect the presence of the condition and evaluates the extent of damage to the facial nerve. This also helps the therapist get an idea of the rate of recovery. There is no need to worry about this test. It is a simple， painless procedure and will not take much time.\n【save__datas】\t【650】\t4\\. If the therapist doesn’t have access to an EMG machine， he or she can evaluate the condition through careful inspection of facial features including the cheeks， lips， brows， etc. The therapist might ask patients to raise their eyebrows， close their eyes or smile widely. Through these actions， the therapist will be able to observe the symmetry and movement of the face. This will also help evaluate nerve functions.\n【save__datas】\t【651】\t5\\. After this， the therapist will be able to judge the extent of weakness of the facial muscles. Subsequently， patients will be guided as to how they can protect their face and eyes. Therapists will perform the role of a coach and educate patients about how they can perform their daily life functions with this condition.\n【save__datas】\t【652】\t6\\. If patients have severe problems， such as extremely dry eyes or slurred speech， the therapist may refer them to a specialist. An ophthalmologist (a physician who specializes in the surgical or medical care of the eyes) or language therapist would then be able to manage the specific symptoms.\n【save__datas】\t【653】\tGuidance and Useful Advice\n【save__datas】\t【654】\tPatients may receive various wellness advice regarding treatment and care.\n【save__datas】\t【655】\tUsually， caregivers offer suggestions and guidance concerning the following issues：\n【save__datas】\t【656】\tEye Protection and Care\n【save__datas】\t【657】\t1.. Your therapist will advise you to protect your eye from becoming infected and dry. Artificial tears and eye patches are highly recommended for maximum protection.\n【len<10_filter】\t【658】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【659】\t. Patients are also encouraged to blink their eyes. By covering their eyelids with their fingertips， patients can learn to how to imitate blinking. This is particularly important to keep the eye moist and protected from external debris.\n【save__datas】\t【660】\tManaging Daily-life Activities Such As Eating and Oral Hygiene\n【save__datas】\t【661】\tDue to the loss of control of the lips and mouth， Bell’s palsy makes it difficult for people to eat and drink normally. Patients will be guided to eat in a way that they do not bite their lips or cheeks.\n【save__datas】\t【662】\tTherapists can also inform patients to pay special attention to their oral health. Bell’s palsy affects the production of saliva and decreases sensation on the paralyzed side of the mouth. Therapists suggest regular brushing to ensure good oral hygiene.\n【save__datas】\t【663】\tSpeech Support\n【save__datas】\t【664】\tSpeech may be mildly slurred due to this condition. Patients may receive advice on how to work on this problem. Therapists might suggest various facial exercises to overcome this difficulty.\n【save__datas】\t【665】\tCustomized Home Exercise Plan\n【save__datas】\t【666】\tAfter the careful inspection of medicall records and facial functions， the rehabilitation therapist will brief the patient about the various treatment options based on the diagnosis and particular symptoms.\n【save__datas】\t【667】\t1\\. One of the unique aspects of facial rehabilitation is that each treatment and therapy is designed according to the special needs of the patient. This typically involves an individualized exercise plan that can be carried out at home by patients themselves.\n【save__datas】\t【668】\t2\\. The customized home exercise plan aims topromote symmetrical and synchronized facial movement. With regular and consistent implementation of the program， patients exhibit considerable improvement in facial functions. It is a great plan due the fact that it reduces the number of billed clinic hours and increases overall practice hours.\n【save__datas】\t【669】\t3\\. In order to enhance the patient's understanding and to keep a track on recovery，therapistscan alsoincorporate photographicand video assessments.\n【save__datas】\t【670】\t4\\. Patients are educated regarding their facial anatomy and working of the facial nerve. It is an integralpart of the therapy plan. Once patients understand how their face functions， it is easier for them to monitor and keep track of their recovery.\n【save__datas】\t【671】\t5\\. Initially， patients are trained to carry out small facial movements. They are advised to use mirrors for help. Remember， therapists don’t want to cause muscular fatigue on the affected side of the face. Thus， the exercise sessions are kept short.\n【save__datas】\t【672】\t6\\. Once the recovery starts， assisted facial movements become part of the exercise plan. They help patients relearn facial movements and focus on the symmetry of these movements.\n【save__datas】\t【673】\t7\\. The side of the face that is affected by Bell’s palsy suffers from muscle tightness and patients may experience spasms as well. Therefore， one vital part of this rehabilitation therapy is relaxing these muscles and facial nerve. This involves stretching techniques that help reduce stiffness in the affected facial muscles.\n【save__datas】\t【674】\t8\\. Some patients experience abnormal patterns of muscle movement due to Bell’s palsy. This condition is referred as synkinesis， which we discussed earlier. The home plan addresses these issues as well and involves massage techniques that don't only prevent muscular spasms， but also reduce these involuntary movements.\n【save__datas】\t【675】\tHere are a few things that you need to keep in mind：\n【save__datas】\t【676】\t1\\. Avoid urgency and do not excessively strain your muscles when performing the home exercise plan designed by your therapist. The facial nerve takes time to heal and regeneration takes place slowly and gradually， so be gentle.\n【save__datas】\t【677】\tIf you try to put in extra effort to move these affected muscles， it may cause abnormal movement patterns.\n【save__datas】\t【681】\tOnce you start to regain control of facial movements， visit your therapist to upgrade your home exercise plan. Required adjustments to the plan will be made by the therapist depending on your needs and progress. You may have to be patient throughout this process. Rehabilitation therapy takes time and a lot of commitment. But bear in mind， this is your key to success.\n【save__datas】\t【682】\t3\\. Just a friendly reminder - do not cheat. Needless to say， good compliance is crucial in achieving your desired results.\n【save__datas】\t【683】\t4\\. Another important thing - practice every day! It is recommended to remain in touch with your therapist via phone or email if you cannot visit in person. This way you can communicate your concerns and queries and the therapist may be able to address them over the phone.\n【save__datas】\t【684】\tB-Vitamins Therapy\n【save__datas】\t【685】\tVitamins are necessary for your body to function properly. The B-vitamins collectively are included under the list of essential 'micronutrients' and are quite useful in converting proteins and carbohydrates into energy. Also， there is a strong link between the B-vitamins， i.e.B-1， B-6， B-12 and cell repair.\n【save__datas】\t【686】\tYou can get B-vitamins by consuming enriched whole grains， dark green vegetables， nuts， and most meat and dairy products. It is a good idea to talk about your specific vitamin B requirements with your healthcare provider before adding any multi-vitamins or supplements to your diet.\n【save__datas】\t【687】\tA study held at Oregon State University concluded that athletes who lack B-vitamins in their diet are unable to repair damaged cells and muscles at the same pace as their peers who consume a diet rich in vitamin B. Even a minor vitamin B deficiency can result in reduced performance and poor muscle recovery.\n【save__datas】\t【688】\tAddingB-vitamins to your diet can help speed up recoveryand ease the symptoms of facial paralysis.\n【save__datas】\t【690】\tVitamin B-12 plays a vital role in the maintenance of various physiological functions. Vitamin B-12 is required for metabolism (the way your body breaks down nutrients to release energy)， red blood cell production and the maintenance--connect--【691】of the central nervous system. Vitamin B-12's positive effect on the nervous system may play a supportive role in the treatment of Bell’s palsy. Simply put， adding a vitamin B-12 supplement to your diet will help boost facial nerve repair and growth.\n【save__datas】\t【692】\tIt's also an option to have vitamin B-12 injections to treat Bell’s palsy. These injections are administered directly into the affected side of the face， and are thought to help by stimulating the facial nerve and reducing inflammation， and can speed up recovery\n【save__datas】\t【693】\tAs with any mineral and vitamin supplement， or other type of treatment， consult your doctor prior to adding vitamin B supplements to your diet plan.\n【len<10_filter】\t【694】\tRemember\n【save__datas】\t【695】\tVitamin B12not only actively protectsnerves， but it also reduces nerve inflammation.\n【save__datas】\t【696】\tMany people prefer to use natural vitamin B-12 to speed up recovery instead of steroids.\n【save__datas】\t【698】\tAdding vitamin B-1 to your diet may prove beneficial in reducing the duration of paralysis. It may bring the total recovery time down from 3 to 4 weeks to less than 3 weeks.\n【save__datas】\t【700】\tPyridoxine or vitamin B-6 is used by your body to convert food into glucose. This vitamin also plays an important part in making the nervous system run smoothly， and this is why you can use Pyridoxine to help relieve symptoms of Bell's palsy. Studies show that vitamin B-6 can help restore the facial nerve.\n【save__datas】\t【701】\tWhat you need to remember is that most supportive care for Bell’s palsy is probably sitting in your kitchen or medicine cupboard already.\n【save__datas】\t【702】\tAcupuncture\n【save__datas】\t【703】\tConventional methods of treatingBell's palsy include the use of steroids， physical therapy and surgical procedures. The chances of recovery are increased if you start treating the condition quickly. In addition to the standard procedures， complete restoration of nerve function is also possible with the use of alternative--connect--【704】treatment methods. One such treatment is acupuncture.\n【save__datas】\t【705】\tCredit： Facial acupuncture’by mscaprikell from Wikipedia Commons(https：//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File：Facial acupuncture.ipg) under the\n【save__datas】\t【706】\tCreative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic\n【save__datas】\t【707】\tRecent medicalresearch suggeststhat acupuncture can help alleviate the symptoms of Bell’s palsy. In fact， the practice of acupuncture to treat Bell's palsy is growing in popularity worldwide. Acupuncture is a Chinese medical technique that has been used for generations. It involves the insertion of fine needles into the skin. It is practiced not only to cure diseases or relieve pain， but also to improve general health and well-being. Today， this ancient practice is used to treat a wide variety of health conditions globally.\n【save__datas】\t【708】\tThis Chinese technique is believed to stimulate the central nervous system， which in turn affects the release of useful biochemical substances such as neurotransmitters and hormones. The release of these substances boosts your body’s in-built natural healing system and promotes emotional and physical wellbeing.\n【save__datas】\t【709】\tWhat Happens in Acupuncture?\n【save__datas】\t【710】\tAcupuncture is generally recommended twice a week. These sessions help improve the overall facial nerve function and tone of facial muscles among Bell's palsy patients.\n【save__datas】\t【711】\tAs mentioned earlier， a typical acupuncture session will involve inserting very fine needles into your skin at specific points. The primary aim of this practice is--connect--【712】to balance the flow of energy in your body.\n【save__datas】\t【713】\tAs these thin needles move through the layers of your skin， they are believed to rebalance the flow of energyinside the body. This condition is sometimes referred to as ‘Wind Attack’ among the traditional Chinese.\n【save__datas】\t【714】\tBell's palsy according to Traditional Chinese medicine is said to develop due to exposure to wind that causes inflammation of the facial nerve. This results in qi or chi (vital energy) deficiency and the disruption of natural blood flow. Qi， also pronounced chi， is translated as life force or natural energy. Therefore， acupuncture sessions specifically target the effect of wind on the body and seek to improve blood circulation to the face and stimulate qi.\n【save__datas】\t【715】\tFor successful recovery， traditional Chinese medicine practitioners recommend a combination of herbs to be used along with routine acupuncture. According to Chinese medicine experts， a weak and deficient immunesystem is also responsible for the development of Bell’s palsy. They believe that if your body has a strong， healthy defense mechanism， your chances of being affected by Bell's palsy are minimal. Therefore， certified acupuncturists also place a strong emphasis on maintaining a healthy lifestyle.\n【save__datas】\t【716】\tYour acupuncture session with a certified therapist might include numerous tips on staying stress-free and following a nutritious diet plan. Make sure you avoid stress and get an ample amount of rest throughout your acupuncture treatment.\n【save__datas】\t【717】\tThe main reason acupuncture is becoming such a popular option for Bell’s palsy treatment is that it has a very holistic approach. Not only will you notice an improvement in your symptoms， but your body’s natural healing mechanism is also given a boost. If you are apprehensive about using steroids that might cause certain side effects， then acupuncture is an excellent alternative. However like most treatments， this ancient medicine practice also has a slight possibility of adverse effects.\n【save__datas】\t【718】\tWhat Are the Risks?\n【save__datas】\t【719】\tAccording to several independent surveys， acupuncture is found to be harmless； however， it is always advised that you visit a qualified， reputable practitioner. The risk of serious side effects in acupuncture is minimal -it is seen to be less than 1 in 10，000.\n【save__datas】\t【720】\tStill， 8-12% of patients undergoing treatment may experience some minor side effects such as：\n【save__datas】\t【721】\t1\\. Drowsiness or tiredness\n【save__datas】\t【722】\tThis is a typical reaction after acupuncture and should not be a matter of great concern. Your body needs rest in order to boost its natural healing mechanism， so make sure you’re getting enough sleep.\n【save__datas】\t【723】\t2\\. Feeling soreness and pain where needles are inserted in the skin\n【save__datas】\t【724】\tYou may feel sore at specific points where the needles are inserted， but this pain normally dispels in less than 24 hours.\n【save__datas】\t【725】\t3\\. Bleeding or bruising\n【save__datas】\t【726】\tThe majority of patients don’t experience these symptoms. In some cases， bruising or bleeding might occur on the area being treated.\n【save__datas】\t【727】\t4\\. Fainting\n【save__datas】\t【728】\tFor anxious patients or those afraid of needles， certain side effects such as fainting and vomiting can become a concern. It can be a physically intense process for faint-hearted patients， so make sure you consult your therapist for further advice.\n【save__datas】\t【729】\t5\\. Other risks\n【save__datas】\t【730】\tSerious risks such as infections and tissue damage are particularly uncommon. A professionally trained practitioner uses only disposable needles for the treatment and is well-versed in anatomy. Please do not hesitate in discussing safety issues with your acupuncturist before you begin treatment.\n【save__datas】\t【731】\tIs Acupuncture Right for Me?\n【save__datas】\t【732】\tPeople who have bleedingdisordersSSsuch as hemophilia shouldavoid acupuncture. This is because there can be a possible danger of bleeding from the area the needle was inserted. This also applies to patients who are taking anticoagulants for blood thinning.These medicationsprevent blood from clotting. So before having an acupuncture treatment， do not forget to seek advice--connect--【733】from your doctor if you have any such disorders.\n【save__datas】\t【734】\tPregnant women should also seek the advice of their doctor before beginning acupuncture treatment. In general， acupuncture is highlyeffective during pregnancy because it reduces pain.\n【save__datas】\t【735】\tPeople with pacemakers must avoid electro-acupuncture. Acupuncture has different variations， and it’s not always about the insertion of needles. Some treatments require electrical stimulation. So for patients who have pacemakers， this could be bothersome or extremely harmful as it may disrupt the function of the device.\n【save__datas】\t【736】\tIf you have metal allergies， especially to stainless steel， acupuncture may not be a good option for you. Moreover， patients with unstable diabetes and immune disorders must seek expert advice before having acupuncture.\n【save__datas】\t【737】\tSpeech Therapy\n【save__datas】\t【738】\tSome people experience speech problems due to Bell’s palsy. This is because the facial nerve has the responsibility of keeping facial muscles toned and is responsible for lip movements required for clear speech.. So because of the malfunction of the facial nerve in Bell’s palsy， patients experience either partial or complete facial weakness.\n【save__datas】\t【739】\tThose affected with Bell’s palsy may find it hard to pronounce certain words correctly， especially those with the letters B and P. However， the trouble in talking typically depends on the severity of muscle weakness.\n【save__datas】\t【740】\tPatients become reluctant to talk to other people and become very embarrassed due to their slurred speech. This is particularlyawkward for school-going children who develop Bell’s palsy. Sadly， they can turn out to be an easy target for bullying and teasing at school.\n【save__datas】\t【741】\tIn addition， patients whosecareersrequire talkingto others or giving presentations have to deal with several challenges. Because of slurred speech， they may become self-conscious， which may affect the quality of their work. This is typically true for professions such as acting， teaching， training or sales.\n【save__datas】\t【742】\tAs I've mentioned throughout the book， you should not worry. The majority of people affected with Bell’s palsy show no signs of slurred speech once they recover completely. Here are some simple tips that are particularly significant in dealing with speech difficulties：\n【save__datas】\t【743】\t1\\. Keep your head held high while talking. One of the best tips to speak in a better manner is to keep your head held high while talking. For instance， if you have to speak in class， don’t tuck your chin downwards into your chest. Always project your voice by looking straight in front of you. This will help you sound clear.\n【save__datas】\t【744】\t2\\. Keep your conversation short. Weariness and fatigue can also aggravate speech problems in people suffering from Bell’s palsy. In this situation； you may consider cutting your sentences and conversation a bit short. You may useegestures， eye contact aandother facialexpressions to help you communicate efficiently.\n【save__datas】\t【745】\t3\\. If you are trying to speak in a hurry， it will in no way help your cause. Always slow down and take your time. Pause- frequently， speak slowly and don’t get stressed. Try to use small sentences to convey your message. Others will find it easier to comprehend what you are saying.\n【save__datas】\t【746】\tOther Helpful Suggestions\n【save__datas】\t【747】\t1\\. If you have to give a presentation or talk to clients who aren't aware of your speech problem， you may let them know beforehand. It is also a good idea to ask for feedback from your listeners. For example， you can ask them whether they understand you or not.\n【save__datas】\t【748】\t2\\. Since dry mouth can also be a problem with Bell’s palsy， it is advised to take frequent sips of water throughout the conversation. If you have an excessively dry mouth， you may consider usingsaliva stimulantsOr artificial saliva that can help moisten the mouth. Your healthcare provider can provide more information about this.\n【save__datas】\t【749】\t3\\. It is always recommended to face the audience while speaking. This enables them to read your lips and understand what you are saying. Also try to reduce any distractions in the surroundingarea while you speak. For instance， you may turn off the television or other background sounds so that listeners can hear you without any trouble.\n【save__datas】\t【750】\tSpeech Therapy for Children\n【save__datas】\t【751】\tChildren who are born with Bell’s palsy have to experience greater difficulty--connect--【752】when it comes to slurred speech. They require specialized help such as coaching from a certified speech and language therapist as early as possible.\n【save__datas】\t【753】\tAfter some basic diagnosis and assessment， therapists will be able to advise you on management and support for speech problems your child experiences. In many cases， qualified therapists not only give counseling and guidance regarding effective communication techniques to parents and the child， but also to teachers to facilitate the child’s learning at home and school.\n【save__datas】\t【754】\tAlternative Treatments for Bell's Palsy\n【save__datas】\t【755】\tThere are several alternative treatments that Bell’s palsy suffers can take to help alleviate their problem.\n【save__datas】\t【756】\tMethyl-Sulphonyl-Methane (MSM)\n【save__datas】\t【757】\tMethyl-Sulphonyl-Methane (MSM) is a sulphur-containing nutrient that can be found in a lot of the foods we eat. MSM acts as an anti-inflammatory and as such will be a benefit to Bells’ palsy sufferers. By taking 500 mg of MSM three times a day will allow MSM to provide its anti-inflammatory properties for Bell's palsy sufferers.\n【save__datas】\t【758】\tHistamine\n【save__datas】\t【759】\tAlthough， if taken in large amounts histamine can be toxic to the body however if it is used in small amounts it is very effective in reducing inflammation and is beneficial for Bell’s palsy sufferers. Histamine is not available in tablet form but thenutrient carnosine regulates the production of histamine and--connect--【761】it is recommended that a daily dose of 100 mg will help Bell’s palsy sufferers.\n【save__datas】\t【762】\tAdenosine Triphosphate (ATP)\n【save__datas】\t【763】\tThe chemical Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) has been proven to produce energy within cells. Experiments in combining ATP with the likes of vitamins B1， B2， B6 or B12 have shown that this combination can have an impact in the recovery from Bell’s palsy. The results from the experiments showed that 100% of the patients who suffered with partial paralysis of the nerve， and approximately 87%of the patients who suffered with full paralysis recovered completely. Whereas approximately only 67% of the patients treated with steroids recovered.\n【save__datas】\t【764】\tAcetyl-L-Carnitine\n【save__datas】\t【765】\tThe anti-inflammatory compound acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALC) has been found to--connect--【766】improvethe symptoms of Bell’s palsy. ALC has been used for several neurological diseases such as nerve weakness， memory problems and nerve injuries. ALC has the ability to reduce any damage that is created by free radicals and it helps to preserve the production of energy within the nerve cells and as such stabilizes the nerve's membrane.\n【save__datas】\t【767】\tDamage to the facial nerve affects how your face looks and also causes facial expressions (smiling， frowning， etc.) to become asymmetrical. There are various surgical options for the management of Bell’s palsy. These include treatments for restoring the smile and facial balance， corrective surgeries such as face lifts， brow lifts and other muscle relaxing procedures.\n【save__datas】\t【768】\tThese treatments are known to enhance the appearance of the face， but do not necessarily improve muscle function. It should be kept in mind that these procedures may not completely restore natural facial expressions or natural movement. But they can improve the patient’s quality of life since the condition isn’t as apparent.\n【save__datas】\t【769】\tCorrective surgery truly helps patients regain their confidence. Nevertheless， there are many people who have developed Bell’s palsy and continue to live contentedly without any surgery. You also have to keep in mind that there are always risks associated with surgery. Let’s take a look at some of these risks.\n【save__datas】\t【770】\tOculoplastic Surgery\n【save__datas】\t【771】\tThe foremost aim of this treatment is to enhance eye comfort and protect vision. Due to Bell’s palsy， patients may experience eyelid retraction that can cause droopy eyebrows. This condition can be very painful as well. Oculoplastic surgery not only enhances the appearance of the eyes but is helpful in addressing problems such as watering of the eyes and incomplete eyelid closure.\n【save__datas】\t【772】\tThis surgery involves a wide range of surgical procedures that involve the eyelids， orbit， face， and tear ducts. Therefore， this is the ideal type of surgery that people with Bell’s palsy choose to undergo.\n【save__datas】\t【773】\tEyelid Surgery\n【save__datas】\t【774】\tMost people with Bell’s palsy have difficulty closing their eyelid. As previously discussed， this puts the eye at immense danger of infection or injury. Some patients may observe the improvement of eyelid function without any treatment. But those who experience lasting effects of Bell's palsy should not lose hope. Eyelid surgery helps these patients pull through the problem and protect their eye.\n【save__datas】\t【775】\tDuring Bell's palsy， the eyebrow may droop， and the upper eyelid may not close completely. Similarly， the lower eyelid may sag. This exposes your eye to the environment making it more susceptible to damage， discomfort and visual impairment. The main aim of eye surgery is to reduce discomfort. The surgery is also very effective in preserving vision.\n【save__datas】\t【776】\tAs with any surgicalprocedure， there are certain risks associated with eye surgery. Remember， there are various other treatments， surgeries and therapies that are helpful for people suffering from Bell’s palsy. You can discuss possible options with your doctor before making a final decision.\n【save__datas】\t【777】\tI've come across many people who live a very happy life even though they decided against having any surgical corrections. It really depends on what makes you happy as a person. If you can live with the fact that you have a droopy eye， then more power to you. However， if you don’t want to deal with a droopy eye for life， you may choose to go under the knife.\n【save__datas】\t【778】\tUpper Eyelid Surgery\n【save__datas】\t【779】\tThis surgery helps the upper lid cover more of the cornea and patients can close over 75% of their eye. Usually， it involves the surgical implantation of gold eyelid weights. The weights help the eyelid close with the help of gravity.\n【save__datas】\t【780】\tGold eyelid weights can be implanted in an outpatient procedure. You can go back home the very same day. Once gold weights are attached to the eyelid，you can close the eyelid immediately. Minor bruising and swelling of the area is quite common， but it goes away in a few weeks.\n【save__datas】\t【781】\tThere can be a slight bump on the eyelid where the weights are implanted. A qualified surgeon may place the gold implants in a place where they remain hidden. The reason gold weights are used is that the metal does not irritate a patient’s skin. Gold weights are also safe to be used during an MRI.\n【save__datas】\t【782】\tThe risk of upper eyelid surgery is that it can be difficult to control the position of the upper lid. If the eyelid still remains high， a repeat surgery may be required. Sometimes the weight may be too heavy， which will be seen as a bulky mass through the upper eyelid. The use of heavy weights can also blur your vision.\n【save__datas】\t【783】\tLower Eyelid Surgery\n【save__datas】\t【784】\tSurgical correction of the lower eyelid is done to reduce watering and allow the--connect--【785】eye to close more. The inner part of the lower eyelid on the affected side is stitched to the inner part of the upper eyelid. The procedure is short and can be performed under local anesthesia. However， the lower eyelid may droop or sag again in the future after surgery.\n【save__datas】\t【786】\tLiftingthe central part of the lower eyelid requires a more complicated procedure. Also known as a scaffold procedure， it involves inserting tissue (from the ear or nose) into the center of the eyelid.\n【save__datas】\t【787】\tEyebrow Surgery\n【save__datas】\t【788】\tAn eyebrow lift is done in the area where the eyebrow is drooping. An incision is made above the eyebrow where tissue is removed， and the eyebrow is“fastened”to the deeper tissue of the forehead. Other eyebrow lifting methods involve the positioning of deep stitches that lift the eyebrow. The latter requires smaller incisions.\n【save__datas】\t【789】\tWhile eyebrow lifting surgeries are successful， the eyebrow may droop or fall again due to the continuing effect of gravity.\n【save__datas】\t【790】\tEye Care during Bell's Palsy\n【save__datas】\t【791】\tEye care is enormously essential in the early stages of Bell’s palsy. Due to the damage to the facial rnerve， certain functions such as blinkingand eyelid movement are disturbed. Therefore， extra care must be taken to keep the eyes moist and protected from external debris and dust.\n【save__datas】\t【792】\tSymptoms and Effects on the Eye\n【save__datas】\t【793】\tThe ability to blink， in many people， is adversely affected because of Bell's palsy. Patients are unable to close their eyes properly. The upper eyelid retraction and drooping of the lower lid causes incomplete closure of the eye. This results in excessive dryness.\n【save__datas】\t【794】\tRemember， if the eye is not lubricated， it could have severe implications such as exposure keratitis， permanent vision impairment and in some， cases blindness as well.\n【save__datas】\t【795】\tUsually， a normal person blinks every 5-7 seconds. Each time we blink， a film of tears spreads smoothly across the eye. However， Bell’s palsy disrupts this function， and it becomes difficult for the eyelid on the affected side to shut completely. This exposes your eye to dryness and irritation. Remember， dry eyes--connect--【796】are more susceptible to scratches from foreign objects. Deeper scratches can also cause scarring. Unfortunately， lasting damage to the cornea can also take place if the eye is not properly cared for.\n【save__datas】\t【797】\tCheck Your Signs\n【save__datas】\t【798】\tIf your eyes feel uncomfortable， do not overlook the issue. You may experience a stinging or burning sensation in the eye due to dryness.\n【save__datas】\t【799】\tSome individuals with Bell’s palsy also experience crocodile tear syndrome. In this complication， the person tears excessively while eating. This is usually seen when a person is recovering but can also appear with the onset of the condition.\n【save__datas】\t【800】\tIf your eyes feel dry， you may use artificial tears， commonly available at any drug store or supermarket. These eye drops will alleviate the stinging， burning sensation and also help maintain moisture in the eyes. It is advisable to look for preservative free eye drops. They have fewer additives and are usually labeled as non-allergic. You may use them 4-5 times a day at least， and of course each time your eyes feel dry.\n【save__datas】\t【801】\tDuring the night， it’s important to keep the eye protected. Using an eye ointment along with a patch on the affected eye will help the eye remain moist while sleeping. eventape your eye shut so that it remains protected overnight.\n【save__datas】\t【802】\tIf you have Bell’s palsy， it is advised first to consult your doctor before starting with an eye care regime. You doctor may refer you to an optometrist if the eye symptoms get worse.\n【save__datas】\t【803】\tCosmetic Reconstructive Options to Regain Facial Muscle Function\n【save__datas】\t【804】\tThere are cosmetic reconstructive options that may help regain muscle function after Bell's palsy.\n【save__datas】\t【805】\tBrow-lifts， removal of excess eyelid skin， muscle relaxation procedures and facelifts are popularly used to improve facial appearance. Let's take a look at some of the more common procedures people opt for if they have Bell’s palsy.\n【save__datas】\t【806】\tFacial Nerve Decompression\n【save__datas】\t【807】\tDecompression of the facial nerve relieves pressure and is usually done via a delicate microsurgical procedure. Pieces of the bone behind the ear are removed--connect--【808】so that the nerve has adequate space to expand.\n【save__datas】\t【809】\tWhile this minor surgery is shown to produce a difference in some types of nerve damage， its use in Bell’s palsy is still debatable.\n【save__datas】\t【810】\tMedical experts， in fact， regard facial nerve decompression in Bell’s palsy as a highly controversial treatment. This is because there are serious medical risks involved. The most common complications include permanent damage to the 7th cranial nerve and hearing loss. In addition， there is no significant evidence that rates facial nerve compression a better alternative to standard medication.\n【save__datas】\t【811】\tIf facial nerve decompression is to be done for Bell’s palsy， it should be done within three weeks of the symptoms first appearing. Statistics shows that once three weeks are over； there’s no point in enduring the pain of surgery and the potential risks.\n【save__datas】\t【812】\tHypoglossal and Facial Nerve Graft Repair\n【save__datas】\t【813】\tNerve graft repairs can be used to improve muscle function as well as enhance facial appearance. However， these are complex surgical procedures and should only be considered after careful analysis of a patient's condition.\n【save__datas】\t【814】\tGraftingnerves seems like a good way ttoo rreessttoore muscle appearance and function， but if not performed correctly， nerve graft repairs can leave a person with worse nerve paralysis than prior to surgery.\n【save__datas】\t【815】\tOne type of nerve graft repair commonly employed involves connecting the hypoglossal nerve， i.e. the nerve that controls the tongue to the facial nerve. Once the surgery is done， the patient is taught how to move the face by carefully controlled tongue movements. Most people learn the technique gradually. This type of nerve graft is likely to end with a loss of sensation in the tongue.\n【save__datas】\t【816】\tWeakness in the tongue might also affect eating and swallowing.\n【save__datas】\t【817】\tAnesthesia Complications\n【save__datas】\t【818】\tBell’s palsy surgery itself is not usually very complex； however， some people may react adversely to anesthesia. They may face increased heart rate or high blood pressure when given anesthesia.\n【save__datas】\t【819】\tBleeding Problems\n【save__datas】\t【820】\tAnother possible complication of surgery is excessive bleeding. Certain patients--connect--【821】may bleed more than others due to existing health conditions， which is why it is essential for the patient to consult their physician before they opt for corrective surgery. In the case of excessive bleeding， the patient may need a blood transfusion， which is prohibited in certain religions. So it is always wise to talk to your doctor beforehand to fully understand the risks of surgery.\n【save__datas】\t【822】\tDelayed Healing During Recovery\n【save__datas】\t【823】\tAs human beings， we are all unique in the way we respond to surgery. The same goes with the recovery process. While some people have a swift recovery after surgery， others may take longer. If the recovery period is far beyond the normal range， it is bound to cause the patient some stress and anxiety.\n【save__datas】\t【824】\tChapter Eight： Bell Palsy Exercises\n【save__datas】\t【825】\tIt is best not to start any exercises until there are clear signs that the facial nerve is recovering and sending impulses to the muscles. Be sure to get approval from your doctor before starting an exercise regime.\n【save__datas】\t【826】\tEarly Stages of Recovery\n【save__datas】\t【827】\tDuring the early stages on the road to recovery， facial massage is highly recommended.\n【save__datas】\t【828】\tStage One\n【save__datas】\t【829】\tGently massage the corner of the mouth， making your way up towards the ear with the help of your fingers. Then in a circular pattern， move the fingers down towards the jaw bone area. These circular movements are also beneficial for the forehead and chin area. Softly tap your skin with the help of your fingertips.\n【save__datas】\t【830】\tYou may use a makeup brush or an electric toothbrush or simply your fingers for the following massage：\n【save__datas】\t【831】\tMassage your forehead upwards (in your hairline’s direction) 3-4 times. Perform the same movements on your cheeks.\n【save__datas】\t【832】\tStage Two\n【save__datas】\t【833】\tIf you feel sore or experience spasms or stiffness at any particular point while carrying out your exercise regime， do not worry. It is advised to exert and hold pressure at that point for at least 15 seconds. This helps to relax the muscles.\n【save__datas】\t【834】\tOnce the facial nerve has begun to recover， this set of exercises can be performed. It is always a good idea to perform these movements in front of a mirror. This way， you will be able to focus on the particular muscles. But bear in mind - never overexert your muscles. You may repeat these exercises 3-4 times a day for better results， however don’t overdo it. As you can guess， good compliance is necessary to get a more fruitful outcome.\n【save__datas】\t【835】\tFor the Eyebrows\n【save__datas】\t【836】\tTry raising your eyebrows slowly. Make sure that the corner of the mouth does not move upwards. Hold your pose for about 10 seconds， i.e. give a slight pause.\n【save__datas】\t【837】\tKeep the muscles around the mouth extremely relaxed. Then repeat the movement.\n【save__datas】\t【838】\tIf you have trouble moving the eyebrow on the affected side of the face， you may use your fingertips for assistance in the movement. Keeping your fingertips just above the eyebrows will help you raise them without trouble. This action can be repeated five times.\n【save__datas】\t【839】\tOnce you have become accustomed to this， you may stop using your fingertips to raise your brows. Instead， start involving the forehead muscles in this activity.\n【save__datas】\t【840】\tUsing the same guidelines as above， you may also wrinkle your forehead. It is a great way to relearn symmetrical facial movements. Now bring the eyebrows downwards and frown.\n【save__datas】\t【841】\tIn the next exercise， do not move your eyebrow； instead open your eyes wide. This will help you assess if any improper muscle movements are taking place. If you feel you’re not doing something right， seek help from a certified Bell's palsy therapist.\n【save__datas】\t【842】\tOther Exercises\n【save__datas】\t【843】\tFor Your Eyes\n【save__datas】\t【844】\tClose your eyes slowly and make sure your eyebrow does not move downward. Place your fingers below and above your eye socket and stretch your eye slowly to a completely open position. Hold for a slow count of four. You may have to stretch a bit further and then pull your fingers back to close the eye.\n【save__datas】\t【845】\tThe functionality of your eye is affected the most due to Bell’s palsy. So while keeping the rest of the face as calm as possible， close one eye. You may also wink lightly with one eye and do it again with the other. Bear in mind， you should perform this movement very gently and as best as you can. Do not exert extra pressure on your eyes.\n【save__datas】\t【846】\tIf you’re not able to get it perfect the first time， there’s no reason to worry. You can always seek help from a reputed Bell’s palsy therapist to master the movement. If there's any significant pain or discomfort， consult your doctor immediately.\n【save__datas】\t【847】\tFor the Nose\n【save__datas】\t【848】\tWrinkle your nose and flare your nostrils as you may do when you smell something unpleasant. This will help use muscles around the nasal area.\n【save__datas】\t【849】\tExercise for Cheeks\n【save__datas】\t【850】\tPuffing your cheeks is also a useful way to exercise the facial muscles. Using your fingers， seal your lips， and puff your cheeks out. Do this as symmetrically as you can. For best results， practice in front of a mirror. Blow your cheeks out at least five times.\n【save__datas】\t【851】\tWith your fingers on your front teeth， gently move them along to the back of your teeth， to around where the molars are located. Molars are the largest teeth in your mouth. While doingso， stretch your cheeks and move your fingers underneath the gums. This is a good way to revive flexibility of the cheeks.\n【save__datas】\t【852】\tRestore Your Smile\n【save__datas】\t【853】\tA smile with your mouth closed is also an integral part of this exercise regime. Move the corners of your mouth to an outward position into a smile. To assist this movement， you may place your finger on the side of the mouth. And if it is difficult smiling on the affected side， you may place your hand over it and then push out and up into a smile.\n【save__datas】\t【854】\tIt’s a good idea to begin smiling， first without showing your teeth. After that， smile with your teeth showing.\n【save__datas】\t【855】\tLip Movements\n【save__datas】\t【856】\tYou may also move the corner of the mouth with your fingers and smoothly push outwards and say feee’. Similarly， position your fingers on each side of the--connect--【857】mouth and push your lips outwards. And say ‘ooo’. Now practice by saying these words repeatedly in this order： aaa...ooo...eee.\n【save__datas】\t【858】\tPractice pressing your lips together. Then pushing forward， pucker your lips as if though you’re ready to give a kiss. Now release them. It is always a good idea to perform this exercise in front of a mirror.\n【save__datas】\t【859】\tDue to Bell’s palsy， it becomes difficult to articulate some sounds. Practice speaking your vowels aloud to ease slurred speech. Focus on the lip movement of each vowel； a， e， i， o and u. Make sure you speak slowly and softly.\n【save__datas】\t【860】\tChin Exercise\n【save__datas】\t【861】\tJut your chin out the best you can. After that， using a firm circular motion， massage the nose， cheeks and chin. Continue the movement from the jaw line up to your ear. Use firm strokes but take care not to exert excess pressure.\n【save__datas】\t【862】\tExercises to Assist Speech Therapy\n【save__datas】\t【863】\tMouth isolation exercises can be very beneficial for patients suffering from Bell's palsy. These exercises can enhance their speech quality and hence， make them feel more confident. These basic movements aim to improve the tone of the affected facial muscles， which helps the patient speak more clearly.\n【save__datas】\t【864】\tWarm-up Activities\n【save__datas】\t【865】\t1\\. This regime begins with simple warm up activities such as flaring--connect--【866】and--connect--【867】constricting the nostrils. You are then required to curl the upper lip up. After that， you will practice to raise and protrude the upper lip. Another easy way to practice lip movements is to pucker the lips (like you’re kissing someone) and then attempt to whistle.\n【save__datas】\t【868】\t2\\. Other exercises can also help improve facial function and will assist you in speaking clearly. For example， you can try smiling without showing teeth first and then smile with teeth. To help with the exercise， try to perform these actions in front of a mirror. You should also attempt to repeat words that have the letters B and P.\n【save__datas】\t【869】\t3\\. Rehearsing resistance exercises is also necessary to assist the toning of facial muscles that eventually makes speaking easier. For that， place your thumb and the index finger near the corner of the lips. Now try smiling as--connect--【870】wide as you can. The thumb and index finger will offer resistance. Repeat this exercise at least ten times.\n【save__datas】\t【871】\t4\\. Bell’s palsy can cause your cheek to droop， which makes it difficult to talk. Talking over the phone can be particularly troublesome because of it. You can rest your hand against your cheek when opening your mouth to speak. This may help you sound better and provide support to the ‘floppy'cheek.\n【save__datas】\t【872】\t5\\. You should also try to stimulate the droopy cheek through a tender massage. It can be performed just by massaging your cheeks in a circular motion with the help of your fingertips. All you have to do is make large strokes starting from the mouth towards the ear. You may also use ice cubes by holding them against your face， from the lips across your cheek to the ears.\n【save__datas】\t【873】\tSpecialized Facial Exercise Program to Improve Speech\n【save__datas】\t【874】\tThe following is another simple， specialized facial exercise program that can help improve your speech. These exercises involve strengthening the muscles in your tongue， lips and jaw.\n【save__datas】\t【875】\tExercises for the Tongue\n【save__datas】\t【876】\tStage One\n【save__datas】\t【877】\tStick your tongue out as far as possible and hold this position for about 5seconds. Next， do the exact opposite， i.e. retract your tongue back inside and hold it close to the ‘roof’of your mouth. Relax for 3 to 5 seconds and then move your tongue up and down， side to side with your mouth closed. You can also try pushing your tongue against your teeth followed by rest.\n【save__datas】\t【878】\tStage Two\n【save__datas】\t【879】\tIn the second stage， we will be adding more resistance to the exercises.\n【save__datas】\t【880】\tStick your tongue out and press it down gently using the back of a spoon while you try to lift it. Next， repeat the same exercise， but try to move your tongue to the left and then the right.\n【save__datas】\t【881】\tIn the final exercise， place your index finger on your affected cheek about one inch from the corner of your mouth. Now try to push this finger using your tongue from the inside of your mouth.\n【save__datas】\t【882】\tYou can do five to eight repetitions of each tongue exercise.\n【save__datas】\t【883】\tExercises for the Jaws\n【save__datas】\t【884】\tIn this exercise， you have to stretch your jaw the same way you stretched your tongue. First， open your mouth as wide as you can. Now move your lower jaw first to the left and then to the right. In the next step， try moving your jaw in a circular motion. Try doing five repetitions of each movement. You may provide resistance with your hand to help tone your jaw muscles.\n【save__datas】\t【885】\tExercising Your Lips\n【save__datas】\t【886】\tAs you know， the movement of your lips plays an important part in the way you speak. Start the exercise by smiling with your mouth closed for about five seconds. Next， hold your lips in a kissing pose for another five seconds.\n【save__datas】\t【887】\tNow， try combining the movements， i.e. smile and then pucker your lips. Make sure you fully use your facial muscles.\n【save__datas】\t【888】\tNext， squeeze your lips using a tongue depressor (the flat wooden stick with rounded corners the doctor inserts in your mouth to check your throat) or any other similar tool. Then try to pull your lips out. Finally， repeat each lip exercise five times.\n【save__datas】\t【889】\tHelpful Illustrations\n【save__datas】\t【890】\tHere are some illustrations that you will find useful.\n【save__datas】\t【891】\tEye Exercises\n【save__datas】\t【892】\tLook down\n【save__datas】\t【893】\tLightly place the back of your index finger on your eyelid to keep your eye closed\n【save__datas】\t【894】\tUsing your opposite hand gently stretch your eyebrow up， working your finger across the brow line. This helps relax your eyelid and prevents it from becoming stiff\n【save__datas】\t【895】\tNow close your eyes tightly\n【save__datas】\t【896】\tOpen your eyes and squint as if you were looking at the sun\n【save__datas】\t【897】\tFace Exercises\n【save__datas】\t【898】\tTurn the corners of the mouth up\n【save__datas】\t【899】\tPush the upper lip forward\n【save__datas】\t【900】\tSuck in the cheeks and push the lips forward\n【save__datas】\t【901】\tPush the lower lip forward\n【save__datas】\t【902】\tBring the eyebrows together in a frown\n【save__datas】\t【903】\tRaise the eyebrows--connect--【904】wrinkle the nose\n【save__datas】\t【905】\tSquint the eyes tightly\n【save__datas】\t【906】\tTurn the corners of the mouth down and tighten the muscles on the front of the neck\n【save__datas】\t【907】\tApart from psychological issues such as depression and mood swings， Bell's palsy can cause various physiological issues that impair many patients’lives.\n【save__datas】\t【908】\tEating and drinking are some of the daily tasks that become complicated to perform. Another great concern is the lack of oral hygiene. Most patients find it difficult to brush their teeth properly， especially on the side of the face that is affected by the condition. They experience difficulty opening their mouth and suffer from nagging problems such as food spilling from their mouth and dry mouth.\n【save__datas】\t【909】\tApart from the difficulty in maintaining oral hygiene， patients also complain of changes in the quantity of saliva that is produced.\n【save__datas】\t【910】\tPatients， who experience decreased production of saliva， are susceptible to tooth decay andgum disease. Remember， saliva has a crucialresponsibility of protecting your teeth.\n【save__datas】\t【911】\tTaking Care of Your Oral Health\n【save__datas】\t【912】\tDentists emphasize the significance of flossing apart from brushing your teeth twice a day. For good oral hygiene， a good quality mouthwash should also be included in your list of essentials. After every meal， it is advised to rinse the mouth thoroughly with the mouthwash as directed so that any food residue and bacteria is removed. Also don’t forget to floss so that any unwanted particles in between your teeth are removed. This will prevent bad breath.\n【save__datas】\t【914】\tDue to Bell’s palsy， the ability to chew food is also compromised. This is mainly because of the loss of muscle tone on the paralyzed side of the face. Unfortunately， the condition can cause problems for those who wear dentures. Simply put， Bell’s palsy can lead to unstable dentures. If you have false teeth， you may have topay extra attention to dental hygiene and must clean the dentures every day.\n【save__datas】\t【915】\tIf you are undergoing any procedure， it is advisable to postpone the dental treatment until you have recovered from the condition. The reason is to avoid--connect--【916】anylfatigue and stress. However， if the treatment cannot be rescheduled or delayed， make sure you inform your dentist about your condition and the medication that you are taking.\n【save__datas】\t【917】\tDentists usually use special equipment such as a rubber bite or tongue retractor for patients who have Bell’s palsy. These tools are used to control the parts of the tongue and mouth affected by the condition. Patients may find it difficult to keep the mouth open for very long. Also， they may have issues swallowing and controlling their tongue， which is why this equipment is used.\n【save__datas】\t【918】\tHere are some tips to prevent dental issues if you wear dentures：\n【save__datas】\t【919】\t1\\. The use of a mouthwash should be a vital part of your daily routine.\n【save__datas】\t【920】\t2\\. In order to avoid any sores， it is always a good idea to rinse your mouth with warm water once you have finished your meal.\n【save__datas】\t【921】\t3\\. Always take small bites of food and try to involve both sides of the mouth while chewing.\n【len<10_filter】\t【922】\t4.\n【save__datas】\t【923】\tIf you are experiencing major difficulty while swallowing food， you should have semi solid food such as pudding， yogurt， or jelly. Also， foods that have texture such as oatmeal are easier to eat.\n【save__datas】\t【924】\t5\\. You may also use straws to assist you when drinking. However， you may have to practice drinking through the straw correctly. Make sure you keep the straw in the center of the mouth while drinking. You may also support your lips with your fingertips so that your mouth forms a seal.\n【save__datas】\t【925】\tTaking Care of a Dry Mouth\n【save__datas】\t【926】\tDamage to the facial nerve as a result of Bell’s palsy causes changes in several normal physiological functions. One such problem is the production of saliva.\n【save__datas】\t【927】\tSalivary glands are stimulated by the 7th cranial nerve. But when the nerve becomes inflamed or irritated， it adversely affects the functioning of the salivary glands. Swelling and irritation of the nerve causes decreased saliva production. This results in an extreme dry mouth for some patients. The condition is also called xerostomia. This leads to other issues such as problems eating properly or throat disorders.\n【save__datas】\t【928】\tQuite often， we do not understand the importance of saliva. However， it is worth--connect--【929】mentioning that saliva plays a crucial role in keeping your mouth healthy. It performs various functions such as preventing sores and mouth ulcers due to its lubricating properties. It also helps us with our ability to taste food. It contains essential enzymes that are integral for the digestive process. Remember， it is only because of saliva that we can chew food thoroughly since it helps break down food.\n【save__datas】\t【930】\tSaliva production also helps prevent tooth loss and tooth decay， keeping the mouth clean and protected from plaque. With decreased saliva to wash away bacteria， patients with dry mouth are vulnerable to oral infections and tooth decay.\n【save__datas】\t【931】\tTreating Dry Mouth\n【save__datas】\t【932】\tThere are various ways through which you can treat dry mouth caused by Bell's palsy.\n【save__datas】\t【933】\t1\\. As discussed in the previous section， good oral hygiene is really important if you have Bell’s palsy. So brush regularly twice a day and use dental floss. It is recommended that you see your dentist every four months.\n【save__datas】\t【934】\t2\\. You should take frequent sips of water or other sugar-free drinks. One great idea is to have a bottle of water with you most of the time like athletes and fitness buffs. You can also keep a water bottle beside your bed when you go to sleep. But avoid having drinks that are very sugary. Drinks loaded with sugar may further aggravate or worsen dental complications.\n【save__datas】\t【935】\t3\\. If you experience an extremely dry mouth， you should strictly avoid alcohol and caffeine. Both alcohol and caffeine have dehydrating characteristics due to their diuretic properties. And dehydration couldcausesevere problems if you are already suffering from a dry mouth. So it’s better to increase the intake of water rather than consume these drinks. You may have decaffeinated tea if you desire.\n【len<10_filter】\t【936】\t4.\n【save__datas】\t【937】\t. If you have problems chewing food because of a dry mouth and other Bell's palsy symptoms， you can increase the quantity of sauce， broth and gravy in your meals. This will help moisten the food make it easier for you to chew and swallow. It is recommended that you avoid dry foods and bread.\n【save__datas】\t【938】\t5\\. Apart from sugary foods， it is also advised to restrict acidic foods such as citric fruits. Apart from this， you should avoid other substances such as--connect--【939】cigarettes that are known to increase dryness of the mouth.\n【save__datas】\t【940】\t6.There are certain products in the market that act as oral moisturizing agents. They include topical gels， toothpaste and mouthwash specifically designed to reduce dry mouth. You may ask your doctor to recommend a suitable product. Use the products strictly as directed.\n【save__datas】\t【941】\tNutritional Requirements for Children\n【save__datas】\t【942】\tSince children suffering from Bell’s palsy often have a compromised immune system， it is important that you pay attention to what they eat.\n【save__datas】\t【943】\tGood nutrition， as suggested by the American Dietetic Association， can rebuild and strengthen a child's immune system.\n【save__datas】\t【944】\tKids often prefer to eat semi-solid foods such as pudding， jelly and yogurt and you may add a multivitamin liquid preparation to them after consultinga certified pediatrician. It is better to stick to semi-solid and liquid foods if the child is having problems swallowing.\n【save__datas】\t【945】\tMake sure you include the following food groups in the kid’s diet plan.\n【save__datas】\t【946】\t1\\. Fruits： Try to include at least two servings of fruit per day. One serving here refers to one piece of fruit or Y2 cup canned fruit or 34 cup fruit juice or14 cup dried fruit. It’s always best to include fresh produce in your child's diet plan.\n【save__datas】\t【947】\t2\\. Milk and Dairy： Kids might not be fond of dairy products but be sure to include two servings of dairy per day. One serving includes 2 oz. cheese or1 cup of milk/yogurt. Please check with a doctor if your child is lactose intolerant.\n【save__datas】\t【948】\t3\\. Protein： Cooked lean meat， poultry or fish， beans， eggs and peanut butter can be used as ideal protein sources. Kids require two servings (85g each) of the protein group.\n【len<10_filter】\t【949】\t4.\n【save__datas】\t【950】\tWhole grains and vegetables are also valuable options that cannot be ignored. You can include six servings of the grain group and three servings of veggies throughout the day. Y cup of chopped raw or cooked vegetables or one cup of raw， leafy vegetables is counted as one serving. One slice of bread or l2 cup cooked rice/pasta， or l2 cup ready-to-eat cereal is one serving of the grains group.\n【save__datas】\t【951】\t5\\. Fatty and sugary food should be limited as much as possible.\n【save__datas】\t【953】\tThere isn't any particular food or special cuisine that you need to follow. But as with any other medical complication， it is better if you stick to a balanced diet plan during facial paralysis. Bell's palsy without a doubt takes a toll on your immune system， so you need to fulfill your body’s nutritional needs. Remember， even small dietary changes can be extremely useful in speeding up the nerve healing process.\n【save__datas】\t【954】\t1\\. Foods rich in vitamins， minerals and fiber should be an essential part of your diet while recovering from this condition. If you are suffering from Bell’s palsy， be sure to eat plenty of fresh fruits， whole grains and leafy， green vegetables such as kale and spinach.\n【save__datas】\t【955】\t2\\. You can also choose low-fat dairy products and lean meat options such as chicken and turkey. Seafood， in fact， makes an excellent choice and definitely deserves a place in your diet plan. Fish are rich sources of vitamin B12 that is known to boost nerve growth and repair.\n【save__datas】\t【956】\t3\\. Seafood such as oysters and shellfish contain copper that is vital to nerve health. Copper can also be found in cocoa and beans. It's also a good idea to include cod liver oil in your diet； studies show that cod liver oil is very helpful in repairing the damaged myelin sheath.\n【save__datas】\t【957】\t4\\. Also， try your best to avoidprocessed foods and foods havinghigh saturated fat or sugar content. While sugar and saturated fats might not cause your facial palsy symptoms to worsen， they do slow down the healing process. Medical research shows that foods high in saturated fats (bad fats) can disrupt the normal healing process andprevent your body from functioning at its optimal level.\n【save__datas】\t【958】\t5\\. One of the most essential nutrients that need to be part of your diet plan are vitamin B12 and vitamin B6， which we coveredpreviously. They are extremely beneficial in encouraging nerve repair and growth. You may find a lot of supplements in the market， but nothing can substitute consumption of the nutrients through the diet directly.\n【save__datas】\t【959】\t6\\. You will find a wide range of vitamins and minerals in seafood such as shellfish， crabs， tuna and salmon as wellas dark leafy greens such as--connect--【960】spinach. Cauliflower， peppers and broccoli are also rich sources of vitamin B6 which is another important nutrient that you should not forget to consume.\n【save__datas】\t【961】\t7\\. Remember， your diet plan will be incomplete without the inclusion of Zinc. Firstly， it is known to strengthen the immune system which is necessary to speed up the Bell’s palsy healing process. If you recall the causes of Bell’s palsy， viruses that cause cold and flu are known to trigger the condition. Hence， it is vital to consume nutrients that can help the body defend against nasty viruses.\n【save__datas】\t【962】\t8\\. Try to include a lot of beans， fortified cereals， chickpeas， oysters and chicken in your diet -they all are rich sources of zinc.\n【save__datas】\t【963】\tFoods to Avoid\n【save__datas】\t【964】\tSaturated Fats\n【save__datas】\t【965】\tIf you want assist your facial palsy recovery， make sure you stay away from bad saturated fats. Remember， bad fats are threatening for your heart. These fats can be found in red meat and dairy products with high-fat content such as high-fat cheeses and butter. It is recommended that you focus more on low-fat dairy products such as skimmed milk. And while choosing animal meat， go for leaner' options such as chicken， turkey and low-fat cuts of beef and pork.\n【save__datas】\t【966】\tRefined Carbohydrates\n【save__datas】\t【967】\tRefined or processed sugars， unfortunately， are one of the strongest irritants of the nervous system. This means sodas， pastries， candies and everything that is high in refined carbohydrates， can have detrimental effects on your recovery. Try to eliminate as much white bread and pastas as you can from your diet as they are also known to worsen nerve health.\n【save__datas】\t【968】\tFoods to Include In Your Diet\n【save__datas】\t【969】\tFolic Acid\n【save__datas】\t【970】\tYou should eat more of the foods that are rich in folic acid and vitamin B12. Both nutrients are essential for the maintenance of healthy nervous system function and adequate repair of nerve insulating material， i.e. myelin sheath. Folic acid in particular is significant in the regeneration of the 7th cranial nerve. Food sources you should also incorporate into your diet include nuts， seeds，--connect--【971】eggs， animal liver， whole grains， and beans.\n【save__datas】\t【972】\tAnti-inflammatory Herbs\n【save__datas】\t【973】\tAdding herbs such as turmeric and ginger in your diet is a great way to reduce inflammation of the facial nerve. You can also add green tea to your diet plan as it is known to protect the myelin sheath.\n【save__datas】\t【975】\tVitamin C is one of the most potent natural immune system boosters， so get your hands on those juicy lemons and oranges. You can also try guava and grapefruits to ensure that your body gets an adequate supply of vitamin C. Surprisingly； generous intake of this vitamin also protects the myelin sheath as this nutrient is also a powerful anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidizing agent.\n【save__datas】\t【976】\tVitamin A and D are valuable supports for your immune system. You can go for orange fruits and veggies such as papaya， carrots and oranges that are rich sources of vitamin A. Cod liver oil is another good source of vitamin A， D and essential fatty acids.\n【save__datas】\t【977】\tEssential Fatty Acids\n【save__datas】\t【978】\tYour brain is composed of 60% fat， and you require good fats like fat omega-3and omega-6 to maintain a healthy brain. Be sure you include rich sources of omega-6 in your diet such as chicken， fish， walnuts and extra virgin olive oil. Both omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids help reduce nerve inflammation and improve electrical transmission.\n【len<10_filter】\t【979】\tFruits\n【save__datas】\t【980】\tBananas are an excellent choice as they are packed with several nutrients like potassium. Citrus fruits， grapes and tropical fruits， not only are an ideal substitute for sweets and candies but are full of powerful immune boosters especially Vitamin C， which is essential for those suffering from Bell's palsy. Eating a cup of blueberries daily can also alleviate symptoms of facial palsy as the berries have incredible anti-inflammatory and healing properties.\n【save__datas】\t【981】\tHere’s another friendly reminder： Try to eat raw veggies and fresh fruits as they are loaded with vital nutrients. You also need to drink plenty of water as it is one of the best conductors of electrical impulses. Also try substituting sugary drinks and caffeine with plain water and try to drink at least 2 liters of water per day.\n【save__datas】\t【982】\tSo this brings us to the completion of the book. We have discussed a wide variety of aspects related to Bell's palsy， starting from what it is， what the symptoms are， how it's caused， who is most likely to be affected by it， and finally， how you can treat it.\n【save__datas】\t【983】\tIt has been a long， but hopefully， beneficial journey through which you have learned about the important aspects of Bell’s palsy and how it affects lives. To many it may not seem like a serious condition， however， to those who have it or have had it， it can be quite debilitating.\n【save__datas】\t【984】\tYou may experience low self-esteem， lose the confidence to mingle with others， and eventually end up isolating yourself. But again， this condition in the majority of instances is temporary and treatable. So don't let it take over your life.\n【save__datas】\t【985】\tWith the help of this book on Bell’s palsy， you can be on your way to living a happier and healthier life.\n【save__datas】\t【986】\tI truly hope that you enjoyed reading the book. My intention was to help every Bell's palsy patient so that they fully understand the condition and that they are fully aware of the treatment options available to them. If you have any feedback， comments or suggestions， please do not hesitate to get in touch. You may contact me at bellspalsy@alanmcdonald.org. It's been a pleasure writing this book， and I would love to hear from you.\n【save__datas】\t【987】\tIf you enjoyed the book and found it useful， may I ask that you please leave me a5-star review if you purchased the book via Amazon.

In 1960 Kouwenhoven， Knickerbocker， and Jude documented 14 patients who survived cardiac arrest with the application of closed chest cardiac massage. That same year， at the meeting of the Maryland Medical Society in Ocean City， MD， the combination of chest compressions and rescue breathing was introduced.2 Two years later， in 1962， direct-current， monophasic waveform defibrillation was de-scribed.3 In 1966 the American Heart Association (AHA) developed the first cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) guidelines， which have been followed by periodic updates.4During the past 50 years the fundamentals of early recogni-tion and activation， early CPR， early defibrillation， and early access to emergency medical care have saved hundreds of thousands of lives around the world. These lives demonstrate the importance of resuscitation research and clinical transla-tion and are cause to celebrate this 50h anniversary of CPR.\n【global_filter】\t【59】\tChallenges remain if we are to fulfill the potential offered by the pioneer resuscitation scientists. We know that there is a striking disparity in survival outcomes from cardiac arrest across systems of care， with some systems reporting 5-fold higher survival rates than others.5-9 Although technology， such as that incorporated in automated external defibrillators(AEDs)， has contributed to increased survival from cardiac arrest， no initial intervention can be delivered to the victim of cardiac arrest unless bystanders are ready， willing， and able to act. Moreover， to be successful， the actions of bystanders and other care providers must occur within a system that coordi-nates and integrates each facet of care into a comprehensive whole， focusing on survival to discharge from the hospital.--connect--【61】lines for CPR and Emergency Cardiovascular Care (ECC).\n【global_filter】\t【62】\tThe scientists and healtheare providers participating in a comprehensive evidence evaluation process analyzed the sequence and priorities of the steps of CPR in light of current scientific advances to identify factors with the greatest potential impact on survival. On the basis of the strength of the available evidence， they developed recommendations to support the interventions that showed the most promise. There was unanimous support for continued emphasis on high-quality CPR， with compressions of adequate rate and depth， allowing complete chest recoil， minimizing inter-ruptions in chest compressions and avoiding excessive ventilation. High-quality CPR is the cornerstone of a system of care that can optimize outcomes beyond return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Return to a prior quality of life and functional state of health is the ultimate goal of a resuscitation system of care.--connect--【64】most current and comprehensive review of resuscitation litera-\n【global_filter】\t【68】\tThe American Heart Association requests that this document be cited as follows： Field JM， Hazinski MF， Sayre MR， Chameides L， Schexnayder SM，\n【global_filter】\t【69】\tHemphill R， Samson RA， Kattwinkel J， Berg RA， Bhanji F， Cave DM， Jauch EC， Kudenchuk PJ， Neumar RW， Peberdy MA， Perlman JM， Sinz E， Travers\n【global_filter】\t【70】\tAH， Berg MD， Billi JE， Eigel B， Hickey RW， Kleinman ME， Link MS， Morrison LJ， O'Connor RE， Shuster M， Callaway CW， Cucchiara B， Ferguson\n【global_filter】\t【67】\tThe 2010 evidence evaluation process included 356 resuscita-tion experts from 29 countries who reviewed， analyzed， evalu-ated， debated， and discussed research and hypotheses through in-person meetings， teleconferences， and online sessions (“web-inars\") during the 36-month period before the 2010 Consensus Conference.

The leader of a resuscitation attempt may need to adapt application of these recommenda-tions to unique circumstances.\n【global_filter】\t【83】\tThere have been many developments in resuscitation science since 2005， and these are highlighted below.\n【global_filter】\t【86】\tImplementation of new resuscitation guidelines has been shown to improve outcomes.18，20-22 A means of expediting guidelines implementation (a process that may take from 18months to 4 years23-26) is needed. Impediments to implemen-tation include delays in instruction (eg， time needed to produce new training materials and update instructors and providers)， technology upgrades (eg， reprogramming AEDs)， and decision making (eg， coordination with allied agencies--connect--【87】and government regulators， medical direction， and participa-tion in research)\n【global_filter】\t【91】\tMinimizing the interval between stopping chest compressions and delivering a shock (ie， minimizing the preshock pause) improves the chances of shock success33，34 and patient sur-vival.33-35 Data downloaded from CPR-sensing and feedback-enabled defibrillators provide valuable information to resus-citation teams， which can improve CPR quality.36 These data are driving major changes in the training of in-hospital resuscitation teams and out-of-hospital healtheare providers.\n【global_filter】\t【93】\tTheNational Registry of CardioPulmonary Resuscitation(NRCPR)7 and other large databases are providing new infor-mation about the epidemiology and outcomes of in-hospital resuscitation in adults and children.8，38-44 Although observa-tional in nature， registries provide valuable descriptive informa-tion to better characterize cardiac arrest and resuscitation out-comes as well as identify areas for further research.\n【global_filter】\t【94】\tDeemphasis on Devices and Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support Drugs During Cardiac Arrest\n【global_filter】\t【95】\tAt the time of the 2010 International Consensus Conference there were still insufficient data to demonstrate that any drugs or mechanical CPR devices improve long-term outcome after cardiac arrest.45 Clearly further studies， adequately powered to detect clinically important outcome differences with these interventions， are needed.\n【gram_filter】\t【96】\tImportance of Post-Cardiac Arrest Care\n【global_filter】\t【97】\tOrganized post-cardiac arrest care with an emphasis on multidisciplinary programs that focus on optimizing hemo-dynamic， neurologic， and metabolic function (including ther-apeutic hypothermia) may improve survival to hospital dis-charge among victims who achieve ROSC following cardiac arrest either in- or out-of-hospital.46-48 Although it is not yet possible to determine the individual effect of many of these therapies， when bundled as an integrated system of care， their deployment may well improve outcomes.\n【global_filter】\t【98】\tTherapeutic hypothermia is one intervention that has been shown to improve outcome for comatose adult victims of--connect--【99】witnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest when the presenting rhythm was VF.49，50 Since 2005， two nonrandomized studies with concurrent controls as well as other studies using historic controls have indicated the possible benefit of hypo-thermia following in- and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest from all other initial rhythms in adults.46，51-56 Hypothermia has also been shown to be effective in improving intact neurologic survival in neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopa-thy，57-6I and the results of a prospective multicenter pediatric study of therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest are eagerly awaited.\n【lens_filter】\t【101】\tEducation and Implementation\n【global_filter】\t【102】\tThe quality of rescuer education and frequency of retraining are critical factors in improving the effectiveness of resusci-tation.65-83 Ideally retraining should not be limited to 2-year intervals. More frequent renewal of skills is needed， with a commitment to maintenance of certification similar to that embraced by many healtheare-credentialing organizations.\n【global_filter】\t【104】\tCommunity and hospital-based resuscitation programs should systematically monitor cardiac arrests， the level of resuscitation care provided， and outcome. The cycle of measurement， interpretation， feedback， and continuous qual-ity improvement provides fundamental information necessary to optimize resuscitation care and should help to narrow the knowledge and clinical gaps between ideal and actual resus-citation performance.\n【lens_filter】\t【105】\tHighlights of the 2010 Guidelines\n【lens_filter】\t【106】\tThe Change From“A-B-C”to“C-A-B”--connect--【109】change for the following reasons：\n【global_filter】\t【111】\t· In the A-B-C sequence chest compressions are often delayed while the responder opens the airway to give mouth-to-mouth breaths or retrieves a barrier device or other ventilation equipment. By changing the sequence to C-A-B， chest compressions will be initiated sooner and ventilation only minimally delayed until completion of the first cycle of chest compressions (30 compressions should be accomplished in approximately 18 seconds).\n【global_filter】\t【112】\t· Fewer than 50% of persons in cardiac arrest receive bystander CPR. There are probably many reasons for this， but one impediment may be the A-B-C sequence， which starts with the procedures that rescuers find most difficult： opening the airway and delivering rescue breaths. Starting with chest compressions might ensure that more victims receive CPR and that rescuers who are unable or unwilling to provide ventilations will at least perform chest compressions.\n【global_filter】\t【113】\t●Itis reasonable for healtheare providers to tailor the sequence of rescue actions to the most likely cause of arrest. For example， if a lone healthcare provider sees a victim suddenly collapse， the provider may assume that the victim has suffered a sudden VF cardiac arrest； once the provider has verified that the victim is unresponsive and not breathing or is only gasping， the provider should immediately activate the emergency response system， get and use an AED， and give CPR. But for a presumed victim of drowning or other likely asphyxial arrest the priority would be to provide about 5 cycles (about 2 minutes) of conventional CPR (including rescue breathing) before ac-tivating the emergency response system. Also， in newly born infants， arrest is more likely to be of a respiratory etiology， and resuscitation should be attempted with the A-B-C sequence unless there is a known cardiac etiology.\n【lens_filter】\t【114】\tEthical Issues\n【global_filter】\t【115】\tThe ethical issues surrounding resuscitation are complex and vary across settings (in- or out-of-hospital)， providers (basic or advanced)， and whether to start or how to terminate CPR. Recent work suggests that acknowledgment of a verbal do-not-attempt-resuscitation order (DNAR) in addition to the current stan-dard-a written， signed， and dated DNAR document—may decrease the number of futile resuscitation attempts.91，92 This is an important first step in expanding the clinical decision rule pertaining to when to start resuscitation in out-of-hospital car-diac arrest. However， there is insufficient evidence to support this approach without further validation.\n【global_filter】\t【116】\tWhen only BLS-trained EMS personnel are available， termination of resuscitative efforts should be guided by a validated termination of resuscitation rule that reduces the transport rate of attempted resuscitations without compro-mising the care of potentially viable patients.93 Advanced life support (ALS) EMS providers may use the same termination of resuscitation rule94-99 or a derived nonyali-dated rule specific to ALS providers that when applied will\n【global_filter】\t【119】\tOffering select family members the opportunity to be present during the resuscitation and designating staff within the team to respond to their questions and offer comfort may enhance the emotional support provided to the family during cardiac arrest and after termination of a resuscitation attempt.\n【global_filter】\t【120】\tIdentifying patients during the post-cardiac arrest period who do not have the potential for meaningful neurologic recovery is a major clinical challenge that requires further research. Caution is advised when considering limiting care or withdrawing life-sustaining therapy. Characteristics or test results that are predictive of poor outcome in post-cardiac arrest patients not treated with therapeutic hypothermia may not be as predictive of poor outcome after administration of therapeutic hypothermia. Because of the growing need for transplant tissue and organs， all provider teams who treat postarrest patients should also plan and implement a system of tissue and organ donation that is timely， effective， and supportive of family members for the subset of patients in whom brain death is confirmed or for organ donation after cardiac arrest.\n【lens_filter】\t【122】\tBasic Life Support\n【global_filter】\t【123】\tBLS is the foundation for saving lives following cardiac arrest. Fundamental aspects of adult BLS include immediate recognition of sudden cardiac arrest and activation of the emergency response system， early performance of high-quality CPR， and rapid defibrillation when appropriate. The--connect--【125】important changes but also have areas of continued emphasis based on evidence presented in prior years.\n【global_filter】\t【127】\t· The BLS algorithm has been simplified， and “Look， Listen and Feel\" has been removed from the algorithm. Performance of these steps is inconsistent and time consuming. For this--connect--【129】immediate activation of the emergency response system and starting chest compressions for any unresponsive adult victim with no breathing or no normal breathing (ie， only gasps).\n【global_filter】\t【130】\t· Encourage Hands-Only (compression only) CPR for the untrained lay rescuer. Hands-Only CPR is easier to perform by those with no training and can be more readily guided by dispatchers over the telephone.\n【global_filter】\t【131】\t· Initiate chest compressions before giving rescue breaths (C-A-B rather than A-B-C). Chest compressions can be started immediately， whereas positioning the head， attaining a seal for mouth-to-mouth rescue breathing， or obtaining or assembling a bag-mask device for rescue breathing all take time. Begin-ning CPR with 30 compressions rather than 2 ventilations leads to a shorter delay to first compression.\n【global_filter】\t【132】\t· There is an increased focus on methods to ensure that high-quality CPR is performed. Adequate chest compres-sions require that compressions be provided at the appro-priate depth and rate， allowing complete recoil of the chest after each compression and an emphasis on minimizing any pauses in compressions and avoiding excessive ventilation. Training should focus on ensuring that chest compressions are performed correctly. The recommended depth of com-pression for adult victims has increased from a depth of 1%to 2 inches to a depth of at least 2 inches.\n【global_filter】\t【133】\t· Many tasks performed by healtheare providers during resus-citation attempts， such as chest compressions， airway man-agement， rescue breathing， rhythm detection， shock delivery， and drug administration (if appropriate)， can be performed concurrently by an integrated team of highly trained rescuers in appropriate settings. Some resuscitations start with a lone rescuer who calls for help， resulting in the arrival of additional team members. Healtheare provider training should focus on building the team as each member arrives or quickly delegat-ing roles if multiple rescuers are present. As additional personnel arrive， responsibilities for tasks that would ordi-narily be performed sequentially by fewer rescuers may now be delegated to a team of providers who should perform them simultaneously.--connect--【139】injury.110 The lay rescuer should activate the emergency response system if he or she finds an unresponsive adult. The lay rescuer should not attempt to check for a pulse and should assume that cardiac arrest is present if an adult suddenly collapses， is unresponsive， and is not breathing or not breathing normally (ie， only gasping).\n【save__datas】\t【141】\tAlternatives to conventional manual CPR have been devel-oped in an effort to enhance perfusion during resuscitation from cardiac arrest and to improve survival. Compared with conventional CPR， these techniques and devices typically require more personnel， training， and equipment， or apply to a specific setting. Some alternative CPR techniques and devices may improve hemodynamics or short-term survival when used by well-trained providers in selected patients.\n【save__datas】\t【143】\tTo prevent delays and maximize efficiency， initial training， ongoing monitoring， and retraining programs should be offered on a frequent basis to providers using CPR devices. To date， no adjunct has consistently been shown to be superior to standard conventional (manual) CPR for out-of-hospital BLS， and no device other than a defibrillator has consistently improved long-term survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.\n【save__datas】\t【144】\tElectrical Therapies\n【save__datas】\t【147】\tOne area of continued interest is whether delivering a longer period of CPR before defibrillation improves out-comes in cardiac arrest. In early studies， survival was im-proved when 1.5 to 3 minutes of CPR preceded defibrillation for patients with cardiac arrest of >4 to 5 minutes duration prior to EMS arrival.123，124 However， in 2 more recent randomized controlled trials， CPR performed before defibril-lation did not improve outcome.125，126 If ≥2 rescuers are--connect--【148】present CPR should be performed while a defibrillator is being obtained and readied for use.\n【save__datas】\t【149】\tThe 1-shock protocol for VF has not been changed. Evidence has accumulated that even short interruptions in CPR are harmful. Thus， rescuers should minimize the interval between stopping compressions and delivering shocks and should resume CPR immediately after shock delivery.\n【save__datas】\t【150】\tOver the last decade biphasic waveforms have been shown to be more effective than monophasic waveforms in cardio-version and defibrillation.127-135 However， there are no clin-ical data comparing one specific biphasic waveform with another. Whether escalating or fixed subsequent doses of energy are superior has not been tested with different wave-forms. However， if higher energy levels are available in the device at hand， they may be considered if initial shocks are unsuccessful in terminating the arrhythmia.\n【save__datas】\t【151】\tIn the last 5 to 10 years a number of randomized trials have compared biphasic with monophasic cardioversion in atrial fibrillation. The efficacy of shock energies for cardioversion of atrial fibrillation is waveform-specific and can vary from 120 to200 J depending on the defibrillator manufacturer. Thus， the recommended initial biphasic energy dose for cardioversion of atrial fibrillation is 120 to 200 J using the manufacturer’s recommended setting. 136-140 If the initial shock fails， providers should increase the dose in a stepwise fashion. Cardiover-sion of adult atrialfflutter andd other supraventricular tachycardiasgenerally requires less energy； anninitial energy of 50 J to 100 J is often sufficient.140 If the initial shock fails， providers should increase the dose in stepwise fashion.141 Adult cardioversion of atrial fibrilla-tion with monophasic waveforms should begin at 200 J and increase in a stepwise fashion if not successful.\n【save__datas】\t【153】\tAdvanced Cardiovascular Life Support\n【save__datas】\t【154】\tACLS affects multiple links in the Chain of Survival， including interventions to prevent cardiac arrest， treat cardiac arrest， and improve outcomes of patients who achieve ROSC after cardiac--connect--【157】essential bridge between BLS and long-term survival with good neurologic function.\n【save__datas】\t【160】\tGuidelines for CPR and ECC regarding management of--connect--【161】symptomatic arrhythmias.

Part 9：“Post-Cardiac Arrest Care\" recognizes the importance of bundled goal-oriented management and--connect--【169】interventions to achieve optimal outcome in victims of cardiac arrest who are admitted to a hospital following ROSC. We recommend that a comprehensive， structured， integrated， multidisciplinary system of care should be imple-mented in a consistent manner for the treatment of post-cardiac arrest patients.\n【save__datas】\t【170】\tInitial and later key objectives of post-cardiac arrest care include\n【save__datas】\t【172】\t· Transportation to an appropriate hospital or critical-care unit with a comprehensive post-cardiac arrest treatment system of care\n【save__datas】\t【173】\t· Identification and intervention for acute coronary syn-dromes (ACS)\n【save__datas】\t【174】\t· Temperature control to optimize neurologic recovery\n【save__datas】\t【175】\t· Anticipation， treatment， and prevention of multiple organ dysfunction\n【save__datas】\t【176】\tThe primary goal of a bundled treatment strategy for the patient after cardiac arrest includes a consistently applied comprehensive therapeutic plan delivered in a multidisci-plinary environment leading to the return of normal or near-normal functional status. Patients with suspected ACS should be triaged to a facility with reperfusion capabilities and a multidisciplinary team prepared to monitor patients for multi-organ dysfunction and initiate appropriate post-cardiac arrest therapy， including hypothermia. Prognostic assessment inIthe setting of hypothermia is changing， and experts qualified in neurologic assessment in this patient population and integration of prognostic tools are essential for patients， caregivers， and families and are reviewed in detail in Part 9. As a guide to therapy， a new algorithm and a table of integrated goal therapy care were developed.--connect--【179】tions for the evaluation and management of ACS have been updated to define the scope of training for healtheare provid-ers who treat patients with suspected or definite ACS within the first hours after onset of symptoms. Within this context several important strategies and components of care are defined and emphasized by these guidelines and include systems of care for patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)， prehospital 12-lead electrocardiograms(ECGs)， triage to hospitals capable of performing percutane-ous coronary intervention (PCI)， and comprehensive care for patients following cardiac arrest with confirmed STEMI or suspected ACS.\n【save__datas】\t【180】\tA well-organized approach to STEMI care requires inte-gration of community， EMS， physician， and hospital re-sources in a bundled STEMI system of care. An important and key component of STEMI systems of care is the performance of prehospital 12-lead ECGs with transmission or interpretation by EMS providers and advance notification of the receiving facility. Use of prehospital 12-lead ECGs has--connect--【182】since 2000 and has been documented to reduce time to--connect--【183】reperfusion with fibrinolytic therapy.147-153 More recently， prehospital 12-lead ECGs have also been shown to reduce the time to primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and can facilitate triage to specific hospitals when PCI is the chosen strategy.154-161 When EMS or ED physicians activate the cardiac care team， including the cardiac catheterization laboratory， significant reductions in reperfusion times are observed.\n【save__datas】\t【184】\tThe ACS guidelines also make new recommendations for triage of patients to PCI centers after cardiac arrest. The performance of PCI has been associated with favorable outcomes in adult patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest， and it is reasonable to include cardiac catheterization in standardized post-cardiac arrest protocols as part of an overall strategy to improve neurologically intact survival in this patient group. In patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to VF， emergent angiography with prompt revascularization of the infarct-related artery is recommended. The ECG may be insensitive or misleading following cardiac arrest， and coronary angiography after ROSC in subjects with arrest of presumed ischemic cardiac etiology may be reasonable， even in the absence of a clearly defined STEMI. Clinical findings of coma in patients before PCI are common following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and should not be a contraindication to consider-ation of immediate angiography and PCI.\n【save__datas】\t【185】\tAdult Stroke\n【save__datas】\t【186】\tPart 11 emphasizes the early management of acute ischemic stroke in adult patients. It summarizes out-of-hospital care through the first hours of therapy. Approximately 795 000people suffer a new or repeat stroke each year， and stroke remains the third leading cause of death in the United States. By integrating public education， 911 dispatch， prehospital detection and triage， hospital stroke system development， and stroke unit management， significant improvements in stroke care have been made. Important components of the stroke system of care are summarized in Part 11.\n【save__datas】\t【189】\tECC， additional data have emerged extending the time window for administration of IV rtPA to select patients with acute ischemic stroke. These guidelines now recommend IV rtPA for patients who meet the eligibility criteria for the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke(NINDS) or the Third European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study (ECASS-3) if rtPA is administered by physicians in the setting of a clearly defined protocol with a knowledgeable--connect--【190】team and institutional commitment. However， it is important to emphasize the continued time-dependent reperfusion win-dow and that earlier treatment is better and is associated with improved outcome. Patients ineligible for standard ⅣV fi-brinolytic therapy may be considered for intra-arterial fi-brinolytic therapy or mechanical revascularization at selected centers with specialized capabilities.\n【save__datas】\t【191】\tFinally these guidelines recommend admission to a stroke unit within 3 hours of presentation to the ED. Recent studies establish that stroke unit care is superior to care in general medical wards， and positive effects of stroke unit care can persist for years. The benefits from treatment in a stroke unit are comparable to the beneficial effects achieved with IV rtPA.\n【save__datas】\t【192】\tOverall stroke care has progressed dramatically since it was first incorporated into the ECC mission. Improvements in education， prehospital management， hospital system develop-ment， and acute treatments have lead to significant improve-ments in patient outcomes.\n【save__datas】\t【193】\tSpecial Situations\n【save__datas】\t【194】\tCardiac arrest in special situations may require special treatments or procedures beyond those provided during stan-dard BLS or ACLS. Because of difficulty in conducting randomized clinical trials in these areas or their infrequent occurrence， these unique situations call for an experienced provider to go“beyond basics，” using clinical consensus and extrapolation from typical circumstances. The topics covered--connect--【196】reviewed， updated， and expanded to 15 specific cardiac arrest situations. These guidelines emphasize the “above and be-yond” knowledge required as well as the anticipatory clinical acumen to provide timely care and unique interventions.\n【save__datas】\t【197】\tTopies include significant periarrest features that may be important to prevent cardiac arrest or that require special post-cardiac arrest care and intervention beyond the usual care defined in these guidelines. Topics with these potentially unique features include asthma， anaphylaxis， pregnancy， morbid obesity， pulmonary embolism， electrolyte imbalance， ingestion of toxic substances， trauma， accidental hypother-mia， avalanche， drowning， electric shock/lightning strikes， and special procedural situations affecting the heart， includ-ing PCI， cardiac tamponade， and cardiac surgery.\n【save__datas】\t【198】\tPediatric Basic Life Support\n【save__datas】\t【199】\tThe majority of pediatric cardiac arrests are asphyxial， with only approximately 5% to 15% attributable to VF.8，9，27，162，163Animal studies164-166 have shown that resuscitation from asphyxial arrest is best accomplished by a combination of ventilations and chest compressions. This has recently been confirmed in a large community pediatric study，2 which not only showed that the best resuscitation results from asphyxial arrest were from a combination of ventilations and chest compressions but also that the small number of children with asphyxial arrest who received compression-only CPR had no better results than those who received no bystander CPR.\n【save__datas】\t【200】\tAlthough animal studies and pediatric series support the importance of ventilation for asphyxial arrest， data in adults suggest that chest compressions are critical for resuscitation from VF arrest， with ventilations being less important. Therefore--connect--【201】we continue to support a combination of ventilations and chest compressions for pediatric resuscitation but emphasize that sudden witnessed cardiac arrest in the adolescent， such as might occur during an athletic event， should be treated as a VF arrest， with emphasis on chest compressions and early defibrillation. Compression-only CPR is encouraged for bystanders who are not trained in giving ventilations or are hesitant to do so.\n【save__datas】\t【202】\tDespite the importance of providing a combination of venti-lations and chest compressions for resuscitation of victims from asphyxial arrest (including most children) as described above， a switch to a C-A-B (Chest compressions， Airway， Breathing) sequence was recommended for ease of teaching. Theoretically this should delay ventilation by a maximum of about 18 seconds(less time if 2 recuers are present).\n【save__datas】\t【203】\tThere is again great emphasis on “push hard， push fast，”allowing the chest to completely recoil after each compres-sion， minimizing interruptions in chest compressions， and avoiding excessive ventilation. To achieve effective chest compressions， rescuers are advised to compress at least one third the anterior-posterior dimension of the chest. This corresponds to approximately 1% inches (4 cm) in most infants and 2 inches (5 cm) in most children.\n【save__datas】\t【204】\tPediatric Advanced Life Support\n【save__datas】\t【206】\tCPR and ECC：\n【save__datas】\t【207】\t· There is additional evidence that many healtheare provid-ers cannot quickly and reliably determine the presence or absence of a pulse in infants or children.167 The pulse assessment is therefore again deemphasized for healthcare providers. For a child who is unresponsive and not breath-ing normally， if a pulse cannot be detected within 10seconds， healtheare providers should begin CPR.\n【save__datas】\t【208】\t· More data support the safety and effectiveness of cuffed endotracheal tubes in infants and young children， and the formula for selecting the appropriately sized cuffed tube has been updated.\n【save__datas】\t【209】\t· The safety and value of using cricoid pressure during emergency intubation has been questioned. It is therefore recommended that the application of cricoid pressure should be modified or discontinued if it impedes ventila-tion or the speed or ease of intubation.\n【save__datas】\t【210】\t· Monitoring capnography/capnometry is again recom-mended to confirm proper endotracheal tube (and other advanced airway) position and may be useful during CPR to assess and optimize quality of chest compressions.\n【save__datas】\t【211】\t· The optimal energy dose required for defibrillation (using either a monophasic or biphasic waveform) in infants and children is unknown. When shocks are indicated for VF or pulseless VT in infants and children， an initial energy dose of 2 to 4 J/kg of either waveform is reasonable； doses higher than 4 J/kg， especially if delivered with a biphasic defibrillator， may also be safe and effective.\n【save__datas】\t【212】\t· On the basis of increasing evidence of potential harm from high oxygen exposure after cardiac arrest， once spontane-ous circulation is restored， inspired oxygen should be titrated to limit the risk of hyperoxemia.\n【save__datas】\t【213】\t· New sections have been added on resuscitation of infants and children with a single ventricle， after a variety of palliative procedures， and with pulmonary hypertension.\n【save__datas】\t【214】\tThere is recognition that for some young victims of sudden death， no cause of death is found on routine autopsy but these victims are found to have a genetic ion channel defect(channelopathy) that predisposes them to a fatal arrhyth-mia. It is therefore recommended that young victims of a sudden， unexpected cardiac arrest should have an unre-stricted， complete autopsy when possible with appropriate preservation and genetic analysis of tissue. Detailed testing may reveal an inherited channelopathy that may also be present in surviving family members.\n【save__datas】\t【215】\tNeonatal Resuscitation\n【save__datas】\t【216】\tThe etiology of neonatal arrests is nearly always asphyxia. Therefore， the A-B-C sequence has been retained for resus-citation of neonates unless there is a known cardiac etiology.\n【save__datas】\t【217】\tAssessment， Supplementary Oxygen， und\n【save__datas】\t【218】\tPeripartum Suctioning\n【save__datas】\t【219】\tWhen assessing an infant’s cardiorespiratory transition and need for resuscitation， the best indicators were found to be increasing heart rate， effective respirations， and good tone. Pulse oximetry， with the probe attached to the right upper extremity， should be used to assess any need for supplemen-tary oxygen. Studies demonstrate that healthy babies born at term start with an oxygen saturation of <60% and will take>10 minutes to reach a saturation of >90%. Hyperoxia can be toxic， particularly to the preterm infant. For babies born at term， it is best to begin resuscitation with room air rather than100% oxygen. Any supplementary oxygen administered should be regulated by blending oxygen and air， using oximetry to guide titration of the blend delivered.\n【save__datas】\t【220】\tThe role of peripartum suetioning has been deemphasized. There is no evidence to support airway suctioning in active babies， even in the presence of meconium. The available evidence does not support or refute the routine endotracheal suctioning of non-vigorous infants born through meconium-stained amniotic fluid.\n【save__datas】\t【221】\tChest Compressions\n【save__datas】\t【222】\tThe recommended compression-ventilation ratio remains3：1 because ventilation is critical to reversal of newborn asphyxial arrest and higher ratios may decrease minute ventilation. If the arrest is known to be of cardiac etiology， a higher ratio (15：2) should be considered. If epinephrine is indicated， a dose of 0.01 to 0.03 mg/kg should be administered IV as soon as possible. When using the endotracheal route it is likely that a larger dose (0.05mg/kg to 0.1 mg/kg) will be required.\n【save__datas】\t【223】\tPostresuscitation Care (Post-Cardiac Arrest Care)\n【save__datas】\t【224】\tTherapeutic hypothermia is recommended for babies born near term with evolving moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic en-cephalopathy. Cooling should be initiated and conducted under clearly defined protocols with treatment in neonatal intensive care facilities and the capabilities for multidisciplinary care.\n【len<10_filter】\t【225】\tEthics\n【save__datas】\t【226】\tThe duration of resuscitation for newborns with prolonged cardiac arrest was reviewed. In a newly born baby with no detectable heart rate that remains undetectable for 10 minutes. it is appropriate to consider stopping resuscitation. When gestation， birth weight， or congenital anomalies are associ-ated with almost certain early death and an unacceptably high morbidity is likely among the rare survivors， resuscitation is not indicated.\n【save__datas】\t【227】\tThe role of simulation in education was assessed. The task force concluded that although it is reasonable to use simulation in resuscitation education， the most effective methodologies remain to be defined. Briefings and debriefings during learning improve acquisition of content knowledge， technical skills， or behavioral skills required for effective， safe resuscitation.\n【save__datas】\t【228】\tEducation\n【save__datas】\t【229】\t“Education， Implementation， and Teams\" is a new section in--connect--【231】mendations and points of emphasis in this new section include the following：\n【save__datas】\t【232】\t· Bystander CPR dramatically improves survival from car-diac arrest， yet far less than half of arrest victims receive this potentially lifesaving therapy.\n【save__datas】\t【233】\t· Methods to improve bystander willingness to perform CPR include formal training in CPR techniques， including compression-only (Hands-Only) CPR for those who may be unwilling or unable to perform conventional CPR； educating providers on the low risk of acquiring an infection by performing CPR； and specific training directed at helping providers overcome fear or panic when faced with an actual cardiac arrest victim.\n【save__datas】\t【234】\t· EMS should provide dispatcher instructions over the tele-phone to help bystanders recognize victims of cardiac arrest， including victims who may still be gasping， and to encourage bystanders to provide CPR if arrest is likely. Dispatchers may also instruct untrained bystanders in the performance of compression-only (Hands-Only) CPR.\n【[*]_filter】\t【235】\t\\* BLS skills can be learned equally well with “practice while watching”(video-based) training as through longer， tradi-tional instructor-led courses.--connect--【236】e To reduce the time to defibrillation for cardiac arrest victims， AED use should not be limited only to persons with formal training in their use. However， AED training does improve performance in simulation and continues to be recommended.\n【save__datas】\t【237】\t· Training in team work and leadership skills should continue to be included in ALS courses.\n【save__datas】\t【238】\t· Manikins with realistic features such as the capability to replicate chest expansion and breath sounds， generate a pulse and blood pressure， and speak may be useful for integrating the knowledge， skills， and behaviors required in ALS training. However， there is insufficient evidence to recommend their routine use in ALS courses.\n【[*]_filter】\t【239】\t\\* Written tests should not be used exclusively to assess the competence of a participant in an advanced life support(ACLS or PALS) course (ie， there needs to be a perfor-mance assessment as well)\n【save__datas】\t【240】\t· Formal assessment should continue to be included in resuscitation courses， both as a method of evaluating the success of the student in achieving the learning objectives and of evaluating the effectiveness of the course.\n【save__datas】\t【241】\t· The current 2-year certification period for basic and ad-vanced life support courses should include periodic assess-ment of rescuer knowledge and skills with reinforcement provided as needed. The optimal timing and method for this assessment and reinforcement are not known and warrant further investigation.\n【save__datas】\t【242】\tCPR prompt and feedback devices may be useful for training rescuers and may be useful as part of an overall strategy to improve the quality of CPR for actual cardiac arrests.\n【save__datas】\t【243】\t· Debriefing is a learner-focused， nonthreatening technique to assist individual rescuers or teams to reflect on and improve performance. Debriefing should be included in advanced life support courses to facilitate learning and can be used to review performance in the clinical setting to improve subsequent performance.\n【save__datas】\t【244】\t春Systems-based approaches to improving resuscitation per-formance， such as regional systems of care and rapid response systems， may be useful to reduce the variability of survival for cardiac arrest.\n【save__datas】\t【245】\tFirst Aid\n【save__datas】\t【246】\tOnce again， a review of the literature on many topics relevant to first aid found that little investigation is being carried out in this field， and many recommendations have had to be extrapolated from research published in related fields. The following are new recommendations or reinforcements of previous recommendations.\n【save__datas】\t【247】\t· Evidence suggests that， without training， laypersons and some healtheare professionals may be unable to recognize the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis. Therefore， initial or subsequent administration of epinephrine for anaphy-laxis by either of these groups may be problematic. This issue takes on added importance in view of legislation permitting the practice in some jurisdictions.\n【save__datas】\t【248】\t· Except in diving decompression injuries， there is no evi-dence of any benefit of administration of oxygen by first aid providers.\n【save__datas】\t【249】\t· The administration of aspirin by a first aid provider to a victim experiencing chest discomfort is problematic. The literature is clear on the benefit of early adminis-tration of aspirin to victims experiencing a coronary ischemic event except when there is a contraindication， such as true aspirin allergy or a bleeding disorder. Less clear， however， is whether first aid providers can recog-nize the signs and symptoms of an acute coronary syndrome or contraindications to aspirin and whether administration of aspirin by first aid providers delays definitive therapy in an advanced medical facility.\n【save__datas】\t【251】\t· Since 2005 considerable new data have emerged on the use of tourniquets to control bleeding. This experience comes pri-marily from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan. There is no question that tourniquets do control bleeding， but if left on too long， they can cause gangrene distal to the application and systemic complications， including shock and death. Protocols for the proper use of tourniquets to control bleeding exist， but there is no experience with civilian use or how to teach the proper application of tourniquets to first aid providers. Studies have shown that not all tourniquets are the same， and some manufactured tourniquets perform better than others and better than tourniquets that are improvised.\n【save__datas】\t【252】\t·Because of its importance， the issue of spinal stabilization was once again reviewed. Unfortunately very little new data are available， and it is still not clear whether secondary spinal cord injury is a real1 problem and whether the methods recommended for spinal stabilization or move-ment restriction are effective.\n【save__datas】\t【253】\t· The literature regarding first aid for snake bites was once again reviewed. In the 2005 review evidence was found for a beneficial effect from pressure immobilization for neu-rotoxic snake bites， but it now appears that there is a benefit even for non-neurotoxic snake bites. The challenge is that the range of pressure needed under the immobilization bandage appears to be critical and may be difficult to teach or estimate in the field.\n【[*]_filter】\t【254】\t\\* A new section on jellyfish stings has been added and new recommendations for treatment have been made.\n【save__datas】\t【255】\t· The literature on the first aid treatment of frostbite was reviewed. There continues to be evidence of potential harm in thawing of a frozen body part if there is any chance of refreezing. The literature is mixed on the benefit of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents as a first aid treat-ment for frostbite. Chemical warmers should not be used because they may generate temperatures capable of causing tissue injury.\n【save__datas】\t【256】\t· Oral fluid replacement has been found to be as effective as IV fluid in exercise- or heat-induced dehydration. The best oral fluid appears to be a carbohydrate-electrolyte mixture.\n【save__datas】\t【257】\tConflict of Interest Management\n【save__datas】\t【258】\tThroughout the 2010 evidence evaluation process the AHA and the International Liaison Committee on Resusciation (ILCOR) followed rigorous conflict of interest (COI) policies to ensure that the potential for commercial bias was minimized. The COI process was based on the successful policies and actions used in\n【len<10_filter】\t【263】\t9In\n【save__datas】\t【267】\tAs in 2005， during the entire 2010 International Consensus Conference every participant used his or her assigned number when speaking as a presenter， panelist， moderator， or commen-tator from the floor. For the duration of each speaker’s com-ments， a slide was displayed with the speaker’s name， institution， and any commercial relationships the speaker had disclosed so that the audience could assess the impact these relationships might have on the speaker’s input. All participants were encour-aged to raise any concerns with the moderators or identified COI leads for the conference. Depending on the nature of the relationship and their role in the guidelines process， participants were restricted from some activities (ie， leading， voting， decid-ing， writing) that directly or indirectly related to that commercial interest. Although the focus of the evidence evaluation process was evaluation of the scientific data and translation of that evidence into treatment recommendations and guidelines， atten-tion to potential conflicts of interest was omnipresent throughout the process， helping ensure evidence-based guidelines free of commercial influence.\n【len<10_filter】\t【268】\tSummary\n【save__datas】\t【269】\tAs we mark the 50th anniversary of modern-era CPR， we must acknowledge that， despite measurable progress aimed at its prevention， cardiac arrest-both in and out of the hospital—continues to be a major public health challenge. Over these 50 years， scientific knowledge about arrest pathophysiology and resuscitation mechanisms has in-creased substantially. Inour ongoing commitment ensure optimal community-based care for all victims of cardiac arrest， we must continue to effectively translate the science of resuscitation into clinical care and improved resuscitation outcomes.\n【save__datas】\t【270】\tAcknowledgments\n【save__datas】\t【272】\tDisclosures\n【save__datas】\t【273】\tGuidelines Part 1： Executive Summary： Writing Group Disclosures\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Group  |  |  | Other Research  |  | Ownership  | LonsuitantAdTISON  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Member  | Employment  | Research Grant  | Support  | Speakers' Bureaw Honoraria  | Interest  | Board  | Other  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| John M  | Penn State University COM & Heart and Vascular  | None  | None  | None  | None  |  | None  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Mary Frar  | Senior Science Editor Vanderbilt Uniersity School of Nursing—Professor； AHA  | None  | None  | None  | None  | NOne  | Me  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  | fSignificant AHA compensation to write edit and review  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| ECC  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| MichaeR  | The Ohio State Unirersity-Associate Professor  | None  | None  | Me  | Mone  | None  | None  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Sayre  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Leon  | Emeritus Director Pediatrc Cardiology， Connecticut  | None  | None  | None  | None  | None  | None  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Chameides  | Children's Hospital； Clinical Professor， Unirersity of  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  | Lonnecticut  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n【[*]_filter】\t【None】\t| stephen M  | Unnersity ot Arkansas tor Medical  | \\*Pharmaookinetics of proton pump inhibitors  | None  | Lontemporary Horums nursine  | None  | None  | Various medkal legal  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  | Consu ltant as Associate Senior Science Editor  |  |  |  |  |  | nediatne crtikeaeae & emergency  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  |  |  |  |  |  |  | medicine  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Robin  | Emory Uniersity， Dept. of Emergeney Medicine-Associate  | None  | None  | None  | None  | None  | None  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Hemphil  | Professol  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| +Paid AHA writer  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Ricardo A  | The Uniersity of Anzona proriding clinical care， teaching  | None  | None  | None  | Mone  | 十Consutant-American  | None  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Samson  | and research associated with an academic pediatric  |  |  |  |  | Heart  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  | cardiology practice.

This evidence evaluation process was revised in2000， when an international set of CPR and ECC guidelines was developed. The evidence evaluation process was refined for the creation of the 2005 International Consensus on\n【save__datas】\t【508】\tCardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovas-cular Care Science\n【save__datas】\t【509】\tWith TreatmentRecommendations--connect--【511】lines for CPR and ECC， the process was further refined， and a comprehensive description of the 2010 process has been published.4 The purpose of this chapter is to briefly describe this evidence evaluation process and its translation to the\n【save__datas】\t【513】\tEvidence Evaluation Process\n【save__datas】\t【514】\tTo begin the 2010 review process， ILCOR representatives established six task forces： basic life support； advanced life support； acute coronary syndromes； pediatric life support； neonatal life support； and a task force for education， imple-mentation， and teams. The AHA established two additional task forces that were not part of the ILCOR process， one for stroke and one for first aid. Two co-chairs were recruited for each task force to oversee the processes of evidence evalua-tion and consensus development. For most task forces， one co-chair was recruited from the AHA and the other from the international resuscitation councils. Within the advanced life support (ALS) task force， five domain subgroups were created： electrical therapy， CPR and airway devices， drugs， special situations， and post-cardiac arrest care. The ALS co-chairs designated leaders for these domains to direct completion of the evidence reviews. Three worksheet experts(Atkins， Callaway， and Jacobs) and one evidence evaluation expert (Morley) were recruited to oversee the evidence evaluation worksheets， review the search strategies， ensure correct assignment of levels of evidence (LOE)， and verify completeness. The lead evidence evaluation expert， trained in the Cochrane methodology and experienced in the CPR and ECC evidence evaluation process， and the three similarly trained worksheet experts shepherded individual evidence evaluation worksheet authors through the established ILCOR process.\n【save__datas】\t【515】\tThe process included the appointment of two co-chairs(Billi and Shuster) to review conflict of interest (COI)\n【save__datas】\t【516】\tThe American Heart Association requests that this document be cited as follows： Sayre MR， O'Connor RE， Atkins DL， Billi JE， Callaway CW，Shuster\n【save__datas】\t【517】\tM， Eigel B， Montgomery WH， Hickey RW， Jacobs I， Nadkarni VM， Morley PT， Semenko TI， Hazinski MF.

All task force mem-bers and co-chairs completed rigorous COI disclosures， and potential conflicts were managed as noted below.\n【save__datas】\t【526】\tTo begin the process， the evidence evaluation expert updated the 2005 evidence review worksheet for use in the2010 process. The template was designed to facilitate the structured evidence reviews for the production of the final consensus on science and treatment recommendation docu-ments. Successful completion of the evidence evaluation worksheet was required to ensure consistent application of the process by many different worksheet authors from around the world.\n【save__datas】\t【530】\tThe task forces selected and invited topic experts from around the world to serve as evidence evaluation worksheet authors. Specialty organizations were also solicited to suggest potential worksheet authors. The qualifications of each work-sheet author were reviewed by the task force， and potential conflicts of interest were disclosed and evaluated by the task force co-chairs and COI co-chairs. Worksheet authors could not have any significant COI issues pertaining to their assigned worksheet. If a COI was identified， the topic was assigned to a different worksheet author. Generally two authors were invited to complete independent reviews of each\n【save__datas】\t【531】\tPICO question. A total of 356 worksheet authors from 29countries completed 411 evidence reviews on 277 topics.\n【save__datas】\t【532】\tAfter generating formal search strategies directly from the PICO questions， the worksheet authors searched， at a mini-mum， four databases： the Cochrane Library (The Cochrane Collaboration， Oxford， England)， PubMed (National Library of Medicine， Washington， DC)， Embase (Elsevier B.V.， Amsterdam， Netherlands)， and an internal database of articles constructed from previous ILCOR and ILCOR council CPR guidelines development cycles. Worksheet authors were asked to review the references cited in key articles to identify other relevant articles， and authors were encouraged to review any articles that cited the key studies found. Worksheet authors then submitted their search strategies， criteria for inclusion and exclusion of articles， and initial search results for review by the task force co-chairs， worksheet experts， and an evidence evaluation expert before initiating their literature review. If necessary， the search strategy was modified and repeated based on feedback from the reviewers. The complete search strategy was documented in the evidence evaluation worksheet； this process provided transparency and enabled the worksheet authors to use the same strategy to update the literature search just prior to the 2010 Consensus Conference. Articles could be included in the evidence review only if the full manuscript was published or accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Abstracts and unpublished data were excluded.\n【save__datas】\t【533】\tClassification of Evidence\n【save__datas】\t【534】\tAfter a search strategy was approved， worksheet authors identified and reviewed each relevant study. Each relevant study was assigned both a numeric level of evidence (LOE) and a quality of evidence. The numeric LOE classification system was updated from the system used for the 2005process based on a review of available classification schemes(see Table 2). The levels of evidence were reduced from seven categories in 2005 to five in 2010 (see Table 3). The LOEs were subdivided into three major categories， depending on the type of question being asked： intervention， diagnosis， or prognosis. The quality of evidence categories were reduced from five categories in 2005 to three (good， fair， poor) in\n【len<10_filter】\t【535】\t2010.\n【save__datas】\t【536】\tSeveral characteristics within each LOE were defined to guide the worksheet authors.

Task force co-chairs occasionally asked worksheet authors who re-viewed the same question to work together after their initial review， either to reconcile different interpretations of the scientific evidence or to consider studies identified by only one author. During those meetings and Web conferences， the task forces debated and discussed the evidence presented by the worksheet authors and developed final Task Force Con-sensus on Science and Treatment Recommendations state-ments. Starting in May 2009， worksheets approved by the task forces were posted on the Internet for external review and comments from the broader resuscitation community.7Authors of comments disclosed conflicts of interest， if any， and the task forces and worksheet authors carefully consid-ered those comments.\n【save__datas】\t【545】\t2010 International Consensus on\n【save__datas】\t【546】\tScience Conference\n【save__datas】\t【550】\tWith Treatment Recommendations， published simultaneously--connect--【551】in Circulation’ and Resuscitation.

In essence，\n【save__datas】\t【565】\tScience With Treatment Recommendations summarizes what\n【save__datas】\t【567】\tIn developing these guidelines， the writing groups used a recommendation system consistent with that used by the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association (ACCF/AHA) collaboration on evidence-based guidelines (see Table 4).10 These classes represent the inte---connect--【568】gration of the weight of scientific evidence with contextual factors such as expert assessment of the magnitude of benefit， usefulness， or efficacy； cost； educational and training chal-lenges； and difficulties in implementation.\n【save__datas】\t【570】\tGenerally for Class I recommendations， high-level prospec-tive studies support the action or therapy， and the benefit substantially outweighs the potential for harm. An exception is possible for actions or therapies with extraordinarily large treatment effects for which expert consensus alone may suffice.I1 Under ideal conditions all CPR and ECC recom-mendations should be based on large， prospective， random-ized， controlled clinical trials that find substantial treatment effects on long-term survival and carry a Class I label. In reality， more questions exist than there are studies attempting to answer them； and when studies have been done， they are not typically large， randomized trials on human subjects. As a result， the writing groups were often confronted with the need to make recommendations based on results from human trials that reported only intermediate outcomes， nonrandom-ized or retrospective observational studies， animal models，or extrapolations from studies of human subiects who were not in cardiac arrest.\n【save__datas】\t【571】\tFor Class IIa recommendations， the weight of available evidence supports the action or therapy， and the therapy is considered reasonable and generally useful. Recommendations were generally labeled Class Ilb when the evidence documented only short-term benefits from the therapy or weakly positive or mixed results. Class IIb recommendations are identified by terms such as “can be considered”or “may be useful” or “usefulness/effectiveness is unknown or unclear or not well established.”\n【save__datas】\t【572】\tClass III recommendations were reserved for interventions for which the available evidence suggests more harm than good， and experts agreed that the intervention should be avoided.--connect--【575】have been evaluated or that only the consensus opinions of experts， case studies， or standards of care support the recommendation.\n【[http:]_filter】\t【577】\tThe revised COI policy governed the entire development--connect--【582】for CPR and ECC. All participants completed the detailed AHA online COI disclosure form and updated it annually and when changes occurred. Relationships were considered inac-tive if they terminated over 12 months prior to the AHA activity， consistent with AHA policy.

Individuals with a commercial relationship were not selected to serve in roles for which they had a possible conflict.--connect--【584】at--connect--【585】http：//ecccanadaheart.com/presenter. jhtml?identifier=3033464).

Mancini--connect--【656】he goals of resuscitation are to preserve life， restore health， relieve suffering， limit disability， and respect the indivi-dual's decisions， rights， and privacy. Decisions about cardiopul-monary resuscitation (CPR) efforts are often made in seconds by rescuers who may not know the victim of cardiac arrest or whether an advance directive exists. As a result， administration of CPR may be contrary to the individual’s desires or best interests.-3 However， practice is evolving as more emergency physicians reportedly honor legal advance directives in decisions about resuscitation.4-7 This section provides guidelines for healthcare providers who are faced with the difficult decision to provide or withhold emergency cardiovascular care.\n【save__datas】\t【657】\tEthical Principles\n【save__datas】\t【658】\tHealtheare professionals should consider ethical， legal， and cultural factors8.9 when caring for those in need of CPR. Although healtheare providers must play a role in resuscitation decision making， they should be guided by science， the individ-ual patient or surrogate preferences， local policy， and legal requirements.\n【save__datas】\t【659】\tPrinciple of Respect for Autonomy10\n【save__datas】\t【660】\tThe principle of respect for autonomy is an important social value in medical ethics and law. The principle is based on society’s respect for a competent individual’s ability to make decisions about his or her own healtheare. Adults are pres-umed to have decision-making capability unless they are inca-pacitated or declared incompetent by a court of law. Truly informed decisions require that individuals receive and under-stand accurate information about their condition and prognosis， as well as the nature， risks， benefits， and alternatives of any proposed interventions. The individual must deliberate and choose among alternatives by linking the decision to his or her framework of values. Truly informed decisions require a strong healtheare provider-patient relationship/communication and a3-step process： (1) the patient receives and understands accurate information about his or her condition， prognosis， the nature of any proposed interventions， alternatives， and risks and benefits；(2) the patient is asked to paraphrase the information to give the provider the opportunity to assess his or her understanding and--connect--【661】to correct any misimpressions； and (3) the patient deliberates and chooses among alternatives and justifies his or her decision.\n【save__datas】\t【662】\tWhen decision-making capacity is temporarily impaired by factors such as active illness， treatment of these conditions may restore capacity. When the individual’s preferences are unknown or uncertain， emergency conditions should be treated until further information is available.\n【save__datas】\t【663】\tAdvance Directives， Living Wills， and\n【save__datas】\t【664】\tPatient Self-Determination\n【save__datas】\t【666】\tA healthcare advance directive is a legal binding document that in the United States (US) is based on the Patient Self-Determination Act of 1990.13 It communicates the thoughts， wishes， or preferences for healtheare decisions that might need to be made during periods of incapacity. The Patient Self-Determination Act mandated that healthcare institutions should facilitate the completion of advance directives if patients desire them.3 Advance directives can be verbal or written and may be based on conversations， written directives， living wills， or durable power of attorney for health care. The legal validity of various forms of advance directives varies from jurisdiction to iurisdiction. Courts consider written advance directives to be more trustworthy than recollections of conversations.\n【save__datas】\t【667】\tA living will may be referred to as a “medical directive\"or“declaration”or“directive to physicians，\" and it provides written direction to healthcare providers about the care that the individual approves should he or she become terminally ill and be unable to make decisions. A living will constitutes evidence of the individu-al’s wishes， and in most areas it can be legally enforced.\n【save__datas】\t【668】\tA durable power of attorney for health care is a legal document that appoints an authorized person to make healtheare decisions (not limited to end-of-life decisions). Simply put， a\n【save__datas】\t【669】\tThe American Heart Association requests that this document be cited as follows： Morrison LJ， Kierzek G， Diekema DS， Sayre MR， Silvers SM， Idris\n【save__datas】\t【670】\tAH， Mancini ME.

In the event that the individual has a durable power of attorney for health care， the person appointed by that document is authorized to make medical decisions within the scope of authority granted by the document. If the individual has a court-appointed guardian with authority to make healthcare decisions， the guardian becomes the authorized surrogate.\n【save__datas】\t【681】\tIf there is no court-appointed or other authority， a close relative or friend can become a surrogate decision maker. Most jurisdictions have laws that designate the legally authorized surrogate decision maker for an incompetent patient who has not identified a decision maker through a durable power of attorney for health care. Surrogate decision makers should base their decisions on the individual’s previously expressed preferences， if known； otherwise， surrogates should make decisions based on their understanding of what constitutes the best interests of the individual.\n【save__datas】\t【682】\tPediatric Decision Making\n【save__datas】\t【683】\tAs a general rule， minors are considered incompetent to provide legally binding consent about their health care. Parents or guardians are generally empowered to make healtheare deci-sions on their behalf， and in most situations， parents are given wide latitude in terms of the decisions they make on behalf of their children. Parental authority is not absolute， however， and when a parent or guardian’s decision appears to place the child at significant risk of serious harm as compared to other options， medical providers may seek to involve state agencies (eg， child\n【save__datas】\t【685】\tA child should be involved in decision making at a level appropriate for the child’s maturity. Children should be asked to consent to healtheare decisions when able within the legal definition of a consenting adult based on local policy and legislation. Children <14 years of age (in Canada) and <18years of age (in the US) rarely possess the legal authority to consent to their health care except under specific legally defined situations (emancipated minors， mature minors， and for specific health conditions such as sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy-related care). In situations where an older child will not consent， the dissent should be carefully considered by the treating provider.\n【save__datas】\t【686】\tPrinciple of Futility\n【save__datas】\t【687】\tPatients or families may ask for care that is highly unlikely to improve health outcomes. Healtheare providers， however， are not obliged to provide such care when there is scientific and social consensus that the treatment is ineffective. If the purpose of a medical treatment cannot be achieved， the treatment can be considered futile.\n【save__datas】\t【688】\tAn objective criterion for medical futility was defined in 1990for interventions and drug therapy as imparting a <1% chance0of survival.19 Although this criterion may be controversial， it remains a basis for current futility research. An obvious example of an inappropriate or futile intervention is providing CPR for a patient who has suffered irreversible death. Without objective signs of irreversible death (eg， decapitation， rigor mortis， or decomposi-tion) and in the absence of known advance directives declining resuscitative attempts， full resuscitation should be offered.\n【save__datas】\t【691】\t(Termination of Resuscitative Efforts) Related to Out-of Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA)\n【save__datas】\t【693】\tBasic life support (BLS) training urges all potential rescuers to immediately begin CPR without seeking consent， because any delay in care dramatically decreases the chances of survival. While the general rule is to provide emergency treatment to a victim of cardiac arrest， there are a few exceptions where withholding CPR might be appropriate， as follows：\n【save__datas】\t【694】\t· Situations where attempts to perform CPR would place the rescuer at risk of serious injury or mortal peril\n【save__datas】\t【695】\t·Obvious clinical signs of irreversible death (eg， rigor mortis， dependent lividity， decapitation， transection， or decomposition)\n【save__datas】\t【696】\t· A valid， signed， and dated advance directive indicating that resuscitation is not desired， or a valid， signed， and dated DNAR order\n【save__datas】\t【701】\tSome EMS systems have extended the DNAR protocol to include verbal DNAR requests from family members as grounds to withhold therapy.21，22 Paramedics withheld care to patients in cardiac arrest with a history of a terminal illness， who were under the care of a physician， and when at the time of the cardiac arrest the family requested that resuscitation not be attempted. The numbers of patients for whom resuscitation was withheld doubled after implementation (from 45 to 99 a year). This is an important first step in expanding the clinical decision rule pertaining to when to start resuscitation in OHCA， however there is insufficient evidence to support this approach without further validation.\n【save__datas】\t【703】\tAdvance directives do not have to include a DNAR order. and a DNAR order is valid without an advance directive. A significant number of cardiac arrest victims for whom EMS is summoned have a terminal illness， and many have written advance direc-tives. Laws detailing the actions of a prehospital provider in response to an out-of-hospital DNAR order vary across jurisdic-tions. In general， EMS professionals should initiate CPR and advanced life support if there is reasonable doubt about the validity of a DNAR order， if there is concern that the victim may have had a change of mind， or if there is a question about whether the patient intended the advance directive to be applied under the actual conditions for which EMS has been called.\n【save__datas】\t【704】\tThe DNAR order should be shown to EMS responders as soon as they arrive on the scene. If the EMS professional cannot--connect--【705】obtain clear information about the victim’s wishes， they should not hesitate to start resuscitation. Sometimes within a few minutes of starting resuscitation， relatives or other medical personnel will arrive and confirm that the victim had clearly expressed a wish that resuscitation not be attempted. CPR or other life-support measures may be discontinued by following local directives or protocols， which may include real-time consultation with medical direction.\n【save__datas】\t【707】\tTerminating Resuscitative Efforts in Neonatal or\n【save__datas】\t【709】\tNo predictors of neonatal or pediatric (infant or child) out-of-hospital resuscitation success or failure have been established. No validated clinical decision rules have been derived and evaluated. Further research in this area is needed.\n【save__datas】\t【710】\tIn the absence of clinical decision rules for the neonatal or pediatric OHCA victim， the responsible prehospital provider should follow BLS pediatric and advanced cardiovascular life support protocols and consult with real-time medical direction or transport the victim to the most appropriate facility per local directives.\n【save__datas】\t【713】\tOut-of-Hospital System\n【save__datas】\t【714】\tRescuers who start BLS should continue resuscitation until one of the following occurs：\n【save__datas】\t【715】\t· Restoration of effective， spontaneous circulation\n【save__datas】\t【716】\t· Care is transferred to a team providing advanced life--connect--【717】support\n【save__datas】\t【718】\t· The rescuer is unable to continue because of exhaustion. the presence of dangerous environmental hazards， or be-cause continuation of the resuscitative efforts places others in jeopardy\n【save__datas】\t【719】\t· Reliable and valid criteria indicating irreversible death are met， criteria of obvious death are identified， or criteria for termination of resuscitation are met.--connect--【722】circulation (ROSC) after 3 full rounds of CPR and automated external defibrillator (AED) analysis； and (3) no AED shocks were delivered.\n【save__datas】\t【724】\tImplementation of the rule includes real-time contacting of medical control when the rule suggests termination. Before the protocol is implemented， EMS providers require training in sensitive communication with the family about the outcome of the resuscitative attempt.3 This strategy will help to ensure comfort of the provider and appropriate support of the grieving family. Support for the prehospital protocol should be sought from collaborating external agencies (eg， destination hospital emergency departments \\[EDs\\]， coroner， medical directors， and police) before implementation.\n【save__datas】\t【726】\tOut-of-Hospital System\n【save__datas】\t【729】\tTerminating Resuscitative Efforts in a Combined BLS and\n【save__datas】\t【732】\tTermination of Resuscitative Efforts and\n【save__datas】\t【733】\tTransport Implications\n【save__datas】\t【735】\tWithholding and Withdrawing CPR(Termination of Resuscitative Efforts) Related To In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest\n【save__datas】\t【739】\tThere should be a consistent and coordinated approach from the obstetric and neonatal teams in applying these guidelines and in communicating with the parents in developing an agreed-upon management plan when possible.\n【save__datas】\t【741】\tFew criteria can accurately predict the futility of continued resuscitation. In light of this uncertainty， all pediatric and adult patients who suffer cardiac arrest in the hospital setting should have resuscitative attempts initiated unless the patient has a valid DNAR order or has objective signs of irreversible death (eg， dependent lividity).\n【save__datas】\t【743】\tUnlike other medical interventions， CPR is initiated without a physician’s order， based on implied consent for emergency treatment. A licensed physician’s order is necessary to withhold CPR in the hospital setting. Physicians should initiate a discus-sion about the use of CPR with all patients admitted for medical and surgical care or with their surrogates. Terminally ill patients may fear abandonment and pain more than death， so physicians should also reassure the patient and family that control of pain and other symptoms as well as other aspects of support will continue even if resuscitation is withheld.\n【save__datas】\t【744】\tThe attending physician should write the DNAR order in accordance with local policy in the patient’s chart， with a note explaining the rationale for the DNAR order， other specific limitations of care， and documenting discussions with the pa-tient， surrogate， and family. Oral DNAR orders are not accept-able. The limitation-of-treatment order should provide explicit instructions for specific emergency interventions that may arise， including the use of vasopressor agents， mechanical ventilation， blood products， or antibiotics. The scope of a DNAR order should specify which interventions are to be withheld.\n【save__datas】\t【747】\tTerminating Curdliae Arrest Resuscitative Efforts in\n【save__datas】\t【751】\tThe decision to continue resuscitative efforts beyond 10 minutes with no heart rate should take into consideration factors such as presumed etiology of arrest， gestational age， presence or absence of complications， and the parents’ previous expressed feelings about the acceptable risk of morbidity.\n【save__datas】\t【752】\tIn the absence of clinical decision rules to guide the termina-tion of resuscitation in the neonatal patient， the responsible clinician should stop the resuscitative attempt if there is a high degree of certainty that the newborn will not respond to further advanced life support.\n【save__datas】\t【753】\tTerminating Cardiac Arrest Resuscitative Efforts in\n【save__datas】\t【755】\tNo predictors of pediatric (infant or child) resuscitative success or failure have been established.49-51 No validated clinical decision rules to guide the termination of resuscitative efforts in pediatric cardiac arrest have been reported， and the decision to stop resuscitation may vary considerably across physicians and institutions. Further research in this area is needed.\n【save__datas】\t【756】\tIn the absence of clinical decision rules， the responsible clinician should stop the resuscitative attempt if there is a high degree of certainty that the patient will not respond to further pediatric advanced life support. Arrest characteristics to be considered by physicians making decisions may include dura-tion of CPR， witnessed event， number of doses of epinephrine， etiology of arrest， first and subsequent rhythm， and age.49，52-56Prolonged efforts are typically made for infants and children with recurring or refractory VF or VT， those who demonstrate some ROSC， those with drug toxicity， or those experiencing an event causing primary hypothermia. Prolonged efforts are also indicated when a decision to employ extracorporeal CPR(ECPR) has been made (see Part 14： “Pediatric Advanced Life Support\").\n【save__datas】\t【757】\tTerminating Cardiac Arrest Resuscitative Efforts in\n【save__datas】\t【759】\tIn the hospital the decision to terminate resuscitative efforts rests with the treating physician and is based on consideration of many factors， including witnessed versus unwitnessed arrest， time to CPR， initial arrest rhythm， time to defibrillation， comor-bid disease， prearrest state， and whether there is ROSC at some point during the resuscitative efforts. Clinical decision rules for in-hospital termination of resuscitation may be helpful in reduc-ing variability in decision making； however， the evidence for their reliability is limited， and rules should be prospectively validated before adoption.\n【save__datas】\t【760】\tProviding Emotional Support to the Family Providing Emotional Support to the Family\n【save__datas】\t【761】\tDuring Resuscitative Efforts in Cardiac Arrest\n【save__datas】\t【762】\tIn the past， family members have often been excluded from being present during the attempted resuscitation of a child or other relative. Surveys suggest that healthcare providers hold a range of opinions about the presence of family members during resuscitative attempts.58-69 One theoretical concern is the poten-tial for family members to become disruptive， interfere with resuscitative procedures， or develop syncope， and another is the possibility of increased exposure to legal liability； however， these are not reported in the literature.\n【save__datas】\t【763】\tSeveral surveys suggested that most family members wish to be present during a resuscitative attempt.62-66 Family members\n【save__datas】\t【766】\tProviding Emotional Support to the Family After Termination of Resuscitative Efforts in\n【save__datas】\t【767】\tCardiac Arrest\n【save__datas】\t【769】\tLimitation of Care and Withdrawal of Life-Sustaining Therapies\n【save__datas】\t【770】\tLimitation of care or withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies is an emotionally complex decision for family and staff. Withholding and withdrawing life support are ethically similar. A decision to limit care or withdraw life support is justifiable if the patient is determined to be brain dead， if the physician and patient or surrogate agree that treatment goals cannot be met， or if the burden to the patient of continued treatment is believed to exceed any benefits.\n【save__datas】\t【771】\tPatients in the end stage of an incurable disease should receive care that ensures their autonomy， comfort， and dignity. Interven-tions that minimize suffering and pain， dyspnea， delirium， convulsions， and other terminal complications should always be provided. For such patients it is ethically acceptable to gradually increase the doses of narcotics and sedatives to relieve pain and other suffering， even to levels that might concomitantly shorten the patient’s life. The care team should initiate plans for future care by collaborative discussions and the resolution of any conflicts with nurses， consultants， residents， fellows， the patient(when capable of participating)， surrogate decision makers， and the family. Nursing and comfort care (eg， oral hygiene， skin care， patient positioning， and measures to relieve pain and suffering) must always be continued.\n【save__datas】\t【772】\tIn the absence of evidence of an incurable disease in the end stage， decisions to withdraw or limit care in the post-arrest--connect--【773】patient are often challenging， given the difficulties of accurate prognostication， especially in the era of treatment advances such as therapeutic hypothermia.\n【save__datas】\t【774】\tPrognostication in Neonatal and Pediatric Patients After Cardiac Arrest-Determining When to\n【save__datas】\t【775】\tWithdraw Life-Sustaining Therapies\n【save__datas】\t【776】\tThere is insufficient evidence about clinical neurologic signs， electrophysiologic studies， biomarkers， or imaging modalities to describe an approach to prognostication in the neonatal or pediatric patient after cardiac arrest. In the absence of prognos-tication guidelines， the decision to withdraw life-sustaining therapies rests with the treating physician and may vary consid-erably across physicians and institutions. Further research in this area is needed.\n【save__datas】\t【777】\tPrognostication in Adult Patients After Cardiac Arrest—Determining When to Withdraw\n【save__datas】\t【778】\tLife-Sustaining Therapies\n【save__datas】\t【779】\tThere are no clinical neurologic signs， electrophysiologic stud-ies， biomarkers， or imaging modalities that can reliably predict death or poor neurologic outcome (eg， Cerebral Performance Category of 3， 4， or 5) within the first 24 hours after cardiac arrest in patients treated with or without therapeutic hypothermia(see Part 9：“Post-Cardiac Arrest Care\"). There is a tendency to withdraw care prematurely in the post-arrest patient， and this has contributed to a selection bias in the current literature on prognostic testing.\n【save__datas】\t【780】\tPrognostic Testing in the Adult Post-Arrest Patient Not\n【save__datas】\t【781】\tTreated With Therupeutic Hypothermia\n【save__datas】\t【783】\tPrognostic Testing in the Adult Post-Arrest Patient\n【save__datas】\t【784】\tTreated With Therapeutic Hypothermia--connect--【786】well.87 Serum biomarkers such as neuron-specific enolase88-90are potentially valuable as adjunctive studies in prognostication of poor outcome in patients treated with hypothermia， but their reliability is limited by the relatively small number of patients studied and the lack of assay standardization.\n【save__datas】\t【788】\tEthics of Organ and Tissue Donation\n【save__datas】\t【791】\t· A process by which permission for organ and tissue donations will be obtained\n【save__datas】\t【792】\t· The establishment of clearly defined guidelines for organ and tissue procurement that will be available to all health-care providers both in and out of the hospital\n【[*]_filter】\t【793】\t\\* Information to address the possible differences between applicable laws and societal values in procedures for organ procurement\n【save__datas】\t【794】\t· The emotional support to be offered to providers post event\n【save__datas】\t【795】\t· A system to acquire organ and tissue donations from individ-uals pronounced dead in the out-of-hospital setting.

In general， research involving--connect--【798】human subjects requires the consent of the subject or， in some cases， a legally authorized surrogate decision-maker.95，96 This has proven to be a challenge for research involving patients in cardiac arrest because research interventions must frequently be implemented at a time when it is impossible to obtain consent.97，98 After much public discussion and in recognition of the value of this type of human research， the United States government， through the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health， adopted regulations that allow an exception for the need to obtain informed consent in certain limited circumstances.99 These exceptions to informed consent for research enrollment apply only if the following conditions are met：\n【save__datas】\t【799】\t· The subject is unconscious or incapacitated and facing a life-threatening or permanently disabling situation for which the only known therapy is investigational， unproven， or unsatisfactory.\n【save__datas】\t【800】\t· The subject is incapable or unable to provide valid consent and the surrogate decision maker cannot be reached for permission before the time the investigational treatment must be started.\n【save__datas】\t【801】\t· The investigational therapy offers the prospect of direct benefit to the participant， and there is no accepted therapy that is clearly superior to the experimental therapy.\n【save__datas】\t【802】\t· The research protocol is approved by an institutional research board (IRB).\n【save__datas】\t【803】\tIn addition these regulations require that input from commu-nity representatives be sought before IRB approval in order to gain a form of “community consultation” to proceed with the research.96，100，101 Before its initiation， public disclosure of the research and its risks and benefits must be made to the commu-nity from which potential participants will come. Public disclo-sure of study results is also required. This process attempts to assess the opinions and thoughts of the community in which the research will take place and enables a two-way exchange that may， in fact， modify the implementation or research design in light of the community dialogue.\n【save__datas】\t【804】\tIf a patient is enrolled in such a study， once the legal decision maker has been identified and informed of the research. the decision maker may choose to discontinue participation at any time after being fully informed of the consequences of doing so.\n【save__datas】\t【806】\tEthics of Training on the Newly Dead\n【save__datas】\t【807】\tThe use of newly dead patients for training raises important ethical and legal issues. Obtaining consent from family members shows respect for the newly dead patient and those who will survive the patient. It may not always be possible or practical to obtain such consent immediately after the death of a patient. One argument is that presuming consent in these situations serves a\n【save__datas】\t【809】\tUltimately， the respect for the individual should prevail over the need for healtheare providers to practice lifesaving tech-niques. The technical advances of high-fidelity simulation and the use of cadaver labs where consent has been obtained in advance should reduce the need for use of recently deceased patients for educational purposes.\n【save__datas】\t【810】\tAcknowledgements\n【save__datas】\t【811】\tNeonatal Task Force Chair Jeffrey M.

In the US and Canada， approximately 350000 people/year (approximately half of them in-hospital) suffer a cardiac arrest and receive attempted resuscitation.3-7 This estimate does not include the substantial number of victims who suffer an arrest without attempted resuscitation. While attempted resuscitation is not always appropriate， there are many lives and life-years lost because appropriate resuscitation is not attempted.\n【save__datas】\t【969】\tThe estimated incidence of EMS-treated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the US and Canada is about 50 to 55/100 000persons/year and approximately 25% of these present with pulseless ventricular arrhythmias.3，8 The estimated incidence of in-hospital cardiac arrest is 3 to 6/1000 admissions4-6 and similarly， approximately 25% of these present with pulseless ventricular arrhythmias.7 Cardiac arrest victims who present with ventricular fibrillation (VF) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT) have a substantially better outcome com-\n【save__datas】\t【972】\tCardiac arrest continues to be an all-too-common cause of premature death， and small incremental improvements in survival can translate into thousands of lives saved every year.\n【save__datas】\t【973】\tKey Principles in Resuscitation： Strengthening the Links in the Chain of Survival\n【save__datas】\t【975】\tThe links include the following：\n【save__datas】\t【976】\t· Immediate recognition of cardiac arrest and activation of the emergency response system\n【save__datas】\t【977】\t·Early CPR with an emphasis on chest compressions\n【save__datas】\t【978】\t· Rapid defibrillation\n【save__datas】\t【979】\t· Effective advanced life support\n【save__datas】\t【980】\t· Integrated post-cardiac arrest care\n【save__datas】\t【981】\tEmergency systems that can effectively implement these links can achieve witnessed VF cardiac arrest survival of almost 50%.11-14 In most emergency systems， however， survival is lower， indicating that there is an opportunity for improvement by carefully examining thelinksSand strengthening those that are weak.3 The individual links are interdependent， and the success of each link is dependent on the effectiveness of those that precede it.\n【save__datas】\t【982】\tRescuers have a wide variety of training， experience， and skills.

The information is provided in a manner that recognizes the real-world hetero-geneity of the rescuer， victim， and resources.\n【save__datas】\t【997】\tConceptual Framework for CPR： Interaction of Rescuer(s) and Victim\n【save__datas】\t【998】\tCPR traditionally has integrated chest compressions and rescue breathing with the goal of optimizing circulation and oxygenation. Rescuer and victim characteristics may influ-ence the optimal application of the components of CPR.\n【len<10_filter】\t【999】\tRescuer\n【save__datas】\t【1000】\tEveryone can be a lifesaving rescuer for a cardiac arrest victim. CPR skills and their application depend on the rescuer’s training， experience， and confidence.\n【save__datas】\t【1001】\tChest compressions are the foundation of CPR (see--connect--【1003】provide chest compressions to all cardiac arrest victims.\n【save__datas】\t【1004】\tBecause of their importance， chest compressions should be the initial CPR action for all victims regardless of age. Rescuers who are able should add ventilations to chest compressions. Highly trained rescuers working together should coordinate their care and perform chest compres-sions as well as ventilations in a team-based approach.\n【len<10_filter】\t【1005】\tVictim\n【save__datas】\t【1009】\tWhen encountering a victim of sudden adult cardiac arrest， the lone rescuer must first recognize that the victim has experienced a cardiac arrest， based on unresponsive-ness and lack of normal breathing. After recognition， the rescuer should immediately activate the emergency re-sponse system， get an AED/defibrillator， if available， and start CPR with chest compressions. If an AED is not close by， the rescuer should proceed directly to CPR. If other rescuers are present， the first rescuer should direct them to activate the emergency response system and get--connect--【1012】the AED/defibrillator； the first rescuer should start CPR immediately.\n【save__datas】\t【1013】\tWhen the AED/defibrillator arrives， apply the pads， if possible， without interrupting chest compressions and turn the AED “on.\" The AED will analyze the rhythm and direct the rescuer either to provide a shock (ie， attempt defibrillation) or to continue CPR.\n【save__datas】\t【1014】\tIf an AED/defibrillator is not available， continue CPR without interruptions until more experienced rescuers as-sumie care.\n【save__datas】\t【1015】\tRecognition and Activation of Emergency Response\n【save__datas】\t【1016】\tPrompt emergency activation and initiation of CPR re-quires rapid recognition of cardiac arrest. A cardiac arrest victim is not responsive. Breathing is absent or is not normal.18，19 Agonal gasps are common early after sudden cardiac arrest and can be confused with normal breath-ing.20-23 Pulse detection alone is often unreliable， even when performed by trained rescuers， and it may require additional time.24-27 Consequently， rescuers should start CPR immediately if the adult victim is unresponsive and not breathing or not breathing normally (ie， only gasping). The directive to “look， listen， and feel for breathing” to aid recognition is no longer recommended.\n【save__datas】\t【1017】\tEmergency dispatchers can and should assist in the assess-ment and direction to start CPR.18，28，29 A healthcare profes-sional may incorporate additional information to aid arrest recognition.\n【save__datas】\t【1018】\tChest Compressions\n【save__datas】\t【1019】\tThe prompt initiation of effective chest compressions is a fundamental aspect of cardiac arrest resuscitation. CPR im-proves the victim’s chance of survival by providing heart and brain circulation. Rescuers should perform chest compressions for all victims in cardiac arrest， regardless of rescuer skill level， victim characteristics， or available resources.\n【save__datas】\t【1020】\tRescuers should focus on delivering high-quality CPR：\n【[*]_filter】\t【1021】\t\\* providing chest compressions of adequate rate (at least100/minute)\n【[*]_filter】\t【1022】\t\\* providing chest compressions of adequate depth\n【save__datas】\t【1023】\t· adults： a compression depth of at least 2 inches (5 cm)--connect--【1024】infants and children： a depth of least one third the anterior-posterior (AP) diameter of the chest or about1 V inches (4 cm) in infants and about 2 inches (5 cm) in children\n【save__datas】\t【1025】\t· allowing complete chest recoil after each compression\n【[*]_filter】\t【1026】\t\\* minimizing interruptions in compressions\n【save__datas】\t【1027】\t· avoiding excessive ventilation\n【save__datas】\t【1028】\tIf multiple rescuers are available， they should rotate the task of compressions every 2 minutes.\n【save__datas】\t【1029】\tAirway and Ventilations\n【save__datas】\t【1030】\tOpening the airway (with a head tilt-chin lift or jaw thrust) followed by rescue breaths can improve oxygena-tion and ventilation. However， these maneuvers can be technically challenging and require interruptions of chest compressions， particularly for a lone rescuer who has not been trained. Thus， the untrained rescuer will provide Hands-Only (compression-only) CPR (ie， compressions without ventilations)， and the lone rescuer who is able should open the airway and give rescue breaths with chest compressions.Ventilations should bee provided if the victim has a high likelihood of an asphyxial cause of the arrest (eg， infant， child， or drowning victim).\n【save__datas】\t【1031】\tOnce an advanced airway is in place， healthcare provid-ers will deliver ventilations at a regular rate 1 breath every6 to 8 seconds (8 to 10 breaths/minute) and chest com-pressions can be delivered without interruption.\n【save__datas】\t【1032】\tDefibrillation\n【save__datas】\t【1035】\tTranslating Resuscitation Science Into Practice\n【save__datas】\t【1036】\tIn a community setting， the sole trained layperson responding to a cardiac arrest victim needs to perform an ordered\n【save__datas】\t【1039】\tAlgorithm.--connect--【1040】sequence of CPR steps. Laypersons can learn these skills online and in courses\n【save__datas】\t【1041】\tIn contrast， in a highly specialized environment， such as a critical care unit of a hospital， many of the individual compo-nents of CPR (compression-ventilation-defibrillation) may be managed simultaneously. This approach requires choreog-raphy among many highly-trained rescuers who work as an integrated team.\n【save__datas】\t【1042】\tIn the prehospital setting， the order of the CPR components performed by the healthcare provider may switch between a sequenced and choreographed model depending on the pro-ficiency of the provider and the availability of resources.\n【save__datas】\t【1043】\tQuality Improvement in Resuscitation Systems， Process， and Outcomes\n【save__datas】\t【1045】\tCardiac arrest is an important public health issue. Resus-citation involves a broad spectrum of individual stakehold-ers and groups. Individuals include victims， family mem---connect--【1046】bers， rescuers， and healtheare providers. Key stakeholder groups include the public， emergency medical dispatchers， public safety organizations， EMS systems， hospitals， civic groups， and policy makers at the local， state， and federal levels.\n【save__datas】\t【1047】\tBecause the links in the Chain of Survival are interde-pendent， an effective resuscitation strategy requires these individuals and groups to work in an integrated fashion and function as a system of care.40 Fundamental to a successful resuscitation system of care is the collective appreciation of the challenges and opportunities presented by the Chain of Survival. Thus individuals and groups must work together， sharing ideas and information， to evaluate and improve their resuscitation system. Leadership and ac-countability areimportant componentsCofthisteani approach.\n【save__datas】\t【1048】\tA conceptual appreciation of the system and its working components is only a starting point. Improving care requires assessment of performance. Only when perfor-mance is evaluated can participants in a system effectively\n【save__datas】\t【1049】\tDeveloping a culture of high quality resuscitation\n【save__datas】\t【1052】\tThere is wide community and hospital variability in cardiac arrest survival.3，8，13 High-performing systems have used this continuous quality improvement approach with great success，4l as have systems that have more recently adopted this strategy.42 These successes have occurred in a variety of systems， suggesting that all communities and hospitals can substantially improve care and outcomes. Since each system has different characteristics and chal-lenges， there is no single prescriptive strategy for improve-ment. However， each system has an obligation to address the fundamental principles of quality improvement： mea-surement， benchmarking， and feedback and change.\n【save__datas】\t【1053】\tMeasurement\n【save__datas】\t【1055】\tBenchmarking and Feedback\n【save__datas】\t【1056】\tThese data should be systematically reviewed and com-pared internally to prior performance and externally to--connect--【1057】similar systems. Existing cardiac arrest registries can facilitate this benchmarking effort； examples include the Cardiac Arrest Registry to Enhance Survival (CARES)46for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and the National Registry of CardioPulmonary Resuscitation (NRCPR)47 for in-hospital cardiac arrest.

Local data may suggest the need to increase bystander CPR response rates， improve CPR performance， or shorten the time to defibrillation. Useful strategies might include programs targeting citizen aware-ness， education and training for citizens and professionals， and various technologic solutions. These programs need to be continually re-evaluated to ensure that potential areas for improvement are fully addressed.\n【save__datas】\t【1062】\tImportant Lessons from CPR and Summary--connect--【1063】th--connect--【1065】anniversary of modern CPR. There is general agreement that the 1960 Meeting of the Maryland Medical Society in Ocean City， MD， formally introduced the combination of chest compressions and rescue breathing.49 Two years later(1962) direct-current， monophasic waveform defibrillation was described.50 In 1966， the American Heart Association developed the first CPR guidelines.5l Over the past 50years， these modern-era basic life support fundamentals of early recognition and activation， early CPR， and early--connect--【1066】defibrillation have saved hundreds of thousands of lives around the world. These lives stand as a testament to the importance of resuscitation research and clinical transla-tion. They give us cause to celebrate this 50\" anniversary of CPR.\n【save__datas】\t【1067】\tAnd yet we still have a long road to travel if we are to fulfill the potential offered by the Chain of Survival. There is a striking disparity in survival across systems of care for cardiac arrest. Survival disparities that were present a generation ago appear to persist.3，8，52 Although future discoveries will offer opportunities to improve survival， we currently possess the knowledge and tools—represent-ed by the Chain of Survival-to address many of these care gaps.\n【save__datas】\t【1068】\tThe challenge is one of real-world translation across--connect--【1070】and ECC， many instructive and encouraging examples have been published， describing ways in which that trans-lation can be accomplished. Each system， whether in the hospital or in the community， must assess its performance and implement a strategy for improving care in cases of cardiac arrest. That strategy should support the building blocks of resuscitation： the BLS links of immediate rec-ognition and emergency activation， early CPR， and rapid defibrillation. If we accept this imperative to act， we can achieve the full potential offered by the Chain of Survival and， in turn， improve public health.\n【save__datas】\t【1071】\tDisclosures\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Wnting  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Group  |  |  | Other Research  | Speakers'  | Oyunership  | Consultant/  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Member  | Employment  | Research Grant  | Support  | Bureau/Honoraria  | Interest  | Advisory Board  | Other  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Andreyr H.  | Emergency Health  | None  | None  | None  | None  | None  | None  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Imyers  | Services Nova Scotia-  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  | Provincial Medical  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  | Director  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n【[*]_filter】\t【None】\t| ThomasD.  | University of  | \\*in the past， I have received modest grants from Philips Inc  | \\*We recently  | None  | None  | None  | \\*l participate  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Rea  | Washington： Physician，  | and PhysioControl to evaluate changes in resuscitation  | completed an  |  |  |  | as part of a  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  | Associate Professor of  | protocols.

For example， survival rates following cardiac arrest due to VF vary from approximately5% to 50% in both out-of-hospital and in-hospital settings.3.4This variation in outcome underscores the opportunity for improvement in many settings.\n【save__datas】\t【1182】\tThe American Heart Association requests that this document be cited as follows： Berg RA， Hemphill R， Abella BS， Aufderheide TP， Cave DM，\n【save__datas】\t【1183】\tHazinski MF， Lerner EB， Rea TD， Sayre MR， Swor RA.

BLS care in the out-of-hospital setting is often provided by laypersons who may be involved in a resuscitation attempt only once in their lives. Thus， creating an effective strategy to translate BLS skills to real-world circumstances presents a challenge. This section updates the adult BLS guidelines with the goal of incorporating new scientific information while acknowledg-ing the challenges of real-world application. Everyone， re-gardless of training or experience， can potentially be a lifesaving rescuer.\n【save__datas】\t【1192】\tActivating the Emergency Response System\n【save__datas】\t【1194】\tWhen dispatchers ask bystanders to determine if breathing is present， bystanders often misinterpret agonal gasps or abnormal breathing as normal breathing.

If rescuers never learned or have forgotten how to do CPR， they should also be prepared to follow the dispatcher’s instructions. Finally the rescuer making the phone call should hang up only when instructed to do so by the dispatcher.\n【save__datas】\t【1208】\tPulse Check\n【save__datas】\t【1210】\t· The lay rescuer should not check for a pulse and should assume that cardiac arrest is present if an adult suddenly collapses or an unresponsive victimisnotbreathing normally.\n【save__datas】\t【1213】\tChest Compressions\n【save__datas】\t【1214】\tChest compressions consist of forceful rhythmic applications of pressure over the lower half of the sternum. These compressions create blood flow by increasing intrathoracic pressure and directly compressing the heart. This generates blood flow and oxygen delivery to the myocardium and brain.\n【save__datas】\t【1215】\t· Effective chest compressions are essential for providing blood flow during CPR. For this reason all patients in\n【save__datas】\t【1219】\tRescue Breatas\n【save__datas】\t【1222】\tOnce chest compressions have been started， a trained rescuer should deliver rescue breaths by mouth-to-mouth or bag-mask to provide oxygenation and ventilation， as follows：\n【save__datas】\t【1225】\t· Use a compression to ventilation ratio of 30 chest com-pressions to 2 ventilations.\n【save__datas】\t【1228】\tDefibrillation Sequence--connect--【1229】e Turn the AED on.\n【save__datas】\t【1230】\t· Follow the AED prompts.\n【save__datas】\t【1231】\t· Resume chest compressions immediately after the shock(minimize interruptions).\n【save__datas】\t【1233】\tThis section summarizes the sequence of CPR interventions that should be performed by 3 prototypical rescuers after they activate the emergency response system. The specific steps that rescuers should take (Hands-Only CPR， conventional CPR with rescue breathing， CPR and AED use) are deter-mined by the rescuer’s level of training.\n【save__datas】\t【1234】\tUntrained Lay Rescuer\n【save__datas】\t【1236】\tTrained Lay Rescuer\n【save__datas】\t【1238】\tHealthcare Provider\n【save__datas】\t【1243】\tRecognition of Arrest (Box 1)\n【save__datas】\t【1244】\tThe necessary first step in the treatment of cardiac arrest is immediate recognition.

Studies have shown that both laypersons and healtheare providers have difficulty detecting a pulse.35-44For this reason pulse check was deleted from training for lay rescuers several years ago， and is deemphasized in training for healtheare providers. The lay rescuer should assume that cardiac arrest is present and should begin CPR if an adult suddenly collapses or an unresponsive victim is not breathing or not breathing normally (ie， only gasping).\n【save__datas】\t【1256】\tTechnique： Chest Compressions (Box 4)\n【save__datas】\t【1257】\tTo maximize the effectiveness of chest compressions， place the victim on a firm surface when possible， in a supine\n【save__datas】\t【1262】\tThe term “duty cycle”refers to the time spent compressing the chest as a proportion of the time between the start of 1cycle of compression and the start of the next. Coronary\n【save__datas】\t【1264】\tIn 2005 3 human observational studies91-93 showed that interruptions of chest compressions were common， averaging24% to 57%85，91-93 of the total arrest time.\n【save__datas】\t【1266】\tAdditional evidence of the importance of minimizing interruptions in chest compressions comes from nonrandom-ized studies suggesting that survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest may be improved by the initial EMS provider delivery of continuous chest compressions without initial assisted ventilations，97，98 or by EMS providers using a higher compression-to-ventilation ratio (50：2).96 Notably， in each of these studies， the airway was opened， oxygen insufflations were provided， and assisted ventilation was recommended at some point during the EMS resuscitation. Other EMS systems have noted significant improvement in survival from out-of-hospital arrest with use of compressions-plus-ventilations with emphases on improved quality of compressions and minimization of hands-off time.2，99 At this time there is insufficient evidence to support the removal of ventilations from CPR provided by EMS professionals.\n【save__datas】\t【1272】\tCompression-Ventilation Ratio (Box 4)\n【save__datas】\t【1276】\tOnly about 20% to 30% of adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrests receive any bystander CPR.29，48-51，112，113 Hands-Only(compression-only) bystander CPR substantially improves survival following adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrests com-pared with no bystander CPR.29，48-51 Observational studies of adults with cardiac arrest treated by lay rescuers showed similar survival rates among victims receiving Hands-Only CPR versus conventional CPR with rescue breaths.29，48-51 Of note， some healthcare providers114-116 and laypersons116，117indicate that reluctance to perform mouth-to-mouth ventila-tion for victims of cardiac arrest is a theoretical and potential barrier to performing bystander CPR. When actual bystanders were interviewed， however， such reluctance was not ex-pressed； panic was cited as the major obstacle to laypersons performance of bystander CPR.118 The simpler Hands-Only technique may help overcome panic and hesitation to act.\n【save__datas】\t【1277】\tHow can bystander CPR be effective without rescue breathing? Initially during SCA with VF， rescue breaths are not as important as chest compressions because the oxygen level in the blood remains adequate for the first several minutes after cardiac arrest. In addition， many cardiac arrest victims exhibit gasping or agonal gasps， and gas exchange allows for some oxygenation and carbon dioxide (CO，) elimination.110，111，119 If the airway is open， passive chest recoil during the relaxation phase of chest compressions can\n【save__datas】\t【1280】\tManaging the Airway\n【save__datas】\t【1281】\tAs previously stated， a significant change in these Guidelines is to recommend the initiation of chest compressions before ventilations (CAB rather than ABC). This change reflects the growing evidence of the importance of chest compressions and the reality that setting up airway equipment takes time. The ABC mindset may reinforce the idea that compressions should wait until ventilations have begun. This mindset can occur even when more than 1 rescuer is present because“airway and breathing before ventilations\" is so ingrained in many rescuers. This new emphasis on CAB helps clarify that airway maneuvers should be performed quickly and effi-ciently so that interruptions in chest compressions are mini-mized and chest compressions should take priority in the resuscitation of an adult.\n【save__datas】\t【1282】\tOpen the Airwey： Lay Rescuer\n【save__datas】\t【1284】\tOpen the Airway： Healthcare Provider\n【save__datas】\t【1286】\tBetween 0.12 and 3.7% of victims with blunt trauma have a spinal injury，134-136 and the risk of spinal injury is increased if the victim has a craniofacial injury，137，138 a Glasgow Coma\n【save__datas】\t【1289】\tRescue Breathing (Box 3A， 4)--connect--【1291】the same recommendations regarding rescue breathing as in2005：\n【save__datas】\t【1294】\t· Use a compression to ventilation ratio of 30 chest com-pressions to 2 ventilations.\n【save__datas】\t【1301】\tMouth-to-Mouth Rescue Breathing\n【save__datas】\t【1304】\tMouth-to-Barrier Device Breathing\n【save__datas】\t【1305】\tSome healthcare providers114-116 and lay rescuers state that they may hesitate to give mouth-to-mouth rescue breathing and prefer to use a barrier device. The risk of disease transmission through mouth to mouth ventilation is very low， and it is reasonable to initiate rescue breathing with or without a barrier device. When using a barrier device the rescuer should not delay chest compressions while setting up the device.\n【save__datas】\t【1306】\tMouth-to-Nose and Mouth-to-Stoma Ventilation\n【save__datas】\t【1307】\tMouth-to-nose ventilation is recommended if ventilation through the victim’s mouth is impossible (eg， the mouth is seriously injured)， the mouth cannot be opened， the victim is in water， or a mouth-to-mouth seal is difficult to achieve\n【save__datas】\t【1310】\tVentilation With Bug and Mask\n【save__datas】\t【1311】\tRescuers can provide bag-mask ventilation with room air or oxygen. A bag-mask device provides positive-pressure ven-tilation without an advanced airway； therefore a bag-mask device may produce gastric inflation and its complications.\n【save__datas】\t【1312】\tThe Bag-Mask Device\n【save__datas】\t【1313】\tA bag-mask device should have the following 158： a nonjam inlet valve； either no pressure relief valve or a pressure relief valve that can be bypassed； standard 15-mm/22-mm fittings； an oxygen reservoir to allow delivery of high oxygen con-centrations； a nonrebreathing outlet valve that cannot be obstructed by foreign material and will not jam with an oxygen flow of 30 L/min； and the capability to function satisfactorily under common environmental conditions and extremes of temperature.\n【save__datas】\t【1314】\tMasks should be made of transparent material to allow detection of regurgitation. They should be capable of creating a tight seal on the face， covering both mouth and nose. Masks should be fitted with an oxygen (insufflation) inlet and have a standard 15-mm/22-mm connector.159 They should be available in one adult and several pediatric sizes.\n【save__datas】\t【1315】\tBag-Mask Ventilation\n【save__datas】\t【1318】\tVentilation With u Supraglottic Airwey\n【save__datas】\t【1319】\tSupraglottic airway devices such as thee LMA， the esophageal-tracheal combitube and the King airway device，\n【save__datas】\t【1321】\tVentilation With an Advanced Airway\n【save__datas】\t【1322】\tWhen the victim has an advanced airway in place during CPR， rescuers no longer deliver cycles of 30 compressions and 2 breaths (ie， they no longer interrupt compressions to deliver 2 breaths). Instead， continuous chest compressions are performed at a rate of at least 100 per minute without pauses for ventilation， and ventilations are delivered at the rate of 1breath about every 6 to 88 secondsS(which will deliver approximately 8 to 10 breaths per minute).\n【save__datas】\t【1323】\tPassive Oxygen Versus Positive-Pressure Oxygen\n【save__datas】\t【1325】\tAlthough many studies describe outcomes after compression-only CPR， these studies infrequently address additional tech-niques to improve ventilation or oxygenation. Two compar-ative studies97，172 and 2 post hoc analysis studies98，173 of passive ventilation airway techniques during cardiac arrest used the same protocol. The protocol included insertion of an oral airway and administration of oxygen with a nonre-breather mask， with interposed ventilations versus passive insufflation of oxygen during minimally interrupted chest compressions. These studies did not demonstrate a significant overall improvement in outcome measures. However， sub-group analysis showed better survival with passive oxygen insufflation among patients with witnessed VF cardiac arrest. For layperson Hands-Only CPR， evidence is insufficient to S1 recommending the use of any specific passive airway or ventilation technique.\n【save__datas】\t【1326】\tCricoid Pressure\n【save__datas】\t【1334】\tRecovery Position\n【save__datas】\t【1335】\tThe recovery position is used for unresponsive adult victims who clearly have normal breathing and effective circulation. This position is designed to maintain a patent airway and reduce the risk of airway obstruction and aspiration. The victim is placed on his or her side with the lower arm in front of the body.\n【save__datas】\t【1337】\tSpecial Resuscitation Situations\n【save__datas】\t【1338】\tAcute Coronary Syndromes\n【save__datas】\t【1340】\tEarly recognition， diagnosis， and treatment of AMI can improve outcome by limiting damage to the heart，210 but treatment is most effective if provided within a few hours of the onset of symptoms.211 Patients at risk for acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and their families should be taught to recognize the symptoms of ACS and to immediately activate the EMS system when symptoms appear， rather than delaying care by contacting family， calling a physician， or driving themselves to the hospital.\n【save__datas】\t【1344】\tCommon practice has been for basic EMT’s to administer oxygen during the initial assessment of patients with sus-pected ACS.

If the adult victim is unresponsive with no breathing or no normal breathing (ie， only gasping)， healtheare providers can check for a pulse， but should start CPR if a pulse is not definitely felt within 10 seconds. Do not wait to check the victim’s temperature and do not wait until the victim is rewarmed to start CPR. To prevent further heat loss， remove wet clothes from the victim； insulate or shield the victim from wind， heat， or cold； and if possible， ventilate the victim with warm， humidified oxygen.\n【save__datas】\t【1364】\tAvoid rough movement， and transport the victim to a hospital as soon as possible. If VF is detected， emergency personnel should deliver shocks using the same protocols used for the normothermic cardiac arrest victim (see Part 12：“Cardiac Arrest in Special Situations”).\n【save__datas】\t【1365】\tFor the hypothermic patient in cardiac arrest， continue resuscitative efforts until the patient is evaluated by advanced care providers. In the out-of-hospital setting， passive warm-ing can be used until active warming is available.\n【save__datas】\t【1366】\tForeign-Body Airway Obstruction (Choking)\n【save__datas】\t【1368】\tRecognition of Foreign-Body Airway Obstruction\n【save__datas】\t【1369】\tBecause recognition of FBAO is the key to successful outcome， it is important to distinguish this emergency from fainting， heart attack， seizure， or other conditions that may cause sudden respiratory distress， cyanosis， or loss of consciousness.\n【save__datas】\t【1370】\tForeign bodies may cause either mild or severe airway obstruction. The rescuer should intervene if the choking victim shows signs of severe airway obstruction. These include signs of poor air exchange and increased breathing difficulty， such as a silent cough， cyanosis， or inability to speak or breathe. The victim may clutch the neck， demonstrating the universal choking sign. Quickly ask， “Are you choking?” If the victim indicates“yes\"by nodding his head without speaking， this will verify that the victim has severe airway obstruction.\n【save__datas】\t【1371】\tRelief of Foreign-Body Airway Obstruction\n【save__datas】\t【1372】\tWhen FBAO produces signs of severe airway obstruction， rescuers must act quickly to relieve the obstruction. If mild obstruction is present and the victim is coughing forcefully， do not interfere with the patient’s spontaneous coughing and breath-ing efforts. Attempt to relieve the obstruction only if signs of severe obstruction develop： the cough becomes silent， respira-tory difficulty increases and is accompanied by stridor， or the victim becomes unresponsive. Activate the EMS system quickly if the patient is having difficulty breathing. If more than one rescuer is present， one rescuer should phone 911 while the other rescuer attends to the choking victim.\n【save__datas】\t【1375】\tChest thrusts should be used for obese patients if the rescuer is unable to encircle the victim's abdomen. If the choking victim is in the late stages of pregnancy， the rescuer should use chest thrusts instead of abdominal thrusts.\n【save__datas】\t【1376】\tIf the adult victim with FBAO becomes unresponsive， the rescuer should carefully support the patient to the ground， immediately activate (or send someone to activate) EMS， and then begin CPR. The healtheare provider should carefully lower the victim to the ground， send someone to activate the emergency response system and begin CPR (without a pulse check). After 2 minutes， if someone has not already done so， the healthcare provider should activate the emeregency re-sponse system. A randomized trial of maneuvers to open the airway in cadavers282 and 2 prospective studies in anesthe-tized volunteers281，283 showed that higher sustained airway pressures can be generated using the chest thrust rather than the abdominal thrust. Each time the airway is opened during CPR， the rescuer should look for an object in the victim’s mouth and if found， remove it. Simply looking into the mouth should not significantly increase the time needed to attempt the ventilations and proceed to the 30 chest compressions.\n【save__datas】\t【1377】\tNo studies have evaluated the routine use of the finger sweep to clear an airway in the absence of visible airway obstruction. The recommendation to use the finger sweep in past guidelines was based on anecdotal reports that sugges ted--connect--【1378】thatit Washelpful for relieving an airway obstruc-tion.276，277，284 However， case reports have also documented harm to the victim236，285，286 or rescuer.\n【len<10_filter】\t【1381】\tSummary\n【save__datas】\t【1382】\tThe critical lifesaving steps of BLS are\n【save__datas】\t【1383】\t· Immediate Recognition and Activation of the emergency response system\n【save__datas】\t【1384】\t· Early CPR and\n【save__datas】\t【1386】\tWhen an adult suddenly collapses， whoever is nearby should activate the emergency system and begin chest com-pressions (regardless of training).

Inaction is harmful and\n【save__datas】\t【1388】\tCPR can be lifesaving. However， the quality of CPR is critical. Chest compressions should be delivered by pushing hard and fast in the center of the chest (ie， chest compressions should be of adequate rate and depth). Rescuers should allow complete chest recoil after each compression and minimize interruptions in chest compressions. They should also avoid excessive ventilation. If and when available， an AED should be applied and used without delaying chest compressions. With prompt and effective provision of these actions， lives are saved every day.\n【save__datas】\t【1389】\tDisclosures\n【save__datas】\t【1390】\tGuidelines Part 5： Adult Basic Life Support： Writing Group Disclosures--connect--【1391】training materials\n【save__datas】\t【1392】\tGuidelines Part 5： Adult Basic Life Support： Writing Group Disclosures， Continued\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Writing GroupMember  | Emp loyment  | Research Grant  | Other Research Support  | SpeakersBureau/Honoraria  | Ownership Interest  | Consultant/AdviseryBoard  | Dther  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| E.

AEDs may be used by lay rescuers and healtheare providers as part of basic life support. Manual defibrillation， cardioversion， and pacing are advanced life support therapies.\n【save__datas】\t【1769】\tIf bystanders provide immediate CPR， many adults in VF can survive with intact neurologic function， especially if defibrillation is performed within 5 to 10 minutes after SCA.8.9 CPR prolongs VF， delays the onset of asystole，10-12and extends the window of time during which defibrillation can occur. Basic CPR alone， however， is unlikely to terminate VF and restore a perfusing rhythm.--connect--【1772】cardiac arrest'： activation of the emergency medical services(EMS) system，’ provision of CPR， and operation of an AED.3When 2 or more rescuers are present， activation of EMS and initiation of CPR can occur simultaneously.\n【save__datas】\t【1773】\tDelays to either the start of CPR or the start of defibrillation reduce survival from SCA. In the 1990s， some predicted that CPR could be rendered obsolete by the widespread development of community AED programs. However， Cobb noted that as more of Seattle’s first responders were equipped with AEDs， survival rates from SCA unexpectedly fell. This decline was attributed to reduced emphasis on CPR， and there is growing evidence to support this view. Part 5：“Adult Basic Life Support”summarizes the evidence on the importance of provision of high-quality CPR (including chest compressions of adequate rate and depth， allowing full chest recoil after each compression and minimizing interruptions in compressions).\n【save__datas】\t【1774】\tTwo critical questions about integration of CPR with defibrillation were evaluated during the 2010 International Consensus Conference on CPR and Emergency Cardiovas-cular Care.3 The first question concerned whether CPR should be provided before defibrillation is attempted. The second question concerned the number of shocks to be delivered in a sequence before the rescuer resumes CPR.\n【save__datas】\t【1776】\tWhen any rescuer witnesses an out-of-hospital arrest and an AED is immediately available on-site， the rescuer should start CPR and use the AED as soon as possible. Healthcare providers who treat cardiac arrest in hospitals and other facilities with AEDs on-site should provide immediate CPR and should use the AED/defibrillator as soon as it is available. These recommendations are designed to support early CPR and early defibrillation， particularly when an AED is available within moments of the onset of SCA.\n【save__datas】\t【1777】\tIn studies in which EMS call-to-arrival intervals were 49 to 58minutes or longer， 1 % to 3 minutes of CPR before defibrillation increased the rate of initial resuscitation (return of spontaneous circulation or ROSC)， survival to hospital discharge，89 and l-year survival’ when compared with immediate defibrillation\n【save__datas】\t【1778】\tThe American Heart Association requests that this document be cited as follows： Link MS， Atkins DL， Passman RS， Halperin HR， Samson RA.

In practice， however， CPR can be initiated while the AED is being readied.\n【save__datas】\t【1789】\tWith in-hospital SCA， there is insufficient evidence to support or refute CPR before defibrillation. However， in monitored patients， the time from VF to defibrillation should be under 3minutes. When 2 or more rescuers are present， one rescuer should begin CPR while the other activates the emergency response system and prepares the defibrillator.\n【save__datas】\t【1790】\t1-Shock Protocol Versus 3-Shock Sequence\n【save__datas】\t【1792】\tFirst-shock efficacy for biphasic shocks is comparable or better than 3 monophasic shocks.21-25 Although the optimal--connect--【1793】energy level for defibrillation using any of the monophasic or biphasic waveforms has not been determined， a recommendation for higher initial energy when using a monophasic waveform was weighed by expert consensus with consideration of the potential negative effects of a high first-shock energy versus the negative effects of prolonged VF. The consensus was that rescuers using monophasic defibrillators should give an initial shock of 360 J； if VF persists after the first shock， second and subsequent shocks of 360 J should be given. This single dose for monophasic shocks is designed to simplify instructions to rescuers but is not a mandate to recall monophasic AEDs for reprogramming. If the monophasic AED being used is pro-grammed to deliver a different first or subsequent dose， that dose is acceptable.\n【save__datas】\t【1796】\tFurthermore， in animal studies， frequent or long interruptions in precordial chest compressions for rhythm analysis29 or rescue breathing30，31 were associated with postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction and reduced survival rates. Data from a prospective observational study showed that interruption in chest compres-sions is associated with a decreased probability of successful conversion of VF to a perfusing rhythm after shock.32 In a recent clinical observational study of out-of-hospital CPR33 and an in-hospital study of CPR34 by healtheare providers， chest compres-sions were performed only for 51%33 to 76%34 of total CPR time.\n【save__datas】\t【1798】\tAED manufacturers should seek innovative methods to decrease the amount of time chest compressions are inter-rupted for AED operation. Training materials for lay rescuers should emphasize the importance of continued CPR until basic or advanced life support personnel take over CPR or the victim begins to move.\n【save__datas】\t【1801】\tDefibrillation Waveforms and Energy Levels\n【save__datas】\t【1803】\tShock success using the typical definition of defibrillation should not be confused with resuscitation outcomes such as restoration of a perfusing rhythm (ROSC)， survival to hospital admission， or survival to hospital discharge.41，43 Since resusci-tation outcomes， including survival， depend on many variables in addition to shock delivery， defibrillation programs must strive to improve patient survival， not just shock suecess\n【save__datas】\t【1804】\tModern defibrillators are classified according to 2 types of waveforms： monophasic and biphasic. Monophasic waveform defibrillators were introduced first， but biphasic waveforms are used in almost all AEDs and manual defibrillators sold today. Energy levels vary by type of device and manufacturer.\n【save__datas】\t【1805】\tMonophasic Waveform Defibrillators\n【save__datas】\t【1806】\tMonophasic waveforms deliver current of one polarity (ie， direction of current flow). Monophasic waveforms can be further categorized by the rate aatwhich the current pulse decreases to zero. The monophasic damped sinusoidal wave-form (MDS) returns to zero gradually， whereas the monophasic truncated exponential waveform (MTE) current returns abruptly(is truncated) to zero current flow.\n【save__datas】\t【1807】\tFew monophasic waveform defibrillators are being manu-factured， but many are still in use， and most use MDS waveforms. As noted above， no specific waveform charac-teristic (either monophasic or biphasic) is consistently asso-ciated with a greater incidence of ROSC or higher survival to hospital discharge rates after cardiac arrest.\n【save__datas】\t【1808】\tBiphasic Waveform Defibrillators\n【save__datas】\t【1810】\tEvidence from 3 randomized trials21，23，39 and 3 other human studies22，42，54 suggests that defibrillation with biphasic wave-forms improves the short-term outcome of termination of VF， but no individual study has demonstrated improved survival to discharge using biphasic waveforms when compared with stud-ies using monophasic waveforms. There is no human study to support defibrillation with a multiphasic waveform when com---connect--【1811】pared with any biphasic waveform. Data from animal studies suggest that multiphasic waveforms (triphasic， quadriphasic， or higher) may defibrillate at lower energies and induce less postshock myocardial dysfunction. These results are limited by studies of only short-duration VF (approximately 30 seconds) and lack of human studies for validation of these experimental obseryations.\n【save__datas】\t【1814】\tFixed and Escalating Energy\n【save__datas】\t【1816】\tCurrent-Based Defibrilllation\n【save__datas】\t【1817】\tModern defibrillators deliver current based on stored energy. Because it is accepted that defibrillation is accomplished by the passage of sufficient current through the heart， the concept of current-based defibrillation is appealing. Energy is a nonphysi-ologic descriptor of defibrillation despite its entrenchment in traditional jargon. Current-based defibrillation has been as-sessed67，68 and in 1 study was superior to energy-based defibril-lation with monophasic waveforms.69 This concept merits ex-ploration in light of the variety of biphasic waveforms available that--connect--【1818】deliver current in different ways. Peak current amplitude， average current， phasic duration， and phasic current flow need to be examined as determinants of shock efficacy. Transition to current-based defibrillation is timely and should be encouraged.\n【save__datas】\t【1820】\tElectrodes\n【save__datas】\t【1821】\tElectrode Placement\n【save__datas】\t【1823】\tLateral pads/paddles should be placed under breast tissue，83and hirsute males should be shaved prior to application of pads.84，85 Ten studies65，81，86-93 indicated that larger pad/paddle size (8 to 12 cm diameter) lowers transthoracic impedance.\n【save__datas】\t【1824】\tDefibrillation With Implanted\n【save__datas】\t【1825】\tCardioverter Defibrillator\n【save__datas】\t【1828】\tIf an unresponsive victim is lying in water or if the victim’s chest is covered with water or the victim is extremely diaphoretic， it may be reasonable to remove the victim from water and briskly wipe the chest before attaching electrode\n【save__datas】\t【1830】\tElectrode Size\n【save__datas】\t【1832】\tTransthoracic Impedance\n【save__datas】\t【1833】\tThe average adult human impedance is =70 to 80 Q.67，86，101When transthoracic impedance is too high， a low-energy shock will not generate sufficient current to achieve defibril-lation.101-103 To reduce transthoracic impedance， the defibril-lator operator should use conductive materials. This is ac-complished with the use of gel pads or electrode paste with paddles or through the use of self-adhesive pads. No existing data suggest that one of these modalities is better than the others in decreasing impedance.\n【save__datas】\t【1834】\tAutomated External Defibrillators\n【save__datas】\t【1835】\tAEDs are sophisticated， reliable computerized devices that use voice and visual prompts to guide lay rescuers and healtheare providers to safely defibrillate VF and (pulseless) rapid ventric-ular tachycardia (VT) SCA.44，46，104，105 In recent clinical trials，33，34modified prototype AEDs recorded information about frequency and depth of chest compressions during CPR. These devices are now commercially available and can prompt rescuers to improve CPR performance.\n【save__datas】\t【1843】\tApproximately 80% of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests oc-cur in private or residential settings.27 One study128 demon-strated that survival was not improved in homes of high-risk individualsequipped with AEDs compared with homes where only CPR training had been provided.\n【save__datas】\t【1844】\tAEDs are of no value for arrest not caused by VF/pulseless VT， and they are not effective for treatment of nonshockable rhythms that may develop after termination of VF. Nonperfusing rhythms are present in most patients after shock deliv-ery，22，28，63，129 and in general， CPR is required until a perfusing rhythm returns. Therefore， the AED rescuer should be trained not only to recognize emergencies and use the AED， but also to provide CPR until the AED is retrieved and ready for shock delivery and immediately after shock delivery.\n【save__datas】\t【1845】\tThe mere presence of an AED does not ensure that it will be used when SCA occurs. Even in the PAD trial， in which almost20 000 rescuers were trained to respond to SCA， lay rescuers attempted resuscitation before EMS arrival for only half of the victims of witnessed SCA， and the on-site AED was used for only 34% of the victims who experienced an arrest at locations with AED programs. 122 These findings suggest that lay rescuers need frequent practice to optimize response to emergencies.\n【save__datas】\t【1847】\t· Performance of the emergency response plan， including accurate time intervals for key interventions (such as collapse to shock or no shock advisory to initiation of CPR)， and patient outcome\n【save__datas】\t【1848】\t· Responder performance\n【save__datas】\t【1849】\t· AED function， including accuracy of the ECG rhythm analysis\n【save__datas】\t【1850】\t· Battery status and function\n【save__datas】\t【1851】\t· Electrode pad function and readiness， including expiration date\n【save__datas】\t【1852】\tAutomated Rhythm Analysis\n【save__datas】\t【1854】\tAEDs have been tested extensively both in vitro against libraries of recorded cardiac rhythms and clinically in many field trials in adults131，l32 and children.133-135 They are ex-tremely accurate in rhythm analysis. Although AEDs are not designed to deliver synchronized shocks (ie， cardioversion for VT with pulses)， AEDs will recommend a (nonsynchronized) shock for monomorphic and polymorphic VT if the rate and R-wave morphology exceed preset values.\n【save__datas】\t【1857】\tCardiac arrest is less common in children than adults， and its causes are more diverse.136-139 Although VF is not a common arrhythmia in children， it is observed in 5% to 15% of pediatric and adolescent arrests.138，140-143 In these patients rapid defibril-lation may improve outcomes.143，144 The lowest-energy dose for effective defibrillation in infants and children is not known. The upper limit for safe defibrillation is also not known， but doses>4 J/kg (as high as 9 J/kg) have effectively defibrillated children60，6l and pediatric animal models145 with no significant\n【save__datas】\t【1859】\tMany AEDs can accurately detect VF in children of all ages133-135 and differentiate shockable from nonshockable rhythms with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity.133-135Some AEDs are equipped with pediatric attenuator systems(eg， pad-cable systems or a key) to reduce the delivered energy to a dose suitable for children.\n【save__datas】\t【1863】\tIn-Hospital Use of AEDs\n【save__datas】\t【1864】\tAt the time of the 2010 Consensus Conference， there were no published in-hospital randomized trials of AEDs versus manual defibrillators. Evidence from 1 study with historic controls，152 1case series，153 and 2 retrospective studies117，118 indicated higher rates of survival to hospital discharge when AEDs were used to treat adult VF or pulseless VT in the hospital. However， 1before/after study did not show an improvement in survival to discharge or ROSC when in-hospital AEDs were implemented in noncritical areas of a hospital，154 and 1 observational study with historical controls observed no improvement in survival to discharge when comparing biphasic AEDs to standard monophasic defibrillators. 155 The Gombotz and Hanefeld studies observed a decrease in the time interval from collapse to first shock delivery as well as increased ROSC and survival.\n【save__datas】\t【1865】\tDefibrillation may be delayed when patients develop SCA in unmonitored hospital beds and in outpatient and diagnostic facilities. In such areas， several minutes may elapse before centralized response teams arrive with the defibrillator， attach it， and deliver shocks.156 Despite limited evidence， AEDs may be considered for the hospital setting as a way to facilitate early defibrillation (a goal of =3 minutes from collapse)， especially in\n【save__datas】\t【1867】\tWhen hospitals deploy AEDs， first-responding personnel should also receive authorization and training to use an AED， with the goal of providing the first shock for any SCA within3 minutes of collapse. The objective is to make goals for in-hospital use of AEDs consistent with goals established in the out-of-hospital setting.157 Early defibrillation capability should be available in ambulatory care facilities， as well as throughout hospital inpatient areas. Hospitals should monitor collapse-to-first shock intervals and resuscitation outcomes.\n【save__datas】\t【1868】\tFibrillation Waveform Analysis to Predict Outcome\n【save__datas】\t【1870】\t“Occult”Versus “False”Asystole\n【save__datas】\t【1872】\tFire Hazard\n【save__datas】\t【1875】\tSynchronized Cardioversion\n【save__datas】\t【1876】\tSynchronized cardioversion is shock delivery that is timed\n【save__datas】\t【1877】\t(synchronized) with the QRS complex. This synchronization avoids shock delivery during the relative refractory portion of the cardiac cycle， when a shock could produce VF.186 For--connect--【1878】additional information， see Part 8.3： “Management of Symp-tomatic Bradycardia and Tachycardia.”\n【save__datas】\t【1879】\tSynchronized cardioversion is recommended to treat supraven-tricular tachycardia due to reentry， atrial fibrillation， atrial flutter， and atrial tachycardia. Synchronized cardioversion is also recom-mended to treat monomorphic VT with pulses. Cardioversion is not effective for treatment of junctional tachycardia or multifocal atrial tachycardia.\n【save__datas】\t【1880】\tSynchronized cardioversion must not be used for treatment of VF as the device may not sense a QRS wave and thus a shock may not be delivered. Synchronized cardioversion should also not be used for pulseless VT or polymorphic (irregular VT). These rhythms require delivery of high-energy unsynchronized shocks (ie， defibrillation doses). Electric therapy for VT is discussed further below. For additional information see Part 8.2：“Management of Cardiac Arrest.”\n【save__datas】\t【1882】\tVentricular Tachycardia\n【save__datas】\t【1883】\tThe energy dose and timing of shocks for treatment of VT with pulses are determined by the patient’s condition and the mor-phological characteristics of the VT.192 Pulseless VT is treated as VF (see Part 8.2：“Management of Cardiac Arrest\"). Manage-ment of stable VT is summarized in Part 8.3： “Management of Symptomatic Bradycardia and Tachycardia.” Unstable mono-morphic (regular) VT with pulses is treated with synchronized cardioversion. Unstable polymorphic (irregular) VT with or without pulses is treated as VF using unsynchronized high-energy shocks (ie， defibrillation doses).\n【save__datas】\t【1886】\tAlthough synchronized cardioversion is preferred for treat-ment of an organized ventricular rhythm， for some arrhythmias synchronization is not possible. The many QRS configurations and irregular rates that comprise polymorphic ventricular--connect--【1887】tachycardia make it difficult or impossible to reliably synchronize to a QRS complex. If there is any doubt whether monomorphic or polymorphic VT is present in the unstable patient， do not delay shock delivery to perform detailed rhythm analysis-provide high-energy unsynchronized shocks (ie， defibrillation doses).\n【len<10_filter】\t【1889】\tPacing\n【save__datas】\t【1892】\tMaintaining Devices in a State of Readiness\n【len<10_filter】\t【1894】\tSummary\n【save__datas】\t【1895】\tThe recommendations for electrical therapies described in this section are designed to improve survival from SCA and life-threatening arrhythmias. Whenever defibrillation is attempted， rescuers must coordinate high-quality CPR with defibrillation to minimize interruptions in chest compressions and to ensure immediate resumption of chest compressions after shock deliv-ery. The high first-shock efficacy of newer biphasic defibrilla-tors led to the recommendation of single shocks plus immediate CPR instead of 3-shock sequences that were recommended prior to 2005 to treat VF. Further data are needed to refine recom-mendations for energy levels for defibrillation and cardioversion using biphasic waveforms.\n【save__datas】\t【1896】\tDisclosures\n【save__datas】\t【1897】\tGuidelines Part 6： Electrical Therapies： Writing Group Disclosures\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Writing Group  |  |  | Hesearch  |  |  | Consultant/Advisery  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Member  | Employment  | Research Grant  | Support  | Speakers' Bureau/Honoraria  | Ownership Interest  | Board  | Other  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Mark S.

Sutton； Richard Branson； Mary Fran Hazinski--connect--【2170】ver the past25)years avariety of alternatives to conventional manual CPR have been developed in an effort to enhance perfusion during attempted resuscitation from cardiac arrest and to improve survival. Compared with conventional CPR， these techniques and devices typically require more personnel， training， and equipment， or they apply to a specific setting. Application of these devices has the potential to delay or interrupt CPR， so rescuers should be trained to minimize any interruption of chest compressions or defibrillation and should be retrained as needed. Efficacy for some techniques and devices has been reported in selected settings and patient conditions； however， no alternative tech-nique or device in routine use has consistently been shown to be superior to conventional CPR for out-of-hospital basic life support. In this section， no class of recommendation is made when there is insufficient evidence of benefit or harm. particularly if human data are extremely limited. For those devices assigned a 2005 Class of Recommendation other than Indeterminate， Classes of Recommendation were assigned when possible using the same criteria applied throughout this document (see Part 1：“Executive Summary” and Part 2：“Evidence Evaluation”).\n【save__datas】\t【2171】\tWhenever these devices are used， providers should monitor for evidence of benefit versus harm. The experts are aware of several clinical trials of the devices listed below that are under way and/or recently concluded， so readers are encouraged to monitor for the publication of additional trial results in peer-reviewed journals and AHA scientific advisory statements.\n【save__datas】\t【2173】\tHigh-Frequency Chest Compressions\n【save__datas】\t【2174】\tHigh-frequency chest compression (typically atL2a fre-quency ≥120 per minute) has been studied as a technique for improving resuscitation from cardiac arrest. The sparse human data have demonstrated mixed results. One clinical trial including 9 patients? and another including 23patients3 showed that a compression frequency of 120 per minute improved hemodynamics compared to conven---connect--【2175】tional chest compressions； no change in clinical outcome\n【save__datas】\t【2179】\tIn open-chest CPR the heart is accessed through a thoracot-omy (typically created through the 5\"h left intercostal space) and compression is performed using the thumb and fingers， or with the palm and extended fingers against the sternum. Use of this technique generates forward blood flow and coronary perfusion pressure that typically exceed those generated by closed chest compressions.\n【save__datas】\t【2181】\tSeveral small case series of cardiac arrest patients treated with thoracotomy and open-chest CPR after blunt 1，12 or penetrating traumal2-14 reported survivors with mild or no neurological deficit.\n【save__datas】\t【2183】\tThe American Heart Association requests that this document be cited as follows： Cave DM， Gazmuri RJ， Otto CW， Nadkarni VM， Cheng A， Brooks\n【save__datas】\t【2184】\tSC， Daya M， Sutton RM， Branson R， Hazinski MF.

The dedicated rescuer who provides manual abdominal compressions will compress the abdomen midway between the xiphoid and the umbilicus during the relaxation phase of chest compression. Hand position， depth， rhythm， and rate of abdominal compressions are similar to those for chest compressions and the force required is similar to that used to palpate the abdominal aorta. In most reports， an endotracheal tube is placed before or shortly after initiation of IAC-CPR. IAC-CPR increases diastolic aortic pressure and venous return， resulting in improved coronary perfusion pressure and blood flow to other vital organs.\n【save__datas】\t【2191】\tIn 2 randomized in-hospital trials， IAC-CPR performed by trained rescuers improved short-term survivall7 and survival to hospital discharge18 compared with conventional CPR for adult cardiac arrest. The data from these studies were com-bined in 2 positive meta-analyses.19，20 However， 1 random-ized controlled trial of adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest21did not show any survival advantage to IAC-CPR. Although there were no complications reported in adults，19 1 pediatric case report22 documented traumatic pancreatitis following IAC-CPR.\n【save__datas】\t【2199】\tPrecordial Thump\n【save__datas】\t【2201】\tA precordial thump has been reported to convert ventric-ular tachyarrhythmias in 1 study with concurrent controls，39single-patient case reports， and small case series.40-44 How-ever， 2 larger case series found that the precordial thump was ineffective in 79 (98.8%) of 80 cases45 and in 153 (98.7%) of155 cases of malignant ventricular arrhythmias.46 Case re-ports and case series47-49 have documented complications associated with precordial thump including sternal fracture， osteomyelitis， stroke， and triggering of malignant arrhythmias in adults and children.\n【save__datas】\t【2203】\tPercussion Pacing\n【save__datas】\t【2204】\tPercussion (eg， fist) pacing refers to the use of regular， rhythmic and forceful percussion of the chest with the rescuer’s fist in an attempt to pace the myocardium. There is little evidence supporting fist or percussion pacing in cardiac arrest based on 6 single-patient case reports50-55 and a moderate-sized case series.56 There is insufficient evidence to recommend percussion pacing during typical attempted re-suscitation from cardiac arrest.\n【save__datas】\t【2206】\tDevices to Assist Ventilation\n【save__datas】\t【2207】\tAutomatic and Mechanical Transport Ventilators\n【save__datas】\t【2208】\tAutomatic Transport Ventilators\n【save__datas】\t【2211】\t1in these\n【save__datas】\t【2212】\tGuidelines.\n【save__datas】\t【2213】\tManually Triggered， Oxygen-Powered，\n【save__datas】\t【2214】\tFlow-Limited Resuscitators\n【save__datas】\t【2216】\tDevices to Support Circulation\n【save__datas】\t【2218】\tActive compression-decompression CPR (ACD-CPR) is per-formed with a device that includes a suction cup to actively lift the anterior chest during decompression. The application of external negative suction during the decompression phase of CPR creates negative intrathoracic pressure and thus potentially enhances venous return to the heart. When used， the device is positioned at midsternum on the chest.\n【save__datas】\t【2219】\tResults from the use of ACD-CPR have been mixed. In several studies61-66 ACD-CPR improved ROSC and short-term survival compared with conventional CPR. Of these studies， 3 showed improvement in neurologically intact survival.61，64，65 In contrast， 1 Cochrane meta-analysis of 10studies involving both in-hospital arrest (826 patients) and out-of-hospital arrest (4162 patients)67 and several other controlled trials68-74 comparing ACD-CPR to conventional CPR showed no difference in ROSC or survival. The meta-analysis67 did not find any increase in ACD-CPR-related complications.\n【save__datas】\t【2221】\tPhused Thoracic-Abdominal Compression-\n【save__datas】\t【2223】\tPhased thoracic-abdominal compression-decompression CPR(PTACD-CPR) combines the concepts of IAC-CPR and ACD-CPR. A handheld device alternates chest compression and abdominal decompression with chest decompression and abdominal compression. Evidence from l prospective ran-domized clinical study of adults in cardiac arrest75 demon-strated no improvement in survival to hospital discharge with use of PTACD-CPR during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.\n【save__datas】\t【2224】\tThere is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of PTACD-CPR for the treatment of cardiac arrest.\n【save__datas】\t【2225】\tImpedance Threshold Device\n【save__datas】\t【2226】\tThe impedance threshold device (ITD) is a pressure-sensitive valve that is attached to an endotracheal tube， supraglottic airway， or face mask. The ITD limits air entry into the lungs during the decompression phase of CPR， creating negative intrathoracic pressure and improving venous return to the heart and cardiac output during CPR. It does so without impeding positive pressure ventilation or passive exhalation.\n【save__datas】\t【2227】\tOriginally， the ITD was used with a cuffed endotracheal tube during bag-tube ventilation and ACD-CPR.76-78 The ITD and ACD-CPR devices are thought to act synergistically to enhance venous return. During ACD-CPR with or without the ITD， 1 randomized study76 found no difference in survival， whereas another randomized study79 found that the addition of an ITD improved short-term survival (24-hour survival and survival to ICU admission).\n【save__datas】\t【2228】\tThe ITD also has been used during conventional CPR with an endotracheal tube or with a face mask， if a tight seal is maintained.77，80，81 During conventional CPR with and without the ITD， I randomized trial80 reported no difference in overall survival； however， l prospective cohort study82 reported improved survival to emergency department (ED) admission with the use of the ITD. One meta-analysis of pooled data from both conventional CPR and ACD-CPR randomized trials83 demonstrated improved ROSC and short-term sur-vival associated with the use of an ITD in the management of adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients but no significant improvement in either survival to hospital discharge or neurologically intact survival to discharge.\n【save__datas】\t【2230】\tMechanical Piston Devices\n【save__datas】\t【2232】\tThe Lund University Cardiac Arrest System (LUCAS) is a gas- (oxygen or air) or electric-powered piston device that produces a consistent chest compression rate and depth. It incorporates a suction cup attached to the sternum that returns the sternum to the starting position. There are no randomized control trials comparing the device with conventional CPR in human cardiac arrests. One case\n【save__datas】\t【2236】\tThe load-distributing band (LDB) is a circumferential chest compression device composed of a pneumatically or electri-cally actuated constricting band and backboard. Case series have demonstrated improved hemodynamics，100 ROSC，101，102and survival to hospital discharge with use of the LDB for cardiac arrest.2 In a study using concurrent controls，03 the use of LDB-CPR was associated with lower odds of 30-day survival (odds ratio 0.4). One multicenter prospective ran-domized controlled trial104，104A comparing LDB-CPR (Auto-pulse device) to manual CPR for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest demonstrated no improvement in 4-hour survival and worse neurologic outcome when the device was used. These results raised concerns about possible harm with use of this device. Further studies are required to determine whether site-specific factors105 and experience with deployment of the devicel06 could influence its efficacy.\n【save__datas】\t【2238】\tExtracorporeal Techniques and Invasive Perfusion Devices\n【save__datas】\t【2240】\tFor the purpose of these Guidelines， extracorporeal mem-brane oxygenation (ECMO) and cardiopulmonary bypass are considered together as different forms of extracorpo-real CPR (ECPR； an alternative term may be extracorpo-reallife support or ECLS))when either is1used for resuscitation for cardiac arrest.Both are sophisticated--connect--【2241】techniques for circulating blood outside the body with or without extracorporeal oxygenation， with the goal of supporting the body’s circulation in the absence of an adequately functioning cardiac pump. The initiation of ECPR and the management of a patient on ECPR require highly trained personnel and specialized equipment.\n【save__datas】\t【2242】\tAlthough there are no data from randomized studies to support the routine use of ECPR， in case series and observa-tional studies the use of ECPR for in-hospital107，108 and out-of-hospital109-111 cardiac arrest has been associated with improved survival when compared with conventional CPR in patients <75 years old with potentially correctable condi-tions. However， supportive studies consisted of small num-bers of patients， and some had unbalanced comparison groups with respect to age， witnessed arrest， bystander CPR， and the quality of conventional CPR.\n【save__datas】\t【2243】\tThere are no randomized studies that compare ECPR with conventional CPR for patients in cardiac arrest. However， data from several case series have demonstrated the feasibil-ity and safety of ECPR in highly specialized centers.108，110，111Observational studies of adults in both the in-hospital107 and out-of-hospital109 settings have demonstrated an association between ECPR use and improved survival when compared with conventional CPR in patients with potentially correct-able conditions. These studies had small numbers of patients， and some had unbalanced comparison groups with respect to age， witness status， bystander CPR， and the quality of conventional CPR.

All of these techniques and devices have the potential to delay chest compressions and defibrillation. In order to prevent delays and maximize efficiency， initial training， ongoing monitoring， and retraining programs should be offered to providers on a frequent and ongoing basis. To date， no adjunct has consistently been shown to be superior to standard conventional (manual) CPR for out-of-hospital basic life support， and no device other than a defibrillator has consistently improved long-term survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.\n【save__datas】\t【2247】\tDisclosures\n【len<10_filter】\t【2249】\tWriting\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Writing  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Gmup  |  |  | Other Research  |  |  | Consu tant/Advisery  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Member  | Employment  | Research Grant  | Support  | Speakers' Bureau/Honoraria  | Ownership Interest  | Board  | Other  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Diana M.  | Legacy Health System， Emanuel  | None  | None  | None  | None  | None  | None  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Carre  | Hospital， Emergency  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  | Services-RN， MSN： Portland  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  | Com.

ACLS interventions aimed at preventing cardiac arrest include airway management， ventilation support， and treatment of bradyarrhythmias and tachyarrhythmias. For the treatment of cardiac arrest， ACLS interventions build on the basic life support (BLS) foundation of immediate recognition and activation of the emergency response system， early CPR， and rapid defibrillation to further increase the likelihood of ROSC with drug therapy， advanced airway man-agement， and physiologic monitoring. Following ROSC， sur-vival and neurologic outcome can be improved with integrated post-cardiac arrest care.\n【save__datas】\t【2417】\t· Continuous quantitative waveform capnography is rec-ommended for confirmation and monitoring of endotra-cheal tube placement.--connect--【2419】and--connect--【2420】avoiding excessive ventilation).\n【save__datas】\t【2421】\t春Atropine is no longer recommended for routine use in the management of pulseless electrical activity (PEA)/asystole.\n【save__datas】\t【2422】\t· There is an increased emphasis on physiologic monitoring to optimize CPR quality and detect ROSC.\n【save__datas】\t【2423】\t·Chronotropic drug infusions are recommended as an alter-native to pacing in symptomatic and unstable bradycardia.\n【save__datas】\t【2424】\tAdenosine is recommended asS2a safe and potentially effective therapy in the initial management of stable undifferentiated regular monomorphicVwide-complex tachycardia.\n【save__datas】\t【2425】\tPart 8.1： Adjuncts for Airway Control and Ventilation\n【save__datas】\t【2426】\tOverview of Airway Management\n【save__datas】\t【2427】\tThis section highlights recommendations for the support of ventilation and oxygenation during CPR and the peri-arrest period. The purpose of ventilation during CPR is to maintain adequate oxygenation and sufficient elimination of carbon dioxide. However， research has not identified the optimal tidal volume， respiratory rate， and inspired oxygen concen-tration required during resuscitation from cardiac arrest.\n【save__datas】\t【2428】\tBoth ventilation and chest compressions are thought to be important for victims of prolonged ventricular fibrillation(VF) cardiac arrest and for all victims with other presenting rhythms. Because both systemic and pulmonary perfusion are substantially reduced during CPR， normal ventilation-perfusion relationships can be maintained with a minute ventilation that is much lower than normal. During CPR with an advanced airway in place， a lower rate of rescue breathing is needed to avoid hyperventilation.\n【save__datas】\t【2429】\tVentilation and Oxygen Administration\n【save__datas】\t【2431】\tDuring low blood flow states such as CPR， oxygen delivery to the heart and brain is limited by blood flow rather than by arterial oxygen content.，2 Therefore， rescue breaths are less important than chest compressions during the first few minutes of resus-citation from witnessed VF cardiac arrest and could reduce CPR efficacy due to interruption in chest compressions and the increase in intrathoracic pressure that accompanies positive-pressure ventilation. Thus， during the first few minutes of witnessed cardiac arrest a lone rescuer should not interrupt chest\n【save__datas】\t【2432】\tThe American Heart Association requests that this document be cited as follows： Neumar RW， Otto CW， Link MS， Kronick SL， Shuster M， Callaway\n【save__datas】\t【2433】\tCW，Kudenchuk PJ， Ornato JP， McNally B， Silvers SM， Passman RS， White RD， Hess EP， Tang W， Davis D， Sinz E， Morrison LJ.

In the out-of-hospital setting， passive oxygen delivery via mask with an opened airway during the first 6 minutes of CPR provided by emergency medical services (EMS) personnel was part of a protocol of bundled care interventions (including continuous chest compressions) that resulted in improved survival.6-8When passive oxygen delivery using a fenestrated tracheal tube (Boussignac tube) during uninterrupted physician-managed CPR was compared with standard CPR， there was no difference in oxygenation， ROSC， or survival to hospital admission.9，10 Chest compressions cause air to be expelled from the chest and oxygen to be drawn into the chest passively due to the elastic recoil of the chest. In theory， because ventilation requirements are lower than normal during cardiac arrest， oxygen supplied by passive delivery is likely to be sufficient for several minutes after onset of cardiac arrest with a patent upper airway.2 At this time there is insufficient evidence to support the removal of ventila-tions from CPR performed by ACLS providers.\n【save__datas】\t【2445】\tBag-Mask Ventilation\n【save__datas】\t【2446】\tBag-mask ventilation is an acceptable method of providing ventilation and oxygenation during CPR but is a challenging skill that requires practice for continuing competency. All healthcare providers should be familiar with the use of the bag-mask device.11，12 Use of bag-mask ventilation is not recom-mended for a lone provider. When ventilations are performed by a lone provider， mouth-to-mouth or mouth-to-mask are more efficient. When a second provider is available， bag-mask venti-lation may be used by a trained and experienced provider. But bag-mask ventilation is most effective when performed by 2trained and experienced providers. One provider opens the airway and seals the mask to the face while the other squeezes the bag. Bag-mask ventilation is particularly helpful when--connect--【2447】placement of an advanced airway is delayed or unsuccessful. The desirable components of a bag-mask device are listed in Part5： “Adult Basic Life Support.\"\n【save__datas】\t【2448】\tThe provider should use an adult (1 to 2 L) bag and the provider should deliver approximately 600 mL of tidal volume sufficient to produce chest rise over 1 second.3 This volume of ventilation is adequate for oxygenation and minimizes the risk of gastric inflation. The provider should be sure to open the airway adequately with a head tilt-chin lift， lifting the jaw against the mask and holding the mask against the face， creating a tight seal. During CPR give 2 breaths (each I second) during a brief (about3 to 4 seconds) pause after every 30 chest compressions.\n【save__datas】\t【2449】\tBag-mask ventilation can produce gastric inflation with complications， including regurgitation， aspiration， and pneu-monia. Gastric inflation can elevate the diaphragm， restrict\n【save__datas】\t【2450】\tTungmovemient.\n【save__datas】\t【2452】\tAirway Adjuncts\n【save__datas】\t【2453】\tCricoid Pressure\n【save__datas】\t【2455】\tOropharyngeal Airways\n【save__datas】\t【2457】\tNasopharyngeul Airways\n【save__datas】\t【2458】\tNasopharyngeal airways are useful in patients with airway obstruction or those at risk for developing airway obstruction， particularly when conditions such as a clenched jaw prevent placement of an oral airway. Nasopharyngeal airways are better tolerated than oral airways in patients who are not deeply unconscious. Airway bleeding can occur in up to 30%of patients following insertion of a nasopharyngeal airway.28Two case reports of inadvertent intracranial placement of a nasopharyngeal airway in patients with basilar skull frac-tures29，30 suggest that nasopharyngeal airways should be used with caution in patients with severe craniofacial injury.\n【save__datas】\t【2459】\tAs with all adjunctive equipment， safe use of the nasopha-ryngeal airway requires adequate training， practice， and retraining. No studies have specifically examined the use of\n【save__datas】\t【2460】\tNeumar et al\n【save__datas】\t【2462】\tAdvanced Airways\n【save__datas】\t【2463】\tVentilation with a bag and mask or with a bag through an advanced airway (eg， endotracheal tube or supraglottic air-way) is acceptable during CPR. All healtheare providers should be trained in delivering effective oxygenation and ventilation with a bag and mask. Because there are times when ventilation with a bag-mask device is inadequate， ideally ACLS providers also should be trained and experi-enced in insertion of an advanced airway.\n【save__datas】\t【2464】\tProviders must be aware of the risks and benefits of insertion of an advanced airway during a resuscitation at-tempt. Such risks are affected by the patient’s condition and the provider’s expertise in airway control. There are no studies directly addressing the timing of advanced airway placement and outcome during resuscitation from cardiac arrest. Although insertion of an endotracheal tube can be accomplished during ongoing chest compressions， intubation frequently is associated with interruption of compressions for many seconds. Placement of a supraglottic airway is a reasonable alternative to endotracheal intubation and can be done successfully without interrupting chest compressions.\n【save__datas】\t【2467】\tFor a patient with perfusing rhythm who requires intuba-tion， pulse oximetry and electrocardiographic (ECG) status should be monitored continuously during airway placement. Intubation attempts should be interrupted to provide oxygen-ation and ventilation as needed.\n【save__datas】\t【2468】\tTo use advanced airways effectively， healthcare providers must maintain their knowledge and skills through frequent practice. It may be helpful for providers to master one primary method of airway control. Providers should have a second (backup) strategy for airway management and venti-lation if they are unable to establish the first-choice airway adjunct. Bag-mask ventilation may serve as that backup strategy.\n【save__datas】\t【2469】\tOnce an advanced airway is inserted， providers should immediately perform a thorough assessment to ensure that it is properly positioned. This assessment should not interrupt chest compressions. Assessment by physical examination consists of visualizing chest expansion bilaterally and listen-ing over the epigastrium (breath sounds should not be heard) and the lung fields bilaterally (breath sounds should be equal and adequate). A device also should be used to confirm correct placement (see the section“Endotracheal Intubation”below).\n【save__datas】\t【2471】\tThe use of capnography to confirm and monitor correct placement of supraglottic airways has not been studied， and its utility will depend on airway design. However， effective ventilation through a supraglottic airway device should result in a capnograph waveform during CPR and after ROSC.\n【save__datas】\t【2472】\tOnce an advanced airway is in place， the 2 providers should no longer deliver cycles of CPR (ie， compressions interrupted by pauses for ventilation) unless ventilation is inadequate when compressions are not paused. Instead the compressing provider should give continuous chest compres-sions at a rate of at least 100 per minute， without pauses for ventilation. The provider delivering ventilation should pro-vide 1 breath every 6 to 8 seconds (8 to 10 breaths per minute). Providers should avoid delivering an excessive ventilation rate because doing so can compromise venous return and cardiac output during CPR. The 2 providers should change compressor and ventilator roles approximately every2 minutes to prevent compressor fatigue and deterioration in quality and rate of chest compressions. When multiple providers are present， they should rotate the compressor role about every 2 minutes.\n【save__datas】\t【2473】\tSupruglottic Airweys\n【save__datas】\t【2474】\tSupraglottic airways are devices designed to maintain an open airway and facilitate ventilation. Unlike endotracheal intubation， intubation with a supraglottic airway does not require visualiza-tion of the glottis， so both initial training and maintenance of skills are easier. Also， because direct visualization is not neces-sary， a supraglottic airway is inserted without interrupting compressions. Supraglottic airways that have been studied in cardiac arrest are the laryngeal mask airway (LMA)， the esophageal-tracheal tube (Combitube) and the laryngeal tube\n【save__datas】\t【2477】\tEsophageal-Tracheal Tube\n【save__datas】\t【2481】\tLaryngeal Tube\n【save__datas】\t【2482】\tThe advantages of the laryngeal tube (Laryngeal Tube or King LT) are similar to those of the esophageal-tracheal tube； however， the laryngeal tube is more compact and less complicated to insert (unlike the esophageal-tracheal tube， the laryngeal tube can only go into the esophagus). At this time there are limited data published on the use of the laryngeal tube in cardiac arrest.40，41，52，53 In one case series assessing 40out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients， insertion of the laryn-geal tube by trained paramedics was successful and ventila-tion was effective in 85% of patients.41 For 3 patients， ventilation was ineffective because of cuff rupture； for 3 other--connect--【2483】patients， ventilation was ineffective because of massive regurgitation and aspiration before laryngeal tube placement.\n【save__datas】\t【2485】\tLaryngeal Mask Airway\n【save__datas】\t【2487】\tBecause insertion of the laryngeal mask airway does not require laryngoscopy and visualization of the vocal cords， training in its placement and use is simpler than that for endotracheal intubation. The laryngeal mask airway also may have advantages over the endotracheal tube when access to the patient is limited，59，60 there is a possibility of unstable neck injury，l or appropriate positioning of the patient for endotracheal intubation is impossible.\n【save__datas】\t【2490】\tEndotrucheal Intubution\n【save__datas】\t【2491】\tThe endotracheal tube was once considered the optimal method of managing the airway during cardiac arrest. How-ever， intubation attempts by unskilled providers can produce complications， such as trauma to the oropharynx， interruption of compressions and ventilations for unacceptably long peri-ods， and hypoxemia from prolonged intubation attempts or failure to recognize tube misplacement or displacement. It is now clear that the incidence of complications is unacceptably high when intubation is performed by inexperienced provid-ers or monitoring of tube placement is inadequate. The optimal method of managing the airway during cardiac arrest will vary based on provider experience， characteristics of the\n【save__datas】\t【2493】\tNo prospective randomized clinical trials have performed a direct comparison of bag-mask ventilation versus endotra-cheal intubation in adult victims of cardiac arrest. One prospective， randomized controlled trial in an EMS system with short out-of-hospital transport intervals67 showed no survival advantage for endotracheal intubation over bag-mask ventilation in children； providers in this study had limited training and experience in intubation.\n【save__datas】\t【2494】\tThe endotracheal tube keeps the airway patent， permits suctioning of airway secretions， enables delivery of a high concentration of oxygen， provides an alternative route for the administration of some drugs， facilitates delivery of a selected tidal volume， and， with use of a cuff， may protect the airway from aspiration.\n【save__datas】\t【2495】\tIndications for emergency endotracheal intubation are (1) the inability of the provider to ventilate the unconscious patient adequately with a bag and mask and (2) the absence of airway protective reflexes (coma or cardiac arrest). The provider must have appropriate training and experience in endotracheal intubation.\n【save__datas】\t【2496】\tDuring CPR providers should minimize the number and duration of interruptions in chest compressions， with a goal to limit interruptions to no more than 10 seconds. Interruptions for supraglottic airway placement should not be necessary at all， whereas interruptions for endotracheal intubation can be mini-mized if the intubating provider is prepared to begin the intubation attempt-ie， insert the laryngoscope blade with the tube ready at hand-as soon as the compressing provider pauses compressions. Compressions should be interrupted only for the time required by the intubating provider to visualize the vocal cords and insert the tube； this is ideally less than 10 seconds.The compressing provider should be prepared to resume chest compressions immediately after the tube is passed through the vocal cords. If the initial intubation attempt is unsuccessful， a second attempt may be reasonable， but early consideration should be given to using a supraglottic airway.\n【save__datas】\t【2498】\tThe provider should use both clinical assessment and confirmation devices to verify tube placement immediately after insertion and again when the patient is moved. However，\n【save__datas】\t【2501】\tClinical Assessment to Confirm Tube Placement\n【save__datas】\t【2502】\tProviders should perform a thorough assessment of endotra-cheal tube position immediately after placement. This assess-ment should not require interruption of chest compressions. Assessment by physical examination consists of visualizing chest expansion bilaterally and listening over the epigastrium(breath sounds should not be heard) and the lung fields bilaterally (breath sounds should be equal and adequate). A device should also be used to confirm correct placement in the trachea (see below). If there is doubt about correct tube placement， use the laryngoscope to visualize the tube passing through the vocal cords. If still in doubt， remove the tube and provide bag-mask ventilation until the tube can be replaced.\n【save__datas】\t【2503】\tUse of Devices to Confirm Tube Placement\n【save__datas】\t【2504】\tProviders should always use both clinical assessment and devices to confirm endotracheal tube location immediately after placement and throughout the resuscitation. Two studies of patients in cardiac arrest72，77 demonstrated 100% sensitiv-ity and100% specificity for waveform capnography in identifying correct endotracheal tube placement in victims of cardiac arrest. However， 3 studies demonstrated 64% sensi-tivity and 100% specificity when waveform capnography was first used for victims with prolonged resuscitation and trans-port times.78-80 All confirmation devices should be consid-ered adjuncts to other confirmation techniques.\n【save__datas】\t【2507】\tWhen exhaled CO， is detected (positive reading for CO) in cardiac arrest， it is usually a reliable indicator of tube\n【save__datas】\t【2509】\tFalse-negative readings (defined in this context as failure to detect CO， despite tube placement in the trachea) may be present during cardiac arrest for several reasons. The most common is that blood flow and delivery of CO， to the lungs is low. False-negative results also have been reported in association with pulmonary embolus because pulmonary blood flow and delivery of CO， to the lungs are reduced. If the detector is contaminated with gastric contents or acidic drugs (eg， endotracheally administered epinephrine)， a color-imetric device may display a constant color rather than breath-to-breath color change. In addition， elimination and detection of CO， can be drastically reduced with severe airway obstruction (eg， status asthmaticus) and pulmonary edema.93，97，98 For these reasons， if CO， is not detected， we recommend that a second method be used to confirm endo-tracheal tube placement， such as direct visualization or the esophageal detector device.\n【save__datas】\t【2510】\tUse of CO，-detecting devices to determine the correct placement of other advanced airways (eg， Combitube， laryn-geal mask airway) has not been studied； their utility will depend on airway design. However， effective ventilation through a supraglottic airway device should result in capno-graph waveform during CPR and after ROSC.\n【save__datas】\t【2511】\tEsophageal Detector Devices. The EDD consists of a bulb--connect--【2512】that is compressed and attached to the endotracheal tube. If the tube is in the esophagus (positive result for an EDD)， the suction created by the EDD will collapse the lumen of the esophagus or pull the esophageal tissue against the tip of the tube， and the bulb will not re-expand. The EDD may also consist of a syringe that is attached to the endotracheal tube； the provider attempts to pull the barrel of the syringe. If the tube is in the esophagus， it will not be possible to pull the barrel (aspirate air) with the syringe.\n【save__datas】\t【2514】\tThe EDD may yield misleading results in patients with morbid obesity， late pregnancy， or status asthmaticus， or when there are copious endotracheal secretions，100，l01 because the trachea tends to collapse in the presence of these condi-tions. There is no evidence that the EDD is accurate for the continued monitoring of endotracheal tube placement.\n【save__datas】\t【2515】\tThoracic Impedance.

Preliminary studies suggest that changes in thoracic impedance， as measured\n【save__datas】\t【2517】\tThere are 2 published reports involving 6 patients where ventilation-induced changes in thoracic impedance disap-peared after esophageal intubation.106，107 There is little evi-dence for the use of thoracic impedance in diagnosing adequacy of ventilation during CPR. Treatment decisions should not be based solely on thoracic impedance measure-ments until further study has confirmed its utility and accu-racy in this population.\n【save__datas】\t【2518】\tPostintubation Airway Management\n【save__datas】\t【2521】\tVentilation After Advancedl Airwey Placement\n【save__datas】\t【2524】\tAutomatic Transport Ventilators\n【save__datas】\t【2526】\tSuction Devices\n【save__datas】\t【2527】\tBoth portable and installed suction devices should be available for resuscitation emergencies. Portable units should provide adequate vacuum and flow for pharyngeal suction. The suction device should be fitted with large-bore， nonkinking suction tubing and semirigid pharyngeal tips. Several sterile suction catheters of various sizes shouldbe available for suctioning the lumen of the advanced airway， along with a nonbreakable collection bottle and sterile water for cleaning tubes and catheters. The installed suction unit should be powerful enough to provide an airflow of >40 L/min at the end of the delivery tube and a vacuum of ≥300 mm Hg when the tube is clamped. The amount of suction should be adjustable for use in children and intubated patients.\n【len<10_filter】\t【2528】\tSummary\n【save__datas】\t【2529】\tAll basic and advanced healtheare providers should be able to provide ventilation with a bag-mask device during CPR or when the patient demonstrates cardiorespiratory com-promise. Airway control with an advanced airway， which may include an endotracheal tube or a supraglottic airway device， is a fundamental ACLS skill. Prolonged interrup-tions in chest compressions should be avoided during advanced airway placement. All providers should be able to confirm and monitor correct placement of advanced airways； this key skill is required to ensure the safe and effective use of these devices. Training， frequency of use， and monitoring of success and complications are more important than the choice of a specific advanced airway device for use during CPR.\n【save__datas】\t【2530】\tPart 8.2： Management of Cardiac Arrest\n【save__datas】\t【2531】\tOverview--connect--【2533】absence of mechanical ventricular activity or mechanical ventricular activity that is insufficient to generate a clini-cally detectable pulse. Asystole (perhaps better described as ventricular asystole) represents absence of detectable ventricular electric activity with or without atrial electric activity.\n【save__datas】\t【2534】\tSurvival from these cardiac arrest rhythms requires both basic life support (BLS) and a system of advanced cardio-vascular life support (ACLS) with integrated post-cardiac arrest care. The foundation of successful ACLS is high-quality CPR， and， for VF/pulseless VT， attempted defibrillation within minutes of collapse. For victims of witnessed VF arrest， early CPR and rapid defibrillation can significantly increase the chance for survival to hospital discharge.128-133 In comparison， other ACLS therapies such as some medications and advanced airways， although associated with an increased rate of ROSC， have not been shown to increase the rate of survival to hospital discharge.31，33，134-138 The majority of clinical trials testing these ACLS interventions， however， preceded the recently renewed emphasis on high-quality CPR and advances in post-cardiac arrest care (see Part 9：“Post-Cardiac Arrest Care\"). There-fore， it remains to be determined if improved rates of ROSC achieved with ACLS interventions might better translate into improved long-term outcomes when combined with higher-quality CPR and post-cardiac arrest interventions such as therapeutic hypothermia and early percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).\n【save__datas】\t【2537】\tIn addition to high-quality CPR， the only rhythm-specific therapy proven to increase survival to hospital discharge is defibrillation of VF/pulseless VT. Therefore， this intervention is included as an integral part of the CPR cycle when the--connect--【2538】rhythm check reveals VF/pulseless VT. Other ACLS inter-ventions during cardiac arrest may be associated with an increased rate of ROSC but have not yet been proven to increase survival to hospital discharge. Therefore， they are--connect--【2540】recommended as considerations and should be performed without compromising quality of CPR or timely defibril-lation. In other words， vascular access， drug delivery， and advanced airway placement should not cause significant interruptions in chest compression or delay defibrillation. There is insufficient evidence to recommend a specific timing or sequence (order) of drug administration and advanced airway placement during cardiac arrest. In most cases the timing and sequence of these secondary inter-ventions will depend on the number of providers partici-pating in the resuscitation and their skill levels. Timing and sequence will also be affected by whether vascular access has been established or an advanced airway placed before cardiac arrest.\n【save__datas】\t【2541】\tUnderstanding the importance of diagnosing and treating the underlying cause is fundamental to management of all cardiac arrest rhythms. During management of cardiac arrest the provider should consider the H’s and T’s to identify and treat any factor that may have caused the arrest or may be complicating the resuscitative effort (Table 1).\n【save__datas】\t【2542】\tIt is common for the arrest rhythm to evolve during the course of resuscitation. In such cases management should shift smoothly to the appropriate rhythm-based strategy. In particular， providers should be prepared to deliver a timely shock when a patient who presented with asystole or PEA is found to be in VF/pulseless VT during a rhythm check. There is no evidence that the resuscitation strategy for a new cardiac arrest rhythm should necessarily be altered--connect--【2543】based on the characteristics of the previous rhythm. Med-ications administered during resuscitation should be mon-itored and total doses tabulated to avoid potential toxicity.\n【save__datas】\t【2544】\tIf the patient achieves ROSC， it is important to begin post-cardiac arrest care immediately to avoid rearrest and optimize the patient’s chance of long-term survival with good neurologic function (see Part 9). Finally， the reality is that the majority of resuscitative efforts do not result in ROSC. Criteria for ending unsuccessful resuscitative ef-forts are addressed briefly below (see “When Should Resuscitative Efforts Stop?\") and in more detail in Part 3：“Ethics.”\n【save__datas】\t【2545】\tRhythm-Based Management of Cardiac Arrest\n【save__datas】\t【2546】\tIn most cases of witnessed and unwitnessed cardiac arrest the first provider should start CPR with chest compressions and the second provider should get or turn on the defibrillator，\n【save__datas】\t【2547】\tTable 1.

Paddles and electrode pads should be placed on the exposed chest in an anterior-lateral position. Acceptable alternative positions are anterior-posterior， anterior-left infrascapular， and anterior-right infrascapular. Rhythm checks should be brief， and if an organized rhythm is observed， a pulse check should be performed. If there is any doubt about the presence of a pulse， chest compressions should be resumed immedi-ately. If a cardiac monitor is attached to the patient at the time of arrest， the rhythm can be diagnosed before CPR is initiated.\n【save__datas】\t【2551】\tWhen a rhythm check by an automated external defibrillator(AED) reveals VF/VT， the AED will typically prompt to charge， “clear\" the victim for shock delivery， and then deliver a shock， all of which should be performed as quickly as possible. CPR should be resumed immediately after shock delivery (without a rhythm or pulse check and beginning with chest compressions) and continue for 2 minutes before the next rhythm check.\n【save__datas】\t【2552】\tWhen a rhythm check by a manual defibrillator reveals VF/VT， the first provider should resume CPR while the second provider charges the defibrillator. Once the defibril-lator is charged， CPR is paused to “clear\" the patient for shock delivery. After the patient is“clear，” the second provider gives a single shock as quickly as possible to minimize the interruption in chest compressions (“hands-off interval\"). The first provider resumes CPR immediately after shock delivery (without a rhythm or pulse check and begin-ning with chest compressions) and continues for 2 minutes. After 2 minutes of CPR the sequence is repeated， beginning with a rhythm check.\n【save__datas】\t【2553】\tThe provider giving chest compressions should switch at every 2-minute cycle to minimize fatigue. CPR quality should be monitored based on mechanical or physiologic parameters(see“Monitoring During CPR”below).\n【save__datas】\t【2554】\tDefibrillation Strategies\n【save__datas】\t【2555】\tWaveform and Energy\n【save__datas】\t【2557】\tAutomatic Versus Manual Modes for\n【save__datas】\t【2558】\tMultimodal Defibrillators\n【save__datas】\t【2559】\tUse of a multimodal defibrillator in manual mode may reduce the duration of interruption of CPR required for rhythm analysis compared with automatic mode but could increase the frequency of inappropriate shock.139，140 Current evidence indicates that the benefit of using a multimodal defibrillator\n【save__datas】\t【2569】\tNeumar et al--connect--【2570】the potential impact of increased myocardial blood flow before the next shock. However， if a shock results in a perfusing rhythm， a bolus dose of vasopressor at any time during the subsequent 2-minute period of CPR (before rhythm check) could theoretically have detrimental effects on cardiovascular stability. This may be avoided by using physiologic monitoring such as quantitative waveform cap-nography， intra-arterial pressure monitoring， and continuous central venous oxygen saturation monitoring to detect ROSC during chest compressions.93，167-177 However， adding an ad-ditional pause for rhythm and pulse check after shock delivery but before vasopressor therapy will decrease myo-cardial perfusion during the critical postshock period and could reduce the chance of achieving ROSC.\n【save__datas】\t【2572】\tTreating Potentially Reversible Causes of\n【save__datas】\t【2577】\tPEA/Asystole\n【save__datas】\t【2578】\tWhen a rhythm check by an AED reveals a nonshockable rhythm， CPR should be resumed immediately， beginning with chest compressions， and should continue for 2 minutes before the rhythm check is repeated. When a rhythm check using a manual defibrillator or cardiac monitor reveals an orgunized rhythm， a pulse check is performed. If a pulse is detected，--connect--【2579】post-cardiac arrest care should be initiated immediately (see Part 9). If the rhythm is asystole or the pulse is absent (eg， PEA)， CPR should be resumed immediately， beginning with chest compressions， and should continue for 2 minutes before the rhythm check is repeated. The provider performing chest compressions should switch every 2 minutes. CPR quality should be monitored on the basis of mechanical or physio-logic parameters (see“Monitoring During CPR”below).\n【save__datas】\t【2580】\tDrug Therapy for PEA/Asystole\n【save__datas】\t【2582】\tTreating Potentially Reversible Causes of PEA/Asystole\n【save__datas】\t【2584】\tAsystole is commonly the end-stage rhythm that follows prolonged VF or PEA， and for this reason the prognosis is generally much worse.\n【save__datas】\t【2588】\tMechanical Parumeters\n【save__datas】\t【2589】\tCPR quality can be improved by using a number of nonphysi-ologic techniques that help the provider adhere to recom---connect--【2590】mended CPR parameters such as rate and depth of compres-sion and rate of ventilation. The most simple are auditory or visual metronomes to guide providers in performing the recommended rate of chest compressions or ventilations. More sophisticated devices actually monitor chest compres-sion rate， depth， relaxation， and pauses in real time and provide visual and auditory feedback. When recorded， this information can also be useful in providing feedback to the entire team of providers after the resuscitation has ended. This type of CPR quality monitoring is discussed in more detail in Part 5： “Adult Basic Life Support\" and Part 16：“Education， Implementation and Teams.”\n【save__datas】\t【2591】\tPhysiologic Parameters\n【len<10_filter】\t【2593】\tPulse\n【save__datas】\t【2594】\tClinicians frequently try to palpate arterial pulses during chest compressions to assess the effectiveness of compressions. No studies have shown the validity or clinical utility of checking pulses during ongoing CPR. Because there are no valves in the inferior vena cava， retrograde blood flow into the venous system may produce femoral vein pulsations.202 Thus， palpation of a pulse in the femoral triangle may indicate venous rather than arterial blood flow. Carotid pulsations during CPR do not indicate the efficacy of myocardial or cerebral perfusion during CPR. Palpation of a pulse when chest compressions are paused is a reliable indicator of ROSC but is potentially less sensitive than other physiologic measures discussed below.\n【save__datas】\t【2596】\tEnd-Tidal CO，\n【save__datas】\t【2597】\tEnd-tidal CO， is the concentration of carbon dioxide in exhaled air at the end of expiration. It is typically ex---connect--【2598】pressed as a partial pressure in mm Hg (PETCO). Because CO， is a trace gas in atmospheric air， CO， detected by capnography in exhaled air is produced in the body and delivered to the lungs by circulating blood. Under normal conditions PETCO， is in the range of 35 to 40 mm Hg. During untreated cardiac arrest CO， continuesto be produced in the body， but there is no CO， delivery to the lungs. Under these conditions PETCO， will approach zero with continued ventilation. With initiation of CPR， cardiac output is the major determinant of CO， delivery to the lungs. If ventilation is relatively constant， PETCO corre-lates well with cardiac output during CPR. The correlation between PETCO， and cardiac output during CPR can be transiently altered by giving IV sodium bicarbonate.208This is explained by the fact that the bicarbonate is converted to water and CO，， causing a transient increase in delivery of CO， to the lungs. Therefore， a transient rise in PETCO， after sodium bicarbonate therapy is expected and should not be misinterpreted as an improvement in quality of CPR or a sign of ROSC. Animal and human studies have also shown that PETCO， correlates with CPP and cerebral perfusion pressure during CPR.209，210 The correlation of PETCO， with CPP during CPR can be altered by vasopres-sor therapy， especially at high doses (ie， >1 mg of epinephrine).211-214Vasopressors cause increased after-load， which will increase blood pressure and myocardial blood flow during CPR but will also decrease cardiac output. Therefore， a small decrease in PETCO， after vaso-pressor therapy may occur but should not be misinterpreted as a decrease in CPR quality.\n【save__datas】\t【2599】\tPersistently low PETCO， values (<10 mm Hg) during CPR 1n intubated\n【save__datas】\t【2602】\tNeumar et al\n【save__datas】\t【2604】\tCoronary Perfusion Pressure and Arterial\n【save__datas】\t【2605】\tRelaxation Pressure\n【save__datas】\t【2606】\tCPP (coronary perfusion pressure=aortic relaxation\\[\"diastolic”\\] pressure minus right atrial relaxation \\[“dia-stolic\"\\] pressure) during CPR correlates with both myocardial blood flow and ROSC.168，192，220 Relaxation pressure during CPR is the trough of the pressure waveform during the relaxation phase of chest compressions and is analogous to diastolic pressure when the heart is beating. Increased CPP correlates with improved 24-hour survival rates in animal studies 193 and is associated with improved myocardial blood flow and ROSC in animal studies of epinephrine， vasopressin， and angiotensin II.193-195 In one human study ROSC did not occur unless a CPP≥15 mm Hg was achieved during CPR.168 However， monitoring SP of CPP during CPR is rarely available clinically because measurement and calculation require simultaneous recording of aortic and central venous pressure.\n【save__datas】\t【2608】\tCentral Venous Oxygen Saturation\n【save__datas】\t【2609】\tWhenoxygen consumption，arterial oxygen saturation(SaO2)， and hemoglobin are constant， changes in Scvo2reflect changes in oxygen delivery by means of changes in cardiac output. Scvo， can be measured continuously using oximetric tipped central venous catheters placed in the superior vena cava. Scvo， values normally range from 60% to80%. During cardiac arrest and CPR these values range from25% to 35%， indicating the inadequacy of blood flow produced during CPR. In one clinical study the failure to achieve Scvo2 of 30% during CPR was associated with failure to achieve ROSC.169 Scvo， also helps to rapidly detect ROSC without interrupting chest compressions to check rhythm and pulse. When available， continuous Scvo2 moni-toring is a potentially useful indicator of cardiac output and\n【save__datas】\t【2611】\tPulse Oximetry\n【save__datas】\t【2612】\tDuring cardiac arrest， pulse oximetry typically does not provide a reliable signal because pulsatile blood flow is inadequate in peripheral tissue beds. But the presence of a plethysmograph waveform on pulse oximetry is potentially valuable in detecting ROSC， and pulse oximetry is useful to ensure appropriate oxygenation after ROSC.\n【save__datas】\t【2613】\tArterial Blood Gases\n【save__datas】\t【2615】\tEchocurdiography\n【save__datas】\t【2617】\tAccess for Parenteral Medications During Cardiac Arrest\n【save__datas】\t【2619】\tDuring cardiac arrest， provision of high-quality CPR and rapid defibrillation are of primary importance and drug administration is of secondary importance. After beginning CPR and attempting defibrillation for identified VF or pulse-less VT， providers can establish IV or IO access. This should be performed without interrupting chest compressions. The primary purpose of IV/IO access during cardiac arrest is to provide drug therapy. Two clinical studies134，136 reported data suggesting worsened survival for every minute that antiar-rhythmic drug delivery was delayed (measured from time of dispatch). However， this finding was potentially biased by a concomitant delay in onset of other ACLS interventions. In one study136 the interval from first shock to administration of an antiarrhythmic drug was a significant predictor of survival.\n【save__datas】\t【2620】\tOne animal study231 reported lower CPP when delivery of a vasopressor was delayed. Time to drug administration was also a predictor of ROSC in a retrospective analysis of swine cardiac arrest.232 Thus， although time to drug treatment appears to have importance， there is insufficient evidence to specify exact time parameters or the precise sequence with which drugs should be administered during cardiac arrest.\n【save__datas】\t【2622】\tIf a resuscitation drug is administered by a peripheral venous route， it should be administered by bolus injection and followed with a 20-mL bolus of IV fluid to facilitate the drug flow from the extremity into the central circulation.233 Briefly elevating the extremity during and after drug administration theoretically may also recruit the benefit of gravity to facilitate delivery to the central circulation but has not been systematically studied.\n【save__datas】\t【2627】\tEndotracheal Drug Delivery--connect--【2629】and--connect--【2630】multiple animal studies252-254 have shownthat lido-caine，248，255 epinephrine，256 atropine，257 naloxone， and vaso-pressin254 are absorbed via the trachea. There are no data--connect--【2631】regarding endotracheal administration of amiodarone. Ad-ministration of resuscitation drugs into the trachea results in lower blood concentrations than when the same dose is given intravascularly. Furthermore， the results of recent animal studies258，259 suggest that the lower epinephrine concentra-tions achieved when the drug is delivered endotracheally may produce transient β-adrenergic effects， resulting in vasodila-tion. These effects can be detrimental， causing hypotension， lower CPP and flow， and reduced potential for ROSC. Thus， although endotracheal administration of some resuscitation drugs is possible， IV or IO drug administration is preferred because it will provide more predictable drug delivery and pharmacologic effect.\n【save__datas】\t【2632】\tIn one nonrandomized cohort study of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in adults260 using a randomized control， IV administration of atropine and epinephrine was associated with a higher rate of ROSC and survival to hospital admission than administration by the endotracheal route. Five percent of those who received IV drugs survived to hospital discharge， but no patient survived in the group receiving drugs by the endotracheal route.\n【save__datas】\t【2634】\tAdvanced Airway\n【save__datas】\t【2635】\tThere is inadequate evidence to define the optimal timing of advanced airway placement in relation to other interventions during resuscitation from cardiac arrest. There are no pro-spective studies that directly address the relationship between timing or type of advanced airway placement during CPR and outcomes. In an urban out-of-hospital setting， intubation in<12 minutes has been associated with a better rate of survival than intubation in ≥13 minutes.32 In a registry study of25 006 in-hospital cardiac arrests， earlier time to advanced airway (<5 minutes) was not associated with increased ROSC but was associated with improved 24-hour survival.31In out-of-hospital urban and rural settings， patients intubated during resuscitation had better survival rates than patients who were not intubated.33 In an in-hospital setting patients requiring intubation during CPR had worse survival rates.34 A recent study’ found that delayed endotracheal intubation combined with passive oxygen delivery and minimally inter-rupted chest compressions was associated with improved neurologically intact survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in patients with witnessed VF/VT.\n【save__datas】\t【2636】\tAdvantages of advanced airway placement include elimi-nation of the need for pauses in chest compressions for\n【save__datas】\t【2637】\tNeumar et al--connect--【2638】ventilation， potentially improved ventilation and oxygena-tion， reduction in the risk of aspiration， and ability to use quantitative waveform capnography to monitor quality of CPR， optimize chest compressions， and detect ROSC during chest compressions or when a rhythm check reveals an organized rhythm. The primary disadvantages are interrup-tions in chest compression during placement and the risk of unrecognized esophageal intubation.\n【save__datas】\t【2639】\tWhen an advanced airway (eg， endotracheal tube or supra-glottic airway) is placed， 2 providers no longer deliver cycles of compressions interrupted with pauses for ventilation. Instead， the provider performing compressions should deliver at least 100 compressions per minute continuously without pauses for ventilation. The provider delivering ventilations should give 1 breath every 6 to 8 seconds (8 to 10 breaths per minute) and should be careful to avoid delivering an exces-sive number of ventilations.\n【save__datas】\t【2640】\tWhen Should Resuscitative Efforts Stop?\n【save__datas】\t【2641】\tThe final decision to stop can never rest on a single parameter， such as duration of resuscitative efforts. Rather， clinical judgment and respect for human dignity must enter into decision making. In the out-of-hospital setting， cessation of resuscitative efforts in adults should follow system-specific criteria under direct medical control. There are limited clinical data to guide this decision in neonatal and pediatric out-of-hospital or in-hospital cardiac arrest. A more detailed discussion is provided in Part 3：“Ethics.”\n【save__datas】\t【2642】\tMedications for Arrest Rhythms\n【save__datas】\t【2643】\tThe primary goal of pharmacologic therapy during cardiac arrest is to facilitate restoration and maintenance of a perfus-ing spontaneous rhythm. Toward this goal， ACLS drug therapy during CPR is often associated with increased rates of ROSC and hospital admission but not increased rates of long-term survivalVwith good neurologic outcome. One study138 randomized patients to IV or no IV medications during management of adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The study demonstrated higher rates of ROSC in the IV group(40% IV versus 25% no IV \\[odds ratio (OR) 1.99； 95%confidence interval (CI) 1.48 to 2.67\\])， but there was no statistical difference in survival to hospital discharge (10.5%IV versus 9.2% no IV \\[OR 1.16； 95% CI 0.74 to 1.821) or survival with favorable neurologic outcome (9.8% IV versus8.1% no IV \\[OR 1.24；95% CI 0.77 to 1.98\\]). This study was not adequately powered to detect clinically important differ-ences in long-term outcomes. Evidence from one nonrandom-ized trial137 found that the addition of ACLS interventions including IV drugs in a previously optimized BLS system with rapid defibrillation resulted in an increased rate of ROSC (18.0% with ACLS versus12.9% before ACLS. P<0.001) and hospital admission (14.6% with ACLS versus10.9% before ACLS，P<0.001) but no statistical difference in survival to hospital discharge (5.1% with ACLS versus 5.0%before ACLS). Whether optimized high-quality CPR and advances in post-cardiac arrest care will enable the increased--connect--【2644】rates of ROSC with ACLS medications to be translated into increased long-term survival remains to be determined.\n【save__datas】\t【2645】\tVasopressors\n【save__datas】\t【2646】\tTo date no placebo-controlled trials have shown that admin-istration of any vasopressor agent at any stage during man-agement of VF， pulseless VT， PEA， or asystole increases the rate of neurologically intact survival to hospital discharge. There is evidence， however， that the use of vasopressor agents is associated with an increased rate of ROSC.\n【save__datas】\t【2647】\tEpinephrine\n【save__datas】\t【2651】\tVusopressin\n【save__datas】\t【2654】\tOther Vasopressors\n【save__datas】\t【2656】\tAntiarrhythmics\n【save__datas】\t【2657】\tThere is no evidence that any antiarrhythmic drug given routinely during human cardiac arrest increases survival to hospital discharge. Amiodarone， however， has been shown to increase short-term survival to hospital admission when compared with placebo or lidocaine.\n【save__datas】\t【2658】\tAmiodarone\n【save__datas】\t【2659】\tIV amiodarone affects sodium， potassium， and calcium chan-nels and has a- and p-adrenergic blocking properties. It can be considered for treatment of VF or pulseless VT unrespon-sive to shock delivery， CPR， and a vasopressor. In blinded randomized controlled clinical trials in adults with refractory VF/pulseless VT in the out-of-hospital setting，134，136 para-medic administration of amiodarone (300 mgl34 or 5 mg/kgl36) improved hospital admission rates when compared with administration of placebol34 or 1.5 mg/kg of lidocaine.136Additional studies283-287 documented consistent improvement in termination of arrhythmias when amiodarone was given to humans or animals with VF or hemodynamically unstable VT. A higher incidence of bradycardia and hypotension was reported for amiodarone in one out-of-hospital study.134 A canine study288 noted that administration of a vasoconstrictor before amiodarone prevented hypotension. The adverse he-modynamic effects of the IV formulation of amiodarone are attributed to vasoactive solvents (polysorbate 80 and benzyl alcohol). When administered in the absence of these solvents， an analysis of the combined data of 4 prospective clinical trials of patients with VT (some hemodynamically unstable) showed that amiodarone produced no more hypotension than lidocaine.286 A formulation of IV amiodarone without these vasoactive solvents was approved for use in the United States.\n【save__datas】\t【2661】\tLidocaine\n【save__datas】\t【2662】\tA retrospective review289 demonstrated an association between improved hospital admission rates and use of lidocaine (compared with standard treatment) in patients with out-of-hospital VF cardiac arrest. But there is inade-quate evidence to recommend the use of lidocaine in patients who have refractory VT/VF， defined as VT/VF not terminated by defibrillation or that continues to recur after defibrillation during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest or in-hospital cardiac arrest.\n【save__datas】\t【2663】\tLidocaine is an alternative antiarrhythmic of long-standing and widespread familiarity with fewer immediate side effects\n【save__datas】\t【2665】\tMugnesium Sulfate\n【save__datas】\t【2669】\tInterventions Not Recommended for Routine Use During Cardiac Arrest\n【len<10_filter】\t【2670】\tAtropine\n【save__datas】\t【2672】\tSodium Bicarbonate\n【save__datas】\t【2673】\tTissue acidosis and resulting acidemia during cardiac arrest and resuscitation are dynamic processes resulting from no blood flow during arrest and low blood flow during CPR. These processes are affected by the duration of cardiac arrest， level of blood flow， and arterial oxygen content during CPR. Restoration of oxygen content with appropriate ventilation with oxygen， support of some tissue perfusion and some cardiac output with high-quality chest compressions， then rapid ROSC are the mainstays of restoring acid-base balance during cardiac arrest.\n【save__datas】\t【2674】\tNeumar et al\n【save__datas】\t【2676】\tThere are few data to support therapy with buffers during cardiac arrest. There is no evidence that bicarbonate improves the likelihood of defibrillation or survival rates in animals with VF cardiac arrest. A wide variety of adverse effects have been linked to administration of bicarbonate during cardiac arrest. Bicarbonate may compromise CPP by reducing sys-temic vascular resistance.313 It can create extracellular alka-losis that will shift the oxyhemoglobin saturation curve and inhibit oxygen release. It can produce hypernatremia and therefore hyperosmolarity. It produces excess CO， which freely diffuses into myocardial and cerebral cells and may paradoxically contribute to intracellular acidosis.314 It can exacerbate central venous acidosis and may inactivate simul-taneously administered catecholamines.\n【len<10_filter】\t【2678】\tCalcium\n【save__datas】\t【2680】\tFibrinolysis\n【save__datas】\t【2681】\tFibrinolytic therapy was proposed for use during cardiac arrest to treat both coronary thrombosis (acute coronary syndrome) with presumably complete occlusion of a proxi-mal coronary artery and major life-threatening pulmonary embolism.

When hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachyarrhythmias were induced during electro-physiological testing， initial administration of a precordial thump appeared to be safe but rarely effective in terminating ventricular arrhythmias.351 In a prospective observational study of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest， prec-ordial thump was associated with ROSC when administered promptly to patients with responder-witnessed asystolic ar-rest. When administered for VF/VT or PEA arrest it was ineffective but resulted in no apparent harm.352 In 3 case series353-355 VF or pulseless VT was converted to a perfusing rhythm by a precordial thump.

When cardiac arrest occurs， high-quality CPR is fundamental to the success of any subsequent ACLS intervention. During resuscitation healthcare pro-viders must perform chest compressions of adequate rate and depth， allow complete recoil of the chest after each compression， minimize interruptions in chest compres-sions， and avoid excessive ventilation， especially with an advanced airway. Quality of CPR should be continuously monitored. Physiologic monitoring may prove useful to optimize resuscitative efforts. For patients in VF/pulseless VT， shocks should be delivered promptly with minimal interruptions in chest compressions. The increased rates of ROSC associated with ACLS drug therapy have yet to be translated into long-term survival benefits. However， im-proved quality of CPR， advances in post-cardiac arrest care， and improved overall implementation through com-prehensive systems of care may provide a pathway to optimize the outcomes of cardiac arrest patients treated with ACLS interyentions.\n【save__datas】\t【2695】\tPart 8.3： Management of Symptomatic Bradycardia and Tachycardia\n【len<10_filter】\t【2696】\tOverview\n【save__datas】\t【2697】\tThis section highlights recommendations for management of patients with acute symptomatic arrhythmias. Electro-cardiographic (ECG) and rhythm information should be interpreted within the context of total patient assessment. Errors in diagnosis and treatment are likely to occur if advanced cardiovascular life support (ACLS) providers base treatment decisions solely on rhythm interpretation and neglect clinical evaluation. Providers must evaluate the patient’s symptoms and clinical signs， including ven-tilation， oxygenation， heart rate， blood pressure， level of consciousness， and signs of inadequate organ perfusion.\n【save__datas】\t【2698】\tUnstable and symptomatic are terms typically used to describe the condition of patients with arrhythmias. Gen-erally， unstable refers to a condition in which vital organ function is acutely impaired or cardiac arrest is ongoing or imminent. When an arrhythmia causes a patient to be unstable， immediate intervention is indicated. Symptomatic implies that an arrhythmia is causing symptoms， such as palpitations， lightheadedness， or dyspnea， but the patient is stable and not in imminent danger. In such cases more time is available to decide on the most appropriate intervention. In both unstable and symptomatic cases the provider must--connect--【2699】make an assessment as to whether it is the arrhythmia that is causing the patient to be unstable or symptomatic. For example， a patient in septic shock with sinus tachycardia of140 beats per minute is unstable； however， the arrhythmia is a physiologic compensation rather than the cause of instability. Therefore， electric cardioversion will not im-prove this patient’s condition. Additionally， if a patient with respiratory failure and severe hypoxemia becomes hypotensive and develops a bradycardia， the bradycardia is not the primary cause of instability. Treating the bradycar-dia without treating the hypoxemia is unlikely to improve the patient’s condition. It is critically important to deter-mine the cause of the patient’s instability in order to properly direct treatment. In general， sinus tachycardia is a response to other factors and， thus， it rarely (if ever) is the cause of instability in and of itself.\n【save__datas】\t【2704】\tIf the patient with tachycardia is stable， determine if the patient has a narrow-complex or wide-complex tachycardia， whether the rhythm is regular or irregular， and for wide complexes whether the QRS morphology is monomorphic or polymorphic. Therapy is then tailored accordingly (Table 2).\n【save__datas】\t【2705】\tKnow when to call for expert consultation regarding complicated rhythm interpretation， drugs， or management decisions.\n【save__datas】\t【2706】\tA comprehensive presentation of the evaluation and man-agement of bradyarrhythmias and tachyarrhythmias is beyond\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Drug  | Characteristics  | Indication(s)  | Dosing  | Side Effects  | Precautions or Special Considerations  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Aimiodarone  | Multichannel blocker  | · Stable irregular narrow complex tachycardia  | 150 ing given over 10 minutes  | Bradycardia，  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  | (sodiui， potassium，  | fatrial fibrillation\\]  | and repeated if necessary，  | hypotension，  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  | calciui channel.  | ● Stable regular narrow-complex tachycardia  | followed by a 1 mg/min infusion  | phlebitis  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  | and noncoipetitive  | ● To control rapid ventricular rate due to  | for 6 hours， followed by 0.5  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Digoxin  | ce/B-blocker  | accessory pathway conduction in pre-excited  | ig/min.

This synchronization avoids shock delivery during the relative refractory period of the cardiac cycle when a shock could produce VF.371 If cardioversion is needed and it is impossible to synchronize a shock， use high-energy unsynchronized shocks (defibrillation doses).\n【save__datas】\t【2780】\tSynchronized cardioversion is recommended to treat (1) unstable SVT， (2) unstable atrial fibrillation， (3) unstable atrial flutter， and (4) unstable monomorphic (regular) VT.

Sinus tachycardia is defined as a heart rate >100 beats per minute. The upper rate of sinus tachycardia is age-related(calculated as approximately 220 beats per minute， minus the patient’s age in years) and may be useful in judging whether an apparent sinus tachycardia falls within the expected range for a patient’s age. If judged to be sinus tachycardia， no specific drug treatment is required. Instead， therapy is directed toward identi-fication and treatment of the underlying cause. When cardiac function is poor， cardiac output can be dependent on a rapid heart rate. In such compensatory tachycardias， stroke volume is limited， so“normalizing\" the heart rate can be detrimental\n【save__datas】\t【2790】\tSupraventricular Tachycardia (Reentry SVT)\n【save__datas】\t【2791】\tEvaluation..\n【save__datas】\t【2792】\tMost SVTs are regular tachycardias that are caused by reentry， an abnormal rhythm circuit that allows a wave of depolarization to repeatedly travel in a circle in cardiac tissue. The rhythm is considered to be of supraven-tricular origin if the QRS complex is narrow (<120 mORSillisec- onds or <0.12 second) or if the QRS complex is wide (broad) and preexisting bundle branch block or rate-dependent aber-rancy is known to be present. Reentry circuits resulting in SVT can occur in atrial myocardium (resulting in atrial fibrillation， atrial1flutter， and some iforms of atrial tachycardia). The reentry circuit may also reside in whole or in part in the AV node itself. This results in AV nodal reentry tachycardia (AVNRT) if both limbs of the reentry circuit involve AV nodal tissue. Alternatively， it may result in AV reentry tachycardia (AVRT) if one limb of the reentry circuit involves an accessory pathway and the other involves the AV node. The characteristic abrupt onset and termination of each of the latter groups of reentrant tachyarrhythmias (AVNRT and AVRT) led to the original name， paroxysmal supraven-tricular tachycardia (PSVT). This subgroup of reentry ar-rhythmias， due to either AVNRT or AVRT， is characterized by abrupt onset and termination and a regular rate that exceeds the typical upper limits of sinus tachycardia at rest(usually ≥150 beats per minute) and， in the case of an AVNRT， often presents without readily identifiable P waves on the ECG.\n【save__datas】\t【2793】\tDistinguishing the forms of reentrant SVTs that are based in atrial myocardium (such as atrial fibrillation) versus those with a reentry circuit partly or wholly based in the AV node itself(PSVT) is important because each will respond differently to therapies aimed at impeding conduction through the AV node. The ventricular rate of reentry arrhythmias based in atrial myocardium will be slowed but not terminated by drugs that slow conduction through the AV node. Conversely， reentry arrhythmias for which at least one limb of the circuit resides in the AV node (PSVT attributable to AVNRT or AVRT) can be terminated by such drugs.\n【save__datas】\t【2794】\tNeumar et al\n【save__datas】\t【2795】\tYet another group of SVTs is referred to as automatic tachycardias. These arrhythmias are not due to a circulat-ing circuit but to an excited automatic focus. Unlike the abrupt pattern of reentry， the characteristic onset and termination of these tachyarrhythmias are more gradual and analogous to how the sinus node behaves in gradually accelerating and slowing heart rate. These automatic ar-rhythmias include ectopic atrial tachycardia， MAT， and junctional tachycardia. These arrhythmias can be difficult tottreat， are not responsive to cardioversion， and are usually controlled acutely with drugs that slow conduction through the AV node and thereby slow ventricular rate.\n【len<10_filter】\t【2796】\tTherapy\n【save__datas】\t【2799】\tA number of studies381-398 support the use of adenosine in the treatment of stable PSVT. Although 2 randomized clinical trials383，386 documented a similar PSVT conversion rate be-tween adenosine and calcium channel blockers， adenosine was more rapid and had fewer severe side effects than verapamil. Amiodarone as well as other antiarrhythmic agents can be useful in the termination of PSVT， but the onset of action of amiodarone is slower than that of adenosine，399and the potential proarrhythmic risks of these agents favor the use of safer treatment alternatives.--connect--【2800】is safe and effective in pregnancy.400 However，nary adenosine does have several important drug interactions. Larger doses may be required for patients with a significant blood level of theophylline， caffeine， or theobromine. The initial dose should be reduced to 3 mg in patients taking dipyridamole or carbamazepine， those with transplanted hearts， or if given by central venous access. Side effects with adenosine are common but transient； flushing， dyspnea， and chest discomfort are the most frequently observed.401 Aden-osine should not be given to patients with asthma.\n【save__datas】\t【2801】\tAfter conversion， monitor the patient for recurrence and treat any recurrence of PSVT with adenosine or a longer-acting AV nodal blocking agent (eg， diltiazem or B-blocker). If adenosine or vagal maneuvers disclose another form of SVT (such as atrial fibrillation or flutter)， treatment with a longer-acting AV nodal blocking agent should be considered to afford more lasting control of ventricular rate.\n【save__datas】\t【2803】\tFor verapamil， give a 2.5 mg to 5 mg IV bolus over 2 minutes(over 3 minutes in older patients). If there is no therapeutic response and no drug-induced adverse event， repeated doses of5 mg to 10 mg may be administered every 15 to 30 minutes to a total dose of 20 mg. An alternative dosing regimen is to give a 5 mg bolus every 15 minutes to a total dose of 30 mg. Verapamil should be given only to patients with narrow-complex reentry SVT or arrhythmias known with certainty to be of supraventricular origin. Verapamil should not be given to patients with wide-complex tachycardias. It should not be given to patients with impaired ventricular function or heart failure.\n【save__datas】\t【2804】\tFor diltiazem， give a dose of 15 mg to 20 mg (0.25 mg/kg) ⅣV over 2 minutes； if needed， in 15 minutes give an additional IV dose of 20 mg to 25 mg (0.35 mg/kg). The maintenance infusion dose is 5 mg/hour to 15 mg/hour， titrated to heart rate.\n【save__datas】\t【2805】\tA wide variety of IV -blockers are available for treatment of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. These include metoprolol， atenolol， propranolol， esmolol， and labetolol (the latter more commonly used for acute management of hypertension than for arrhythmias). In principle these agents exert their effect by antagonizing sympathetic tone in nodal tissue， resulting in slowing of conduction. Like calcium channel blockers， they also have negative inotropic effects and further reduce cardiac output in patients with heart failure. More detailed information is provided below. Side effects of p-blockers can include brady-cardias， AV conduction delays， and hypotension. p-blockers should be used with caution in patients with obstructive pulmo-nary disease or congestive heart failure.\n【save__datas】\t【2807】\tCaution is also advised to avoid the combination of AV nodal blocking agents that have a longer duration of action. For example， the short elimination half-life of adenosine affords follow-up treatment， if required， with a calcium channel blocker or p-blocker. Conversely the longer half-life of a calcium channel or B-blocker means their effects will overlap； profound bradycardia can develop if they are given serially.\n【save__datas】\t【2808】\tAlthough antiarrhythmic medications (eg， amiodarone， pro-cainamide， or sotalol) can also be used to treat SVTs， the higher toxicity and risk for proarrhythmia make these medications less desirable alternatives to the described AV nodal blocking agents. A possible exception is in patients with pre-excited atrial arrhythmias； the typical AV nodal blocking drugs are contrain-dicated in these patients and rate control may be achieved with antiarrhythmic medications. Importantly， use of these agents for atrial-based SVTs， such as atrial fibrillation and flutter can result in their termination， which may be undesirable in the absence of precautions to prevent the thromboembolic complications that may result from such conversion.\n【save__datas】\t【2810】\tEvaluation\n【save__datas】\t【2813】\tWide-complex tachycardias are defined as those with a QRS ≥0.12 second.

Procainamide should be avoided in patients with prolonged QT and congestive heart failure.\n【save__datas】\t【2827】\tⅣV sotalol (100 mg IV over 5 minutes) was found to be more effective than lidocaine (100 mg IV over 5 minutes) when administered to patients with spontaneous hemodynamically stable sustained monomorphic VT in a double-blind randomized trial within a hospital setting.420 In a separate study of 109patients with a history of spontaneous and inducible sustained\n【save__datas】\t【2828】\tNeumar et al--connect--【2829】ventricular tachyarrhythmias， infusing 1.5 mg/kg of sotalol over≤5 minutes was found to be relatively safe and effective， causing hypotension in only 2 patients， both of whom responded to ⅣV fluid.421 Package insert recommends slow infusion， but the literature supports more rapid infusion of 1.5 mg/kg over 5minutes or less. Sotalol should be avoided in patients with a prolonged QT interval.\n【save__datas】\t【2830】\tAmiodarone is also effective in preventing recurrent monomorphicVTOrtreating refractory ventricular arrhythmias286，422-424 in patients with coronary artery disease and poor ventricular function. It is given 150 mg IV over 10minutes； dosing should be repeated as needed to a maximum dose of 2.2 g IV per 24 hours. Higher doses (300 mg) were associated with an increased frequency of hypotension， al-though some reports422，424 attributed the hypotension to the vasoactive solvents that are not present in a new form of the drug recently approved for use in the US.\n【save__datas】\t【2831】\tBy comparison， lidocaine is less effective in terminating VT than procainamide， sotalol， and amiodarone， 286，419，420 and when given to patients with or without a history of MI with sponta-neous sustained stable VT in the hospital setting.413，425，426 Lido-caine has been reported to variably terminate VT when admin-istered intramuscularly to patients with AMI and VT in the out-of-hospital setting.427，428 Thus， while occasionally effective， lidocaine should be considered second-line antiarrhythmic ther-apy for monomorphic VT. Lidocaine can be administered at a dose of 1 to 1.5 mg/kg IV bolus. Maintenance infusion is l to 4mg/min (30 to 50 mcg/kg per minute).\n【save__datas】\t【2832】\tIrregular Tachycardias\n【save__datas】\t【2833】\tAtrial Fibrillation and Flutter\n【save__datas】\t【2834】\tEvaluation\n【save__datas】\t【2835】\tAn irregular narrow-complex or wide-complex tachycardia is most likely atrial fibrillation (with or without aberrant conduc-tion) with an uncontrolled ventricular response. Other diagnostic possibilities include MAT or sinus rhythm/tachycardia with frequent atrial premature beats. When there is doubt about the rhythm diagnosis and the patient is stable， a 12-lead ECG with expert consultation is recommended.\n【len<10_filter】\t【2836】\tTherapy\n【save__datas】\t【2838】\tRate Control\n【save__datas】\t【2839】\tPatients who are hemodynamically unstable should receive prompt electric cardioversion. More stable patients require\n【save__datas】\t【2841】\tA wide-complex irregular rhythm should be considered pre-excited atrial fibrillation. Expert consultation is advised. Avoid AV nodal blocking agents such as adenosine， calcium channel blockers， digoxin， and possibly p-blockers in patients with pre-excitation atrial fibrillation because these drugs may cause a paradoxical increase in the ventricular response.Typically， patients with pre-excited atrial fibrillation present with very rapid heart rates and require emergent electric cardioversion. When electric cardioversion is not feasible or effective， or atrial fibrillation is recurrent， use of rhythm control agents (discussed below) may be useful for both rate control and stabilization of the rhythm.\n【save__datas】\t【2842】\tRhythm Control\n【save__datas】\t【2843】\tA variety of agents have been shown to be effective in terminating atrial fibrillation (pharmacologic or chemical cardioversion)， although suecess between them varies and not all are available as parenteral formulations. Expert consulta-tion is recommended.\n【save__datas】\t【2845】\tPolymorphic (irregular) VT requires immediate defibrillation with the same strategy used for VF.\n【save__datas】\t【2846】\tPharmacologic treatment to prevent recurrent polymorphic VT should be directed by the underlying cause of VT and the presence or absence of a long QT interval during sinus rhythm.\n【save__datas】\t【2847】\tIf a long QT interval is observed during sinus rhythm (ie， the VT is torsades de pointes)， the first step is to stop medications known to prolong the QT interval. Correct electrolyte imbalance and other acute precipitants (eg， drug overdose or poisoning： see Part 12.7： “Cardiac Arrest Associated With Toxic Ingestions\"). Although magnesium is commonly used to treat torsades de pointes VT (polymorphic VT associated with long QT interval)， it is supported by only 2 observational studies107，170 that showed effectiveness in patients with prolonged QT interval. One adult case series439 showed that isoproterenol or ventricular pacing can be effective in terminating torsades de pointes associated with bradycardia and drug-induced QT prolongation. Polymorphic VT associated with familial long QT syndrome may be treated with ⅣV magnesium， pacing， and/or p-blockers； isoproterenol should be avoided. Polymorphic VT associated with acquired long QT syndrome may be treated with IV magnesium. The addition of pacing or IV isoproterenol may be considered when polymorphic VT is accompanied by bradycardia or appears to be precipitated by pauses in rhythm.\n【save__datas】\t【2850】\tOther causes of polymorphic VT apart from ischemia and long QT syndrome are catecholaminergic VT (which may be responsive to p-blockers) and Brugada syndrome (which may be responsive to isoproterenol).\n【len<10_filter】\t【2851】\tSummary\n【save__datas】\t【2852】\tThe goal of therapy for bradycardia or tachycardia is to rapidly identify and treat patients who are hemodynamically unstable or symptomatic due to the arrhythmia. Drugs or， when appropriate， pacing may be used to control unstable or symptomatic bradycardia. Cardioversion or drugs or both may be used to control unstable or symptomatic tachycardia. ACLS providers should closely monitor stable patients pend-ing expert consultation and should be prepared to aggres-sively treat those with evidence of decompensation.\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Writing  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Group  |  |  | Other Research  | Speakers' Bureau/  | Ownership  | Consultant/  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Member  | Employment  | Research Grant  | Support  | Honoraria  | Interest  | Advisory Board  | Other  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Robert W.  | University of  | None  | None  | None  | None  | None  | None  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Neumar  | Pennsylvania-Associate  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  | Professor of  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  | Emergency Medicine  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Charles W.  | University of Arizona-  | None  | None  | None  | None  | None  | None  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Otto  | Professor  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Mark S.  | Tufts Medical Center-  | None  | None  | None  | None  | None  | None  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Link  | Physician  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Steven L.  | University of  | None  | None  | None  | None  | None  | None  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Kronick  | Michigan-Assistant  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  | Professor  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Michael  | Self-employed-  | None  | None  | None  | None  | None  | None  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Shuster  | emergency physician  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n【[*]_filter】\t【None】\t| Clifton W.  | University of Pittsburgh  | fGrants to  | \\*Loan of an  | None  | tCo-inventor on  | None  | None  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Callaway  | School of  | University of  | Arctic Sun  |  | patent about  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  | Medicine-Associate  | Pittsburgh：  | cooling device  |  | ventricular  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  | Professor； UPMC  | NHLBI-  | fwithout  |  | fibrillation  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  | Health  | Resuscitation  | disposables) to  |  | waveform  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  | System—Physician  | Outcomes  | human  |  | analysis，  |  |  |\n【[*]_filter】\t【None】\t|  | \\*American Heart  | Consortium  | physiology  |  | licensed by  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  | Association-Work Sheet  | HRSA-Development  | laboratory for  |  | University of  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  | Editor for 2010  | and Dissemination  | experiments on  |  | Pittsburgh to  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  | Guidelines.

This is based in part on the publication of results of randomized controlled clinical trials as well as a description of the post-cardiac arrest syndrome.l-3 Post-cardiac arrest care has significant potential to reduce early mortality caused by hemo-dynamic instability and later morbidity and mortality from multiorgan failure and brain injury.3.4 This section summarizes our evolving understanding of the hemodynamic， neurologi-cal， and metabolic abnormalities encountered in patients who are initially resuscitated from cardiac arrest.\n【save__datas】\t【3424】\tThe initial objectives of post-cardiac arrest care are to\n【save__datas】\t【3425】\t· Optimize cardiopulmonary function and vital organ perfusion.\n【save__datas】\t【3426】\t· After out-of-hospital cardiac arrest， transport patient to an appro-priate hospital with a comprehensive post-cardiac arrest treat-ment system of care that includes acute coronary interventions， neurological care， goal-directed critical care， and hypothermia.\n【save__datas】\t【3427】\t· Transport the in-hospital post-cardiac arrest patient to an appropriate critical-care unit capable of providing compre-hensive post-cardiac arrest care.\n【save__datas】\t【3428】\t· Try to identify and treat the precipitating causes of the arrest and prevent recurrent arrest.\n【save__datas】\t【3429】\tSubsequent objectives of post-cardiac arrest care are to\n【save__datas】\t【3430】\t· Control body temperature to optimize survival and neuro-logical recovery\n【save__datas】\t【3431】\t· Identify and treat acute coronary syndromes (ACS)\n【save__datas】\t【3432】\t· Optimize mechanical ventilation to minimize lung injury\n【save__datas】\t【3433】\t· Reduce the risk of multiorgan injury and support organ function if required\n【save__datas】\t【3434】\t· Objectively assess prognosis for recovery\n【save__datas】\t【3435】\t· Assist survivors with rehabilitation services when required\n【save__datas】\t【3436】\tSystems of Care for Improving Post-Cardiac Arrest Outcomes--connect--【3438】after cardiac arrest.5.6 The best hospital care for patients with ROSC after cardiac arrest is not completely known， but there is increasing interest in identifying and optimizing practices that are likely to improve outcomes (Table 1).7 Positive associations have been noted between the likelihood of survival and the number of cardiac arrest cases treated at any individual hospi-tal.8.9 Because multiple organ systems are affected after cardiac arrest， successful post-cardiac arrest care will Ost-Cbenefit from the development of system-wide plans for proactive treatment of these patients. For example， restoration of blood pressure and gas exchange does not ensure survival and functional recovery. Significant cardiovascular dysfunction can develop， requiring support of blood flow and ventilation， including intravascular volume expansion， vasoactive and inotropic drugs， and invasive devices. TheS..rapeutic hypothermia and treatment of the underly- ing cause of cardiac arrest impacts survival and neurological outcomes. Protocolized hemodynamic optimization and multi-disciplinary early goal-directed therapy protocols have been introduced as part of a bundle of care to improve survival rather than single interventions.10-12 The data suggests that proactive titration of post-cardiac arrest hemodynamics to levels intended to ensure organ perfusion and oxygenation may improve out-comes. There are multiple specific options for acheiving these goals， and it is difficult to distinguish between the benefit of protocols or any specific component of care that is most important.\n【save__datas】\t【3440】\tOverview of Post-Cardiac Arrest Care\n【save__datas】\t【3441】\tThe provider of CPR should ensure an adequate airway and support breathing immediately after ROSC.

It may be necessary to replace a supraglot-tic airway used for initial resuscitation with an endotracheal tube， although the timing of replacement may vary. Methods for securing an advanced airway are discussed in Part 8.1：“Airway Management，”but several simple maneuvers deserve consider-ation. For example， rescuers and long-term hospital providers should avoid using ties that pass circumferentially around the patient’s neck， potentially obstructing venous return from the brain. They should also elevate the head of the bed 30° if tolerated to reduce the incidence of cerebral edema， aspiration， and ventilatory-associated pneumonia. Correct placement of an advanced airway， particularly during patient transport， should be monitored using waveform capnography as described in other\n【save__datas】\t【3453】\tOxygenation of the patient should be monitored continuously with pulse oximetry.\n【save__datas】\t【3454】\tAlthough 100% oxygen may have been used during initial resuscitation， providers should titrate inspired oxygen to the lowest level required to achieve an arterial oxygen saturation of≥94%， so as to avoid potential oxygen toxicity. It is recognized that titration of inspired oxygen may not be possible immedi-ately after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest until the patient is transported to the emergency department or， in the case of in-hospital arrest， the intensive care unit (ICU). Hyperventilation or “overbagging\" the patient is common after cardiac arrest and should be avoided because of potential adverse hemodynamic effects. Hyperventilation increases intrathoracic pressure and inversely lowers cardiac output. The decrease in Paco， seen with hyperventilation can also potentially decrease cerebral blood flow directly.Ventilation may be started at 10 to 12 breaths per minute and titrated to achieve a PETCO， of 35 to 40 mm Hg or a Paco， of 40 to 45 mm Hg.\n【save__datas】\t【3456】\tThe clinician should assess vital signs and monitor for recurrent cardiac arrhythmias. Continuous electrocardio-graphic (ECG) monitoring should continue after ROSC， during transport， and throughout ICU care until stability has been achieved. Intravenous (IV) access should be obtained if not already established and the position and function of any intravenous catheter verified. IV lines should be promptly established to replace emergent intraosseous access achieved during resuscitation. If the patient is hypotensive (systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg)， fluid boluses can be considered. Cold fluid may be used if therapeutic hypothermia is elected. Vasoactive drug infusions such as dopamine， norepinephrine， or epinephrine may be initiated if necessary and titrated to achieve a minimum systolic blood pressure of ≥90 mm Hg or a mean arterial pressure of ≥65 mm Hg.\n【save__datas】\t【3457】\tBrain injury and cardiovascular instability are the major determinants of survival after cardiac arrest.13 Because ther-apeutic hypothermia is the only intervention demonstrated to improve neurological recovery， it should be considered for any patient who is unable to follow verbal commands after ROSC. The patient should be transported to a facility that reliably provides this therapy in addition to coronary reperfusion(eg， PCI) and other goal-directed postarrest care therapies.\n【save__datas】\t【3458】\tOverall the most common cause of cardiac arrest is cardiovascular disease and coronary ischemia.14，15 Therefore， a 12-lead ECG should be obtained as soon as possible to detect ST elevation or new or presumably new left bundle-branch block. When there is high suspicion of acute myocar-dial infarction (AMI)， local protocols for treatment of AMI and coronary reperfusion should be activated. Even in the absence of ST elevation， medical or interventional treatments may be considered for treatment of ACS14，16，17 and should not be deferred in the presence of coma or in conjunction with\n【save__datas】\t【3459】\tTable 1. Multiple System Approach to Post-Cardiac Arrest Care--connect--【3460】hypothermia. Concurrent PCI and hypothermia are safe， with good outcomes reported for some comatose patients who undergo PCI.\n【save__datas】\t【3461】\tPatients who are unconscious or unresponsive after cardiac arrest should be directed to an inpatient critical-care facility with a comprehensive care plan that includes acute cardio-vascular interventions， use of therapeutic hypothermia， stan-dardized medical goal-directed therapies， and advanced neu---connect--【3462】rological monitoring and care. Neurological prognosis may be difficult to determine during the first 72 hours， even for patients who are not undergoing therapeutic hypothermia. This time frame for prognostication is likely to be extended in patients being cooled.18 Many initially comatose survivors of cardiac arrest have the potential for full recovery such that they are able to lead normal lives.1，2，19 Between 20% and 50%or more of survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who are\n【save__datas】\t【3463】\tcomatose on arrival at the hospital may have good one-year neurological outcome.1，2，11 Therefore， it is important to place patients in a hospital critical-care unit where expert care and neurological evaluation can be performed and where appro-priate testing to aid prognosis is available and performed in a timely manner.\n【save__datas】\t【3464】\tAttention should be directed to treating the precipitating cause of cardiac arrest after ROSC. The provider should initiate or request studies that will further aid in evaluation of the patient. It is important to identify and treat any cardiac， electrolyte， toxicological， pulmonary， and neurological pre-cipitants of arrest. The clinician may find it helpful to review the H's and T’s mnemonic to recall factors that may contrib-ute to cardiac arrest or complicate resuscitation or postresus-citation care： hypovolemia， hypoxia， hydrogen ion (acidosis of any etiology)， hyper-/hypokalemia， moderate to severe hypothermia， toxins， tamponade (cardiac)， tension pneumo-thorax， and thrombosis of the coronary or pulmonary vascu-lature. For further information on treating other causes of cardiac arrest， see Part 12：“Special Resuscitation Situations.\"\n【save__datas】\t【3465】\tTargeted Temperature Management\n【save__datas】\t【3466】\tInduced Hypothermia\n【save__datas】\t【3468】\tNo randomized controlled trials have compared outcome between hypothermia and normothermia for non-VF arrest. However， 6 studies with historical control groups reported a beneficial effect on outcome from use of therapeutic hypo-thermia in comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest associated with any arrest rhythm.11，22-26 Only one study with historical controls reported better neurological outcome after VF cardiac arrest but no difference in outcome after cardiac arrest associated with other rhythms.27 Two nonrandomized studies with concurrent controls28，29 indicate a possible benefit of hypothermia after in- and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest associated with non-VF initial rhythms.\n【save__datas】\t【3469】\tCase series have reported the feasibility of using therapeu-tic hypothermia after ROSC in the setting of cardiogenic shock23，30，31 and therapeutic hypothermia in combination with emergent PCI.32-36 Case series also report successful use of fibrinolytic therapy for AMI after ROSC，37，38 but data are lacking about interactions between fibrinolytics and hypo-thermia in this population.\n【save__datas】\t【3470】\tThe impact of the timing of initiating hypothermia after cardiac arrest is not completely understood. Studies of animal models of cardiac arrest showed that short-duration hypother-mia (=1 hour) achieved <10 to 20 minutes after ROSC had a beneficial effect that was lost when hypothermia was delayed.39-41 Beyond the initial minutes of ROSC and when hypothermiais prolonged (>12 hours)， the relationship between the onset of hypothermia and the resulting neuro-protection is less clear.42，43 Two prospective clinical trials in which hypothermia was achieved within 2 hours? or at a median of 8 hours (interquartile range \\[IQR\\] 4 to 16 hours) after ROSC both demonstrated better outcomes in the hypothermia-treated than the normothermia-treated subjects. Subsequent to these studies， one registry-based case series of986 comatose post-cardiac arrest patients35 suggested that time to initiation of cooling (IQR l to 1.8 hours) and time to achieving target temperature (IQR 3 to 6.7 hours) were not associated with improved neurological outcome after dis-charge. A case series of 49 consecutive comatose post-cardiac arrest patients44 cooled intravascularly after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest also documented that time to target temperature (median 6.8 hours \\[IQR 4.5 to 9.2 hours\\]) was not an independent predictor of neurological outcome.\n【save__datas】\t【3472】\tAlthough there are multiple methods for inducing hypo-thermia， no single method has proved to be optimal. Feedback-controlled endovascular catheters and surface cool-ing devices are available.47-49 Other techniques (eg名， ，cooling blankets and frequent application of ice bags) are readily available and effective but may require more labor and closer monitoring. As an adjunct， iced isotonic fluid can be infused to initiate core cooling but must be combined with a follow-up method for maintenance of hypothermia.50-52 A1-though a theoretical concern is that rapid fluid loading could have adverse cardiopulmonary effects such as pulmonary edema， 9 case series indicate that cooling can be initiated safely with IV ice-cold fluids (500 mL to 30 mL/kg of saline0.9% or Ringer's lactate).51-59 One human case series56showed that the deterioration in oxygenation that often occurs after ROSC was not significantly affected by the infusion of cold fluids (3427 mL±210mL).

Other diagnostic tests may be added based on history， physical examination， and clinical circumstances. Evaluation of a chest radiograph should verify the correct position of the endotracheal tube and the distribution of pulmonary infil-trates or edema and identify complications from chest com-pressions (eg， rib fracture， pneumothorax， and pleural effu-sions) or pneumonia.\n【save__datas】\t【3485】\tProviders should adjust mechanical ventilatory support based on the measured oxyhemoglobin saturation， blood gas values， minute ventilation (respiratory rate and tidal volume)， and patient-ventilator synchrony. In addition， mechanical ventilatory support to reduce the work of breathing should be considered as long as the patient remains in shock. As spontaneous ventilation becomes more efficient and as con-current medical conditions allow， the level of support may be gradually decreased.\n【save__datas】\t【3486】\tThe optimal Fio， during the immediate period after cardiac arrest is still debated. The beneficial effect of high F1oz on systemic oxygen delivery should be balanced with the deleteri-ous effect of generating oxygen-derived free radicals during the reperfusion phase. Animal data suggests that ventilations with100% oxygen (generating Paoz≥350 mm Hg at 15 to 60minutes after ROSC) increase brain lipid peroxidation， increase metabolic dysfunctions， increase neurological degeneration， and worsen short-term functional outcome when compared with ventilation with room air or an inspired oxygen fraction titrated to a pulse oximeter reading between 94% and 96%.82-87 One randomized prospective clinical trial compared ventilation for the first 60 minutes after ROSC with 30% oxygen (resulting in Pao2=110±25 mm Hg at 60 minutes) or 100% oxygen (result-ing in Paoz=345±174 mm Hg at 60 minutes).88 This small trial detected no difference in serial markers of acute brain injury， survival to hospital discharge， or percentage of patients with good neurological outcome at hospital discharge but was inad-equately powered to detect important differences in survival or neurological outcome.\n【save__datas】\t【3487】\tOnce the circulation is restored， monitor systemic arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation.

However， metabolic aci-dosis is likely to be reversed once adequate perfusion is restored， and there are several physiological reasons why hyperventilation may be detrimental. Minute ventilation al-ters the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Paco)， which in turn can affect cerebral blood flow. In a normal brain a l-mm Hg decrease in Paco， results in a decrease in cerebral blood flow of approximately 2.5% to 4%； cerebral blood flow remains CO-reactive after cardiac arrest，89，90 although the magnitude of the CO， reactivity (magnitude of change in cerebral blood flow per millimeters of mercury \\[mm Hg\\] change in Pco) may be diminished or suppressed for 1 to 3hours after reperfusion，91，92 especially after prolonged ische-mia (≥15 minutes).93，94 After ROSC there is an initial hyperemic blood flow response that lasts 10 to 30 minutes， followed by a more prolonged period of low blood flow.95，96During this latter period of late hypoperfusion， a mismatch between blood flow (as a component of oxygen delivery) and oxygen requirement may occur. Hyperventilation at this stage may lower Paco，， cause cerebral vasoconstriction， and exac-erbate cerebral ischemic injury.\n【save__datas】\t【3491】\tHyperventilation also may compromise systemic blood flow because of occult or auto-PEEP and is deleterious in all low-flow states， including cardiopulmonary resuscitation(CPR)100，101 and hypovolemia.102，103 Auto-PEEP， also known--connect--【3492】as intrinsic PEEP or gas trapping， occurs preferentially in--connect--【3493】patients with obstructive lung disease and is aggravated by hyperventilation that does not allow sufficient time for--connect--【3494】complete exhalation. A gradual increase in end-expiratory volume and pressure in the lung (hyperinflation) is transmit-ted to the great veins in the thorax and depresses both venous return and cardiac output.104，105 Similar effects may occur after cardiac arrest， suggesting that hyperventilation should be avoided， especially in hypotensive patients.\n【save__datas】\t【3496】\tIn conclusion， post-cardiac arrest patients are at risk of acute lung injury and ARDS， but refractory hypoxemia is not a frequent mode of death after cardiac arrest. There is no reason to recommend hyperventilation and “permissive hy-percapnia”(hypoventilation) for these patients， and normo-capnia should be considered the standard. There is also no data to recommend unique ventilation strategies in this population different from usual care of other mechanically ventilated patients at risk for acute lung injury and ARDS.\n【save__datas】\t【3499】\tFibrinolytic use may benefit patients with massive pulmonary emboli who have not had CPR，ll and use of fibrinolytics to treat pulmonary embolism after CPR has been reported.112The use of fibrinolytics during CPR has been studied， and CPR itself does not appear to pose an unacceptable risk of bleeding.113-121 Alternatively， surgical embolectomy has also been used successfully in some patients after PE-induced cardiac arrest.117，122-125 Mechanical thrombectomy was em-ployed in a small case series and only one of seven patients died and pulmonary perfusion was restored in the majority(85.7%).115 In post-cardiac arrest patients with arrest due to\n【save__datas】\t【3501】\tSedation After Cardiac Arrest\n【save__datas】\t【3502】\tPatients with coma or respiratory dysfunction after ROSC are routinely intubated and maintained on mechanical ventilation for a period of time， which results in discomfort， pain， and anxiety. Intermittent or continuous sedation and/or analgesia can be used to achieve specific goals. Patients with post-cardiac arrest cognitive dysfunction may display agitation or frank delirium with purposeless movement and are at risk of self-injury. Opioids， anxiolytics， and sedative-hypnotic agents can be used in various combinations to improve patient-ventilator interaction and blunt the stress-related surge of endogenous catecholamines. Other agentsSwith sedative and antipsychotic-tranquilizer properties， such as Oz-adrenergic agonists，126 and butyrophenones127are also used based on individual clinical circumstances.\n【save__datas】\t【3503】\tIf patient agitation is life-threatening， neuromuscular blocking agents can be used for short intervals with adequate sedation. Caution should be used in patients at high risk of seizures unless continuous electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring is available. In general sedative agents should be administered cautiously with daily interruptions and titrated to the desired effect. A number of sedation scales 128-133 and motor activity scales134 were developed to titrate these phar-macological interventions to a clinical goal.\n【save__datas】\t【3504】\tShorter-acting medications that can be used as a single bolus or continuous infusion are usually preferred. There is little evidence to guide sedation/analgesia therapy immedi-ately after ROSC. One observational studyl35 found an association between use of sedation and development of pneumonia in intubated patients during the first 48 hours of therapy. However， the study was not designed to investigate sedation as a risk factor for either pneumonia or death in patients with cardiac arrest.\n【save__datas】\t【3505】\tAlthough minimizing sedation allows a better clinical estimate of neurological status， sedation， analgesia， and occasionally neuromuscular relaxation are routinely used to facilitate induced hypothermia and to control shivering. The duration of neuromuscular blocker use should be minimized and the depth of neuromuscular blockade should be moni-tored with a nerve twitch stimulator.\n【save__datas】\t【3507】\tCardiovascular System\n【save__datas】\t【3509】\t(STEMI) should begin as in non-cardiac arrest patients， regardless of coma or induced hypothermia. Because of the high incidence of acute coronary ischemia， consideration of emergent coronary angiography may be reasonable even in the absence of STEMI.14，16 Notably， PCI， alone or as part of a bundle of care， is associated with improved myocardial function'4 and neurological outcomes.11，16 Therapeutic hypo-thermia can be safely combined with primary PCI after cardiac arrest caused by AMI.11，31，33-35 Other details of ACS treatment are discussed in Part 10.\n【save__datas】\t【3511】\tVasoactive Drugs for Use in Post-Cardiac Arrest Patients\n【save__datas】\t【3512】\tVasopressors\n【save__datas】\t【3514】\tSpecific drug infusion rates cannot be recommended be-cause of variations in pharmacokinetics (relation between drug dose and concentration) and pharmacodynamics (rela-tion between drug concentration and effect) in critically ill patients，154，155 so commonly used initial dose ranges are listed in Table 2. Vasoactive drugs must be titrated at the bedside to secure the intended effect while limiting side effects. Provid-ers must also be aware of the concentrations delivered and compatibilities with previously and concurrently adminis-tered drugs.\n【save__datas】\t【3515】\tIn general， adrenergic drugs should not be mixed with sodium bicarbonate or other alkaline solutions in the IV line because there is evidence that adrenergic agents are inacti-vated in alkaline solutions.156，157 Norepinephrine (levartere-nol) and other catecholamines that activate a-adrenergic receptors may produce tissue necrosis if extravasation occurs. Therefore， administration through a central line is preferred whenever possible. If extravasation develops， infiltrate 5 to10 mg of phentolamine diluted in 10 to 15 mL of saline into the site of extravasation as soon as possible to prevent tissue death and sloughing.\n【len<10_filter】\t【3516】\tTable 2.\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Drug  | Typical Starting Dose (Then Titrate to Effect)  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| --- | --- |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Epinephrine  | 0.1-0.5 mcg/kg/min (n 70-kg adult， 7-35 mcg/min)  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  | ·Useful for symptomatic bradycardia if atropine  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  | and transcutaneous pacing fail or if pacing is not  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  | available  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Norepinephrine  | · Used to treat severe hypotension (eg， systolic  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Norepinephrine  | blood pressure <70 mm Hg)  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Norepinephrine  | ·Useful for anaphylaxis associated with  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Norepinephrine  | hemodynamic instability or respiratory distress 158  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Norepinephrine  | 0.1-0.5 mcg/kg/min (In 70-kg adult， 7-35 mcg/min)  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Norepinephrine  | · Used to treat severe hypotension (eg， systolic  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Norepinephrine  | blood pressure <70 mm Hg) and a low total  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Norepinephrine  | peripheral resistance  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Norepinephrine  | Relatively contraindicated in patients with  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Norepinephrine  | requirements， mandating cautious use in patients  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  | ●  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  | hypovolemia.

However， many patients will die， remain permanently unresponsive， or remain permanently unable to perform independent activities. Early prognostication of neurological outcome is an essential component of post-cardiac arrest care. Most importantly， when decisions to limit or withdraw life-sustaining care are being considered， tools used to prognosticate poor outcome must be accurate and reliable with a false-positive rate (FPR) approaching 0%. Poor outcome is defined as death， persistent unresponsive-ness， or the inability to undertake independent activities after6 months.203 No prearrest or intra-arrest parameters (includ-ing arrest duration， bystander CPR， or presenting rhythm) alone or in combination accurately predict outcome in indi-vidual patients who achieve ROSC.\n【save__datas】\t【3545】\tA thorough neurological evaluation is needed to obtain accurate prognostic findings. No postarrest physical exami-nation finding or diagnostic study has as yet predicted poor outcome of comatose cardiac arrest survivors during the first24 hours after ROSC. After 24 hours somatosensory evoked--connect--【3546】potentials (SSEPs) and select physical examination findings at specific time points after ROSC in the absence of con-founders (such as hypotension， seizures， sedatives， or neuro-muscular blockers) are the most reliable early predictors of poor outcome in patients not undergoing therapeutic hypo-thermia. However， the decision to limit care should never be made on the basis of a single prognostic parameter， and expert consultation may be needed.\n【save__datas】\t【3547】\tNeurological Assessment\n【save__datas】\t【3550】\tNo electrophysiological study reliably predicts outcome in comatose patients during the first 24 hours after ROSC.

Biomarkers that are predictive of neurological outcome are typically released from dying neu-rons or glial cells in the brain (eg， neuron-specific enolase\\[NSE\\]， S100B， GFAP， CK-BB) and can be measured in the blood or CSF. The primary advantage of biomarkers is that levels are unlikely to be confounded by sedation or neuro-muscular blockade， which are commonly used in the first few days after cardiac arrest. However， for most biomarkers， only an association with outcome has been reported. When using a cutoff value that results in an FPR of 0% for predicting poor outcome， the 95% CI is unacceptably high due to the small number of patients studied.\n【save__datas】\t【3565】\tThe most promising and extensively studied biomarker is serum NSE， which has been reported to have a 0% FPR (95%CI 0% to 3%) for predicting poor outcome when measured between 24 and 72 hours after cardiac arrest.203，204 Other\n【save__datas】\t【3568】\tChanges in Prognostication With Hypothermia\n【save__datas】\t【3569】\tThere is a paucity of data about the utility of physical examination， EEG， and evoked potentials in patients who have been treated with induced hypothermia.

The post-cardiac arrest period is often marked by hemodynamic instability as well as metabolic abnormalities. Support and treatment of acute myocardial dysfunction and acute myocardial ischemia can increase the probability of survival. Interventions to reduce secondary brain injury， such as therapeutic hypothermia， can improve survival and neurological recovery. Every organ system is at risk during this period， and patients are at risk of developing multiorgan dysfunction.\n【save__datas】\t【3575】\tThe comprehensive treatment of diverse problems after cardiac arrest involves multidisciplinary aspects of critical care， cardiology， and neurology. For this reason， it is impor-tant to admit patients to appropriate critical-care units with a prospective plan of care to anticipate， monitor， and treat each of these diverse problems. It is also important to appreciate the relative strengths and weaknesses of different tools for estimating the prognosis of patients after cardiac arrest.\n【save__datas】\t【3576】\tGuidelines Part 9： Post-Cardiac Arrest Care： Writing Group Disclosures\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Writing GroupMember  | Employment  | Research Grant  | Other Research Support  | Speakers' Bureau/Honoraria  | Ownership Interest  | Consultant/Advisory Board  | Other  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Mary Ann Peberdy  | Virginia Commowealth University-Professor of Medicine & Emergency Medicine  | None  | None  | None  | None  | None  | Non丹  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  | Virginia Commowealth University-Professor of Medicine & Emergency Medicine  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  |  | 十Grants to University of Pittsburgh： NHLBI-Resuscitation Dutcomes Consortium HRSA-Development and Dissemination of Program Tools for Uncontrolled Denation After Cardiac Death YUDCD  | Loan of an Arctic Sun cmling device \\[without disposables) to human physiology laboratory for experiments on hypothermia by Medivance， Inc.  |  | licensed by University of Pittsburgh to Medtronic ERS， Inc.  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  |  | 十Grants to University of Pittsburgh： NHLBI-Resuscitation Dutcomes Consortium HRSA-Development and Dissemination of Program Tools for Uncontrolled Denation After Cardiac Death YUDCD  | Loan of an Arctic Sun cmling device \\[without disposables) to human physiology laboratory for experiments on hypothermia by Medivance， Inc.  |  | licensed by University of Pittsburgh to Medtronic ERS， Inc.  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  |  | 十Grants to University of Pittsburgh： NHLBI-Resuscitation Dutcomes Consortium HRSA-Development and Dissemination of Program Tools for Uncontrolled Denation After Cardiac Death YUDCD  | Loan of an Arctic Sun cmling device \\[without disposables) to human physiology laboratory for experiments on hypothermia by Medivance， Inc.  |  | licensed by University of Pittsburgh to Medtronic ERS， Inc.  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  |  | Role on Project： Principal Therapeutic Hypothermia AIfntger  |  |  |  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  |  | Cardiac Arrest Description： The  |  |  |  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  |  | goal of this project is to evaluate  |  |  |  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  |  | how the onset and duration of  |  |  |  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  |  | cardiac arrest impacts survival and  |  |  |  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  | Care Medicine and Neurosurgery  | Monitor Phase IIB  |  |  |  |  |  |\n【[*]_filter】\t【None】\t| Janice L.

Potential delays to therapy occur during 3 intervals： from onset of symptoms to patient recognition， during prehospital transport， and during emergency department (ED) evaluation.\n【save__datas】\t【3973】\tSymptoms of ACS may be used in combination with other important information (biomarkers， risk factors， ECG， and other diagnostic tests) in making triage and some treatment decisions in the out-of-hospital and ED settings.

VF or pulseless VT is the precipitating cardiac arrest rhythm in most of these deaths，26，27 and it is most likely to develop in the early phase of ACS evolution.28 Communities should develop programs to respond to cardiac emergencies that include the prompt recognition of ACS symptoms by--connect--【3993】patients and their companions as well as by healthcare and public safety providers and early activation of the EMS system. Additional features of such a program include high-quality CPR for patients in cardiac arrest (see Part 5：“Adult Basic Life Support\") and rapid access to and use of an automated external defibrillator (AED) through community AED programs (see Part 6：“Electrical Therapies\").29 Emer-gency dispatch center personnel should be educated in the provision of CPR instructions for lay rescuers before the arrival of EMS. EMS providers should be trained to respond to cardiovascular emergencies， including ACS and its acute complications.\n【save__datas】\t【3995】\tEMS providers should be familiar with the presentation of ACS and trained to determine the time of symptom onset.

Hospital-based issues include ED protocols， activation of the cardiac catheterization labo-ratory， and admission to the coronary intensive care unit.\n【save__datas】\t【4015】\tContinuous review and quality improvement involving EMS and prehospital care providers are important to achieve ongoing optimal reperfusion time. Quality assurance， real-time feedback， and healtheare provider education can also reduce the time to therapy in STEMI.89，93-97 Involvement of hospital leadership in the process and commitment to support rapid access to STEMI reperfusion therapy are critical factors associated with successful programs.\n【save__datas】\t【4025】\t3\\. The nondiagnostic ECG with either normal or mini-mally abnormal (ie， nonspecific ST-segment or T-wave changes， Box 13). This ECG is nondiagnostic and inconclusive for ischemia， requiring further risk strati-fication. This classification includes patients with nor-mal ECGs and those with ST-segment deviation of<0.5 mm (0.05mV) or T-wave inversion of ≤0.2 mV. This category of ECG is termed nondiagnostic.\n【save__datas】\t【4027】\tCardiac Biomarkers--connect--【4031】infarction can be made when clinical symptoms or new ECG abnormalities are consistent with ischemia and one biomarker is elevated above the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit (URL) using a test with optimal precision defined as a CV≤10%.\n【save__datas】\t【4032】\tThere is insufficient evidence to support the use of tropo-nin point-of-care testing (POCT) either in or out of hospital. There is also insufficient evidence to support the use of myoglobin， β-natriuretic peptide (BNP)， NT-proBNP， D-dimer， C-reactive protein， ischemia-modified albumin pregnancy-associated plasma protein A((PAPP-A) or interleukin-6 in isolation.\n【save__datas】\t【4034】\tPatients with STEMI usually have complete occlusion of an epicardial coronary artery. The primary goal of initial treat-ment is early reperfusion therapy through administration of fibrinolytics (pharmacological reperfusion) or PPCI (mechan-ical reperfusion). Providers should rapidly identify patients with STEMI and quickly screen them for indications and contraindications to fibrinolytic therapy and PCI. Patients who are ineligible for fibrinolytic therapy should be consid-ered for transfer to a PCI facility regardless of delay.\n【save__datas】\t【4037】\tUnstable angina (UA) and NSTEMI are difficult to distin-guish initially. These patients usually have a partially or intermittently occluding thrombus. Both ACS syndromes may present with similar symptoms and ECG. Clinical features can correlate with the dynamic nature of clot forma-tion and degradation (eg， waxing and waning clinical symp-toms). The ECG will demonstrate a range of findings short of diagnostic ST-segment deviation； these ECG presentations include normal， minimal nonspecific ST-segment/T-wave changes， and significant ST-segment depression and T-wave inyersions.\n【save__datas】\t【4038】\tAn elevated biomarker separates NSTEMI from UA and has incremental value in addition to the ECG. Elevation of cardiac troponin indicates increased risk for major adverse cardiac events and benefit from an invasive strategy. Cardiac troponins indicate myocardial necrosis， although numerous conditions other than ACS may cause elevated biomarkers(eg， myocarditis， heart failure， and pulmonary embolism).\n【save__datas】\t【4039】\tManagement strategies for UA/NSTEMI include antiplate-let， antithrombin， and antianginal therapy and are based on risk stratification.

This nondiagnostic evaluation includes a normal or nondiagnostic12-lead ECG and normal serum cardiac biomarker concen-trations. The majority of these patients will not be experienc-ing an ACS， but many may have underlying CAD or other clinical features putting them at subsequent risk for major adverse cardiac events over the course of a few days to several months.\n【save__datas】\t【4053】\tA major goal of the risk stratification process is to identify those patients who do not appear to have high-risk features on initial assessment but are found， through the course of the diagnostic process， to have ACS and clinically significant CAD. This strategy allows physicians to target patients who would benefit from guidelines-based ACS therapies while avoiding unnecessary procedural and pharmacological risks(eg， anticoagulation therapy and invasive cardiac catheteriza-tion) in patients with low risk for major adverse cardiac events.\n【save__datas】\t【4054】\tAlthough the diagnosis of ACS is important and will help to guide immediate therapy， the estimation of risk for major adverse cardiac events in the immediate， short-term， and long-term time frames helps the physician determine the urgency in completing the diagnostic workup not just for ACS but also for CAD. Many patients can be managed in the outpatient setting once it is determined that they are at very low risk for short-term (30 days) major adverse cardiac events.\n【save__datas】\t【4055】\tBraunwald Risk Stratification\n【save__datas】\t【4057】\tTable 2127 is a modified version of Braunwald and col-leagues’approach updated over several publications.124，126，128Patients are initially risk-stratified according to the likelihood that symptoms are due to unstable CAD. Patients at interme-diate or high risk for CAD are further classified by their risk of major adverse cardiac events. This second classification is useful for prospectively identifying patients at intermediate or high risk who can benefit from an invasive strategy and more aggressive pharmacology with antiplatelet and antithrombin agents. Other risk stratification schemes include the TIMI， GRACE， and PURSUIT risk scores developed for short- and longer-term risk assessment.129-133 Stratification tools cannot be used to determine discharge from the ED.\n【save__datas】\t【4060】\tThe TIMI risk score comprises 7 independent prognostic variables (Table 3). These 7 variables were significantly associated with the occurrence within 14 days of at least one of the primary end points： death， new or recurrent MI， or need for urgent revascularization. The score is derived from complex multivariate logistic regression. It is useful to note that traditional cardiac risk factors are only weakly associated with major adverse cardiac events. Aspirin use was found to be one of the most powerful predictors.134 It is possible that aspirin use identified a subgroup of patients at higher risk or on active but failed therapy for CAD.\n【save__datas】\t【4063】\tIndicators for Early Invasive Strategies\n【save__datas】\t【4065】\tThe 2007 Focused Update of the ACC/AHA/SCAI 2005Guideline Update for Percutaneous Coronary Intervention contains the following recommendations related to the selec-tion of early invasive PCI versus conservative strategies.\n【save__datas】\t【4071】\tThe majority of patients with normal or nondiagnostic ECGs do not have ACS. Patients in this category with ACS are most often at low or intermediate risk. The physician’s goal involves risk stratification (see above) to provide appropriate diagnostic or treatment strategies for an individual patient. These strategies then target patients at increased risk for benefit while avoiding risk (eg， anticoagulation therapy and invasive cardiac catheterization) in patients with low or minimal risk.\n【save__datas】\t【4072】\tThe Chest Pain Unit Model\n【save__datas】\t【4073】\tChest pain observation protocols may be employed in a dedicated space (ie， a physical chest pain unit \\[CPU\\]) or throughout an ED/hospital (ie， virtual CPU). These chest pain observation protocols are a rapid system of patient assess-ment that should generally include a history and physical examination， a period of observation， serial electrocardiogra-phy， and serial measurement of serum cardiac markers.

The treatment benefits of nitroglycerin are limited， however， and no conclusive evidence has been shown to support the routine use of IV， oral， or topical nitrate therapy in patients with AMI.183 With this in mind， these agents should be carefully considered， especially in the patient with low blood pressure and when their use would preclude the use of other agents known to be beneficial， such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.\n【save__datas】\t【4111】\tAnalgesia\n【save__datas】\t【4114】\tAcute reperfusion therapy using PPCI or fibrinolytic therapy in patients with STEMI restores flow in the infarct-related artery， limits infarct size， and translates into early mortality benefit that is sustained over the next decade.187，188 While optimal fibrinolysis restores normal coronary flow (TIMI 3) in 50% to 60% of subjects， PPCI is able to achieve restored flow in ≥90% of subjects. The patency rates achieved with PPCI translates into reduced mortality and reinfarction rates as compared to fibrinolytic therapy.189 This benefit is even greater in patients presenting with cardiogenic shock. PPCI also results in a decreased risk of intracranial hemorrhage and stroke， making it the reperfusion strategy of choice in the elderly and those at risk for bleeding complications.\n【save__datas】\t【4115】\tFibrinolytics\n【save__datas】\t【4120】\tTable 5.

Inferior wall STEMI also benefits from fibrinolysis， yet the magnitude of this outcome improvement is markedly less robust. More extensive inferior STEMI presentations， of course， demonstrate more robust benefit when undergoing fibrinolysis； inferior wall STEMI with RV involement is such an example. Fibrinolytics have been shown to be beneficial across a spectrum of patient subgroups with comorbidities such asSpreviousMI，cdiabetes. tachycardia， and hypotension.190 Although superior to pla-cebo， the lack of efficacy in the setting of cardiogenic shock makes referral for PPCI an optimal strategy in this setting.\n【save__datas】\t【4151】\tIntracranial Hemorrhage\n【save__datas】\t【4154】\tPercutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI)\n【save__datas】\t【4160】\tCardiac angiography and PCI， when used as part of a n i standardized advanced post-cardiac arrest protocol， may result in improved survival to hospital discharge.220 Acute coronary artery occlusion is frequent in survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

As a system goal， PCI should ideally be performed within 90 minutes of first medical contact. PCI should be performed by an experienced provider (an individual who performs ≥75 PCI procedures per year) in a high-volume center (a laboratory that performs more than 200 PCI procedures per year， of which at least 36 are PCI for STEMI). High-risk STEMI patients， “late presenters”(ie，>3 hours since the onset of STEMI symptoms)， and individuals with contraindication to fibrinolysis are all candidates for PCI as well. And， of course， if the diagnosis of STEMI is in doubt， regardless of the reason， initial coronary angiography followed by PCI is the most appro-priate diagnostic and therapeutic strategy.\n【save__datas】\t【4167】\tAlthough PCI may offer an improved outcome over fibri-nolysis， catheter-based techniques must be applied early without prolonged delay. If applied without delay by experi-enced providers， PCI provides improved outcome in the STEMI patient. As noted in the DANAMI-2 study，239 PCI initiated within 3 hours of initial hospital arrival was superior to fibrinolysis. For patients admitted in hospital without PCI capabilities， there may be some benefit associated with transferring patients for PPCI versus on-site fibrinolytics in terms of reinfarction， stroke and a trend to a lower mortality in the PPCI group.214，240 For patients with cardiogenic shock， early revascularization was associated with improved sur-vival at six months， especially in patients younger than 75years-of-age.241 Transfer for PCI instead of more immediate fibrinolysis has shown the combined rate of death， nonfatal MI， and stroke to be reduced by 42% if the mean transfer to PCI time could be less than 80 to 122 minutes.\n【save__datas】\t【4168】\tIf the time required to mobilize staff and arrange for PCI is prolonged or delays in transfer are anticipated， the treating physician must consider fibrinolysis， assuming that the pa-tient is an appropriate candidate. Time delays to PCI range from 45 to 120 minutes and are associated with age， symptom duration， and location of infarction. These delays may negate the benefit of PCI over fibrinolytics.86，242 In addition， the benefit of PCI over fibrinolytics is offset when PCI is carried out in low-volume PCI centers.212 PCI has been shown to be superior to fibrinolysis on the combined end points of short-term death， nonfatal myocardial infarction， and stroke.\n【save__datas】\t【4169】\tPinto and colleagues86 have performed a very important analysis of the“PCI versus fibrinolysis” consideration in the STEMI patient. Their analysis asked the following questions for the patient with STEMI： How long should the practitioner wait for PCI in a patient who is fibrinolytic eligible? And， in this waiting period for PCI， when is the benefit of the catheter-based therapy lost and fibrinolysis becomes the preferred option? Time recommendations—essentially the answer to the above questions-are pro-vided with respect to patient age， infarct duration， and MI anatomic location. This paper provides the emergency phy-sician with the total elapsed time that he or she should wait for PCI， at which point the survival benefit of the invasive strategy is lost and the patient should receive a fibrinolytic agent.

This study involved 3959 patients from 106hospitals in 14 countries who presented within 6 hours of chest pain onset and underwent either PCI (55%) or fibrinolysis(45%).

The use of clopi-dogrel in ACS patients with a high likelihood of needing CABG requires weighing the risk of bleeding if given against the potential for perioperative ACS events if withheld.

The idea of a“stroke-prepared”hospital emerged after the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved rtPA for stroke. In 2000 the Brain Attack Coalition provided a descrip-tion of “primary stroke centers，\"which would ensure that best practices for stroke care (acute and beyond) would be offered in an organized fashion.? The logic of having a multitiered system such as that provided for trauma was evident. There-fore， in 2005 the Brain Attack Coalition followed the state-ment on primary stroke centers with recommendations for comprehensive stroke centers.6 Following the establishment--connect--【4958】of primary stroke centers and comprehensive stroke centers， the new concept of a stroke-prepared hospital has recently emerged. This stroke-prepared hospital can access stroke expertise via telemedicine. The comparison with a trauma system with Level 1， 2， and 3 centers is rational and quite intuitive to emergency care providers familiar with such configurations.\n【save__datas】\t【4959】\tSubstantial progress has been made toward regionalization of stroke care. Several states have passed legislation requiring prehospital providers to triage patients with suspected stroke to designated stroke centers. This is contingent on the accuracy of dispatch， an area where further improvement is--connect--【4960】needed.10 The integration of EMS into regional stroke models is crucial for improvement of patient outcomes.' Efforts have been strong in many regions， especially in regions with relatively high population density and large critical mass of stroke centers to effectively create a model for stroke region-alization.12 Although a large proportion of the US population is now within close proximity to a stroke center， it is not clear how many stroke patients arrive at stroke-prepared hospitals.\n【save__datas】\t【4963】\tStroke Warning Signs\n【save__datas】\t【4965】\tPatient education efforts are most effective when the message is clear and succinet. The signs and symptoms of stroke include sudden weakness or numbness of the face. arm， or leg， especially on one side of the body； sudden confusion； trouble speaking or understanding； sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes； sudden trouble walking， dizziness， loss of balance or coordination； or sudden severe headache with no known cause. Educational efforts need to couple the knowledge of the signs and symptoms of stroke with action-call 911.\n【save__datas】\t【4968】\tIn settings where ground transport to a stroke center is potentially long， air medical services may be used. Regional stroke resources work with EMS agencies to establish criteria for the use of air medical transport for patients with acute stroke and determine the most appropriate destination based on distance and the hospital’s stroke capability.

In addition， for stroke， providers must clearly establish the time ofonset of symptoms. This time represents time zero for the patient. If the patient wakes from sleep or is found with symptoms of a stroke， the time of onset of symptoms is defined as the last time the patient was observed to be normal. EMS providers must be able to support cardiopulmonary function， perform rapid stroke assessment， establish time of onset of symptoms\n【save__datas】\t【4990】\tTransport and Destination Hospital\n【save__datas】\t【4991】\tEMS providers should consider transporting a witness， family member， or caregiver with the patient to verify the time of stroke symptom onset. En route to the facility， providers should continue to support cardiopulmonary function， moni-tor neurologic status， check blood glucose if possible， and provide prehospital notification.\n【save__datas】\t【4993】\tEMS providers must rapidly deliver the patient to a medical facility capable of providing acute stroke care and provide prearrival notification to the receiving facility 41，46，48 Each re-ceiving hospital should define its capability for treating patients with acute stroke using the definitions established for stroke-prepared hospitals， primary stroke centers， and comprehensive stroke centers3，6，7 and should communicate this information to the EMS system and the community. Although not every hospital is capable of organizing the necessary resources to safely administer fibrinolytic therapy， every hospital with an ED33should have a written plan that is communicated to EMS systems describing how patients with acute stroke are to be managed in that institution. The plan should detail the roles of healtheare professionals in the care of patients with acute stroke and define which patients will be treated with fibrinolytic therapy at that facility and when transfer to another hospital with a dedicated stroke unit is appropriate.\n【save__datas】\t【4994】\tThe role of stroke centers and in particular stroke units continues to be defined， but a growing body of evi-\n【save__datas】\t【4997】\tIn-Hospital Care\n【save__datas】\t【4999】\tOn arrival ED personnel should establish or confirm IV access and obtain blood samples for baseline studies (eg， complete blood count， coagulation studies， blood glucose). If not already identified in the prehospital setting， ED staff should promptly identify and treat hypoglycemia. The ED physician should perform a neurologic screening assessment， order an emer-gent computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain， and activate the stroke team or arrange for consultation with a stroke expert.\n【save__datas】\t【5001】\tAssessment (Box 4)\n【save__datas】\t【5002】\tThe treating physician should review the patient’s history and verify time of onset of symptoms.65-67 This may require interviewing out-of-hospital providers， witnesses， and family members to establish the time that the patient was last known to be normal.

Emergent CT or MRI scans of patients with suspected stroke should be promptly evaluated by a physician with expertise in interpretation of these studies.69 During the first few hours of an ischemic stroke the noncontrast CT scan may not indicate signs of brain ischemia. If the CT scan shows no evidence of intracerebral hemor-rhage， the patient may be a candidate for fibrinolytic therapy(Boxes 6 and 8). If hemorrhage is noted on the CT scan， the patient is not a candidate for fibrinolytic therapy. Consult a neurologist or neurosurgeon and consider transfer as needed for appropriate care (Box 7).\n【save__datas】\t【5018】\tIf hemorrhage is not present on the initial CT scan and the patient is not a candidate for fibrinolytic therapy for other reasons， consider administration of aspirin (Box 9) either rectally or orally after the patient is screened for dysphagia(see below). Admit the patient to a stroke unit (if available) for careful monitoring (Box 11).\n【save__datas】\t【5019】\tFibrinolytic Therapy (Boxes 6， 8， and 10)\n【save__datas】\t【5022】\tIf the patient remains a candidate for fibrinolytic therapy(Box 8)， the physician should discuss the risks and potential benefits of the therapy with the patient or family if available(Box 10). After this discussion， if the patient/family elects to proceed with fibrinolytic therapy， begin the rtPA bolus and infusion as quickly as possible and begin the stroke pathway of care (see below). Careful dose calculation and removal of excess rtPA help prevent inadvertent administration of excess rtPA. Typically neither anticoagulant nor antiplatelet treat-ment may be administered for 24 hours after administration of rtPA until a repeat CT scan at 24 hours shows no hemorrhagic transformation.\n【save__datas】\t【5023】\tSeveral studies9，15，70 have documented a higher likelihood of good to excellent functional outcome when rtPA is\n【save__datas】\t【5025】\tInclusion criteria\n【save__datas】\t【5026】\t·Diagnosis of ischemic stroke causing measurable neurologic deficit\n【save__datas】\t【5027】\t· Onset of symptoms <3 hours before beginning treatment\n【save__datas】\t【5028】\t· Age ≥18 years\n【save__datas】\t【5029】\tExclusion criteria\n【save__datas】\t【5030】\t· Head trauma or prior stroke in previous 3 months\n【save__datas】\t【5031】\t· Symptoms suggest subarachnoid hemormhage\n【save__datas】\t【5032】\t· Arterial puncture at noncompressible site in previous 7 days\n【save__datas】\t【5033】\t·History of previous intracranial hemorrhage\n【save__datas】\t【5034】\t· Elevated blood pressure (systolic >185 mm Hg or diastolic>110 mm Hg)\n【save__datas】\t【5035】\t· Evidence of active bleeding on examination\n【save__datas】\t【5036】\t· Acute bleeding diathesis， including but not limited to\n【save__datas】\t【5037】\t\\-Platelet count <100 000/mm²\n【save__datas】\t【5038】\t\\-Heparin received within 48 hours， resulting in aPTT >upper limit of--connect--【5039】normal\n【save__datas】\t【5040】\t\\-Current use of anticoagulant with INR ≥1.7 or PT ≥15 seconds\n【save__datas】\t【5041】\t· Blood glucose concentration <50 mg/dL (2.7 mmol/L)\n【save__datas】\t【5042】\t· CT demonstrates multilobar infarction (hypodensity >1/3 cerebral hemisphere)\n【save__datas】\t【5043】\tRelative exclusion criteria\n【save__datas】\t【5044】\tRecent experience suggests that under some circumstances-with careful consideration and weighing of risk to benefit-patients may receive fibrinolytic therapy despite 1 or more relative contraindications.

These findings show that it is important to have an institutional commitment to ensure optimal patient outcomes.\n【save__datas】\t【5074】\tGeneral Stroke Care\n【save__datas】\t【5075】\tRecent studies establish that stroke unit care is superior to care in general medical wards， and the positive effects of stroke unit care can persist for years. The benefits from treatment in a stroke unit are comparable to the effects achieved with ⅣV rtPA. Patients should be admitted to a stroke unit (if available) for careful observation (Box 11)， including monitoring of blood pressure and neurologic status and physiologic optimization. General stroke care， centered on physiologic optimization， in-cludes prevention of hypoxia， management of hypertension， optimal glucose control， maintenance of euthermia， and nutri-tional support. Additional efforts center on prevention of com-plications associated with stroke (eg， aspiration pneumonia， deep venous thrombosis， urinary tract infections) and initiation of secondary stroke prevention.\n【save__datas】\t【5076】\tGiven the requirements for frequent neurologic assessment and vital sign measurements， especially after administration of IV rtPA， patients should be admitted as quickly as possible， ideally within 3 hours from arrival.8 If the patient’s neurologic status deteriorates， an emergent CT scan is re-quired to determine if cerebral edema or hemorrhage is responsible for the deterioration. Treatment of hemorrhage or edema should be started immediately as indicated.\n【save__datas】\t【5077】\tBlood Pressure Munugement\n【save__datas】\t【5078】\tBlood pressure management varies depending on whether or not fibrinolytic or intra-arterial therapies were used. Current recom-mendations for control of blood pressure in patients who receive IV rtPA or intra-arterial recanalization therapies are shown in Table 2. In those patients for whom recanalization is not planned， more liberal acceptance of hypertension is recom-mended， provided no other comorbid conditions require interven-tion (Table 3). Normal saline， administered at a rate of approxi-mately 75 to 100 mL/h， is used to maintain euvolemia as needed. In stroke patients who may be relatively hypovolemic， careful admin-istration of IV normal saline boluses may be appropriate.\n【save__datas】\t【5079】\tGlycemic Control\n【save__datas】\t【5081】\tTemperature Control\n【save__datas】\t【5083】\tDysphagia Screening\n【save__datas】\t【5084】\tAll patients with stroke should be screened for dysphagia before they are given anything by mouth. A simple bedside screening evaluation involves asking the patient to sip water from a cup. If the patient can sip and swallow without difficulty， the patient is asked to take a large gulp of water and swallow. If there are no signs of coughing or aspiration after 30 seconds， then it is safe for the patient to have a thickened diet until formally assessed by a speech patholo-gist. Medications may be given in applesauce or jam. Any patient who fails a swallow test may be given medications such as aspirin rectally or， if appropriate for the medication， intravenously， intramuscularly， or subcutaneously.\n【save__datas】\t【5085】\tOther Stroke Manugement\n【save__datas】\t【5086】\tAdditional stroke care includes support of the airway， oxy-genation and ventilation， and nutritional support. Seizure prophylaxis is not recommended， but for patients who expe-rience a seizure， administration of anticonvulsants is recom-mended to prevent more seizures.104 In patients with severe stroke， posterior circulation stroke， and in younger patients， healthcare providers must observe for signs of increased intracranial pressure.\n【len<10_filter】\t【5087】\tSummary\n【save__datas】\t【5088】\tAdvances in stroke care will have the greatest effect on stroke outcome if care is delivered within a regional stroke system designed to improve both efficiency and effectiveness. The ultimate goal of stroke care is to minimize ongoing injury， emergently recanalize acute vascular occlusions， and begin secondary measures to maximize functional recovery. These efforts will provide stroke patients with the greatest opportu-nity for a return to previous quality of life and decrease the overall societal burden of stroke.\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  |  |  | Other  | Speakers'  |  | Consultant/  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Writing Group  |  |  | Research  | Bureau/  | Ownership  | Advisory  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Member  | Employment  | Research Grant  | Support  | Honoraria  | Interest  | Board  | Other  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Edward C.

Jeejeebhoy； Andrea Gabrielli\n【save__datas】\t【5247】\tECC addresses cardiac arrest in situations that require special treatments or procedures beyond those provided during basic life support (BLS) and advanced cardiovas-cular life support (ACLS). We have included 15 specific cardiac arrest situations. The first several sections discuss cardiac arrest associated with internal physiological or metabolic conditions， such as asthma (12.1)， anaphylaxis(12.2)， pregnancy (12.3)， morbid obesity (12.4)， pulmo-nary embolism (PE) (12.5)， and electrolyte imbalance(12.6).\n【save__datas】\t【5248】\tThe next several sections relate to resuscitation and treat-ment of cardiac arrest associated with external or environ-mentally related circumstances， such as ingestion of toxic substances (12.7)， trauma (12.8)， accidental11hypothermia(12.9)， avalanche (12.10)， drowning (12.11)， and electric shock/lightning strikes (12.12).\n【save__datas】\t【5249】\tThe last 3 sections review management of cardiac arrest that may occur during special situations affecting the heart， including percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (12.13)， cardiac tamponade (12.14)， and cardiac surgery (12.15).\n【save__datas】\t【5250】\tPart 12.1： Cardiac Arrest Associated With Asthma\n【save__datas】\t【5251】\tAsthma is responsible for more than 2 million visits to the emergency department (ED) in the United States each year， with 1 in 4 patients requiring admission to a hospital.'Annually there are 5，000 to 6，000 asthma-related deaths in the United States， many occurring in the prehospital setting.2 Severe asthma accounts for approximately 2% to20% of admissions to intensive care units， with up to one third of these patients requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.3 This section focuses on the evaluation and treatment of patients with near-fatal asthma.\n【save__datas】\t【5252】\tSeveral consensus groups have developed excellent guide-lines for the management of asthma that are available on the World Wide Web：\n【[http:]_filter】\t【5253】\t· http：//www.nhlbi.nih.gov/about/naepp\n【[http:]_filter】\t【5254】\t· http：//www.ginasthma.com\n【save__datas】\t【5255】\tPathophysiology\n【save__datas】\t【5256】\tThe pathophysiology of asthma consists of 3 key abnormalities：\n【[*]_filter】\t【5257】\t\\* Bronchoconstriction\n【save__datas】\t【5258】\t· Airway inflammation\n【save__datas】\t【5259】\t·Mucous plugging\n【save__datas】\t【5261】\tClinical Aspects of Severe Asthma\n【save__datas】\t【5262】\tWheezing is a common physical finding， although the sever-ity of wheezing does not correlate with the degree of airway obstruction. The absence of wheezing may indicate critical airway obstruction， whereas increased wheezing may indicate a positive response to bronchodilator therapy.\n【save__datas】\t【5263】\tOxygen saturation (Sao，) levels may not reflect progressive alveolar hypoventilation， particularly if oxygen is being admin-istered. Note that Sao， may fall initially during therapy because B2-agonists produce both bronchodilation and vasodilation and initially may increase intrapulmonary shunting.\n【save__datas】\t【5265】\tInitial Stabilization\n【save__datas】\t【5266】\tPatients with severe life-threatening asthma require urgent and aggressive treatment with simultaneous administration of oxygen， bronchodilators， and steroids. Healtheare providers must monitor these patients closely for deterioration. Al-though the pathophysiology of life-threatening asthma con-sists of bronchoconstriction， inflammation， and mucous plug-ging， only bronchoconstriction and1inflammation are amenable to drug treatment.\n【save__datas】\t【5267】\tThe American Heart Association requests that this document be cited as follows： Vanden Hoek TL， Morrison LJ， Shuster M， Donnino M， Sinz E，\n【save__datas】\t【5268】\tLavonas EJ， Jeejeebhoy FM， Gabrielli A.

As noted above， successful treatment with B-agonists may cause an initial decrease in oxygen saturation because the resultant bronchodilation can initially increase the ventilation-perfusion mismatch.\n【save__datas】\t【5276】\tInhaled Br-Agonists\n【save__datas】\t【5279】\tLevalbuterol is the R-isomer of albuterol. Comparisons with albuterol have produced mixed results， with some studies show-ing a slightly improved bronchodilator effect in the treatment of acute asthma in the ED.I1 There is no evidence that levalbuterol should be favored over albuterol.\n【save__datas】\t【5281】\tCorticosteroids\n【save__datas】\t【5282】\tSystemic corticosteroids are the only treatment for the inflam-matory component of asthma proven to be effective for acute asthma exacerbations. Because the antiinflammatory effects after administration may not be apparent for 6 to 12 hours， corticosteroids should be administered early. The early use of systemic steroids hastens the resolution of airflow obstruction ayeduce admission to the hospital.4 Although there may lato be no difference in clinical effects between oral and IV formu-lations of corticosteroids，15，16 the ⅣV route is preferable in patients with severe asthma. In adults a typical initial dose of methylprednisolone is 125 mg (dose range： 40 mg to 250 mg)； a typical dose of dexamethasone is 10 mg.\n【save__datas】\t【5283】\tAdjunctive Therapies\n【save__datas】\t【5284】\tAnticholinergics\n【save__datas】\t【5287】\tMagnesium Sulfate\n【save__datas】\t【5289】\tEpinephrine or Terbutaline\n【len<10_filter】\t【5291】\tKetumine\n【save__datas】\t【5292】\tKetamine is a parenteral， dissociative anesthetic with bronchodi-latory properties that also can stimulate copious bronchial secretions. One case series25 suggested substantial efficacy， whereas 2 published randomized trials in children26，27 found no benefit of ketamine when compared with standard care. Keta-mine has sedative and analgesic properties that may be useful if intubation is planned.\n【len<10_filter】\t【5293】\tHeliox\n【save__datas】\t【5294】\tHeliox is a mixture of helium and oxygen (usually a 70：30helium to oxygen ratio mix) that is less viscous than ambient air. Heliox has been shown to improve the delivery and deposition of nebulized albuterol28； however， a recent meta-analysis of clinical trials did not support its use as initial treatment for--connect--【5295】patients with acute asthma.29 Because the heliox mixture re-quires at least 70% helium for effect， it cannot be used if the patient requires ≥30% oxygen.\n【save__datas】\t【5296】\tMethylxanthines\n【save__datas】\t【5298】\tLeukotriene Antagonists\n【save__datas】\t【5299】\tLeukotriene antagonists improve lung function and decrease the need for short-acting B2-agonists for long-term asthma therapy， but their effectiveness during acute exacerbations of asthma is unproven.\n【save__datas】\t【5300】\tInhuled Anesthetics\n【save__datas】\t【5301】\tCase reports in adults3l and children32 suggest a benefit of the potent inhalation anesthetics sevoflurane and isoflurane for patients with life-threatening asthma unresponsive to maximal conventional therapy. These agents may have direct bronchodi-lator effects. In addition， the anesthetic effect of these drugs increases the ease of mechanical ventilation and reduces oxygen demand and carbon dioxide production. This therapy requires expert consultation in an intensive care setting， and its effective-ness has not been evaluated in randomized clinical studies.\n【save__datas】\t【5302】\tAssisted Ventilation\n【save__datas】\t【5303】\tNoninvasive Positive-Pressure Ventilation\n【save__datas】\t【5304】\tNoninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NIPPV) may offer short-term support for patients with acute respiratory failure and may delay or eliminate the need for endotracheal intuba-tion.33-35 This therapy requires that the patient is alert and has adequate spontaneous respiratory effort. Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP)， the most common method of delivering NIPPV， allows for separate control of inspiratory and expiratory pressures.\n【save__datas】\t【5305】\tEndotracheul Intubation With Mechunical Ventilation\n【save__datas】\t【5306】\tEndotracheal intubation is indicated for patients who present with apnea， coma， persistent or increasing hypercapnia， exhaus-tion， severe distress， and depression of mental status. Clinical judgment is necessary to assess the need for immediate endo-tracheal intubation for these critically ill patients. Endotracheal intubation does not solve the problem of small airway constric-tion in patients with severe asthma； thus， therapy directed toward relief of bronchoconstriction should be continued. Mechanical ventilation in the asthmatic patient can be difficult and associ-ated risks require careful management. Intubation and positive-pressure ventilation can trigger further bronchoconstriction and complications such as breath stacking that result from incom-plete expiration， air trapping， and buildup of positive end-expiratory pressure (ie， intrinsic or auto-PEEP). This breath stacking can cause barotrauma. Decreasing tidal volume may avoid auto-PEEP and high peak airway pressures. Optimal ventilator management requires expert consultation and ongoing careful review of ventilation flow and pressure curves. Although endotracheal intubation introduces risks， it should be performed when necessary based on clinical condition.\n【save__datas】\t【5307】\tRapid sequence intubation is the technique of choice and should be performed by an expert in airway management. The--connect--【5308】provider should use the largest endotracheal tube available(usually 8 or 9 mm) to decrease airway resistance. Immediately after intubation， endotracheal tube placement should be con-firmed by clinical examination and waveform capnography. A chest radiograph should then be performed.\n【save__datas】\t【5309】\tTroubleshooting After Intubation\n【save__datas】\t【5310】\tWhen severe bronchoconstriction is present， breath stacking(so-called auto-PEEP) can develop during positive-pressure ventilation， leading to complications such as hyperinflation， tension pneumothorax， and hypotension. During manual or mechanical ventilation， a slower respiratory rate should be used with smaller tidal volumes (eg， 6 to 8 mL/kg)，36 shorter inspira-tory time (eg， adult inspiratory flow rate 80 to 100 mL/min)， and longer expiratory time (eg， inspiratory to expiratory ratio 1：4 or1：5) than generally would be provided to patients without asthma.37 Management of mechanical ventilation will vary based on patient-ventilation characteristics. Expert consultation should be obtained.\n【save__datas】\t【5311】\tMild hypoventilation (permissive hypercapnia) reduces the risk of barotrauma. Hypercapnia is typically well tolerated.38，39Sedation is often required to optimize ventilation， decrease ventilator dyssynchrony (and therefore auto-PEEP)， and mini-mize barotrauma after intubation. Because delivery of inhaled medications may be inadequate before intubation， the provider should continue to administer inhaled albuterol treatments through the endotracheal tube.\n【save__datas】\t【5312】\tFour common causes of acute deterioration in any intubated patient are recalled by the mnemonic DOPE (tube Displace-ment， tube Obstruction， Pneumothorax， Equipment failure). Auto-PEEP is another common cause of deterioration in patients with asthma. If the asthmatic patient’s condition deteriorates or if it is difficult to ventilate the patient， check the ventilator for leaks or malfunction； verify endotracheal tube position； elimi-nate tube obstruction (eliminate any mucous plugs and kinks)； evaluate for auto-PEEP； and rule out a pneumothorax.\n【save__datas】\t【5313】\tHigh-end expiratory pressure can be reduced quickly by separating the patient from the ventilator circuit； this will allow PEEP to dissipate during passive exhalation. If auto-PEEP results in significant hypotension， assisting with exhalation by pressing on the chest wall after disconnection of the ventilator circuit will allow active exhalation and should lead to immediate resolution of hypotension. To minimize auto-PEEP， decrease the respiratory rate or tidal volume or both. If auto-PEEP persists and the patient displays ventilator dyssynchrony despite ade-quate sedation， paralytic agents may be considered.\n【save__datas】\t【5314】\tIn exceedingly rare circumstances， aggressive treatment for acute respiratory failure due to severe asthma will not provide adequate gas exchange. There are case reports that describe successful use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation(ECMO) in adult and pediatric patients40-43 with severe asthma after other aggressive measures have failed to reverse hyoxemia and hypercarbia.\n【save__datas】\t【5316】\tBLS treatment of cardiac arrest in asthmatic patients is unchanged.\n【save__datas】\t【5318】\tWhen cardiac arrest occurs in the patient with acute asthma， standard ACLS guidelines should be followed.\n【save__datas】\t【5322】\tPart 12.2： Cardiac Arrest Associated With Anaphylaxis\n【save__datas】\t【5324】\tThe term classic anaphylaxis refers to hypersensitivity reac-tions mediated by the immunoglobulins IgE and IgG. Prior sensitization to an allergen produces antigen-specific immuno-globulins. Subsequent reexposure to the allergen provokes the anaphylactic reaction， although many anaphylactic reactions occur with no documented prior exposure. Pharmacological agents， latex， foods， and stinging insects are among the most common causes of anaphylaxis described.\n【save__datas】\t【5325】\tSigns and Symptoms\n【save__datas】\t【5326】\tThe initial symptoms of anaphylaxis are often nonspecific and include tachycardia， faintness， cutaneous flushing， urti-caria， diffuse or localized pruritus， and a sensation of impend-ing doom. Urticaria is the most common physical finding. The patient may be agitated or anxious and may appear either flushed or pale.\n【save__datas】\t【5328】\tCardiovascular collapse is common in severe anaphylaxis. If not promptly corrected， vasodilation and increased capillary permeability， causing decreased preload and relative hypovole-mia of up to 37% of circulating blood volume， can rapidly lead--connect--【5329】to cardiac arrest.61，62 Myocardial ischemia and acute myocardial infarction， malignant arrhythmias， and cardiovascular depression can also contribute to rapid hemodynamic deterioration and cardiac arrest.63 Additionally， cardiac dysfunction may result from underlying disease or development of myocardial ischemia due\n【save__datas】\t【5332】\tThere are no randomized controlled trials evaluating alterna-tive treatment algorithms for cardiac arrest due to anaphylaxis. Evidence is limited to case reports and extrapolations from nonfatal cases， interpretation of pathophysiology， and consensus opinion. Providers must be aware that urgent support of airway， breathing， and circulation is essential in suspected anaphylactic reactions.\n【save__datas】\t【5333】\tBecause of limited evidence， the management of cardiac arrest secondary to anaphylaxis should be treated with standard BLS and ACLS. The following therapies are largely consensus-based but commonly used and widely accepted in the manage-ment of the patient with anaphylaxis who is not in cardiac arrest.\n【len<10_filter】\t【5335】\tAirway\n【save__datas】\t【5337】\tCirculation\n【len<10_filter】\t【5341】\tAirway\n【save__datas】\t【5343】\tFluid Resuscitation\n【save__datas】\t【5346】\tVasopressors\n【save__datas】\t【5351】\tOther Interventions\n【save__datas】\t【5353】\tExtracorporeal Support of Circulation\n【save__datas】\t【5354】\tCardiopulmonary bypass has been successful in isolated case reports of anaphylaxis followed by cardiac arrest.90，91 Use of\n【save__datas】\t【5356】\tPart 12.3： Cardiac Arrest Associated With Pregnancy\n【save__datas】\t【5357】\tScope of the Problem\n【save__datas】\t【5359】\tDuring attempted resuscitation of a pregnant woman， provid-ers have 2 potential patients： the mother and the fetus.

However， at a tilt ≥30° the patient may slide or roll off the inclined plane，106 so this degree of tilt may not be practical during resuscitation. Although important， the degree of tilt is difficult to estimate reliably； 1 study reported that the degree of table tilt is often overestimated.110 Using a fixed， hard wedge of a predetermined angle may help.\n【save__datas】\t【5380】\tIf chest compressions remain inadequate after lateral uterine displacement or left-lateral tilt， immediate emergency cesarean section should be considered.

After a pregnant woman receives an electric shock， the range of clinical presentations varies from the mother feeling only a strange sensation with no fetal effects to fetal death either immediately or a few days after the shock. Risk factors for adverse fetal outcomes include the magnitude of current and duration of contact. The greatest predictor of risk for adverse fetal outcome is if the current travels through the uterus， because amniotic fluid most likely transmits current in a manner similar to that transmitted via other body fluids， which could increase the risk of fetal death or burns.\n【save__datas】\t【5408】\tTreatment of Reversible Causes\n【save__datas】\t【5409】\tThe same reversible causes of cardiac arrest that occur in nonpregnant women can occur during pregnancy.

Neurological effects ranging from loss of tendon reflexes， sedation， severe muscular weakness， and respiratory depression are seen at levels of 4-5 mmol/L. Other signs of magnesium toxicity include gastrointestinal symptoms(nausea and vomiting)， skin changes (flushing)， and electrolyte/fluid abnormalities (hypophosphatemia， hyperosmolar dehydra-tion).

In addition， reversible causes of cardiac arrest need to consid-ered. While CPR in the pulseless trauma patient has overall been considered futile， several reversible causes of cardiac arrest in the context of trauma are correctible and their prompt treatment could be life-saving. These include hypoxia， hypo-volemia， diminished cardiac output secondary to pneumotho-rax or pericardial tamponade， and hypothermia.\n【save__datas】\t【5598】\tWhen multisystem trauma is present or trauma involves the head and neck， the cervical spine must be stabilized. A iaw thrust should be used instead of a head tilt-chin lift to establish a patent airway. If breathing is inadequate and the patient’s face is bloody， ventilation should be provided with a barrier device， a pocket mask， or a bag-mask device while maintaining cervical spine stabilization. Stop any visible hemorrhage using direct compression and appropriate dressings. If the patient is completely unresponsive despite rescue breathing， provide standard CPR and defibrillation as indicated.\n【save__datas】\t【5600】\tAfter initiation of BLS care， if bag-mask ventilation is inadequate， an advanced airway should be inserted while maintaining cervical spine stabilization.

Control ongoing bleeding where possible and replace lost volume if the losses appear to have significantly compromised circulating blood volume. Cardiac arrest resuscitation will likely be ineffective in the presence of uncorrected severe hypovolemia.\n【save__datas】\t【5604】\tTreatment of PEA requires identification and treatment of reversible causes， such as severe hypovolemia， hypothermia， cardiac tamponade， or tension pneumothorax.399 Develop-ment of bradyasystolic rhythms often indicates the presence of severe hypovolemia， severe hypoxemia， or cardiorespira-tory failure. Ventricular fibrillation (VF) and pulseless ven-tricular tachycardia (VT) are treated with CPR and defibril-lation. For treatment recommendations regarding cardiac tamponade in traumatic cardiac arrest， see Part 12.14：“Car-diac Arrest Caused by Cardiac Tamponade.”\n【save__datas】\t【5606】\tCommotio Cordis\n【save__datas】\t【5607】\tCommotio cordis is VF triggered by a blow to the anterior chest during a cardiac repolarization.403，404 Blunt cardiac injury may result in cardiac contusion with injured myocar-dium and risk of ECG changes and arrhythmias. Even a small blow to the anterior chest during a cardiac repolarization， such as that imparted by the strike of a baseball or hockey puck， may trigger VF， so-called commotio cordis.405 Events causing commotio cordis are most commonly seen in young persons up to 18 years of age who are engaged in sports but may occur during daily activities. Prompt recognition that a precordial blow may cause VF is critical. Rapid defibrillation is often life-saving for these frequently young victims of cardiac arrest. Provision of immediate BLS care using an automated external defibrillator (AED) and ACLS for VF in this setting is appropriate.\n【save__datas】\t【5608】\tPart 12.9： Cardiac Arrest in Accidental Hypothermia\n【save__datas】\t【5609】\tUnintentional or accidental hypothermia is a serious and preventable health problem. Severe hypothermia (body tem-perature <30°C \\[86°F\\]) is associated with marked depression of critical body functions， which may make the victim appear clinically dead during the initial assessment. Therefore， life-saving procedures should be initiated unless the victim is--connect--【5610】obviously dead (eg， rigor mortis， decomposition， hemisec-tion， decapitation). The victim should be transported as soon as possible to a center where aggressive rewarming during resuscitation is possible.\n【save__datas】\t【5611】\tInitial Care for Victims of\n【save__datas】\t【5612】\tAccidental Hypothermia\n【save__datas】\t【5613】\tWhen the victim is extremely cold but has maintained a perfusing rhythm， the rescuer should focus on interventions that prevent further loss of heat and begin to rewarm the victim immediately. Additional interventions include the following：\n【save__datas】\t【5614】\t· Preventing additional evaporative heat loss by removing wet garments and insulating the victim from further envi-ronmental exposures. Passive rewarming is generally ade-quate for patients with mild hypothermia (temperature≥34°℃ \\[93.2°F\\]).\n【save__datas】\t【5616】\t·For patients with severe hypothermia (<30°℃ \\[86°F\\]) with a perfusing rhythm， core rewarming is often used， although some have reported successful rewarming with active external warming techniques.408，409 Active external warm-ing techniques include forced air or other efficient surface-warming devices.\n【save__datas】\t【5618】\t· Adjunctive core rewarming techniques include warmed IV or intraosseous (IO) fluids and warm humidified oxygen.424 Heat transfer with these measures is not rapid， and should be considered supplementary to active warming techniques.\n【save__datas】\t【5619】\t· Do not delay urgent procedures such as airway manage-ment and insertion of vascular catheters. Although these patients may exhibit cardiac irritability， this concern should not delay necessary interventions.\n【save__datas】\t【5620】\tBeyond these critical initial steps， the treatment of severe hypothermia (temperature <30°℃\\[86°F\\]) in the field remains controversial. Many providers do not have the time or equipment to assess core body temperature or to institute aggressive rewarming techniques， although these methods should be initiated when available.\n【save__datas】\t【5622】\tWhen the victim is hypothermic， pulse and respiratory rates may be slow or difficult to detect，425，426 and the ECG may even show asystole. If the hypothermic victim has no signs of life， begin CPR without delay. If the victim is not breathing， start rescue breathing immediately.\n【save__datas】\t【5623】\tThe temperature at which defibrillation should first be attempted in the severely hypothermic patient and the number of defibrillation attempts that should be made have not been\n【save__datas】\t【5626】\tTo prevent further loss of core heat， remove wet garments and protect the victim from additional environmental expo-sure. Insofar as possible， this should be done while providing initial BLS therapies. Rewarming should be attempted when feasible.\n【save__datas】\t【5628】\tFor unresponsive patients or those in arrest， advanced airway insertion is appropriate as recommended in the standard ACLS guidelines. Advanced airway management enables effective ventilation with warm， humidified oxygen and reduces the likelihood of aspiration in patients in periarrest.\n【save__datas】\t【5629】\tACLS management of cardiac arrest due to hypothermia focuses on aggressive active core rewarming techniques as the primary therapeutic modality. Conventional wisdom in-dicates that the hypothermic heart may be unresponsive to cardiovascular drugs， pacemaker stimulation， and defibrilla-tion； however， the data to support this are essentially theo-retical.429 In addition， drug metabolism may be reduced， and there is a theoretical concern that medications could accumu-late to toxic levels in the peripheral circulation if given repeatedly to the severely hypothermic victim. For these reasons， previous guidelines suggest withholding IV drugs if the victim’s core body temperature is <30°℃ (86°F).\n【save__datas】\t【5630】\tIn the last decade a number of animal investigations have been performed evaluating both vasopressors and antiarrhyth-mic medications that could challenge some of this conven-tional wisdom.430-435 In a meta-analysis of these studies， Wira et al436 found that vasopressor medications (ie， epineph-rine or vasopressin) increased rates of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) when compared with placebo (62%versus 17%； P<0.0001，n=77). Coronary perfusion pressures were increased in groups that received vasopressors com-pared with placebo. But groups given antiarrhythmics showed no improvement in ROSC when compared with control groups， although sample sizes were relatively small (n=34and n=40， respectively).\n【save__datas】\t【5632】\tGiven the lack of human evidence and relatively small number of animal investigations， the recommendation for\n【save__datas】\t【5635】\tAfter ROSC， patients should continue to be warmed to a goal temperature of approximately 32° to 34℃； this can be maintained according to standard postarrest guidelines for mild to moderate hypothermia in patients for whom induced hypothermia is appropriate. For those with contraindications to induced hypothermia， rewarming can continue to normal temperatures.\n【save__datas】\t【5636】\tBecause severe hypothermia is frequently preceded by other disorders (eg， drug overdose， alcohol use， or trauma)， the clinician must look for and treat these underlying condi-tions while simultaneously treating hypothermia.\n【save__datas】\t【5637】\tWithholding and Cessution of Resuscitative Efforts\n【save__datas】\t【5638】\tMultiple case reports indicate survival from accidental hypo-thermia even with prolonged CPR and downtimes.410，422Thus， patients with severe accidental hypothermia and car-diac arrest may benefit from resuscitation even in cases of prolonged downtime and prolonged CPR. Low serum potas-sium may indicate hypothermia， and not hypoxemia， as the primary cause of the arrest.438 Patients should not be consid-ered dead before warming has been provided.\n【save__datas】\t【5639】\tPart 12.10： Cardiac Arrest in Avalanche Victims\n【save__datas】\t【5640】\tAvalanche-related deaths are on the rise in North America due to winter recreational activities， including backcountry skiing and snowboarding， helicopter and snowcat skiing， snowmobiling， out-of-bounds skiing， ice climbing， mountain-eering， and snowshoeing. The most commoncauses of avalanche-related death are asphyxia， trauma， and hypother-mia， or combinations of the 3. Rescue and resuscitation strategies focus on management of asphyxia and hypother-mia， because most field research has been done on these 2conditions.\n【save__datas】\t【5642】\tIt may be difficult to know with any certainty how long an avalanche victim has been buried. The core temperature at time of extrication provides a proxy for duration of burial. A case series450 of buried avalanche victims showed a maxi-mum cooling rate of 8°C per hour， whereas a case report447described a maximum cooling rate of 9°C per hour. These--connect--【5643】cooling rates suggest that at 35 minutes of burial， the core temperature may drop as low as 32℃.\n【save__datas】\t【5644】\tIf information on the duration of burial or the state of the airway on extrication is not available to the receiving physi-cian， a serum potassium level of <8 mmol/L on hospital admission is a prognostic marker for ROSC444 and survival to hospital discharge.443，450 High potassium values are associ-ated with asphyxia，443，450-452 and there is an inverse correla-tion between admission K+ and survival to discharge in all-cause hypothermic patients.443，453-456 In a series of 32avalanche survivors the highest serum K+ was 6.4 mmol/L，450 but there is a single case report of a 31- month-old child with a K+ of 11.8 mmol/L presenting with hypothermia from exposure unrelated to an avalanche who survived.457 This suggests that the upper survivable limit of potassium is unknown for children who are hypothermic and victims of avalanche.\n【save__datas】\t【5646】\tPart 12.11： Drowning\n【save__datas】\t【5649】\tAlthough survival is uncommon in victims who have undergone prolonged submersion and require prolonged re-suscitation，464，465 successful resuscitation with full neurolog-ical recovery has occurred occasionally after prolonged sub-mersion in icy water466-469 and， in some instances， warm water.470，471 For this reason， scene resuscitation should be initiated and the victim transported to the ED unless there is obvious death (eg， rigor mortis， decomposition， hemisection， decapitation， lividity).\n【save__datas】\t【5653】\tCPR now begins with chest compressions in a C-A-B sequence. However， the guidelines recommend individualiza-tion in sequence based upon the presumed etiology of the arrest. CPR for drowning victims should use the traditional A-B-C approach in view of the hypoxic nature of the arrest. Victims with only respiratory arrest usually respond after a few artificial breaths are given.\n【save__datas】\t【5654】\tRecovery From the Water\n【save__datas】\t【5655】\tWhen attempting to rescue a drowning victim， the rescuer should get to the victim as quickly as possible. It is crucial， however， that the rescuer pays constant attention to his or her own personal safety during the rescue process.\n【save__datas】\t【5657】\tRescue Breathing\n【save__datas】\t【5658】\tThe first and most important treatment of the drowning victim is the immediate provision of ventilation. Prompt initiation of rescue breathing increases the victim’s chance of surviva1.475Rescue breathing is usually performed once the unresponsive victim is in shallow water or out of the water. Mouth-to-nose ventilation may be used as an alternative to mouth-to-mouth ventilation if it is difficult for the rescuer to pinch the victim’s nose， support the head， and open the airway in the water.\n【save__datas】\t【5660】\tChest Compressions\n【save__datas】\t【5661】\tAs soon as the unresponsive victim is removed from the water， the rescuer should open the airway， check for breathing， and if there is no breathing， give 2 rescue breaths that make the chest rise (if this was not done previously in the water). After delivery of 2 effective breaths， the lay rescuer should immediately begin chest compressions and provide cycles of compressions and ventilations according to the BLS guidelines. Once the victim is out of the water， if he or she is unresponsive and not breathing after delivery of 2 rescue breaths， rescuers should attach an AED and attempt defibrillation if a shockable rhythm is identified. It is only necessary to dry the chest area before applying the defibrillation pads and using the AED. If hypothermia is present， follow the recommendations in Part 12.9： “Cardiac Arrest in Accidental Hypothermia.”\n【save__datas】\t【5662】\tVomiting by the Victim During Resuscitation\n【save__datas】\t【5663】\tThe victim may vomit when the rescuer performs chest com-pressions or rescue breathing. In fact， in a 10-year study in Australia， two thirds of victims who received rescue breathing and 86% of those who required compressions and ventilations vomited.478 If vomiting occurs， turn the victim to the side and remove the vomitus using your finger， a cloth， or suction. If spinal cord injury is suspected， the victim should be logrolled so--connect--【5664】that the head， neck， and torso are turned as a unit to protect the cervical spine.\n【save__datas】\t【5667】\tPart 12.12： Cardiac Arrest Associated With Electric Shock and Lightning Strikes\n【save__datas】\t【5669】\tElectric Shock\n【save__datas】\t【5671】\tLightning Strike\n【save__datas】\t【5674】\tLightning also can have myriad effects on the cardiovascular system， producing extensive catecholamine release or autonomic stimulation. The victim may develop hypertension， tachycardia，--connect--【5675】nonspecific ECG changes (including prolongation of the QT interval and transient T-wave inversion)， and myocardial necro-sis with release of creatinine kinase-MB fraction.\n【save__datas】\t【5676】\tLightning can produce a wide spectrum of peripheral and central neurological injuries. The current can produce brain hemorrhages， edema， and small-vessel and neuronal injury. Hypoxic encephalopathy can result from cardiac arrest.\n【save__datas】\t【5677】\tVictims are most likely to die of lightning injury if they experience immediate respiratory or cardiac arrest and no treatment is provided. Patients who do not suffer respiratory or cardiac arrest， and those who respond to immediate treatment， have an excellent chance of recovery. Therefore， when multiple victims are struck simultaneously by lightning， rescuers should give the highest priority to patients in respiratory or cardiac arrest.\n【save__datas】\t【5680】\tThe rescuer must first be certain that rescue efforts will not put him or her in danger of electric shock. When the scene is safe (ie， the danger of shock has been removed)， determine the victim’s cardiorespiratory status. If spontaneous respiration or circulation is absent， immediately initiate standard BLS resuscitation care， including the use of an AED to identify and treat VT or VF.\n【save__datas】\t【5681】\tMaintain spinal stabilization during extrication and treatment if there is a likelihood of head or neck trauma.494，495 Both lightning and electric shock often cause multiple trauma， includ-ing injury to the spine，495 muscular strains， internal injuries from being thrown， and fractures caused by the tetanic response of skeletal muscles.496 Remove smoldering clothing， shoes， and belts to prevent further thermal damage.\n【save__datas】\t【5683】\tNo modification of standard ACLS care is required for victims of electric injury or lightning strike， with the exception of paying attention to possible cervical spine injury. Establishing an airway may be difficult for patients with electric burns of the face， mouth， or anterior neck. Extensive soft-tissue swelling may develop rapidly， complicating airway control measures. Thus， early intubation should be performed for patients with evidence of extensive burns even if the patient has begun to breathe spontaneously.\n【save__datas】\t【5684】\tFor victims with significant tissue destruction and in whom a pulse is regained， rapid ⅣV fluid administration is indicated to counteract distributive/hypovolemic shock and to correct ongo-ing fluid losses due to third spacing. Fluid administration should be adequate to maintain diuresis and facilitate excretion of myoglobin， potassium， and other byproducts of tissue destruc-tion (this is particularly true for patients with electric injury).492Regardless of the extent of external injuries after electrothermal shock， the underlying tissue damage can be far more extensive.\n【save__datas】\t【5685】\tPart 12.13： Cardiac Arrest During Percutaneous Coronary Intervention\n【save__datas】\t【5686】\tDuring both elective and emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)， there is risk of cardiac arrest. Although high-quality chest compressions improve the chance of suc-cessful resuscitation and survival， it is difficult to perform effective， high-quality chest compressions during PCI. There-fore， resuscitation adjuncts have been explored for the treat-ment of cardiac arrest during PCI. There are no randomized controlled trials evaluating alternative treatment strategies as opposed to standard care for cardiac arrest during PCI.\n【save__datas】\t【5689】\tEmergency Cardiopulmonary Bypass\n【save__datas】\t【5693】\tIntracoronary Verapamil\n【save__datas】\t【5694】\tOne large case series508 describes the successful use of intracoronary verapamil to terminate reperfusion-induced VT following mechanical revascularization therapy. Verapamil was not successful in terminating VF.\n【save__datas】\t【5695】\tPart 12.14： Cardiac Arrest Caused by Cardiac Tamponade\n【save__datas】\t【5696】\tCardiac tamponade can be a life-threatening event.

The arguments in favor of starting with chest compressions are as follows：\n【save__datas】\t【6414】\t· All rescuers should be able to start chest compressions almost immediately. In contrast， positioning the head and attaining a seal for mouth-to-mouth or a bag-mask appara-tus for rescue breathing take time and delays the initiation of chest compressions.\n【save__datas】\t【6415】\tAsphyxial cardiac arrest is more common than VF cardiac arrest in infants and children， and ventilations are extremely important in pediatric resuscitation. Animal studies 28-30 and a recent large pediatric study3 show that resuscitation results for asphyxial arrest are better with a combination of ventila-tions and chest compressions. ItIS，however， unknown whether it makes a difference if the sequence begins with ventilations (ABC) or with chest compressions (CAB). Start-ing CPR with 30 compressions followed by 2 ventilations should theoretically delay ventilations by only about 18seconds for the lone rescuer and by an even a shorter interval for 2 rescuers. The CAB sequence for infants and children is recommended in order to simplify training with the hope that more victims of sudden cardiac arrest will receive bystander CPR. It offers the advantage of consistency in teaching rescuers， whether their patients are infants， children， or adults.\n【save__datas】\t【6416】\tFor the purposes of these guidelines\n【save__datas】\t【6417】\t· Infant BLS guidelines apply to infants<approximately 1year of age.\n【save__datas】\t【6418】\t春Child BLS guidelines apply to children approximately 1year of age until puberty.

Although provision of CPR carries a theoretical risk of transmitting infectious disease， the risk to the rescuer is very low.3l\n【save__datas】\t【6426】\tTo assess the need for CPR， the lay rescuer should assume that cardiac arrest is present if the victim is unresponsive and not breathing or only gasping.\n【save__datas】\t【6427】\tCheck for Response\n【save__datas】\t【6428】\tGently tap the victim and ask loudly， “Are you okay?” Call the child’s name if you know it. If the child is responsive， he or she will answer， move， or moan. Quickly check to see if the child has any injuries or needs medical assistance. If you are alone and the child is breathing， leave the child to phone the emergency response system， but return quickly and recheck the child's condition frequently. Children with respi-ratory distress often assume a position that maintains airway patency and optimizes ventilation. Allow the child with respiratory distress to remain in a position that isS1comfortable. If the child is unresponsive， shout for help.\n【save__datas】\t【6429】\tCheck for Breathing\n【save__datas】\t【6430】\tIf you see regular breathing， the victim does not need CPR. If there is no evidence of trauma， turn the child onto the side (recovery position)， which helps maintain a patent airway and decreases risk of aspiration.\n【save__datas】\t【6433】\tStart Chest Compressions\n【save__datas】\t【6434】\tDuring cardiac arrest， high-quality chest compressions generate blood flow to vital organs andincrease the likelihood of ROSC. If the infant or child is unresponsive and not breathing， give 30 chest compressions.\n【save__datas】\t【6435】\tThe following are characteristics of high-quality CPR：\n【save__datas】\t【6437】\t· Allow complete chest recoil after each compression to allow the heart to refill with blood.\n【save__datas】\t【6438】\t· Minimize interruptions of chest compressions.\n【[*]_filter】\t【6439】\t\\* Avoid excessive ventilation.--connect--【6444】expansion improves the flow of blood returning to the heart and thereby blood flow to the body during CPR.44-46During pediatric CPR incomplete chest wall recoil1is common， particularlywhenn rescuersbecomefa-tigued.32，47，48 Incomplete recoil during CPR is associated with higher intrathoracic pressures and significantly de-creased venous return， coronary perfusion， blood flow， and cerebral perfusion.45，46 Manikin studies suggest that tech-niques to lift the heel of the hand slightly， but completely， off the chest can improve chest recoil， but this technique has notbeen studied in humans.44，49 Automated CPR feedback devices hold promise as monitors of CPR quality parameters， including chest recoil， by providing real-time， corrective feedback to the rescuer. However， there is currently insufficient evidence for or against their use in infants and children.\n【save__datas】\t【6445】\tRescuer fatigue can lead to inadequate compression rate， depth， and recoil.32，47，50 The quality of chest compressions may deteriorate within minutes even when the rescuer denies feeling fatigued.51，52Rescuers sshould therefore rotate the compressor role approximately every 2 minutes to prevent compressor fatigue and deterioration in quality and rate of chest compressions. Recent data suggest that when feedback devices are used and compressions are effective， some rescuers may be able to effectively con-tinue past the 2-minute interval.47 The switch should be accomplished as quickly as possible (ideally in less than 5seconds) to minimize interruptions in chest compressions.\n【save__datas】\t【6446】\tResuscitation outcomes in infants and children are best if chest compressions are combined with ventilations (see below)， but if aa rescuer is not trainedinPproviding ventilations， or is unable to do so， the lay rescuer should continu1eeVwith chest compressions (“Hands-Only” or compression-only CPR) until help arrives.\n【save__datas】\t【6447】\tOpen the Airway and Give Ventilations\n【save__datas】\t【6449】\tTo give breaths to an infant， use a mouth-to-mouth-and-nose technique； to give breaths to a child， use a mouth-to-mouth technique.56 Make sure the breaths are effective (ie， the chest rises). Each breath should take about 1 second. If the chest does not rise， reposition the head， make a better seal， and try again.56 It may be necessary to move the child’s head through a range of positions to provide optimal airway patency and effective rescue breathing.\n【save__datas】\t【6452】\tCoordinate Chest Compressions and Breathing\n【save__datas】\t【6453】\tAfter giving 2 breaths， immediately give 30 compressions. The lone rescuer should continue this cycle of 30 com-pressions and 2 breaths for approximately 2 minutes (about5 cycles) before leaving the victim to activate the emer-gency response system and obtain an automated external defibrillator (AED) if one is nearby.\n【save__datas】\t【6454】\tThe ideal compression-to-ventilation ratio in infants and children is unknown. The following have been considered in recommending a compression-to-ventilation ratio of30：2 for single rescuers：\n【save__datas】\t【6457】\t· An observational human study7 comparing resuscitations by firefighters prior to and following the change from 15：2to 30：2 compression-to-ventilation ratio reported more chest compressions per minute with a 30：2 ratio； ROSC was unchanged.\n【save__datas】\t【6458】\tAnimal studies71-73 show that coronary perfusion pressure， a major determinant of success in resuscitation， rapidly declines when chest compressions are interrupted； once compressions are resumed， several chest compressions are needed to restore coronary perfusion pressure. Thus， fre-quent interruptions of chest compressions prolong the duration of low coronary perfusion pressure and flow.\n【save__datas】\t【6459】\t· Manikin studies，25，69，74 as well as in- and out-of-hospital adult human studies， 33，34，75 have documented long interrup-tions in chest compressions. Adult studies76-78 have also demonstrated that these interruptions reduce the likelihood of ROSC.\n【save__datas】\t【6460】\tActivate Emergency Response System\n【save__datas】\t【6461】\tIf there are 2 rescuers， one should start CPR immediately and the other should activate the emergency response system (in most locales by phoning 911) and obtain an AED， if one is available. Most infants and children with cardiac arrest have an asphyxial rather than a VF ar-rest3，9，12； therefore 2 minutes of CPR are recommended before the lone rescuer activates the emergency response system and gets an AED if one is nearby. The lone rescuer should then return to the victim as soon as possible and use the AED (if available) or resume CPR， starting with chest compressions. Continue with cycles of 30 compressions to2 ventilations until emergency response rescuers arrive or the victim starts breathing spontaneously.\n【save__datas】\t【6465】\tAssess the Need for CPR (BOX 1)\n【save__datas】\t【6466】\tIf the victim is unresponsive and is not breathing (or only gasping)， send someone to activate the emergency re-sponse system.\n【save__datas】\t【6467】\tPulse Check (BOX3)\n【save__datas】\t【6469】\tInadequate Breathing With Pulse\n【save__datas】\t【6471】\tBradycardia With Poor Perfusion\n【save__datas】\t【6472】\tIf the pulse is <60 per minute and there are signs of poor perfusion (ie， pallor， mottling， cyanosis) despite support of oxygenation and ventilation， begin chest compressions. Because cardiac output in infancy and childhood largely depends on heart rate， profound bradycardia with poor perfusion is an indication for chest compressions because cardiac arrest is imminent and beginning CPR prior to full cardiac arrest results in improved survival.96 The absolute heart rate at which chest compressions should be initiated is unknown； the recommendation to provide chest com-pressions for a heart rate <60 per minute with signs of--connect--【6474】by healthcare providers and not by lay rescuers @ 2010 American Heart Association--connect--【6476】poor perfusion is based on ease of teaching and retention of skills.

In the past， it hasbeen recommended that the thorax be squeezed at the time of chest compression， but there is no data that show benefit from a circumferential squeeze. The 2-thumb-encireling hands technique is preferred over the 2-finger technique becauseit produceshigher coronary artery perfusion pressure， results more consistently in appropriate depth or force of compression，99-102 and may generate higher sys-tolic and diastolic pressures.97，98，103，104 If you cannot phys-ically encircle the victim’s chest， compress the chest with2 fingers (see “Chest Compressions\" above).\n【save__datas】\t【6481】\tVentilations (Box 4)\n【save__datas】\t【6485】\tCoordinate Chest Compressions and Ventilations\n【save__datas】\t【6487】\tDefibrillation (Box 6)\n【save__datas】\t【6488】\tVF can be the cause of sudden collapse7，107 or may develop during resuscitation attempts.19，108 Children with sudden witnessed collapse (eg， a child collapsing during an ath-letic event) are likely to have VF or pulseless VT and need immediate CPR and rapid defibrillation. VF and pulseless VT are referred to as “shockable rhythms\" because they respond to electric shocks (defibrillation).\n【save__datas】\t【6491】\tRescuers should coordinate chest compressions and shock delivery to minimize the time between compressions and shock delivery and to resume CPR， beginning with compres-sions， immediately after shock delivery. The AED will prompt the rescuer to re-analyze the rhythm about every 2minutes. Shock delivery should ideally occur as soon as possible after compressions.\n【save__datas】\t【6493】\t· Follow the AED prompts.\n【save__datas】\t【6494】\t· End CPR cycle (for analysis and shock) with compressions， if possible\n【save__datas】\t【6495】\t· Resume chest compressions immediately after the shock.

If there is any delay in obtaining a barrier device or ventilation equipment， give mouth-to-mouth ventilation (if willing and able) or continue chest compressions alone.\n【save__datas】\t【6503】\tBug-Mask Ventilation (Healthcure Providers)\n【save__datas】\t【6504】\tBag-mask ventilation is an essential CPR technique for healthcare providers. Bag-mask ventilation requires training and periodic retraining in the following skills： selecting the correct mask size， opening the airway， making a tight seal between the mask and face， delivering effective ventilation， and assessing the effectiveness of that ventilation.\n【save__datas】\t【6505】\tUse a self-inflating bag with a volume of at least 450 to 500mL 123 for infants and young children， as smaller bags may not deliver an effective tidal volume or the longer inspiratory times required by full-term neonates and infants.24 In older children or adolescents， an adult self-inflating bag (1000mL) may be needed to reliably achieve chest rise.\n【save__datas】\t【6506】\tA self-inflating bagdelivers only room airunless supplementary oxygenisattached， but evenWwith an oxygen inflow of 10 L/min， the concentration of delivered oxygen varies from 30% to 80% and is affected by the tidal volume and peak inspiratory flow rate.125 To deliver a high oxygen concentration (60% to 95%)， attach an oxygen reservoir to the self-inflating bag.

Excessive ventilation is harmful because it\n【save__datas】\t【6512】\t春Causes air trapping and barotrauma in patients with small-airway obstruction.\n【save__datas】\t【6513】\t· Increases the risk of regurgitation and aspiration in patients without an advanced airway.\n【save__datas】\t【6515】\tBecause effective bag-mask ventilation requires com-plex steps， bag-mask ventilation is not recommended for ventilation by a lone rescuer during CPR.\n【save__datas】\t【6517】\tTwo-Person Bug-Mask Ventilation\n【save__datas】\t【6518】\tIf skilled rescuers are available， a 2-person technique may provide more effective bag-mask-ventilation than a single-person technique.129 A 2-person technique may be required to provide effective bag-mask ventilation when there is significant airway obstruction， poor lung compliance，128 or difficulty in creating a tight seal between the mask and the face. One rescuer uses both hands to open the airway and maintain a tight mask-to-face seal while the other com-presses the ventilation bag. Both rescuers should observe the chest to ensure chest rise. Because the 2-person technique may be more effective， be careful to avoid delivering too high a tidal volume that may contribute to excessive ventilation.\n【save__datas】\t【6519】\tGastric Inflation and Cricoid Pressure\n【save__datas】\t【6520】\tGastric inflation may interfere with effective ventilation130and cause regurgitation.

Sudden onset of respiratory distress in the absence of fever or other respiratory symptoms (eg， antecedent cough， congestion) suggests FBAO rather than an infectious cause of respiratory distress， such as croup.\n【save__datas】\t【6539】\tFBAO may cause mild or severe airway obstruction. When the airway obstruction is mild， the child can cough and make some sounds. When the airway obstruction is severe， the victim cannot cough or make any sound.\n【save__datas】\t【6540】\t· If FBAO is mild， do not interfere. Allow the victim to clear the airway by coughing while you observe for signs of severe FBAO.\n【save__datas】\t【6541】\t· If the FBAO is severe (ie， the victim is unable to make a sound) you must act to relieve the obstruction.\n【save__datas】\t【6542】\tFor a child perform subdiaphragmatic abdominal thrusts(Heimlich maneuver)152，153 until the object is expelled or the victim becomes unresponsive. For an infant， deliver repeated cycles of 5 back blows (slaps) followed by 5 chest compres-sions154-156 until the object is expelled or the victim becomes unresponsive. Abdominal thrusts are not recommended for infants because they may damage the infant’s relatively large and unprotected liver.\n【save__datas】\t【6543】\tIf the victim becomes unresponsive， start CPR with chest compressions (do not perform a pulse check). After30 chest compressions， open the airway. If you see a foreign body， remove it but do not perform blind finger sweeps because they may push obstructing objects farther into the pharynx and may damage the oropharynx.157-159Attempt to give 2 breaths and continue with cycles of chest compressions and ventilations until the object is expelled. After 2 minutes， if no one has already done so， activate the emergency response system.\n【save__datas】\t【6544】\tSpecial Resuscitation Situations\n【save__datas】\t【6545】\tChildren With Special Healthcare Needs\n【save__datas】\t【6546】\tChildren with special healtheare needs may require emergency care for complications of chronic conditions (eg， obstruction of a tracheostomy)， failure of support technology (eg， ventilator malfunction)， progression of underlying disease， or events unre-lated to those special needs.160 Care is often complicated by a lack of medical information， a comprehensive plan of medical care， a list of current medications， and lack of clarity in limitation of resuscitation orders such as “Do Not Attempt Resuscitation(DNAR)”or“Allow Natural Death (AND).\"Parents and child-care providers of children with special healthcare needs are encouraged to keep copies of medical information at home， with the child， and at the child's school or child-care facility.

If a jaw thrust--connect--【6561】does not open the airway， use a head tilt-chin lift， because a patent airway is necessary. If there are 2 rescuers， 1 can manually restrict cervical spine motion while the other rescuer opens the airway.\n【save__datas】\t【6563】\t· If possible， transport children with potential for serious trauma to a trauma center with pediatric expertise.\n【len<10_filter】\t【6564】\tDrowning\n【save__datas】\t【6565】\tOutcome after drowning is determined by the du l1neration of submersion， the water temperature， and how promptly and effectively CPR is provided.1，16，165 Neurologically intact survival has been reported after prolonged submersion in icy waters.166，167 Start resuscitation by safely removing the victim from the water as rapidly as possible. If you have special training， start rescue breathing while the victim is still in the water168 if doing so will not delay removing the victim from the water. Do not attempt chest compressions in the water.\n【save__datas】\t【6566】\tAfter removing the victim from the water start CPR if the victim is unresponsive and is not breathing. If you are alone， continue with 5 cycles (about 2 minutes) of com-pressions and ventilations before activating the emergency response system and getting an AED. If 2 rescuers are present， send the second rescuer to activate the emergency response system immediately and get the AED while you continue CPR.\n【save__datas】\t【6568】\tImmediate CPR can improve survival from cardiac arrest in children， but not enough children receive high-quality CPR.

More often it is the terminal result of progressive respiratory failure or shock， also called an asphyxial arrest. Asphyxia begins with a variable period of systemic hypoxemia， hypercapnea， and acidosis， progresses to bradycardia and hypotension， and culminates with cardiac arrest.\n【save__datas】\t【6789】\tAnother mechanism of cardiac arrest， ventricular fibrilla-tion (VF) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT)， is the initial cardiac rhythm in approximately 5% to 15% of pediatric in-hospital and out-of-hospital cardiac arrests：2-9 it is reported in up to 27% of pediatric in-hospital arrests at some point during the resuscitation.6 The incidence of VF/pulseless VT cardiac arrest riseswith age.2.4 Increasing evidence suggests that sudden unexpected death in young people can be associated with genetic abnormalities in myo-cyte ion channels resulting in abnormalities in ion flow (see“Sudden Unexplained Deaths，\"below).\n【save__datas】\t【6791】\tIt is unclear why the improvement in outcome from in-hospital cardiac arrest has occurred， although earlier rec-ognition and management of at-risk patients on general inpatient units and more aggressive implementation of evidence-based resuscitation guidelines may have played a role. Implementation of a formal pediatric medical emer-gency team (MET) or rapid response team (RRT) as part of an\n【save__datas】\t【6795】\tPediatric advanced life support (PALS) usually takes place in the setting of an organized response in an advanced healthcare environment.

The challenge is to organize the rescuers into an efficient team. Important considerations for the greatest chance of a successful resuscitation from cardiac arrest include the following：\n【save__datas】\t【6809】\t· While one rescuer performs chest compressions and an-other performs ventilations， other rescuers should obtain a monitor/defibrillator， establish vascular access， and calcu-late and prepare the anticipated medications.\n【save__datas】\t【6810】\tMonitored Patients\n【save__datas】\t【6811】\tMany in-hospital patients， especially if they are in an ICU， are monitored and some have an advanced airway andIare receiving mechanical ventilation. If the patient has an in-dwelling arterial catheter， use the waveform as feedback to evaluate hand position and chest compression depth. A minor adjustment of hand position or depth of compression can significantly improve the amplitude of the arterial waveform， reflecting better chest compression-induced stroke volume. The arterial waveform may also be useful in identification of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). If the patient’s end-tidal CO， (PETCO) is being monitored， it can be used to evaluate the quality of chest compressions； it can also provide an indication of ROSC (see below).\n【save__datas】\t【6812】\tRespiratory Failure\n【save__datas】\t【6813】\tRespiratory failure is characterized by inadequate ventilation， insufficient oxygenation， or both. Anticipate respiratory fail-ure if any of the following signs is present：\n【save__datas】\t【6814】\t· An increased respiratory rate， particularly with signs of distress (eg， increased respiratory effort including nasal flaring， retractions， seesaw breathing， or grunting)\n【save__datas】\t【6815】\t· An inadequate respiratory rate， effort， or chest excursion(eg， diminished breath sounds or gasping)， especially if mental status is depressed\n【save__datas】\t【6816】\t·Cyanosis with abnormal breathing despite supplementary oxygen\n【len<10_filter】\t【6817】\tShock\n【save__datas】\t【6818】\tShock results from inadequate blood flow and oxygen deliv-ery to meet tissue metabolic demands. The most common type of shock in children is hypovolemic， including shock due to hemorrhage. Distributive， cardiogenic， and obstructive shock occur less frequently. Shock progresses over a contin-uum of severity， from a compensated to a decompensated state. Compensatory mechanisms include tachycardia and increased systemic vascular resistance (vasoconstriction) in an effort to maintain cardiac output and perfusion pressure respectively. Decompensation occurs when compensatory mechanisms fail and results in hypotensive shock.\n【save__datas】\t【6819】\tTypical signs of compensated shock include\n【save__datas】\t【6820】\t· Tachycardia\n【save__datas】\t【6821】\t· Cool and pale distal extremities\n【save__datas】\t【6822】\t· Prolonged (>2 seconds) capillary refill (despite warm ambient temperature)\n【save__datas】\t【6823】\t·Weak peripheral pulses compared with central pulses\n【save__datas】\t【6824】\t· Normal systolic blood pressure\n【save__datas】\t【6825】\tAs compensatory mechanisms fail， signs of inadequate end-organ perfusion develop. In addition to the above， these signs include\n【save__datas】\t【6826】\t· Depressed mental status\n【save__datas】\t【6827】\t· Decreased urine output\n【save__datas】\t【6828】\t· Metabolic acidosis\n【save__datas】\t【6829】\t·Tachypnea\n【save__datas】\t【6830】\t· Weak central pulses\n【save__datas】\t【6831】\t· Deterioration in color (eg， mottling， see below)\n【save__datas】\t【6832】\tDecompensated shock is characterized by signs and symp-toms consistent with inadequate delivery of oxygen to tissues(pallor， peripheral cyanosis， tachypnea， mottling of the skin， decreased urine output， metabolic acidosis， depressed mental status)， weak or absent peripheral pulses， weak central pulses， and hypotension.\n【save__datas】\t【6833】\tLearn to integrate the signs of shock because no single sign confirms the diagnosis. For example：\n【save__datas】\t【6835】\t· Tachycardia is a common sign of shock， but it can also result from other causes， such as pain， anxiety， and fever.\n【save__datas】\t【6836】\t·Pulses are weak in hypovolemic and cardiogenic shock， but may be bounding in anaphylactic， neurogenic， and septic shock.\n【save__datas】\t【6837】\t· Blood pressure may be normal in a child with compensated shock but may decline rapidly when the child decompen-sates.

Based on data from adult stud-ies276，277 and pediatric animal models，278-280 biphasic shocks appear to be at least as effective as monophasic shocks and less harmful.\n【len<10_filter】\t【7016】\tAEDs\n【save__datas】\t【7017】\tMany AEDs can accurately detect VF in children of all ages.271，281-283 They can differentiate “shockable”from“non-shockable” rhythms with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity.281，282 It is recommended that systems and institu-tions that have AED programs and that care for children should use AEDs with a high specificity to recognize pedi-atric shockable rhythms and a pediatric attenuating system\n【save__datas】\t【7020】\tIntegration of Defibrillation With Resuscitation Sequence\n【save__datas】\t【7021】\tThe following are important considerations：\n【save__datas】\t【7022】\t· Provide CPR until the defibrillator is ready to deliver a R. shock； after shock delivery， resume CPR， beginning with chest compressions. Minimize interruptions of chest com-pressions. In adults with prolonged arrest285，286 and in animal models，287 defibrillation is more likely to be suc-cessful after a period of effective chest compressions. Ideally chest compressions should be interrupted only for ventilations (until an advanced airway is in place)， rhythm check， and shock delivery. If a “shockable\"rhythm is still present， continue chest compressions after a rhythm check(when possible) while the defibrillator is charging (so chest compressions are delivered until shock delivery).\n【save__datas】\t【7023】\t· (Step 3) Give 1 shock (2 J/kg) as quickly as possible and immediately resume CPR， beginning with chest compres-sions. If 1 shock fails to eliminate VF， the incremental benefit of another immediate shock is low， and resumption of CPR is likely to confer a greater value than another shock. CPR may provide coronary perfusion， increasing the likelihood of defibrillation with a subsequent shock. It is important to minimize the time between chest compres-sions and shock delivery and between shock delivery and resumption of postshock compressions.\n【save__datas】\t【7024】\t· (Step 4) Continue CPR for about 2 minutes. In in-hospital settings with continuous invasive monitoring， this sequence may be modified at the expert provider’s discretion (see， also Part 8.2：“Management of Cardiac Arrest\"). If sufficient rescuers are present， obtain vascular (IO or IV) access.\n【save__datas】\t【7025】\t· After 2 minutes of CPR， check the rhythm； recharge the defibrillator to a higher dose (4 J/kg).\n【save__datas】\t【7026】\t· (Step 5) If a “shockable” rhythm persists， give another shock (4 J/kg).

Therefore， one goal of the postresuscitation phase is to reduce the risk of oxidative injury while maintain-ing adequate oxygen delivery. A practical way to achieve that goal is to reduce the Fio， to reduce the Pao while ensuring adequate arterial oxygen content. Specifically， use the lowest inspired oxygen concentration that will maintain the arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation ≥94%. Provided appropriate equipment is available， once ROSC is achieved， adjust the Fio， to the minimum concentration needed to achieve transcutaneous or arterial oxygen saturation at least 94%， with the goal of avoiding hyperoxia while ensuring ade-quate oxygen delivery. Since an arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation of 100% may correspond to a Pao， anywhere between ~80 and 500 mmHg， in general it is appropriate to wean the Fio， for a saturation of 100%， provided the oxyhemoglobin saturation can be maintained =94%.\n【save__datas】\t【7157】\t· In addition to the usual clinical signs of adequate perfusion， laboratory parameters of adequate oxygen delivery over time include resolution of metabolic acidosis， reduced lactate concentration， and normalization of venous oxygen saturation.\n【save__datas】\t【7158】\t春Assist ventilation if there is significant respiratory compro-mise (tachypnea， respiratory distress with agitation or de-creased responsiveness， poor air exchange， cyanosis， hy-poxemia).

They apply primarily to newly born infants undergoing transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life， but the recommendations are also applicable to neonates who have completed perinatal transition and require resus-citation during the first few weeks to months following birth. Practitioners who resuscitate infants at birth or at any time during the initial hospital admission should consider following these guidelines. For the purposes of these guidelines， the terms newborn and neonate are intended to apply to any infant during the initial hospitalization. The term newly born is intended to apply specifically to an infant at the time of birth.\n【save__datas】\t【7856】\tApproximately 10% of newborns require some assistance to begin breathing at birth. Less than 1% require extensive resuscitative measures.2，3 Although the vast majority of newly born infants do not require intervention to make the transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life， because of the large total number of births， a sizable number will require some degree of resuscitation.\n【save__datas】\t【7857】\tThose newly born infants who do not require resuscitation can generally be identified by a rapid assessment of the following 3 characteristics：\n【save__datas】\t【7858】\t· Term gestation?\n【save__datas】\t【7859】\t·Crying or breathing?--connect--【7860】e Good muscle tone?\n【save__datas】\t【7861】\tIf the answer to all 3 of these questions is “yes，\" the baby does not need resuscitation and should not be separated from the mother. The baby should be dried， placed skin-to-skin with the mother， and covered with dry linen to maintain temperature. Observation of breathing， activity， and color should be ongoing.\n【save__datas】\t【7862】\tIf the answer to any of these assessment questions is “no，”the infant should receive one or more of the following 4categories of action in sequence：\n【save__datas】\t【7863】\tA.

Once positive pressure ventilation or supplementary oxygen administration is begun， assessment should consist of simultaneous evaluation of 3 vital characteristics： heart rate. respirations， and the state of oxygenation， the latter optimally determined by a pulse oximeter as discussed under “Assess-ment of Oxygen Need and Administration of Oxygen”below. The most sensitive indicator of a successful response to each step is an increase in heart rate.\n【save__datas】\t【7869】\tAnticipation of Resuscitation Need\n【save__datas】\t【7870】\tAnticipation， adequate preparation， accurate evaluation， and prompt initiation of support are critical for successful neona-\n【save__datas】\t【7871】\tThe American Heart Association requests that this document be cited as follows： Kattwinkel J， Perlman JM， Aziz K， Colby C， Fairchild K， Gallagher\n【save__datas】\t【7872】\tJ， Hazinski MF， Halamek LP， Kumar P， Little G， McGowan JE， Nightengale B， Ramirez MM， Ringer S， Simon WM， Weiner GM， Wyckoff M，Zaichkin\n【save__datas】\t【7873】\tJ.

If the possible need for resuscitation is anticipated， additional skilled personnel should be recruited and the necessary equipment prepared. Identifiable risk factors and the necessary equipment for resuscitation are listed in the\n【save__datas】\t【7883】\tTextbook of Neonatal Resuscitation， 6th Edition (American\n【save__datas】\t【7884】\tAcademy of Pediatrics， in press).\" If a preterm delivery(<37 weeks of gestation) is expected， special preparations will be required. Preterm babies have immature lungs that may be more difficult to ventilate and are also more vulner-able to injury by positive-pressure ventilation. Preterm babies also have immature blood vessels in the brain that are prone to hemorrhage； thin skin and a large surface area， which contribute to rapid heat loss； increased susceptibility to infection； and increased risk of hypovolemic shock related to small blood volume.\n【save__datas】\t【7885】\tInitial Steps\n【save__datas】\t【7886】\tThe initial steps of resuscitation are to provide warmth by placing the baby under a radiant heat source， positioning the head in a \"sniffing” position to open the airway， clearing the airway if necessary with a bulb syringe or suction catheter， drying the baby， and stimulating breathing. Recent studies have examined several aspects of these initial steps.

Oxy-hemoglobin saturation may normally remain in the 70% to80% range for several minutes following birth， thus resulting in the appearance of cyanosis during that time. Other studies have shown that clinical assessment of skin color is a very poor indicator of oxyhemoglobin saturation during the imme-diate neonatal period and that lack of cyanosis appears to be a very poor indicator of the state of oxygenation of an uncompromised baby following birth.\n【save__datas】\t【7898】\tOptimal management of oxygen during neonatal resusci-tation becomes particularly important because of the evidence that either insufficient or excessive oxygenation can be harmful to the newborn infant. Hypoxia and ischemia are known to result in injury to multiple organs. Conversely there is growing experimental evidence， as well as evidence from studies of babies receiving resuscitation， that adverse out-comes may result from even brief exposure to excessive oxygen during and following resuscitation.\n【save__datas】\t【7899】\tPulse Oximetry\n【save__datas】\t【7903】\tAdministration of Supplementary Oxygen\n【save__datas】\t【7906】\tPositive-Pressure Ventilation (PPV)\n【save__datas】\t【7907】\tIf the infant remains apneic or gasping， or if the heart rate remains <100 per minute after administering the initial steps， start PPV.\n【save__datas】\t【7908】\tInitial Breaths and Assisted Ventilation\n【save__datas】\t【7909】\tInitial inflations following birth， either spontaneous or as-sisted， create a functional residual capacity (FRC).47-50 The optimal pressure， inflation time， and flow rate required to establish an effective FRC when PPV is administered during resuscitation have not been determined. Evidence from ani-mal studies indicates that preterm lungs are easily injured by large-volume inflations immediately after birth.51，52 Assisted ventilation rates of 40 to 60 breaths per minute are commonly used， but the relative efficacy of various rates has not been investigated.\n【save__datas】\t【7912】\tEnd-Expiratory Pressure\n【save__datas】\t【7914】\tAlthough positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) has been shown to be beneficial and its use is routine during\n【save__datas】\t【7916】\tAssisted-Ventilation Devices\n【save__datas】\t【7918】\tLaryngeal Mask Airways\n【save__datas】\t【7920】\tEndotracheal Tube Placement\n【save__datas】\t【7921】\tEndotracheal intubation may be indicated at several points during neonatal resuscitation：\n【save__datas】\t【7922】\t· Initial endotracheal suctioning of nonvigorous meconium-stained newborns\n【save__datas】\t【7923】\t· If bag-mask ventilation is ineffective or prolonged\n【save__datas】\t【7924】\t· When chest compressions are performed\n【save__datas】\t【7925】\t· For special resuscitation circumstances， such as congenital diaphragmatic hernia or extremely low birth weight\n【save__datas】\t【7926】\tThe timing of endotracheal intubation may also depend on the skill and experience of the available providers.\n【save__datas】\t【7927】\tAfter endotracheal intubation and administration of intermittent positive pressure， a prompt increase in heart\n【save__datas】\t【7930】\tChest Compressions\n【save__datas】\t【7931】\tChest compressions are indicated for a heart rate that is<60 per minute despite adequate ventilation with supple-mentary oxygen for 30 seconds. Because ventilation is the most effective action in neonatal resuscitation and because chest compressions are likely to compete with effective ventilation， rescuers should ensure that assisted ventilation iSbeingdelivered optimally beforestarting chest compressions.\n【save__datas】\t【7937】\tMedications\n【save__datas】\t【7938】\tDrugs are rarely indicated in resuscitation of the newly born infant. Bradycardia in the newborn infant is usually the result of inadequate lung inflation or profound hypox-emia， and establishing adequate ventilation is the most important step toward correcting it. However， if the heart rate remains <60 per minute despite adequate ventilation(usually with endotracheal intubation) with 100% oxy-gen and chest compressions， administration of epinephrine or volume expansion， or both， may be indicated. Rarely， buffers， a narcotic antagonist， or vasopressors may be useful after resuscitation， but these are not recommended in the delivery room.\n【save__datas】\t【7939】\tRate and Dose of Epinephrine Administration\n【save__datas】\t【7941】\tThe recommended IV dose is 0.01 to 0.03 mg/kg per dose. Higher IV doses are not recommended because animal86，8877and pediatric88，899studies show exaggerated hypertension， decreased myocardial function， and worse neurological function after administration of IV doses in the range of 0.1 mg/kg. If the endotracheal route is used， doses of 0.01 or 0.03 mg/kg will likely be ineffective. Therefore， IV administration of 0.01 to 0.03 mg/kg per dose is the preferred route.

Once adequate ventilation and circulation have been established， the infant should be maintained in， or transferred to an environment where close monitoring and anticipatory care can be provided.\n【len<10_filter】\t【7947】\tNaloxone\n【save__datas】\t【7948】\tAdministration of naloxone is not recommended as part of initial resuscitative efforts in the delivery room for newborns with respiratory depression.

Studies indicate that parents desire a larger role in decisions to initiate resuscitation and continue life support of severely compromised newborns. Opinions among neonatal providers vary widely regarding the benefits and disadvantages of aggressive therapies in such newborns.\n【save__datas】\t【7956】\tWithholding Resuscitation\n【save__datas】\t【7958】\tA consistent and coordinated approach to individual cases by the obstetric and neonatal teams and the parents is an important goal. Noninitiation of resuscitation and discontin-uation of life-sustaining treatment during or after resuscita-tion are ethically equivalent， and clinicians should not hesi-tate to withdraw support when functional survival is highly unlikely.103 The following guidelines must be interpreted according to current regional outcomes：\n【save__datas】\t【7962】\tAssessment of morbidity and mortality risks should take into consideration available data， and may be augmented by use of published tools based on data from specific popula-tions. Decisions should also take into account changes in medical practice that may occur over time.\n【[www.com]_filter】\t【7963】\tMortality and morbidity data by gestational age com-piled from data collected by perinatal centers in the US and several other countries may be found on the Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) website (www.aap.org/nrp). A link to a computerized tool to estimate mortality and morbidity from a population of extremely low-birth-weight babies born in a network of regional perinatal centers may be found at that site. However， unless conception occurred via in vitro fertilization， techniques used for obstetric dating are accurate to only ±3 to 4 days if applied in the first trimester and to only ±1 to 2 weeks subsequently. Estimates of fetal weight are accurate to only ±15% to20%. Even small discrepancies of 1 or 2 weeks between estimated and actual gestational age or a 100-to 200-g difference in birth weight may have implications for survival and long-term morbidity. Also， fetal weight can be misleading if there has been intrauterine growth restriction， and outcomes may be less predictable. These uncertainties underscore the impor-tance of not making firm commitments about withholding or providing resuscitation until you have the opportunity to exam-ine the baby after birth.\n【save__datas】\t【7964】\tDiscontinuing Resuscitative Efforts\n【save__datas】\t【7966】\tStructure of Educational Programs to Teach Neonatal Resuscitation\n【save__datas】\t【7968】\tDisclosures\n【save__datas】\t【7969】\tGuidelines Part 15： Neonatal Resuscitation Writing Group Disclosures\n【len<10_filter】\t【7970】\tWriting\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| GroupMember  |  |  |  |  | Ownership  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| GroupMember  | Employment  | Research Grant  | Other Research Support  | Speakers' Bureau/ Honoraria  | Interest  | Consultant/ Advisory Board  | Other  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| .lohn  | University of Virg in ia-Professor  | None  | None  | None  | None  | None  | None  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Kattwinke  | of Pediatics  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Jeffrey M  | Weill Cornell-Professor of  | +NIH-NIH- Improving antimicrobial  | None  | None  | None  | NOne  | None  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Perlman  | Pediatrics  | prescribing practices in the NICU  |  |  |  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Khalid Aziz  | University of Alberta- Associate Professor of Pediatrics  | NOne  | None  | None  | None  | None  | NoRe  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Christopher  | Mayo Clinic-physician  | Non  |  |  | None  | None  | NoRe  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Colby  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Karen Fairchik  | University of Virginia Health System-Associate Professor of  | None  | None  | None  | None  | None  | None  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  | Pediatrics  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| .lohn Gallagher  | Dniv.

Outcome from cardiac arrest is a function of many factors including the willingness of bystanders to perform cardiopulmonary resus-citation (CPR)， the ability of rescuers to integrate knowledge and psychomotor skills， the quality of performance delivered by individual rescuers and teams， and the efficiency and effectiveness of post-cardiac arrest care.\n【save__datas】\t【8134】\tThe Chain of Survival is a metaphor used to organize and describe the integrated set of time-sensitive， coordinated actions necessary to maximize survival from cardiac arrest. The use of evidence-based education and implementation strategies can optimize the links of that chain.\n【save__datas】\t【8135】\tStrengthening the Chain of Survival in the prehospital setting requires focus on prevention and immediate recogni-tion of cardiac arrest， increasing the likelihood of high-quality bystander CPR and early defibrillation， and improving re-gional systems of care. In the hospital setting， organized efforts targeting early identification and prevention of dete-rioration in patients at risk can decrease the incidence of cardiac arrest. The challenge for resuscitation programs is twofold： to ensure that providers acquire and maintain the necessary knowledge， skills， and team behavior to maximize resuscitation outcome； and to assist response systems in developing， implementing， and sustaining an evidence-based Chain of Survival.\n【save__datas】\t【8136】\tMaximizing survival from cardiac arrest requires improve-ment in resuscitation education and the implementation of systems that support the delivery of high-quality resuscitation and postarrest care， including mechanisms to systematically evaluate resuscitation performance. Well-designed resuscita-tion education can encourage the delivery of high-quality CPR. In addition continuous quality improvement processes should close the feedback loop and narrow the gap between ideal and actual performance. Community- and hospital-based resuscitation programs should systematically monitor cardiac arrests， the level of resuscitation care provided， and outcomes. The cycle of measurement， benchmarking， feed---connect--【8137】back， and change provides fundamental information neces-sary to optimize resuscitation care and maximize survival.\n【save__datas】\t【8138】\tThis chapter reviews key educational issues that affect the quality of resuscitation performance and describes major implementation and team-related issues shown to improve outcomes. The information is organized into four major categories： willingness to perform CPR， educational design， improving resuscitation quality， and issues related to imple-mentation and outcomes.\n【save__datas】\t【8139】\tWhile important concepts identified in the 2010 Interna-tional Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) and American Heart Association (AHA) evidence evaluation process are applied below，l，2 this document does not include all education， implementation， and team-related topics con-\n【save__datas】\t【8141】\tWillingness to Perform\n【save__datas】\t【8142】\tWithout immediate initiation of CPR， most victims of cardiac arrest will die. Bystander CPR can significantly improve survival rates from cardiac arrest，3 but recent evidence indicates that only 15% to 30% of victims of out-of-hospital arrest receive CPR before EMS arrival.4 Strategies to increase the incidence of bystander-initiated CPR and the use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are addressed in this section.\n【save__datas】\t【8144】\tCommonly cited reasons for reluctance to perform lifesaving maneuvers include concern for injuring the victim，5-7 fear of performing CPR incorrectly，6，8-11 physical limitations， 12 fear of liability， l2 fear of infection， l or victim characteristics.13-16Opportunities exist to overcome many of these barrers through education and encouragement to perform when the bystander is faced with a victim in cardiac arrest.\n【save__datas】\t【8145】\tIn a study of actual bystanders interviewed following a 911call in which the EMS dispatcher encouraged performance of CPR， nonresponders most frequently cited panic (37.5%) and\n【save__datas】\t【8146】\tThe American Heart Association requests that this document be cited as follows： Bhanji F， Mancini ME， Sinz E， Rodgers DL， McNeil MA， Hoadley\n【save__datas】\t【8147】\tTA， Meeks RA， Hamilton MF， Meaney PA， Hunt EA， Nadkarni VM， Hazinski MF.

Although the precise number of trained volunteers needed to optimize the chance that a specific victim will receive CPR is not known， it is reasonable to assume that maximizing the number of people trained in a community and providing instructions and encouragement at the time an event occurs will improve the odds that a bystander will engage in resuscitation efforts.\n【save__datas】\t【8165】\tEducation Design\n【save__datas】\t【8166】\tEvidence-based guidelines for instruction， as well as the development of cost-effective courses， are required to im-prove training of providers and ultimately improve resusci-tation performance and patient outcomes.\n【save__datas】\t【8167】\tCourse Design\n【save__datas】\t【8173】\t·Objectives-Based - Cognitive，87 psychomotor，88 and affective objectives89should be included in all courses.\n【save__datas】\t【8175】\t●Contextual - Adult learning principles92 should be applied to all ECC courses with emphasis on creating relevant training scenarios that can be applied practically to the learners' real-world setting， such as having hospital-based leamers practice CPR on a bed instead of the floor.\n【save__datas】\t【8178】\t· Assessment - Evaluative strategies should assess competence and promote learning.

Basic skills have been shown to deteriorate when assessed at 1 to 6months24，27，165-167 or 7 to 12 months168，169 following training. Advanced life support providers demonstrated similar decays in knowledge or skills when assessed at 3 to 6 months，165，170-1787tO12 months，179，180 and more than 12 months.181 These studies were heterogeneous with respect to participant com-position， course length， course format， instructor type， and frequency of participant involvement in actual resuscitations. The majority reflected teaching methodologies in use prior to the most recent AHA course design updates in 2005.\n【save__datas】\t【8201】\tIn one study a 2-hour class was sufficient for participants to acquire and retain BLS skills for an extended time period， provideddabrief re-evaluation was performed after 6months.182 Four studies showed minimal or no deterioration of skills or knowledge at 6，79 12，183，184 or 17 months185 after course completion.\n【save__datas】\t【8203】\tFurther research is needed to determine if modifications to initial training will alter the decay curve of CPR skills. Additional research is also needed to determine what time interval， mechanism of assessment， and method for refresher trainingwill minimize decay in CPR skills. Innovative concepts to reduce the decay of skills and knowledge may include continuous maintenance of competency programs that employ frequent short-duration interactions with content and skills after an initial course， or they may include guided debriefings after real-life events that focus on response improvement.\n【save__datas】\t【8205】\tImproving Resuscitation Skills\n【save__datas】\t【8206】\tChecklists/Cognitive Aids\n【save__datas】\t【8207】\tThe quality of resuscitation is a major determinant of patient outcome.

Two British officers， Peter Shep-herd and Francis Duncan， are said to have been the first to expand the concept to civilians and to develop the first curriculum in first aid.4 Organized training in civilian first aid began in the United States in 1903 when Clara Barton， president of the Red Cross， formed a committee to establish instruction in first aid among the nation’s industrial workers， where， under dangerous conditions， accidents and deaths were all too frequent.\n【save__datas】\t【8663】\tThe Evidence Evaluation Process\n【save__datas】\t【8664】\tThe International First Aid Science Advisory Board first identified 38 questions in first aid practice that either were not raised in previous evidence evaluations or were in need of updating. Two or more board members volunteered to review the scientific literature independently and develop an evidence-based review worksheet summarizing the literature relevant to each question (see Part 2：“Evidence Evaluation and Management of Potential or Perceived Conflicts of Interest\"). After each worksheet was presented to， and re-viewed by， the full board， a summary draft of the scientific evidence and a treatment recommendation were crafted. The evidence-based review for each question was presented and discussed a second time at a subsequent board meeting. All first aid worksheets， co-copyrighted by the American Heart Association and the American Red Cross， can be viewed through hyperlinks in the 2010 American Heart Association and American Red Cross International Consensus on First Aid Science with Treatment Recommendations. Each ques-tion， evidence-based review， draft summary of science， and draft treatment recommendation was presented， discussed， and debated on 2 separate occasions until a consensus was reached.

In reviewing the medical literature， members of the International First Aid Science Advisory Board once again found a paucity of evidence to guide first aid interven-tions. Very little research is being conducted in first aid， and many of the following recommendations are extrapolated from the experience of healtheare professionals. It is impor-tant to recognize the limitations of the evidence that supports many of these guidelines so that research can be undertaken and future guidelines can be based on a larger body of scientific evidence.\n【save__datas】\t【8706】\tDefinition of First Aid\n【save__datas】\t【8707】\tWe define first aid as the assessments and interventions that can be performed by a bystander (or by the victim) with minimal or no medical equipment. A first aid provider is defined as someone with formal training in first aid， emergency care， or medicine who provides first aid. First aid assessments and interventions should be medically--connect--【8708】sound and based on scientific evidence or， in the absence of such evidence， on expert consensus. Administration of first aid must not delay activation of the emergency medical services (EMS) system or other medical assistance when required. We strongly believe that education in first aid should be universal： everyone can learn first aid and everyone should.\n【save__datas】\t【8709】\tThe scope of first aid is not purely scientific； it is influenced by both training and regulatory issues. The defi-nition of scope is therefore variable， and should be defined according--connect--【8710】to--connect--【8711】circumstances. need.and regulatory requirements.\n【save__datas】\t【8712】\tCalling for Help\n【save__datas】\t【8713】\tA first aid provider must be able to recognize when help is needed and how to get it. First aid providers should learn how and when to access the EMS system， how to activate the on-site emergency response plan (ERP)， and how to contact the Poison Control Center (see “Poison Emergen-cies”below).\n【save__datas】\t【8714】\tPositioning the Victim\n【save__datas】\t【8715】\tAs a general rule a victim should not be moved， especially if you suspect， from the victim’s position or the nature of the injury， that the victim may have a spinal injury (see“Spine Stabilization” below). There are times， however， when the victim should be moved：--connect--【8716】e If the area is unsafe for the rescuer or the victim， move the victim to a safe location if it is safe to do so.\n【save__datas】\t【8717】\t· If the victim is face down and is unresponsive， turn the victim face up.\n【save__datas】\t【8720】\tThe evidence for a benefit to raising the feet is extrapolated from leg raising studies on volume expansion； there are no studies on the effect of leg raising as a first aid maneuver for shock. The results of the volume expansion studies are contradictory with some showing an increase in cardiac output，1-13 while others show no change in cardiac output or mean arterial pressurel4-18 with leg raising.\n【len<10_filter】\t【8721】\tOxygen\n【save__datas】\t【8722】\tThere is insufficient evidence to recommend routine use of supplementary oxygen by a first aid provider for victims complaining of chest discomfort19，20 or shortness of breath21\n【save__datas】\t【8724】\tMedical Emergencies\n【save__datas】\t【8725】\tBreathing Difficulties\n【save__datas】\t【8727】\t· The victim states that he or she is having an asthma attack or symptoms associated with a previously diagnosed breathing disorder， and the victim has the prescribed medications or inhaler in his or her possession.\n【save__datas】\t【8729】\tFirst aid providers should become familiar with inhalers so that they can assist a victim with an acute asthma attack in using the inhaler.\n【save__datas】\t【8730】\tAnaphylaxis\n【save__datas】\t【8733】\tIn retrospective studies35-37 18% to 35% of patients having signs of anaphylaxis required a second dose of epinephrine if symptoms persisted or progressed after the first dose. Because of the difficulty in making a diagnosis of anaphylaxis27-30，38，39 and the potential harm from epi-nephrine if the diagnosis is incorrect，40-43 first aid provid-ers are advised to seek medical assistance if symptoms persist， rather than routinely administering a second dose of epinephrine.

Cardiac chest discomfort is often described as “crushing”or“pressing”and is often accompanied by shortness of breath or perspiration. But cardiac chest discomfort may not have these classical characteristics， especially in women. Call EMS immediately for anyone with chest discomfort. Do not delay and do not try to transport the patient to a healthcare facility yourself.\n【save__datas】\t【8743】\tInjury Emergencies\n【len<10_filter】\t【8744】\tBleeding\n【save__datas】\t【8745】\tControl of bleeding is a basic skill of first aid and one of the few actions with which a first aid provider can critically influence outcome.\n【save__datas】\t【8746】\tDirect Pressure\n【save__datas】\t【8748】\t·Manual pressure on gauze or other cloth placed over the bleeding source.

Thermal burns may result from burning clothing that is in contact with the skin or from electric current traversing a portion of the body. When current traverses the body， thermal burns may be present at the entry and exit points and along its internal pathway. Cardiopulmonary arrest is the primary cause of immediate death from electrocu-tion.100 Cardiac arrhythmias， including ventricular fibrilla-tion， ventricular asystole， and ventricular tachycardia that progresses to ventricular fibrillation， may result from exposure to low- or high-voltage current.l01 Respiratory arrest may result from electric injury to the respiratory center in the brain or from tetanic contractions or paralysis of respiratory muscles.\n【save__datas】\t【8766】\tOnce the power is off， assess the victim， who may need CPR， defibrillation， and treatment for shock and thermal burns. All victims of electric shock require medical assess-ment because the extent of injury may not be apparent.\n【save__datas】\t【8767】\tSpine Stabilization\n【save__datas】\t【8768】\tThere is approximately a 2% risk of injury to the cervical spine after blunt trauma that is serious enough to require spinal imaging in an emergency department，102，103 and this risk is tripled in patients with craniofacial injury.104 Most victims with spinal injuries are males between the ages of10 and 30 years. Motor vehicles cause approximately half\n【save__datas】\t【8770】\tIf the cervical spine is injured， the spinal cord may be unprotected， and further injury (secondary spinal cord injury) could result from stresses to the cord that occur when the victim is manipulated or moved. This could result in permanent neurological damage including quad-riplegia.106，107 Only one controlled but underpowered study with some methodological problems 108 has examined this question. In the study， the group of injured victims with spinal immobilization by emergency medical technicians using equipment failed to show any neurological benefit compared with a group of injured victims without spinal immobilization.\n【save__datas】\t【8772】\tFirst aid rescuers cannot conclusively identify a victim with a spinal injury， but they should suspect spinal injury if an injured victim has any of the following risk factors(these have been modified slightly from the 2005 Ameri---connect--【8773】can Heart Association and American Red Cross First Aid\n【save__datas】\t【8774】\tGwidelines103，109-114)：\n【save__datas】\t【8775】\t· Age ≥65 years\n【save__datas】\t【8776】\t· Driver， passenger， or pedestrian， in a motor vehicle， mo-torized cycle， or bicycle crash\n【save__datas】\t【8777】\t· Fall from a greater than standing height\n【save__datas】\t【8778】\t· Tingling in the extremities\n【save__datas】\t【8779】\t· Pain or tenderness in the neck or back\n【save__datas】\t【8780】\t· Sensory deficit or muscle weakness involving the torso or upper extremities\n【save__datas】\t【8781】\t· Not fully alert or is intoxicated\n【save__datas】\t【8782】\t·Other painful injuries， especially of the head and neck\n【save__datas】\t【8783】\t· Children 2 years of age or older with evidence of head or neck trauma\n【save__datas】\t【8784】\tMusculoskeletal Trauma\n【save__datas】\t【8785】\tSprains and Strains\n【save__datas】\t【8786】\tSoft-tissue injuries include joint sprains and muscle contu-sions.

Cooling is best accomplished with a plastic bag or damp cloth filled with a mixture of ice and water； the mixture is better than ice alone.121-123 Refreezable gel packs do not cool as effectively as an ice-water mixture.124，125 To prevent cold injury， limit each application of cold to periods≤20 minutes.126-128 If that length of time is uncomfortable， limit application to 10 minutes.129 Place a barrier， such as a\n【save__datas】\t【8789】\tFractures\n【save__datas】\t【8791】\tHuman and Animal Bites\n【save__datas】\t【8793】\tSnakebites\n【save__datas】\t【8796】\tJellyfish Stings\n【save__datas】\t【8797】\tThis section is new to the First Aid Guidelines.

First aid includes rest， cooling off， and drinking an electrolyte-carbohydrate mixture， such as juice， milk， or a commercial electrolyte-carbohydrate drink.176-185 Stretching， icing， and massaging the painful muscles may be helpful. Exercise should not be resumed until all symptoms have resolved.\n【save__datas】\t【8820】\tHeat exhaustion is caused by a combination of exercise-induced heat and fluid and electrolyte loss as sweat. Signs and symptoms may start suddenly and include： nausea， dizziness， muscle cramps， feeling faint， headache， fatigue， and heavy sweating. Heat exhaustion is a serious condition because it can rapidly advance to the next stage， heat stroke， which can be fatal. Heat exhaustion must be vigorously treated by having the victim lie down in a cool place， taking off as many clothes as possible， cooling the victim with a cool water spray， and encouraging the victim to drink cool fluids， preferably containing carbohydrates and electrolytes.\n【save__datas】\t【8821】\tHeat stroke includes all the symptoms of heat exhaustion plus signs of central nervous system involvement， including dizziness， syncope， confusion， or seizures. The most impor-tant action by a first aid provider for a victim of heat stroke is to begin immediate cooling， preferably by immersing the victim up to the chin in cold water.186-189 It is also important to activate the EMS system. Heat stroke requires emergency--connect--【8822】treatment with intravenous fluids. Do not try to force the victim to drink liquids.\n【len<10_filter】\t【8823】\tDrowning\n【save__datas】\t【8825】\tRemove the victim rapidly and safely from the water， but do not place yourself in danger. If you have special training， you can start rescue breathing while the victim is still in the water 95 providing that it does not delay removing the victim from the water. There is no evidence that water acts as an obstructive foreign body， so do not waste time trying to remove it with abdominal or chest thrusts. Start CPR and， if you are alone， continue with about 5 cycles (about 2 minutes) of chest compressions and ventilations before activating EMS. If 2 rescuers are present， send 1 rescuer to activate EMS immediately.\n【save__datas】\t【8826】\tPoison Emergencies\n【save__datas】\t【8827】\tIf the patient exhibits any signs or symptoms of a life-threatening condition， (eg， sleepiness， seizures， difficulty breathing， vomiting) after exposure to a poison， activate the EMS immediately.\n【save__datas】\t【8828】\tPoison Control Centers\n【[www.com]_filter】\t【8829】\tThere are many poisonous substances in the home and worksite. It is important to understand the toxic nature of the chemical substances in the environment and the proper protective equipment and emergency procedures in case of toxic exposure. The Poison Help hotline of the American Association of Poison Control Centers (800-222-1222) is an excellent resource in the United States for information about treating ingestion of， or exposure to， a potential poison. Further information is available at www.aapcc.org.

By controlling the breath and holding the body in steady poses， or asanas， yoga creates harmony. Yoga consists of five key elements： beneficial exercise， correct breathing， complete relaxation， balanced diet， and positive thinking. The asanas help ease tension， tone internal organs， and improve flexibility.\n【global_filter】\t【69】\tYoga helps create a flexible body coupled with a relaxed but focused mental state， able to tap into the full depths of its potential.\n【global_filter】\t【71】\tTo maximize the benefits of yoga practice， hold postures steady for several breaths， reaching for a deeper stretch on each.\n【lens_filter】\t【74】\tThe aim of yoga practice is--connect--【75】to improve suppleness and strength. Each posture is pertormed slowly in fluid movements. Jerky movements should be avoided. because they produce a buildup of lactic acid， which causes fatigue. It is also important to take into account your existing fitness and stamina. Yoga postures can be modified to make them safe for people of all abilities.\n【lens_filter】\t【77】\tYogic breathing techniques maximize--connect--【78】oxygen levels in your blood. Correct breathing is achieved through proper execution of the asanas， so be aware of the position of your chest， ensuring that you are connecting to the movement of the diaphragm. Deep exhalations also force stale air from the lungs， and breath control facilitates the calming of， and greater ability to focus， the mind.\n【global_filter】\t【80】\t4 It is most beneficial to begin and end each yoga sess ion with relaxation. You should also take a little time to relax between asanas. Relaxation sequences apply pressure to those areas of the body that are tense， massaging them in a similar way to acupressure to release the tension held there.\n【global_filter】\t【82】\tThe yoga definition of true relaxation is the point at which the body consumes the minimum amount of energy required to exist.\n【lens_filter】\t【84】\tIn yoga， much importance--connect--【85】is placed on the value of--connect--【86】positive thinking in sustaining mental well-being. Through meditation and relaxation， yoga aims to clear the mind of negativity， while at the same time using positive affirmations to increase self-esteem. Some people think this is difficult to achieve， but practicing yoga will eventually bring you to a state of mental harmony and serenity.\n【global_filter】\t【88】\tBy channeling your thoughts in a positive direction， you will be better able to unlock your creative potential.\n【lens_filter】\t【90】\tThe recommended yogic--connect--【91】diet is very much in line with current ideas about healthy eating. It is a simple， wholesome vegetarian way of eating， comprised of natural foods that are easy to digest： fresh fruit and vegetables， dairy products， nuts， and legumes. It is also important to eat in moderation and only when hungry， taking time to chew tood properly.\n【global_filter】\t【93】\tAs much as possible， make the healthy choice， by favoring natural fresh ingredients over processed and canned foods.\n【lg1_filter】\t【95】\tLeft unchecked， toxins build up in the body，--connect--【97】leading to lethargy. Many yoga postures massage the internal organs that are involved in the elimination of waste products. This helps flush out toxins， thereby increasing vital nourishment to the organs and making your body function far more efficiently.\n【global_filter】\t【98】\tPracticing yoga can help the nervous system release blocked energy channels and activate healing. Postures that twist or bend the neck are particularly effective for putting the body into a restorative， healing mode. This state is also activated through the relaxation brought about by yogic\n【global_filter】\t【100】\tConsuming the right foods is an important--connect--【101】part of bringing the mind and body into harmony. Foods that are beneficial to us are said to be Sattvic， or pure. Impure foods that can upset our physical， emotional， or intellectual balance are identified as being in the categories Tamasic (stale or rotten) and Rajasic (stimulating)； foods that fall into these categories should be avoided by those following the yogic philosophy.\n【global_filter】\t【104】\tAlcohol contains fermented products， introducing toxins into the body and--connect--【105】overexciting the mind.\n【global_filter】\t【106】\tConsequently， it is both Tamasic and Rajasic. Improve vour mental clarity and physical well-being by avoiding alcohol.\n【lens_filter】\t【107】\tRemove all alcohol from your diet\n【gram_filter】\t【108】\tClockwise from top： Sattvic， Rajasic， and Tamasic\n【global_filter】\t【110】\tTamasic foods include： meat and fish：mushrooms； and products that have been frozen， preserved， or canned. Rajasic items include： onions and garlic； tobacco； eggs； coffee and tea； strong spices； and chocolate.\n【lens_filter】\t【112】\tTobacco is another product--connect--【113】that is both Rajasic and\n【lens_filter】\t【114】\tTamasic. By giving up--connect--【115】smoking you will eliminate toxins from your body， helping you achieve a calm mind and body.\n【lens_filter】\t【117】\tYoga postures flex and--connect--【118】extend each section of the--connect--【119】spine to help it regain its inherent flexibility. Each of the vertebrae goes through the full range of movement in all directions， although to varying degrees depending on the pose. The increased mobility of the intervertebral disks reduces injuries， since there is less strain on movement. The postures work on toning and strengthening the muscles that support the back， giving additional support to the spine.\n【global_filter】\t【121】\tThe benefits of this pose (see p.39) include strengthening of the back and thighs， as well as improving your posture.\n【lens_filter】\t【122】\tBring left thigh\n【global_filter】\t【124】\tThis posture (see p.57) helps relieve tension in the back. The twisting motion helps in the revitalization of the abdominal organs.\n【lens_filter】\t【125】\tTit head back--connect--【126】and look up\n【global_filter】\t【128】\tYoga asanas flex and extend difterent sections of the spine to varying--connect--【129】degrees in order to develop spinal flexibility. The poses that offer the most obvious benefits for the spine include back and forward bends and twists. Such postures help maintain and restore the spine's support network， such as the ligaments that bind vertebrae together， spinal joints， and the disks between the vertebrae， as well as the surrounding muscles.\n【save__datas】\t【131】\tYoga poses help correct any abnormal curvatures of the spine that may have developed through poor posture.\n【save__datas】\t【132】\tThoracic vertebrae extend from--connect--【133】base of neck to bottom ofrib cage\n【save__datas】\t【134】\tFused sacral vertebrae connect to--connect--【135】pelvic girdle and assist walking--connect--【136】and running\n【save__datas】\t【137】\tLast five vertebrae fuse to form--connect--【138】tailbone or coccyr， which aids balance\n【save__datas】\t【140】\tA flexible spine nourishes the cerebrospinal fluid that surrounds the spinal cord and allows prana， or vital energy， to flow freely throughout the body.\n【save__datas】\t【142】\tThe cornerstone of yoga is learning to hold your body in line. Consider the body--connect--【143】as a single unit that is segmented into eight--connect--【144】parts—head， torso， arms， forearms， hands， thighs， legs， and feet—and remember that the straight line can be horizontal， vertical， or angled， depending on the particular yoga posture you are attempting.\n【save__datas】\t【146】\tRaise arms straight up，--connect--【147】palms facing inward\n【save__datas】\t【148】\tTry to create a mind-map， or“internal mirror，\" of your body. Use this to realign the body by working slowly up， from the toes to the head. Make tiny adjustments until you feel grounded and centered. Become aware of your breathing pattern as you ease into correct alignment.\n【save__datas】\t【149】\tTilt head back slightly\n【save__datas】\t【150】\tInhale as you lift arms\n【save__datas】\t【153】\tIn everyday life， many activities work or emphasize one part or side of the body. However， for balance and--connect--【154】harmony， it is important to keep all body parts equally strong. That is why in yoga the same exercises are repeated on both sides of the body.\n【save__datas】\t【156】\tThis yoga exercise (see p.30) is perfect for helping achieve spinal alignment， as well as for improving your posture.\n【save__datas】\t【158】\tFor children， yoga--connect--【159】is a great way to develop self-awareness. self-control， and powers of concentration. If you have kids， encourage them to join you in your yoga practice. They are likely to be flexible even if they lack stamina. However， the latter will increase with regular sessions.\n【save__datas】\t【161】\tChildren have a natural curiosity and desire to mimic， so they will probably be intrigued enough by your yoga to want to join in.\n【save__datas】\t【163】\tPracticing yoga during--connect--【164】the prenatal period can be--connect--【165】a valuable learning experience. Also， it can help ease your pregnancy， as well as the delivery. Work slowly and gently， allowing the poses to relax and strengthen the body and to help it adjust to the changes that are happening within. However， talk to your instructor about which poses should not be attempted while pregnant.\n【save__datas】\t【167】\tYogic breathing exercises-always important-come into their own during pregnancy， helping you make the most of your breath.\n【save__datas】\t【169】\tThere is no age limit for yoga， in part because it is noncompetitive and you work at your own pace. Done correctly， there is no risk of injury， and regular practice helps maintain good health and mobility. Additionally， yoga stimulates circulation and reduces the effects of arthritis.\n【save__datas】\t【170】\tDon’t let advancing years deter you\n【save__datas】\t【172】\t19Many yoga asanas help relieve stress by--connect--【173】releasing tension that has built up in your body.\n【save__datas】\t【174】\tBreathing exercises and meditation are also--connect--【175】helpful， since they relax the body and calm the mind. Mental tranquillity can be further encouraged by avoiding stimulants.\n【save__datas】\t【176】\tCalm the mind--connect--【177】with breathing--connect--【178】and meditation\n【save__datas】\t【180】\tJust as relaxing the body and mind--connect--【181】helps get you ready for your yoga practice， your regular sessions make it easier for you to maintain a relaxed state in general-and easier to achieve that relaxed state when you are teeling the stresses and strains of daily lite. The warm-up exercises on pp.26-29 are a great start， but see also the poses in Chapter 5， as well as the cool-down relaxation on pp.64-65.\n【save__datas】\t【182】\tYoga helps you connect to yourself\n【save__datas】\t【184】\tBecause yoga should be--connect--【185】practiced on an empty stomach， early mornings or evenings tend to be the best times， but you need to consider what suits you best. Morning practice awakens the body and eases stiffness by lubricating the joints and energizing the muscles. Digestion is stimulated and mental alertness is increased， ready for a productive day. Conversely， evening yoga can help counter the stresses of the day， improving the quality of your sleep. Whichever you choose， setting aside a regular time is good for establishing a routine.\n【save__datas】\t【187】\tYou don't need a special room or fancy equipment for yoga， but there are some--connect--【188】things to consider when choosing a practice place. Ideally， opt for a private area away from distractions. If that area is spacious， even better， since this can have a positive effect on the mind and， therefore， help you relax. Try to personalize the space， too， because this can also calm the mind.\n【save__datas】\t【190】\tIdeally your space should be lit by natural light and have some form of ventilation. The floor should be level. firm， and nonslip.\n【save__datas】\t【192】\tIt you are lucky enough to be near a quiet， flat open space， take advantage of it. Lay down your mat， and greet the day with open-air yoga.\n【save__datas】\t【194】\tRegardless of how small or large your class， it is always best to have your yoga practice supervised by a qualified teacher at least until you are confident. This is the only--connect--【195】way to learn how to ease your body correctly into and out of the asanas， as well as how to breathe correctly when holding a pose. Your teacher will also make sure you do not strain your limbs.\n【save__datas】\t【198】\tYoga's portability means that， once you have some experience， you will be able to practice the postures in the comfort of your own home. Indeed， your teacher--connect--【199】may even suggest that you work at home with some of the simpler asanas or with the relaxation techniques.\n【save__datas】\t【204】\tBefore you undertake any yoga practice， first take the time to understand your body，--connect--【205】bearing in mind any factors that might affect its pertormance， such as recent surgery， pregnancy， or medical conditions.\n【save__datas】\t【207】\tWhile in an asana， check for any tension and try to relax it with your breathing.\n【save__datas】\t【210】\tIt is important to know what your body's limits are and--connect--【211】not to force yourself to go beyond them. There is no rush； yoga is completely noncompetitive. Continue your regular yoga sessions and you will find your body becomes more flexible with time.\n【save__datas】\t【212】\tRegardless of age， yoga--connect--【213】is perfectly appropriate for everyone. Nevertheless， as with any physical exercise， if you have any medical concerns or conditions， it is a good idea to check with your doctor before beginning a class.\n【save__datas】\t【215】\tYoga equipment will keep you safer and more--connect--【216】comfortable while you practice. Some pieces， such as blocks and straps， can also be used to help you achieve poses that would otherwise be beyond your capabilities， as you continue to work on expanding your level of flexibility. Props and supports can also extend the time you can hold a pose with proper body alignment.\n【save__datas】\t【218】\tThe equipment you are most likely to need or find useful in your yoga practice comprises：\n【save__datas】\t【219】\t·Slip-resistant mat\n【save__datas】\t【220】\t·Block， usually foam\n【len<10_filter】\t【222】\t·Cushion\n【len<10_filter】\t【223】\t·Towel\n【save__datas】\t【224】\tMost yoga teachers will have equipment for use in classes， but it is all affordable enough to make it worth investing in your own.\n【save__datas】\t【227】\tWhatever you wear for your yoga sessions should be comfortable and must allow complete freedom of movement. Ideally， you would practice in bare feet， but socks are fine. If practical to do so， also remove any dangling jewelry before beginning your session because it may distract or anhoy you.\n【save__datas】\t【231】\t.

A yoga journal can also act as a means of reinforcing your practice so you can more easily tailor it to your own needs.\n【save__datas】\t【248】\tAlthough yoga is not a competitive pursuit， it can be fun and rewarding to set your own goals in a yoga journal.\n【save__datas】\t【250】\tIt's important when--connect--【251】practicing any discipline--connect--【252】to have a way of tracking progress. As well as keeping a yoga journal， a good method of self-assessment is to listen to your body. This requires practice and concentration， but once you are attuned to your body， you will be able to identify the benefits of your practice.\n【save__datas】\t【256】\tWhen you first start yoga， you will almost certainly experience some stiffness and soreness in the joints. This shows--connect--【257】you are working areas that may have been neglected.\n【save__datas】\t【258】\tBuilding flexibility in these parts requires patience and commitment. If you find a specific pose hard， practice a modified version until you can progress.\n【save__datas】\t【260】\tForward bends and other standing postures may be beyond your reach to perform correctly when--connect--【261】you first attempt them.

Lying on your back， place your hands on either side of your navel. Feel how the abdomen expands as you inhale and contracts as you exhale. By breathing slowly and deeply you are able to take air into the--connect--【274】lowest parts of your lungs， while also exercising your diaphragm.\n【save__datas】\t【276】\t37Inhalation can be used to lengthen and expand within an asana， while exhalation helps release deeper into the pose. Careful and progressive work within postures will allow for a full， easy-flowing breath， which is a crucial indicator of how well the asana is being executed. In this respect， the breath and asana practice must work together.\n【save__datas】\t【277】\tInhalation Exhalation\n【save__datas】\t【279】\tBefore beginning a yoga session， make sure you are fully warmed up. Carry out the exercises shown in Tips 39-46. You should also take some time to practice your breathing--connect--【280】techniques (see Tips 36 and 37). Mastering breath control will allow you to breathe more deeply， enable you to position yourself correctly in the yoga asanas， and assist you in holding the poses.\n【save__datas】\t【282】\tThis series of exercises is purely for the eyes， so be sure not to move the head or neck while doing them.

As you exhale， breaths before releasing.\n【save__datas】\t【641】\tAlign head to\n【save__datas】\t【642】\tSit cross-legged and well rooted， with-your right ankle in front of the left. Hinge forward from the waist， setting your palms on the floor. Exhale and lean forward.\n【save__datas】\t【645】\tAsanas and breathing exercises help build core and overall--connect--【646】muscular strength and flexibility. They also improve reflex responses while developing a calm， focused mind and profound bodily awareness. This all leads to better balance and poise， both physically and mentally. Balance is improved by working the body through a range of different postures. With consistent， mindful yoga practice， the body gradually becomes better poised. Combine your practice with meditation to balance yourself mentally as well as physically.\n【save__datas】\t【648】\tThis pose helps aid balance through concentration， by building strength and flexibility in the leg muscles. Start standing with the feet together， and--connect--【649】inhale as you transfer your body weight onto your left foot.\n【save__datas】\t【650】\tBend the right knee and place your right foot on the inside of the left leg， using your right hand to position it as high as is comfortable.\n【save__datas】\t【651】\tPush down through--connect--【653】your left leg and breathe deeply， finding your point of balance. Inhale， and bring your hands to the prayer pose.\n【save__datas】\t【654】\t3and， inhaling， extend your arms up， touching your palms together. Take a complete breath， then come out of the pose and repeat on the other side.\n【save__datas】\t【656】\tThis hip-opening， standing posture requires you to use not strength but concentration and balancing skills.\n【save__datas】\t【657】\tPress patms--connect--【658】together over head\n【save__datas】\t【660】\tPress palmsCenter your head\n【save__datas】\t【662】\tThis asana helps strengthen the core and so promotes centering--connect--【663】together--connect--【664】and alignment. The joints are nourished by increased blood flow.\n【save__datas】\t【665】\tKeep torso--connect--【666】completely vertical\n【save__datas】\t【667】\tFrom a standing pose， bend your knees slightly and balance on the left foot. Cross the right thigh over your left， hooking the right foot behind it.\n【save__datas】\t【668】\t2Lift your arms with the elbows bent. Wrap your right arm and hand under and around the left， pressing the palms together. Repeat on the right.\n【save__datas】\t【669】\tTake the time to carefullv3 adjust your position， with the aim of making your back as straight as possible. Then take the left leg from the wall and point it straight up.--connect--【671】increasing the supply of blood to the--connect--【672】face and brain， as well as to the--connect--【673】heart and other organs. Such postures are particularly restorative. This pose is good for improving circulation.\n【save__datas】\t【674】\tBend your knees， so your feet are flat to the wall and shins parallel to the floor. Pushing off from your feet， raise your torso and place your hands on the small of your back.\n【save__datas】\t【675】\tRoll over by--connect--【676】rotating along--connect--【677】lower back\n【save__datas】\t【678】\tBring your right leg4beside the left， adjusting your hands for extra support.

Gently drop the legs sideways until your knees reach the floor. Rest for a few breaths， then sit up.\n【save__datas】\t【681】\tQuite a lot of the yoga postures that are good for balance tend to start from--connect--【682】a standing position. However， Cat Balance begins on the floor. Practice this asana to develop your core and strengthen your arms and legs. Repeat each step five times， alternating limbs.\n【save__datas】\t【683】\tPosition yourself on all fours， with wrists directly below the shoulders and knees under the hips. Point your toes. Draw your navel toward the spine to flatten your back.\n【save__datas】\t【686】\t87The cool-down atter your yoga practice is an important component of the session， so be sure not to rush or skip it. It will calm your mind and relax your muscles， but it also allows your body to absorb the energy that has been released through the various yoga postures， thereby maximizing the value of the session.\n【save__datas】\t【688】\tAssume the Corpse pose (see pp.66-67)， then physically tense and relax all the muscles in your body， one body part at a time. Start at the--connect--【689】toes and work your way up. Once you have finished， start at the toes again and mentally relax all those same muscles. Last of all， take a few moments to relax your mind.\n【save__datas】\t【690】\tKeep feet apart--connect--【691】and turned out\n【save__datas】\t【693】\tThe yoga cool-down， or relaxation stage， is more of a mental exercise than a physical one. This is because it requires--connect--【694】you to send mental messages to your body parts， instructing them to tense and relax. Once that is done， you finish the cool-down by relaxing your mind， too.\n【save__datas】\t【695】\tTake time to relax your mind\n【save__datas】\t【697】\tYour end-of-session relaxation is based on the\n【save__datas】\t【698】\tCorpse pose， which should also be employed--connect--【699】at the beginning of your yoga practice. Relax--connect--【700】fully by resting in this position for at least five minutes.\n【save__datas】\t【702】\tWhile in Corpse pose，--connect--【703】allow your breath to be full--connect--【704】and easy. Wiggle the fingers and toes， gradually waking up the body. Bend your knees， keeping your feet on the ground. Draw the knees to your chest， hug them in， and gently roll from side to side. Roll on to one side and push yourself up into a seated position. End by bringing the hands to prayer pose.\n【save__datas】\t【705】\tKnees bent， with feet on the ground\n【save__datas】\t【707】\tJust as it is important to warm up the eyes before--connect--【708】your yoga session (see p.26)， you should also take the time to cool them down after your practice.\n【save__datas】\t【709】\tSitting comfortably， with your back straight， rub your hands together until they begin to warm up a little.\n【save__datas】\t【710】\tClose your eyes. Breathing easily， place\n【save__datas】\t【712】\t\\-your hands over your eyes for several minutes， completely obscuring your vision.\n【save__datas】\t【714】\tThe Corpse pose is the ideal way to end your yoga sessions， as well as being a good start to your workouts. It allows the body the time to absorb all of the good muscle and mind work--connect--【715】that has been done during your practice time， letting released energy flow freely and expelling waste products from the muscles. It helps you relax in preparation for the rest of your day.\n【save__datas】\t【718】\tIn this extended version of the classic Corpse pose， the full length of the body is held in alignment and completely supported by the floor. This allows for deep relaxation in all of the muscles.\n【save__datas】\t【719】\t1Lie with knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Interlock your fingers behind your head. Lift the head to look forward toward your knees.\n【save__datas】\t【720】\tLie fully extended， with--connect--【722】eyes closed if you want. Starting from your feet， work up the body， breathing any tightness out of your muscles.\n【save__datas】\t【723】\tInhale as you raise3 your right leg by about1ft (30cm). Tense the right leg， keeping everything else relaxed. Hold， then lower and switch legs.\n【save__datas】\t【724】\tArch the upper back to士lift the chest， pulling the shoulder blades in. Keep the head and bottom on the floor. Hold for one breath. then release.\n【save__datas】\t【725】\tThe following postures can be tagged on to your Corpse pose relaxation at the end of your yoga session， or you can pick and choose the steps that you think would most benefit--connect--【726】you on any given day， focusing on the areas that feel most tense.\n【save__datas】\t【727】\tInhale， raising your1 arms by about 1ft(30cm). Tense both arms， making fists with your hands. Hold for one breath. and exhale to lower.\n【len<10_filter】\t【728】\tInhal\n【save__datas】\t【730】\t)Ine to raise both arms， palms up and fingers apart.

Rest for a few minutes.\n【save__datas】\t【734】\tAt the end of your5 relaxation， bend your knees and roll to one side. Rest a while， then use the hands to push the upper body off the floor and into a kneeling position.\n【save__datas】\t【736】\tAlthough meditation is perfectly suited to everyone， it is particularly beneficial for those who have busy lives， either because of stressful jobs or because of a vast array of family--connect--【737】and household commitments. Meditation helps calm the overactive mind， thereby reenergizing you， increasing your stamina， and improving your powers of concentration. Through the regular use of meditation， it is within your grasp to create a sense of inner peace and have a clear mind.\n【save__datas】\t【739】\tYou are free to meditate--connect--【740】wherever you are comfortable， but there are some considerations to bear in mind. If you choose to meditate indoors， pick a room that is warm， clutter-free， and away from distracting noises. If you go outside， find somewhere with as little activity as possible but where you are sate and able to relax fully. Meditation can be practiced at any time of day or night， but it is easier to train your mind if you are able to set a regular time slot.\n【save__datas】\t【742】\tA good way to grasp--connect--【743】the real essence of true meditation is to consider a lake. Think about how you can clearly see the bottom of the lake when the surface is still. However， when there are a lot of waves， you are unable to see much below the surface at all. This is the perfect analogy for the mind： when your mind is still， you are better able to experience inner calm.\n【save__datas】\t【745】\tYou do not have to meditate alone. It can be done in pairs or even in larger groups. Mass meditations are often held around the world.\n【save__datas】\t【747】\tTo allow yourself to--connect--【748】meditate correctly--connect--【749】without any distractions it is important to take a comfortable sitting pose. Your legs should be crossed， and your spine should be straight. Keep your shoulders straight but relaxed. This is an easy， natural pose for children， but adults may require some assistance. If you feel any tension in your lower back， try sitting on the front edge of a cushion.\n【save__datas】\t【751】\tCorrect breathing is a key part of meditation--connect--【752】and concentration. First， oxygenate your brain with 5 minutes of deep abdominal breathing. Next， slow down but still breathe rhythmically， in for 3 seconds， then out for 3 seconds.\n【len<10_filter】\t【753】\tHAND101\n【save__datas】\t【755】\tThe hand positions shown below are all--connect--【756】used in meditation.

This information compilation， set in an orderly fashion， is what allows us to enjoy its lecture.\n【cont_pre_fil】\t【183】\tNow then， when we review books， we can come across some that we read only once and some that have become part of our reference library， those we always keep at hand for per-manent consultation. In my opinion，\"1，001 tips for orthodontics and its secrets\" will be one of those books that upon opening will introduce us in the basic biomechanical principles that we always must keep in mind. Then， in the second chapter we can appreciate how the management of anchorage is a fundamental part of treatment， it plays a preponderant role in the different mechanics that are exposed and how we can vary the type of anchorage depending upon the necessities of each case in particular， exemplified with the different auxiliaries that allow us to obtain our objectives， from minimal anchorage to the use of mini implants for the consecution of the almost utopist absolute anchorage.\n【cont_pre_fil】\t【184】\tIn later chapters we can relish upon the superb exposition of different techniques that will help us make decisions in the solution of different problems， from space closure， passing through the therapeutic focuses of open and closed bites， the treatment of anterior and posterior cross bites， dental and skeletal through the polemic distalization.\n【cont_pre_fil】\t【185】\tThe different types of habits， their probable causes and the effects they can produce， and the varieties of appliances that can be used for their interception are exposed， from the well known crib to the modern trainer.\n【cont_pre_fil】\t【186】\tA subject not frequently mentioned in orthodontic books refers to lesions and urgency treatments that may happen during orthodontic treatment and how to manage them mechanically and therapeutically. The subject is well managed in this text and clearly orients the professional about a series ofeveryday problems that may be encountered and sometimes we do not have at hand the alternative of a solution，\n【cont_pre_fil】\t【187】\tAnd ending with one of the most important treatment phases in the success of any treat-ment， there is “Retention， where we can find different techniques from the classic Hawley to the most modern and recent retention systems.\n【cont_pre_fil】\t【188】\tIn few words， the content of this book is an arsenal with the best secrets to lead us through and to a successful treatment； it is all written here， now its up to the reader to take ad-vantage of this superb text.\n【cont_pre_fil】\t【189】\tOscar Quiros A.\n【cont_pre_fil】\t【190】\tHead professor， Dean of the orthodontic post grade program， and Chairman of the undergraduate orthodon-tic program of Facultad de Odontologla de la Universidad Central de Venezuela.\n【cont_pre_fil】\t【191】\tPreface--connect--【192】he book 1，001 Tips For Orthodontics and its Secrets has been written in a simple--connect--【194】and didactic way for easy reading and understanding， ideal for the dental student， orth-odontic resident or specialist. The book has a stock of more than 1，000 clinical photographs in which we explain \"different methods to do the same thing\" meaning that we point out many ways to close， open or uncross a bite. We include different molar distalizers，how to provide anchorage or how to close spaces； in this manner， multiple treatment options are shown for an identical problem， orthodontic or orthopedic in nature.\n【cont_pre_fil】\t【195】\tOur book consists of ten chapters， which we will describe briefly：\n【cont_pre_fil】\t【196】\tChapter 1. Action and reaction. In an informative and straightforward approach we：\n【cont_pre_fil】\t【197】\tDescribe how and why teeth move orthodontically， and the effects at bone and dental levels.\n【cont_pre_fil】\t【198】\tThe three laws of Newton and their clinical application during orthodontic treatment.\n【cont_pre_fil】\t【199】\tA simple and easy description on how to understand the physics laws that we utilize in an orthodontic treatment. The use of forces， resultant forces， coplanar forces， center of resistance，center of rotation， moment， types of dental movements and their physiology， dental equilibrium and first， second and third order bends are clearly explained.\n【cont_pre_fil】\t【200】\tChapter 2. Anchorage. In this chapter we examine the different types of anchorage utilized during orthodontic treatment， such as when to use minimal， moderate， maximum or absolute anchorage， their advantages， disadvantages and recommendations for each one.\n【cont_pre_fil】\t【201】\tChapter 3. Space closure in orthodontics. We present a whole array of different modalities for dental space closure， from the classical elastic chain to the use of coils， wire bends and retroligatures. We also describe the forces produced by each of these additions， in the case they can be used， the advantages， disadvantages and recommendations of each one.\n【cont_pre_fil】\t【202】\tChapter 4. Deep bite. Description of the different types of deep bites and their etiology， and the possible treatment plans for correction. We mention here why and how to use a bite plane， the use of bite ramps， bypass， why should braces be bonded near the incisal edge to help correct this problem， when to use an intrusion bend or a Tip back， how to use and how can reverse curves help us to correct a deep bite， the use of in-block intru-sion arch wires like the intrusion arch of Dr. Oscar Quiroz， the utility arch wire， the CIA and intrusive arches with loops. All these additions have advantages， disadvantages and recommendations， which are clearly explained.\n【cont_pre_fil】\t【203】\tChapter 5. Open bite. This is one of the most difficult types of malocclusions to treat because it has a high relapse rate. As in the deep bite chapter， we describe the different causes and the different types of open bite， and their possible treatments. We discuss how we use in block extrusion bends or in an individual manner the benefits of palatal plates and the advantages of using reverse curves on the maxilla and a curve on the mandible in order to close an anterior open bite； why brace bonding near the gingival margin helps us， cases in which we can use an individual or In block By-pass， the use of an inverted--connect--【204】tip back， the treatments in which we must place cribs or reminders for tongue habits and cases that require tongue or maxillary surgery.\n【cont_pre_fil】\t【205】\tChapter 6. Cross bite. In this chapter we will analyze the different methods of correction of anterior and posterior cross bites， and their etiology. We review in a meticulous manner the ideal moment to implement orthopedic appliances for the correction of a cross bite， in which we mention the Face Mask， the Modified Tandem， the mini maxillary protrac-tor， the Camacho Badillo regulator， the Tandem Loop， the Quad Helix， the Hass and the Hyrax. We also present various orthodontic options to correct a cross bite， like the use of the forward arch wire， the lingual bonding of braces， the overlay， inverted NiTi arch wires and crossed elastics. We mention all the advantages， disadvantages and indications for these additions.\n【cont_pre_fil】\t【206】\tChapter 7. Distalizers. This is one of the most controversial topics in orthodontics today because these appliances can provoke alterations in the temporomandibular joint. This type of appliances are used in cases where we want to avoid bicuspid extractions. There is an arsenal of distalizers like the CEOB-1， open coils， the Vlock distalizing technique， the GG distal spring， repellant magnets， the pendulum， pendex， distal jet， the Cetlin plate， the K-loop，the Veltri distalizer and the Belussi distalizer. We mention the facial and dental characteristics of the patients that are candidates for this therapy modality； we also cover the advantages， disadvantages and indications for each distalizer.\n【cont_pre_fil】\t【207】\tChapter 8. Habits. Early detection of a habit in our patients may help us solve many prob-lems and avoid future headaches. So， in this chapter， we propose different appliances in order to correct habits， like cribs， punchers， tridents， labial shields and trainers. Each one of these has advantages， disadvantages and indications which we mention here.\n【cont_pre_fil】\t【208】\tChapter 9. Lesions and emergencies during orthodontic treatment. In this chapter we--connect--【209】mention the possible solutions (analgesics， vibratory stimuli and laser) in order to avoid or diminish pain provoked by dental movement.\n【cont_pre_fil】\t【210】\tOrthodontic and orthopedic appliances tend to retain great amounts of dentobacterial plaque， which can provoke gingival problems； so we give alternatives in order to diminish this inconvenience， and in case they are present， how to eliminate them in a simple way with the use of dental pastes， tooth brushes， creams and topical gels.\n【cont_pre_fil】\t【211】\tChapter 10. Retention in orthodontics. The success of an orthodontic treatment is based on retention. We cannot place the same retainer in all finished cases， that is why in this chapter we present various retainers (removable， fixed and invisible ones) and their differ-ent uses， advantages， disadvantages and indications. Among the removable retainers we mention the Hawley， the circumferential retainer， the elastic circumferential retainer， the Van der Linden retainer， the Sarhan， the spring aligner and the Coregg. Amid the esthetic retainers we will analyze the Osamu retainer， The Essix \"A， Essix \"C+ and the reinforced Essix. Finally we will analyze the prefabricated fixed retainers and the made-to-fit on the patient fixed retainers.\n【save__datas】\t【212】\tWe are very proud to present this book， but what is really rewarding to us is the fact that the book was developed largely by our residents and ex residents of Centro de Estudios de Ortodoncia del Bajio (CEOB)， who，thanks to their enthusiasm， brotherhood and support， have turned into a great family.\n【len<10_filter】\t【213】\tContents\n【cont_filter】\t【214】\tChapter 1.

If these two objectives are fulfilled the orthodontist will have the foundations to perform a satisfactory and efficient treatment. These biomechanical principles are contemplated within a part of Engineering called Mechanics， which describes the effect of forces on objects (teeth and bone) divided in three areas：\n【len<10_filter】\t【648】\tStatic\n【save__datas】\t【650】\tKinetics.\n【save__datas】\t【651】\t3\\. Materials Resistance.\n【save__datas】\t【652】\tStatic describes the effect of forces over still objects at a constant speed (in a straight line).\n【save__datas】\t【653】\tKinetics describes the behavior of objects that suffer shift ing speeds (acceleration and deceleration).\n【save__datas】\t【654】\tAnd finally， Materials Resistance describes the relation between force and tension among these， allowing us to select the ideal materials in order to apply a force.\n【save__datas】\t【655】\tThe basis oforthodontic treatment consists in the clinical application of biomechanical concepts. The term Bio-mechanics refers to the part of Mechanics that studies movement in relation with biological systems， Biome-chanical principles explain the mechanisms ofaction of the orthodontic appliances and of the force system utilized for dental movement. Common sense use of these concepts will lead to obtain more predictable， efficient and stable treatments，(4.11，14)\n【save__datas】\t【656】\tThe Mechanics principles and Static design are universal for all orthodontic appliances and do not change with time. When the physical principles of fixed or remoy-able appliances are understood， it is possible then to have enough knowledge to build and place a determined appliance. Whoever gets to understand how these physics principles work， will be able to design， select--connect--【657】and use orthodontic appliances for greater benefit of the patient.\n【save__datas】\t【658】\tMany different designs in appliances， methods， and phi-losophies are used， but we use forces in all of them， without them orthodontics would not exist. 13)\n【save__datas】\t【659】\tIn 1686， Newton presented the fundamental laws of Me chanics， their applications and results，( The three laws of motion are the following：\n【len<10_filter】\t【660】\t1.\n【len<10_filter】\t【662】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【663】\tThe law ofacceleration： The change in motion is pro---connect--【664】portional to the motive force impressed and is made in the direction of a straight line in which the force is impressed.) In orthodontics we can apply diverse forces with different intensities； it all depends on the tooth that we want to move.(13) Said in another way， we can affirm that teeth move in the direction of the applied force， the larger the root volume， the larger the force that has to be exerted to produce physiologic movement，(16)\n【len<10_filter】\t【665】\t3.\n【save__datas】\t【666】\tThe law ofaction and reaction： To every action there--connect--【667】is always opposing and equal reaction The\"secret\"in orthodontics is to minimize or eliminate the num-ber of secondary or collateral effects of treatment； for this to happen they must be understood and clearly identified.(13.14)\n【save__datas】\t【668】\tThese three laws offer evident benefits to the orthodontist and the patient. If applied in a convenient manner， therapy efficiency can improve； thus，rapid and painless treatments with negligible damage to teeth and supporting tissues can be achieved with less collateral damage and more pleasing and durable results，(14)\n【save__datas】\t【669】\tOrthodontic appliances have a similar function as phar-maceuticals have in medicine. They both need an ac-curate diagnosis to be able to define an exact treatment. In medicine， the physician makes a diagnosis and then selects the proper medication to accomplish his goals. In orthodontics， the orthodontist must make his diagnosis and then select the best appliance design to reach his objectives. In pharmacology， medicines are used to act upon cells， tissues and specific organs. In orthodontics moments and forces are used to act upon cells and specific tissue that support teeth and bone. The collateral effects of medicines are unavoidable and must be well managed. Secondary effects are also produced during tooth move-ment and should also be recognized and managed with care， When such effects are known beforehand， precau-tion measures can be taken to counter these harmful effects， which in some instances can be managed to our benefit. Finally， in orthodontic appliances as in medicine the efficiency depends upon the degree of cooperation of the patient.\n【save__datas】\t【670】\tWhat is force?\n【save__datas】\t【671】\tForce is an action exerted by a body (wire， coil， elastic， etc.) over another body (teeth or bone). It expresses itself as mass times acceleration (mass x acceleration) and is a vector that presents：\n【save__datas】\t【672】\t1 Intensity (measured in g).\n【save__datas】\t【673】\tSense/Direction (straight or angular). The latter is included between the straight line and an axis of reference.\n【save__datas】\t【674】\t3\\. Modulus (sense or direction of the force).(13)\n【save__datas】\t【675】\tA force is also defined asa vector with magnitude and direction. The correct unit for force expression is the Newton (N). But in orthodontics forces are expressed normally in g. The conversion factor from g to Newtons is 1g=0.00981N，or1N=101.937g.(1.14)\n【save__datas】\t【676】\tThis vector is graphically defined by an arrow， indicating the direction of the force (bucco-lingual， mesio-distal，etc.) and the line of action， (where the force is going). The force direction (from buccal to lingual， from mesial to distal， etc.)--connect--【677】is defined by the point of the arrow. The vector also shows us the force magnitude that is proportional to the length of the body of the arrow； the point of force application is indicated by the origin or tail of the arrow. (11.14)\n【save__datas】\t【679】\tThe units employed in orthodontics are force and distance. Force is defined， as previously mentioned， as the action of a body (wire) over another body (tooth) that changes or tends to change the way the second body moves， due to a push or traction. In the metric system it is measured in g or g x mm， depending if it is considered shear force or force times surface unit (pressure).\n【save__datas】\t【680】\tSometimes we do not work in orthodontics with a single force， frequently two or more elements add up.\n【save__datas】\t【682】\tIn these cases we can use the Parallelogram law， which determines the resultant of two forces applied over the same point.(14)\n【save__datas】\t【683】\tWhat is the center of resistance?\n【save__datas】\t【684】\tThe center of resistance is the point a force has to pass through in order to move an object freely in a linear man-ner. Said in another way， every free body has a point known as mass center，therefore， every time that the line of action of a force passes through de mass center of a free body will suffer a translation movement，(11，14)\n【save__datas】\t【685】\tA. tooth in the mouth is not a free body because periodon-tal support tissue does not let it move freely. The center of resistance is equivalent to the mass center for free bodies. Any force that acts through the center of resistance of a tooth makes it translate in a bodily manner.(111)\n【save__datas】\t【686】\tThe center of resistance of a tooth depends on the length and morphology of the root， the number of roots and the level of support of the alveolar bone.\"\n【save__datas】\t【687】\tThe center of resistance for a single root tooth with a nor-mal level of alveolar bone is situated between the middle and cervical third part of the root， meanwhile in a multiple root tooth the center of resistance is located at one or two millimeters apical from the furcate.(1114)\n【save__datas】\t【688】\tBecause braces can only be bonded on the crowns of teeth， there are very few opportunities in which it is pos-sible to apply a force that can act through the center of resistance of the tooth to produce pure dental translation(excepting power arms. Please refer to the Space Closure chapter).\n【save__datas】\t【689】\tWhat is the Center of Rotation?\n【save__datas】\t【693】\tThe center of rotation of a tooth is the arbitrary point lo cated at a distance from the center of resistance on which a tooth is going to turn around if a force is applied.\n【save__datas】\t【694】\tThe center of rotation can be very close， but it will never coincide with the center of resistance. In orthodontics， when the rotational process occurs along the larger axis of the tooth it is called rotation or first order dental move-ment (in-out movement).\n【save__datas】\t【695】\tWhen rotation occurs around the mesiodistal axis it is called angulation or second order dental movement (Tip).--connect--【696】if it happens around the buccolingual axis， it is called torque or third order movement. ()\n【save__datas】\t【700】\tWhat is a moment?--connect--【703】and the center of resistance of the tooth. This distance (in a perpendicular way) is the cause of moment in the tooth， giving dental rotation as a result.(5The measur-ing unit for a moment is g x mm\"and the graphic representation is a curved arrow that in 2-dimensional diagrams can be drawn clockwise or anticlockwise.(4)\n【save__datas】\t【704】\tEvery force that passes through the center of resistance will not produce a moment； furthermore， the body will translate with-out any type of rotation； the greater the distance between the center of resistance to the line of force， the greater the moment that will be produced.\n【save__datas】\t【708】\tDental movement physiology\n【save__datas】\t【709】\tDental movement is produced as a result of a biological response to the physiologic reaction toward forces applied by our mechanical procedures. So when we design our--connect--【710】appliances it is very important to evaluate the forces that they will generate during treatment， (2)\n【save__datas】\t【712】\tBlood vessels are responsible for the periodontal ligament nourishment， and will provide a way of access for the cells responsible of bone remodeling. Existing nerve endings will transmit pressure sensation and proprioception. Peri-odontal fibers and interstitial fluids will provide together， during brief time periods， an effective physiologic force dissipater and shock absorption system.)\n【save__datas】\t【713】\tWhen a force is applied to a tooth， it dislocates itself in the interior of the alveolar space， stretching some periodontal fibers and compressing other periodontal fibers. Simulta-neously， the liquid that fills the spaces between the fibers is compressed against the bone walls provoking a hydraulic resistance to tooth movement.3At this moment， the load is transferred to the alveolar bone and due to its porosity， the interstitial liquid drains toward neighboring tissues， diminishing the hydraulic pressure. This way， the root gets even closer to the alveolar wall， compressing the peri-odontal ligament closer to the side the force was applied--connect--【714】upon and stretching the ligaments on the opposing side. The vascular system， that occupies 50% of the periodontal space， is compressed， and makes circulation difficult on the tension and compression areas.(1)\n【save__datas】\t【715】\tAt this moment， an inflammatory tissue response is pro-duced increasing blood vasodilatation and promoting prostaglandin production in order to increase blood ir-rigation， stimulating the exit of monocytes that will fuse with one another， by doing this， multinuclear cells called osteoclasts will be originated， these are responsible for cortical alveolar resorption whenever periodontal liga-ment is compressed. On the side where distention of the periodontal ligament fibers is occurring， undifferentiated mesenchyma cells transform into osteoblasts and fibro-blasts， which are responsible of forming bone tissue and collagen fibers respectively. When blood flow is limited， teeth do not move or they move slowly. Intense forces may limit the physiologic response and can affect the rate of dental movement，(12)\n【save__datas】\t【716】\tDental movement begins two days after the force is applied. This movement stimulates osteoclasts and osteoblasts to begin the bone remodeling process with apposition on the periodontal fiber tension side and resorption on the compressed periodontal ligament side. Slowly the alveolus dislocates in the direction of the applied force， with orth-odontic movement as a consequence.(14)\n【save__datas】\t【717】\tBrian Lee， following the works by Storey and Smith， evalu-ated the optimal force for canine retraction. In his study he proposed that 200 g/cm of exposed root surface to movement was the optimal pressure to apply In order to obtain an efficient dental movement(7)\n【save__datas】\t【718】\tTaking into consideration that force times surface unit is defined as pressure， the force applied must differ depend-ing on the size of the root surface and the direction of the planned movement.\n【save__datas】\t【719】\tThe mesiodistal size of the root surface is evaluated when the tooth is moving in an anteroposterior direction. The buccolingual size of the root surface is evaluated if the tooth is going to be moved in a transverse direction. When intrusion or extrusion ofteeth is planned， the cross section of the root surface is evaluated.(12)\n【save__datas】\t【720】\tAccording to Ricketts， the optimal force for dental movement is 100 g/cm of root surface exposed to movement (please refer to Space Closure chapter. Table of Ricketts).(12)\n【save__datas】\t【721】\tTypes of dental movement\n【save__datas】\t【722】\tDental movement can be classified in many ways：\n【len<10_filter】\t【723】\t1.\n【save__datas】\t【724】\tInclination：\n【save__datas】\t【725】\ta. Uncontroled inclination.\n【save__datas】\t【726】\tb. Controlled inclination，\n【save__datas】\t【728】\tRoot displacement.\n【save__datas】\t【729】\tRotation，(1)\n【save__datas】\t【730】\t1\\. Inclination： Is the movement in which the crown of the teeth suffers greater displacement than the root of the tooth. This can be classified according to the location of the center of resistance：--connect--【731】a+ Uncontrolled inclination： This type of incli-nation happens when the center of rotation is between the center of resistance and the apex of the tooth. This movement can be obtained by any orthodontist， but is usually not wanted. This uncontrolled inclination happens when we have a round arch wire in the slot of the brace and force is applied to the tooth.(3.11.14)\n【save__datas】\t【733】\tAnother way to produce uncontrolled inclination is with the use ofelastomeric power chains in order to close spaces.\n【save__datas】\t【734】\tWhen an elastomeric power chain is placed from a molar to a canine， with a round arch， the outcome is an inclina-tion (moment) of the crowns toward the space； meanwhile the roots will become completely divergent. This happens because the force is applied on the crown， away from the center of resistance.\n【len<10_filter】\t【735】\tb.\n【save__datas】\t【736】\tControlled inclination： This is a wanted move-ment；it is obtained with the application of a force to move the crown， and the placement of a mo-ment in order to control or maintain the position of the root apex. An example of this inclination is when we want to retract the anterior sector with-out moving the location of the tooth apex. This is obtained with rectangular arch wires. When we softly insert the wire in the slot of the brace， It counteracts (torque) part of the moment caused by the dental retraction(3.11.14)\n【len<10_filter】\t【740】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【741】\tTranslation： Is one of the most difficult movements in orthodontics. It is also known as in-mass or bodily movement. Happens when the crown and the denta apex are horizontally displaced. This is only possible when the line of action of a force passes through the center of resistance of the tooth. We obtain this type of movement with the use of power arms， which allow the line of action of the force to pass directly through the center of resistance (1.3，11.14)\n【save__datas】\t【742】\tAs it was previously mentioned， translation is one of the most difficult movements to achieve in orthodontics. This is caused by the anatomical characteristics that sur-round teeth that make the application of a force through the center of resistance very difficult， so pure translation is hard to obtain. Although in a high percentage of cases， each time we want to move a tooth in a bodily manner it will not translate， instead it will tend to rotate slightly in the direction of the exerted force， because the force is away from the center of resistance of the tooth， so we will have translation and rotation of the tooth.--connect--【746】altering the incisal edge of the tooth. Root displacement is commonly used to torque incisors， to upright canine roots after space closure， upright posterior teeth that are mesially inclined，etc.(311.14)\n【save__datas】\t【748】\t3\\. Root displacement： In this movement a Momentand a force are applied to displace only the root， meanwhile the dental crown is not displaced. This is the best move-ment to alter the longitudinal axis of the tooth without\n【len<10_filter】\t【750】\t4.\n【save__datas】\t【751】\tRotation： To make this movement a couple or co-planar forces are required， which can produce a pure rotation around the longitudinal axis of the tooth(seen from the occlusal view).351114)\n【save__datas】\t【754】\tA couple is defined as two parallel forces of the same magni-tude but in opposite directions. This is the only force system capable of producing pure rotation of a body around its center of resistance.( In this case the tooth maintains its position because both forces annul each other since both lines of force act at a same distance perpendicular to the center of resis-tance， leaving only the pure Moment (pure rotation).--connect--【756】aWhat is static equilibrium?\n【save__datas】\t【757】\tIn order to have static equilibrium in an orthodontic sys-tem， three basic criteria must be met：\n【save__datas】\t【758】\t1\\. That the sum of all vertical forces that act in the system be equal to 0.\n【len<10_filter】\t【759】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【760】\tThat the sum of all horizontal forces that act in the system be equal to 0.\n【save__datas】\t【761】\t3\\. That the sum of the moments that can act in any point be equal to 0.(6，11)\n【save__datas】\t【762】\tClearly understanding the basic concepts of orthodontic biomechanics and the physiology of dental movement， we shall now analyze the different actions and reactions that can happen during the different stages of orthodontic treat-ment and select， apply and control in an efficient manner the force systems that will be utilized.\n【save__datas】\t【765】\tThe third law of Newton applies in almost all orthodontic movements； the law of Action and Reaction， which states that to every action there is always opposing and equal reaction. Sometimes the reaction to a movement results in an unwanted movement.\n【save__datas】\t【766】\tAnother example of the third law of Newton would be when we want to align intruded or extruded teeth， where the same force produced to make these movements will be applied on the surrounding teeth provoking a movement in opposite direction to the one we want to produce.\n【save__datas】\t【769】\tIn order to determine the action of a bend， we must know where we are going to put it， this way we can identify what type of forces are going to be applied and the moments we can expect with the bends on a determined group of teeth.\n【save__datas】\t【770】\tThe easiest way to determine the direction of a movement of a bend made on an arch wire is to put it in a passive manner in the slots of two braces， and we will observe where the arch is headed to， so that when we activate the wire， placing it in the slots， we can predict the direction of the movement to take place.1)\n【save__datas】\t【771】\tIn these images we can observe the direction where the arch wire is going when it is placed in the slot of the brace of the central incisor in a passive way， and what move-ments we can expect once the arch is activated. In this--connect--【772】case， as soon as we insert the arch in the slot of the brace on the lateral incisor， this tooth will be intruded and the central incisor will extrude (action and reaction： third law of Newton).\n【save__datas】\t【773】\tIn the next set of images， the same case is presented but seen from another perspective； the arch wire is passive in the slot of the lateral incisor and the bend is over the brace of the central incisor； when activated， it is going to produce the same movements，extrusion of the central incisor and intrusion of the lateral incisor.\n【save__datas】\t【776】\tBoth examples are useful in order to predict the direction of dental movements produced by the forces of the arch wire. Now we have to know where to place the bend so we can identify over which teeth we want to place the force.\n【save__datas】\t【777】\tIf a bend is located far from the center of the arch wire， we will have two segments， a short one and a long one， that will produce equal forces in different directions. Wher the short segment of the bend is inserted in the tube， the long segment will indicate us the direction of the force produced over the teeth that are going to receive this--connect--【779】segment. In this case， what is produced is what we call force equilibrium， where equal and opposed forces with different moments take place， being the greater moment the side that receives the shorter segment of the bend，(14.7)\n【save__datas】\t【780】\tOn the contrary， if the bend is located in the center of the arch wire， between both teeth， the forces that are produced cancel one another when the wire is inserted in the slot of the braces， In this case the system is in equilibrium， because the associated forces are equal and opposed and cancel each other. This type of centered bend is only going to produce equal moments that are going to oppose each other.(14.12)\n【save__datas】\t【782】\tDeep bite correction with a tip back\n【save__datas】\t【783】\tIf we utilize the tip back bend for the correction of a deep bite， it can clearly be seen that when the short segment of the bend is inserted in the molar tube， the large segment di-rects itself to the apical portion of the anterior zone(before being inserted in the slots of the braces of the incisors). This way we know that an intrusive force will be produced on the anterior zone and an extrusive force in the posterior zone，15 Another consideration that we have to mind with the placement of bends is that the short segment of the arch wire is going to represent the anchorage side， and the long segment of wire the side of no anchorage， this is due to the fact that Moment at the molar level (short part of the bend) is greater than the one that is being produced at the incisor level， making the molar much more resistant to movement.(10)\n【save__datas】\t【784】\tWhen the arch wire is activated by placing it in the slots of the incisor braces， two moments are going to be produced， one at molar level and another at the incisor level，provok-ing a differential torque on both teeth.\n【save__datas】\t【789】\tA mesial root movement and a distal crown movement is going to be produced in the molars， meanwhile since the intrusive force passes buccal to the center of resistance of the incisors， the moment is going to be lower， taking the incisor to a more buccal position.(6)\n【save__datas】\t【792】\tOnce tip and torque have expressed themselves completely at incisor and molar levels， the slight extrusion that is produced with the mesial angulation of the molar is going to aid in the correction of the deep bite together with the intrusion of the anterior segment，\n【save__datas】\t【793】\tNow then we can apply this same bend in the lower arch when the deep bite is a product of the extrusion of the anteroinferior segment，and the biomechanics of the move-ment will be exactly the same\n【save__datas】\t【798】\tIn both cases the moment that is produced in the anterior sector product of the intrusive force， projects the incisal edges of the incisors in a buccal manner increasing the arch length and correcting the deep overbite.)\n【save__datas】\t【799】\tAction taken\n【save__datas】\t【800】\t1\\.

Another effect is that the intrusive forces are going to provoke at the molar level a positive torque and a distal inclination of the crowns and a mesial movement of their roots； on the other hand the intrusive forces exercised at the incisor level will provoke a buccal movement of these (positive torque).\n【save__datas】\t【814】\tAction taken\n【save__datas】\t【815】\t1..

If we do not have the anchorage that we need， this will lead usto certain failure，so it is very important to apply all our knowledge in this subject during orthodontic treatment.\n【save__datas】\t【938】\tAnchorage can be defined as the resistance to movement that teeth show upon the application of a force. Another way to define anchorage would be the distance in mil-limeters teeth have to be displaced in order to close an extraction site.(4.19.28)\n【save__datas】\t【939】\tIn order to understand the importance of anchorage use， first we must review the mechanics of dental movement. The third law of Newton states：“To every action there is always opposing and equal reaction. In orthodontics this means that when a force is used to move a group ofteeth in a certain direction， there will always be an equal force in an opposing direction， this is why anchorage selection is so important； also important is the selection of the teeth in which we want to limit its movement， because this reciprocal force may induce the displacement of the anchored teeth.(319)\n【save__datas】\t【941】\tOrthodontic anchorage diminishes or limits the movement of the anchored teeth， but does not immobilize them. The concept that a group of teeth can maintain themselves im-mobile while another group can be displaced during the application of a force is controversial， therefore anchored teeth must not be considered static. In fact， one of the main advantages in the use of the appliances is the displacement control of anchored teeth.\n【save__datas】\t【942】\tWithin the various anatomical structures we can rely on in order to improve anchorage control we find teeth， the hard palate， alveolar bone， the occipital bone and the nape of the neck，(2B)\n【save__datas】\t【943】\tIf anchorage was not well designed or if we did not choose Se. the right type for the case， a mesial displacement of the anchored teeth will occur and the overjet will increase.(19) This is known as loss of anchorage； if it is excessive，canines will not retract enough and there will not be enough space to obtain good incisor alignment.\n【save__datas】\t【944】\tIndications for anchorage placement (7)\n【save__datas】\t【945】\t1\\. There must be good bone support and no dental mo-bility. We can check the degree of periodontal health of the teeth that will be used for anchorage support with a Panorex x-ray.\n【len<10_filter】\t【946】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【947】\tWe need healthy teeth with no caries and well adjusted restorations on which to cement anchorage.\n【save__datas】\t【949】\t3\\. We must determine the amount of dental overcrowd-ing， this way we can define the type of anchorage accordingly with the space needed. The greater the misalignment， the more anchorage will be needed.\n【len<10_filter】\t【951】\t4.\n【save__datas】\t【952】\tProfile type. The type of anchorage to be used will be determined by the dental overcrowding and the profile of the patient.\n【save__datas】\t【954】\tFactors to consider determining the type of anchorage\n【save__datas】\t【955】\t1\\. The angulations and position of the anterosuperior and anteroinferior teeth. Usually， in cases where there is biprotrusiveness or excessive proclination of--connect--【957】the anterosuperior teeth， a total control of anchor-age will be necessary. This way we can take complete advantage of the extraction spaces.\n【len<10_filter】\t【958】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【959】\tThe mandibular plane angle (high or low). The incli-nation of this angle may be modified with different extra-oral anchorage appliances (High Pull， Head Gear， and Face Bow).\n【len<10_filter】\t【962】\t6.\n【save__datas】\t【963】\tAnterior and posterior dental overcrowding discrep-ancy. Usually， for a greater degree of overcrowding， a greater degree of anchorage will be needed.\n【len<10_filter】\t【964】\t3.\n【save__datas】\t【965】\tSpee curve depth.\n【len<10_filter】\t【967】\t4.\n【save__datas】\t【969】\t5\\. Patient profile. In biprotrusive type patients we will need very good posterior anchorage in order to modify this type of profile.\n【len<10_filter】\t【971】\t7.\n【save__datas】\t【972】\tSize and form of the root. The wider the area covered by the root， higher resistance to movement the tooth will have. This is the reason why teeth with small roots， like the lower incisors， will respond faster to movement，compared with the first molars， which will need a greater force in order to be displaced. Teeth that present great resistance to movement have an elevated anchorage value； meanwhile，those that move easily have a low anchorage value. This is known as Dental Anchorage.\n【save__datas】\t【973】\tThe recommended forces for anteroposterior movements， according to Ricketts， are as follow：\n【save__datas】\t【974】\tUpper central incisor...... 50 grams.\n【save__datas】\t【975】\tUpper lateral incisor......， 40 grams.\n【save__datas】\t【976】\tUpper canine........ 75 grams.\n【save__datas】\t【977】\tFirst upper premolar...... 75 grams.\n【save__datas】\t【978】\tSecond upper premolar....... 55 grams\n【save__datas】\t【979】\tFirst upper molar.......... ..120 grams.\n【save__datas】\t【980】\tLower central incisor......... 25 grams\n【save__datas】\t【981】\tThe necessary force to move a tooth is related to the root area and the quantity of movement permitted： this is called \"affronted root surface\" described by Dr. Ricketts. He mentioned that the optimal force for tooth movement is 100 g/cm and that the teeth with the highest anchorage quantity are the first superior molars， and the teeth with the least anchorage are the central and lateral incisors. The optimal force is the one that produces dental movement without collateral adverse effects (root resoption).\n【save__datas】\t【982】\tLower lateral incisor........... .25 grams.\n【save__datas】\t【983】\tLower canine..... .75 grams.\n【save__datas】\t【984】\tFirst lower premolar........... .60 grams.\n【save__datas】\t【985】\tSecond lower premolar........... 60 grams\n【save__datas】\t【986】\tFirst lower molar....... 110 grams\n【save__datas】\t【987】\t8\\. Surrounding bone characteristics. When teeth are lo-cated within trabecular bone， they pose less resistance to move. But， when they are located in cortical bone，--connect--【988】their anchorage quantity increases because this bone is denser； laminated and much more compact， with a very limited blood supply. Blood supply is the key factor in dental movement because the physiologic resorp-tion process and the osseous apposition are delayed， so dental movement is slower(23) For this motive it is convenient that at the moment ofretracting the canines we give a vestibular torque to the molar roots in order to anchor them in the cortical bone， and in this man-ner we can limit its mesial movement. This is known as Cortical Anchorage.(8.23)\n【save__datas】\t【989】\t10.Patient facial muscles. Brachyfacial patients (short faces) have more muscle tone than dolichofacial patients (long faces)； these have weak and hypotonic facial muscles.(5In these patients teeth present less resistance to orthodontic movement. (920.27) This is called Muscular Anchorage.\n【save__datas】\t【990】\tOnce we have considered all these factors we can establish the amount and type of anchorage necessary to accomplish our treatment objectives.\n【save__datas】\t【993】\tTips to increase the amount of anchorage in the upper and lower dental arch\n【save__datas】\t【994】\t9\\. Amount of allowed movement. Teeth will move toward places where they encounter less resistance(toward extraction sites)； because of this， they in-cline toward the direction of the applied force. But if this inclination is avoided and we force the tooth to move bodily， then the force needed must be stronger， because teeth that are moved bodily present greater resistance than teeth that are free to incline.

At the same time the interstitial liquid of the fibers is also compressed against the osseous walls. As the liquid slowly drains out of the alveolus， it also exerts hydraulic resistance against the dental movement. Periodontal fi-bers and interstitial liquid act in conjunction， against the forces applied on the tooth， making it return to its original position. It is a paradox， but bone is the most malleable tissue of the human body， adapting to the forces that act upon it. It reacts by depositing osseous tissue in the areas exposed to traction forces and to resorb osseous tissue in areas where pressure is exerted.Orthodontic movement is only possible because of this malleability. This way， the root gets even closer to the alveolar wall， compressing the peri-odontal ligament on the side where the force is applied and stretching the fibers on the opposite side. Osteoclasts are responsible for cortical alveolar resorption where ligament compression occurs. In the phase where ligament disten-sion occurs， osteoblasts and fibroblasts， the cells that form bone tissue and collagen fibers， are present. Clinically， this period is characterized by moderate tooth pain submitted to pressure but without movement. Around two days after the force application， osteoclasts and osteoblasts initiate the remodeling process. Slowly the alveolus dislocates in the direction of the applied force， with the subsequent orthodontic movement.(23)\n【save__datas】\t【1582】\tBurstone defines optimal force as the one that provides a rapid dental movement， with no patient discomfort and no tissue damage (no bone loss or root resorption)， be-ing this the most physiologic orthodontic force.(23Many investigators (Storey， Smith， Brian Lee， Ricketts， among others) evaluated the optimal necessary force for dental--connect--【1583】movement； this was obtained by measuring the root sur face exposed to movement， the so called affronted root surface. Because pressure is defined as force times surface unit， the applied force must vary depending on the size of the root surface involved and the direction of the proposed movement.Brian Lee proposed 200 g/cmas the optima pressure for efficient movement， half of what Brian Lee had put forward. According to studies made by lwasaki， 60g of force produce a distal canine movement of an average of 1.23 mm per month. 16，19)\n【save__datas】\t【1584】\tRicketts clinically showed that intrusion of the inferioi incisors with utility arches is efficiently done applying 15to 20 g per tooth or 60 to 80 g for the four lower incisors upper incisors have a root surface transversal section that is almost double in size compared to the lower incisors， so the force required for intrusion is double compared to the force required for the lower incisors， approximately to 160g for all four upper incisors or 40 g per tooth.\n【save__datas】\t【1585】\tThe recommended forces for dental movement，according to Ricketts， are shown next page.(16.19)\n【save__datas】\t【1586】\tPeriodontal fibers and interstitial liquid form together a shock absorbing and physiologic force dissipating system during occlusal function and orthodontic movement When there is a rise in the orthodontic force， the periodon tal ligament will present zones with excessive pressure. In these zones， more often on the compression side， blood circulation slows or shuts down， and degeneration or ne-crosis of the periodontal fibers sets in. This phenomenon is known as hyalinization (aseptic necrosis). The greater the number of hyalinization areas present， the slower the orthodontic movement will be， therefore the greater the force is， the slower dental movement will be. Histologically speaking， during hyalinization we will observe periodon tal tissue necrosis in the compression zone， blood vessel obliteration， a diminished blood supply and anoxia (lack of oxygen) in the conjunctive tissue. Clinically we car affirm that heavy forces are pathological and they cause\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  | RickettsTable  |  |  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t|  | Anteroposterior movements.  | Transverse movements  | Intrusive and extrusive movements，  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Upper central incisor  | 50 grams  | 70 grams  | 40 grams  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Upper lateral incisor  | 40 grams  | 65 grams  | 30 grams  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Upper canine  | 75 grams  | 70 grams  | 45 grams  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Upper first premolar  | 75 grams  | 50 grams  | 30 grams  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Upper second premolar  | 55 grams  | 50 grams  | 30 grams  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Upper first molar  | 120 grams  | 135 grams  | 80 grams  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Upper second molar  |  | 105 grams  | 70 grams  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Lower central incisor  | 25 grams  | 50 grams  | 20 grams  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Lower lateral incisor  | 25 grams  | 50 grams  | 20 grams  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Lower canine  | 75 grams  | 70 grams  | 35 grams  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Lower first premolar  | 60 grams  | 60 grams  | 30 grams  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Inferior second premolar  | 60 grams  | 60 grams  | 30 grams  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Lower first molar  | 110 grams  | 105 grams  | 85 grams  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Lower second molar  |  | 95 grams  | 75 grams  |--connect--【1587】pain， dental mobility，pulpitis， root resorption and alveolar crest alterations.(3.23)\n【save__datas】\t【1588】\tOrthodontic movement in young patients presents less osseous resorption due to the great cellular element pro-liferation in the periodontal ligament and the bundles of fibers are thinner and flexible， in contrast with much older patients. Younger patients present less tissue reaction to orthodontic forces (around 2 or 3 days)， in contrast with the 8 or 10 days needed for cellular proliferation in an adult， which makes adult orthodontic movement slower. Patients with heavy complexion present reduced medullar spaces and denser cortical bone， they present a higher tendency of hyalinization and consequently a higher degree of difficulty to move teeth. Patients with hyperparathyroidism produce more osteoclasts with the subsequent bone resorption. In the same way， sexual hormones (estrogen or testosterone)， when in surplus， have an effect over bone alterations. Storey， in 1954 found erratic tooth movement related to menstrual cycle phases in young adolescents(3.23)\n【save__datas】\t【1589】\tWhen we determine the need to extract teeth in an orthodontic treatment we must consider some factors like dental overcrowding， anchorage， canine and incisor axial inclination， midline discrepancies， vertical dimen-sion， facial and dental esthetics， dental health， plus the main motive why the patient seeks consultation with an orthodontist. Space closure in orthodontic treatment can be done with two types of mechanics：\n【save__datas】\t【1590】\t1\\. Sectional or segmented mechanics， that consist in closure loops that are made on a sectioned arch. Teeth move by activation of the loop of the wire that can be designed to deliver a low load-deflection relation and a controlled moment-force relation (Burstone \"T\"loop).\n【len<10_filter】\t【1591】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【1592】\tSliding mechanics， in which braces slide either on an arch wire or the wire slides on braces and tubes. One of the main factors to differentiate between the two mechanics is friction； space closure in segmented mechanics is frictionless while sliding mechanics involves friction.(16)\n【save__datas】\t【1593】\tOrthodontic friction is produced while braces slide upon the arch wire. In order to move a tooth we must apply a force(elastics， wires， ligatures， coils， etc.) in such magnitude as to overcome friction， this way beginning dental movement. The level of friction depends on several factors， including the type of brace and arch wire used. Stainless steel braces slide with relative ease over stainless steel arch wires and not so well on wires that contain certain percentage of titanium (beta-titanium or nickel-titanium) that presenta rough surface and generate more friction； furthermore， a ceramic brace has rough surface that also increases friction. The combination of ceramic braces and stainless steel arch wires produces a great deal of friction. Adding sliding mechanics for space closure will result in a high friction coefficient and more root resorption. Recent studies have demonstrated that self-ligat-ing braces have the lowest friction coefficient，(1216)\n【save__datas】\t【1594】\tSome believe that we lose less posterior anchorage utilizing space closure in two phases (canine retraction first with subsequent incisor retraction) rather than with in-mass six anterior teeth retraction； but this may not be valid for all cases. In-mass space closure can reduce treatment time significantly because it is done in only one phase.()\n【save__datas】\t【1595】\tThe ideal force system used for space closure must meet certain characteristics， which are：\n【save__datas】\t【1596】\tProvide optimal forces for tooth movement.\n【save__datas】\t【1597】\tMust be comfortable and hygienic to the patient.\n【save__datas】\t【1598】\tMust require minimal chair time.\n【save__datas】\t【1599】\tMust require minimal patient cooperation.\n【save__datas】\t【1600】\tMust be inexpensive.\n【save__datas】\t【1601】\tAccording to Burstone， canine retraction mechanics can be described by three principle characteristics：\n【save__datas】\t【1603】\tThe main arch wire deflection.\n【save__datas】\t【1604】\tThe maximum force that the arch can withstand without permanent deformation.(927)\n【save__datas】\t【1605】\tThe final result of space closure must include aligned and upright teeth with parallel roots. This implies that denta movement almost always requires certain degree of in-mass translation and also root displacement，(16)\n【save__datas】\t【1606】\tIn this chapter we analyze four suggested ways to accom plish space closure：\n【save__datas】\t【1607】\tElastics. 3. Loops.\n【save__datas】\t【1608】\t12Coils. 4. Retroligature.--connect--【1610】a\\] Elastic chains\n【save__datas】\t【1611】\tElastic chains are made with polymers of synthetic rubber with great deformation capacity. Manufacturers make these elastics with urethane， thus producing light and constant forces with greater deformation capacity. These chains have an active lifetime of 60 days once installed in the mouth. This is because the molecular structure (molecular chain) is folded while the chain is inactive， but when the chain is extended the molecules unfold in a lineal and orderly fashion. The exposition to ozone and ultraviolet radiation breaks up the unsaturated double ligatures at molecular level， which results in flexibility reduction and less traction resistance. This is why manufacturers add antioxidants and ozone inhibitors that reduce these effects.(10，16)\n【save__datas】\t【1612】\tElastics absorb water and saliva in the mouth， which deforms permanently and destroys the chain at molecular level. These also swell and stain due to the fluids and bacteria present in saliva that fill in empty spaces of the rubber matrix. Saliva， chewing， plaque and mouth temperature have influence in the degradation rate of the force of the chain.(4-6)\n【save__datas】\t【1613】\tThe force of the elastomeric chain tends to degrade with time. Hershey and Reynolds showed a 60% force loss after four weeks； 50 % of the force loss took place the first day of use. Wong observed a loss of force of 50-70% after the first 24 hours， when the chain was kept in water at 37°.(16) In 2003 the Eastman Dental Hospital and the Queen Mary Hospital in London published a comparative study between power chain and closed NiTi coils. They compared the force and amount of space closure in millimeters--connect--【1616】between these two devices. They demonstrated that the force maintained during space closure between the chain and the closed coil was very similar； furthermore， the amount of closure of the extraction site in millimeters was very similar and there was no statistical difference. They demonstrated that the initial force of power chain was approximately 209 g while closed coils have 300 g. After a week， chains can lose almost 50% of their initial force and closed coils lose rapidly their initial force after 6 weeks of use. Weekly space closure done with the power chain was0.21 mm and with the closed coil was 0.26 mm. Therefore，--connect--【1617】there is no significant statistical difference between these two space closure methods.?\n【save__datas】\t【1618】\tThe use of power chain in big gap space closure is not recommended due to problems related with the force level. For example， chains placed from molar to molar initially exert 400 g of force in the upper dental arch and 350g in the lower dental arch. In a premolar extraction case the chain will stretch excessively upon the extraction sites； this provokes adjacent teeth rotation. If the chain is not stretched， the spaces will not close.213)--connect--【1619】higher initial force and retain more remnant force than long chains. Bell recommends stretching the elastics three times its length in order to obtain the desired force level.\n【len<10_filter】\t【1620】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【1621】\tShort chain.

The interlink distance is 3.5mm.\n【save__datas】\t【1623】\tPower chain is useful for closing one or two small spaces at the end of a treatment and to avoid space reopening in advanced treatment phases.(2.13)\n【save__datas】\t【1624】\tAccording to the distance between the center of the eyelets(interlink distance)， chains are divided in four types：\n【save__datas】\t【1625】\t1\\. Closed or continuous chain. Recommended foi lower incisor space closure. This chain has an interlink distance of 3 mm. Closed chains generally provide\n【save__datas】\t【1627】\t3\\. Long chain.

It has an interlink distance of 4.5mm and the advantage of having less holes where food can lodge into， resulting in less caries and periodontal problems，(4-6，31.35)\n【save__datas】\t【1632】\t.Space closure with elastic chain on sectioned arches\n【save__datas】\t【1633】\tThe use of elastic chains during orthodontic treatment is very common. They are usually used for space closure， but they are also very effective rotating and intruding teeth. Elastomeric chains must be used with caution because there is the risk of exerting excessive force and creating new problems.\n【save__datas】\t【1634】\tIn cases of anterior overcrowding with canines out of the alveolar bone， the way to align， level and close--connect--【1635】spaces at the same time is using one continuous arch wire and two sectional ones； the sectioned arches may be round or rectangular and are placed from molar to canine (one on the left and one on the right side). These arches will--connect--【1637】serve as “rails\" to move the canines to the extraction sites， then we can place an elastic chain from the mo-lar to the canine and begin its retraction. At the same time we place a NiTi principle arch wire (from molar to molar) to begin the alignment and leveling phase of the treatment.\n【save__datas】\t【1640】\tAdvantages\n【save__datas】\t【1642】\tTreatment time is reduced.\n【save__datas】\t【1643】\tLateral incisor intrusion is avoided while alignment is taking place.\n【save__datas】\t【1645】\tIn this case， power chain can be substituted by closed coil.\n【save__datas】\t【1646】\tDisadvantages\n【save__datas】\t【1647】\t1， If the power chain exerts excessive force， it will pro-voke undesired canine crown tip.\n【save__datas】\t【1649】\tThe chain can lose elasticity.\n【save__datas】\t【1650】\tRecommendations\n【len<10_filter】\t【1651】\t1.\n【save__datas】\t【1652】\tUse heavy sectional arches to diminish undesired canine tip.\n【save__datas】\t【1654】\tChange the chains every 3 weeks.\n【save__datas】\t【1655】\t4\\.

This way coils exert physiologic loads， that translate in accelerated dental movement and they act for longer periods of time， so they do not have to be changed that often. About biocompatibility， some authors believe that NiTi is as compatible as stainless steel； some say that NiTi is more prone to corrosion. Super elastic coils， compared to stainless steel， store more energy because they are more resilient.(18.23)\n【save__datas】\t【1823】\tStainless steel coils provide elevated initial force， which can cause discomfort in some patients， but this force rapidly dissipates with dental movement. These coils are not so resilient and tend to deform after use，(13)\n【save__datas】\t【1824】\tThe variables that affect the force level produced by the coils are： the caliber of the arch wire， the alloy， the size of the spiral， the length and magnitude of the coil activation. The less contact between the coil and the arch wire， the faster space closure and dental movement will be.(26.28)\n【save__datas】\t【1825】\tRudge and Mair compared the space closure index using elastic chain and NiTi closed coil.

So， with this type of mechanics， during space closure， we need extra control of inclination， tip and rotation. In order to obtain this， bends are added for each tooth. In advanced treatment phases these bends can be added or eliminated selectively. This space closure method has many disadvan-tages： we need a lot of time for wire bending and the forces are elevated； sliding mechanics is not so effective and the activation range is limited.(z13.34)\n【save__datas】\t【1888】\tThere are many loops designed for space closure and retru-sion of the anterior sector， of which we can mention：\n【save__datas】\t【1889】\tThe open “T\"loop.\n【save__datas】\t【1890】\tThe closed \"T\"loop.\n【save__datas】\t【1891】\tThe closed helicoid \"I\"loop，\n【save__datas】\t【1892】\tRicketts loop.\n【save__datas】\t【1893】\tBull or Keyhole loop.\n【save__datas】\t【1894】\tThe segmented “T\"loop.\n【save__datas】\t【1895】\tThe utility retraction loop.\n【save__datas】\t【1896】\tThe DKL (Double Key Loops).\n【save__datas】\t【1897】\tLoop principles\n【save__datas】\t【1898】\tPrinciple 1.

This type of arch wire can be used in the mixed or permanent dentition for intrusion or retraction of the four incisors； it is generally used during the last phases of treatment.\n【save__datas】\t【1945】\tIn premolar extraction cases， in which canines have been retracted， a space distal to the lateral incisor opens.

The sharp bends of this loop may fracture， and some portions of the wire may have zones with altered elasticity.)\n【save__datas】\t【1955】\tThis is a steel wire with two loops on each side of the wire and is used for sagittal movements of the anterior or posterior sectors in order to close extraction sites. It performs a broad range of movements with good control of the dental groups involved. DKL preformed arches of different calibers of stainless steel or TMA are available or they can be manually conformed. On each side， near the canines， it has two loops that resemble key eyelets. When this arch is installed， the loops must be equidistant mesially and distally to the brace of each canine.1))\n【save__datas】\t【1957】\tWe can find preformed DKL arches in the market in various dimensions that are adequate for different dental arches. The numerical scale is in millimeters，and measures the distance between both mesial loops with a two mil-limeters difference between sizes.\n【save__datas】\t【1958】\tScale：22 mm，24 mm， 26 mm， 28 mm， 30 mm， 32 mm，34mm， 36 mm，38 mm， 40 mm，42 mm， 44 mm， 46 mm.\n【save__datas】\t【1960】\tThe loops have 8 mm of separation between them； the wire in between is inserted in the slot of the brace leaving approximately two millimeters on each side of the brace， In some occasions due to DKL size standardization， the equidistance between the brace and the loop is not pos-sible， in those cases， we must have the precaution to choose an arch in which the mesial loop remains separated at least two millimeters from the brace of the canine in order to allow the activation，(11)\n【save__datas】\t【1961】\tDue to these characteristics， it is indispensable for the use of the DKL that the anterior sector from canine to canine to be diastema free. Sometimes it may be neces-sary to unite the 6 anterior teeth with continuous rigid ligature in order to maintain the contact points. If small diastemas develop continuous elastic chain must be used to close them before installing the arch； at this moment， the dental arch is divided in three sectors： two posterior and one anterior and in between them the extraction sites. In general the anterior group is formed by incisors and canines and includes the first canines in second premolar extraction cases.(I)\n【save__datas】\t【1962】\tIn order to place a DKL arch， the dental arches must be perfectly prepared for arch installation. The previous arch sequence must have left the teeth aligned and with torque fully expressed on each tooth. This previous sequence with rectangular arches must reach a caliber similar to the DKL in order to allow not only an easy insertion but also perfect sliding of the arch in the slots of the braces. This is an in-dispensable requisite in order to maintain good movement control of the dental groups involved.\n【save__datas】\t【1963】\tBefore we install the DKL arches， we must define the direction and the magnitude of the required movements：retraction of the anterior sector， mesial movement of the posterior sector or a combination of both movements. According to these， not only arch modifications will be made， but also the appropriate way to activate the arch will be selected so space closure can go according to our treatment plan. When the DKL is activated， the anterior key exerts a retrusion force on the anterior sector and a mesialization force on the cuspid； the second key exerts a distalizing force on the canine and a mesializing force on the posterior sector. Both forces applied on the canine are--connect--【1964】of the same intensity and in inverse direction， therefore they annul each other. The force exerted on the cuspid is zero， the 300 g should translate in a mesial movement of the posterior sector (anchorage loss)， but in reality this does not occur， because if we add up the resistance force of the first and second molars (364 g)， these are greater than the mesializing force of the key. Because of this， the retrusion force is of 64 g.(.11)\n【save__datas】\t【1965】\tActivation\n【save__datas】\t【1966】\tBecause this arch has four closure loops incorporated， it can behave as a spring or in some cases the loops will remain passive and these will be used as anchorage ele-ments for ligatures or elastic chains in case these become the active elements. In the first case， activation is made by opening the loops， pulling and cinching back the arch at the end of the molar tubes or with wire ligature tied from the molar hook to the distal loop provoking its opening.\n【save__datas】\t【1967】\tWhen the DKL is used as an anchorage device， the active element is added to it (elastic chain， ligature， etc.).\n【save__datas】\t【1968】\tDKL activation\n【save__datas】\t【1969】\tThe DKL arch can be used for space closure under two different mechanical concepts：\n【save__datas】\t【1971】\tUse as a spring.\n【len<10_filter】\t【1972】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【1973】\tUse of the arch as an anchorage element for auxiliary additions.(11)\n【len<10_filter】\t【1974】\t1.\n【save__datas】\t【1975】\tUse of the arch as a spring\n【save__datas】\t【1976】\tThis space closure manner is based on the activation of the arch by opening the loops and producing a closure force while the arch returns to its original form. This activation can take place in two ways：\n【save__datas】\t【1978】\tActivation with retroligature.\n【save__datas】\t【1979】\tA.Activation by distal traction of the arch： this is done opening the loops by pulling the arch from behind the molar tube， provoking the loop aperture that must not surpass 1 mm； the maneuver is completed by cinching the arch behind the molar tube and this way we maintain this activation.(1)\n【save__datas】\t【1981】\tThe response to activation (arch cinching) is manifested in two time periods； in the first period a crown retro-inclination occurs at the canine and incisor level. In the second period incisor and canine torque are recuperated. We must prolong the time between activations so this recuperation can occur.(I)\n【save__datas】\t【1982】\tTeeth with orthodontic treatment have a periodontal wid-ening that can absorb the tension accumulated in the loops， provoking rapid loop closure； this must not be interpreted as the desired dental movement. The resorption and ap-position process needs the persistence of the stimuli on the periodontium. The zones that first absorb the activation forces of the DKL are the palatine or lingual portion of the alveolar socket of the incisors and the distal portion of the alveolar socket of the canine， resulting in retro-inclination of these teeth. In the canine， this uprighting inclines mesially and inciselly the slot of the brace，guiding the arch in this direction and incrementing the arching of the Spee curve with intrusion of the lateral section and the extrusion of the anterior sector. This tends to create--connect--【1983】a posterior open bite and an anterior deep bite. On the other hand， due to the magnitude of its root surface， the canine will be the tooth that will take more time to recover its correct inclination.(1I)\n【save__datas】\t【1984】\tThe appropriate period between activations must oscillate between 6 and 8 weeks. Before each activation we must observe clinically if it is the right time to do it. We must bear in mind two references：\n【save__datas】\t【1985】\tThe DKL arch must not have any occlusal curving.\n【save__datas】\t【1986】\tThe cuspid must have its correct inclination.\n【save__datas】\t【1987】\tWhen the indicated time has passed， if we observe a cur-vature or if the canine is distally inclined， the arch should not be activated again. We must wait until both situations normalize. If the activations are too often， the second phase of the movement of the incisors will not occur， meaning that incisor torque and correct canine inclination will not be accomplished.(1)\n【len<10_filter】\t【1988】\tB.\n【save__datas】\t【1990】\tActivation with retroligature： another way to acti-vate this arch is with a wire ligature that spans from the hook of the buccal tube on the molar band to the distal loop of the DKL arch wire. The loops are opened with a Weingardt plier and this activation is consolidated with the ligature wire； do not bend the end of the wire behind the molar. The main difference between these two activation modes is the position assumed by the anterior portion of the arch. The trac-tion exerted by the ligature in the distogingival angle of the distal loop provokes a gingival inclination of the anterior sector of the DKL with the increment of positive torque.(1l)\n【save__datas】\t【1991】\tThis has many advantages：\n【save__datas】\t【1992】\tImproved torque recovery of the upper incisors.\n【save__datas】\t【1993】\tIt avoids anterior sector extrusion.\n【save__datas】\t【1994】\tMoves the canine distally minimizing the crown retro inclining effect.\n【save__datas】\t【1995】\tReduces the intrusion effect on the lateral sector and， associated to the anterior intrusive movement，main-tains the occlusal plane leveled eliminating forward and aft movements.\n【save__datas】\t【1996】\tWhen a lot of dental retraction is needed， the activation with retro ligature is more appropriate.\n【len<10_filter】\t【1997】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【1998】\tUse of the arch as anchorage for--connect--【1999】auxiliary elements\n【save__datas】\t【2000】\tThis is used in special cases in which we want posterior sector migration (anchorage loss). In this case the DKL arch must remain passive with the loops closed. The distal loops will be used as anchorage for the auxiliary elements， and from these loops the auxiliary elements will apply the force to the teeth of the posterior sector that we want to move.(1I)\n【save__datas】\t【2002】\tDKL arch modifications for retraction without torque；--connect--【2003】the management of the DKL has a variant when the retrac-tion movement must be accomplished without torque， movement is seldom planned for the upper dental arch， but on the contrary apt for the inferior dental arch in which the retraction movement of the anterior sector must be planned with minimal or nil torque expression due to the anatomical characteristics of the alveolar ridge of this sec-tor. To accomplish this we must wear off the arch in the--connect--【2004】anterior sector so we can eliminate the edges and this way diminish torque. Despite this， the manner and frequency of activation are the same for both cases with the objective to avoid secondary effects derived from the deepening of the Spee curve.(11)\n【save__datas】\t【2005】\tDKL modifications in order to allow mesial migra-tion of the posterior sectors； in cases where the treat-ment plan indicates that the posterior sectors must be mesialized， and especially in those where retrusion of the incisors is necessary， the DKL arch must not express negative torque because anchorage would increase. This is done by wearing off the arch wire on the distal portions of the loops， and this way the sharp edges of the wire will disappearand with this the negative torque expression and friction will be reduced. This activation will be made from the first molar. Another modification can be made for the same purpose we must place a positive torque (around15 degrees)， in the posterior sectors of the arch (turn the braces 180 degrees). This will place the molar roots onto trabecular bone. When an important inferior molar mesial movement is going to be done it is conyenient to reinforce the inferior incisor anchorage. A higher caliber DKL arch can be used to increase anterior torque， like a 0.021”x0.025\" DKL arch. In this case the wearing off will be done on the edges of the posterior segment of the arch； giving positive torque is not convenient because using a highei caliber wire increases friction and will make mesial molar migration more difficult. (1)\n【save__datas】\t【2006】\tActivation errors. These are always made by excesses； in the opening of the loops of the arch or in the frequency of the activations. Both provoke very marked retroclina-tion of the anterior sector and greater resistance to torque recovery. As a result of this， a total loss of control of tooth movement occurs. The adverse effects are difficult to solve and prolong treatment time， because the occlusal planes would have to be leveled again and sometimes this is obtained by opening spaces in the dental arch again. The activation of a DKL arch provokes in a first time period a distal canine inclination and aretroclination of the incisors， at the second time period incisor torque and canine upright position is regained. These different types of movement made by the DKL require a prolonged time to manifest. The orthodontist must be cautious with the amount of activations of the loops of the DKL， which must be very moderate in order to avoid a distal canine crown inclination that would affect the anterior part of the dental arch pro-voking extrusion of the incisors. For this reason， activation--connect--【2007】must not surpass 1 mm in each loop. On the other hand， the frequent activation of the DKL wire will not allow the canine to regain its normal inclination and will retard the recovery of the incisor torque. This over activation pro-vokes an increase of the overbite due to incisor extrusion. Furthermore， we must decide which the best time to do the activation， observing the aspect of the dental arch. A new activation can be done if good canine inclination is observed and if there is no evidence of a concave occlusal arch (deep Spee curve). In normal conditions， activations can be made every 6 or 8 weeks.(I)\n【save__datas】\t【2008】\tSynchronization errors during space closure： when both dental arches are being retracted it must be in a coor-dinated manner. Two of the main objectives oforthodontic mechanotherapy are a normal overjet and a Class I canine relation； sometimes this last objective forces us to work on one dental arch， and when the canine Class I relation is obtained we can activate both DKL arches.\n【save__datas】\t【2009】\tIf we retroincline the inferior incisors excessively and we do not take good care of the overjet， upper retrusion may not accomplish the objectives of normalizing the overjet and obtaining a canine Class I. For this reason， in four extraction cases the closure sequence would be， in a co-ordinated manner， to close the two anterior sectors first and later mesialize the posterior sectors in two phases， first the lower arch till completed and then the upper arch. This way， we finalize first the space closure in the inferior arch， maintaining the spaces in the upper arch that must be closed mesializing the molars. This maneuver is done with ease and poses no risk to the canine relation because the upper incisors will be consolidated in their sagittal posi-tion. These upper spaces allow incisor retrusion in case we must compensate any maladjustment in the anterior sector relation. Due to these anchorage differences between the dental arches in both sectors， it is logical to think that if we pretended to migrate mesially simultaneously in both dental arches， the most frequent complication observed would be a total space closure in a Class II relation with an increased overjet(11)\n【save__datas】\t【2010】\tError in anterior vertical control： sometimes we can alternate our mechanotherapy sequence and retrude the upper arch without solving before any vertical problem of the inferior and superior incisors. This may place the inferior incisors in contact with the cingulum of the up-per incisors， not allowing their retrusion and increasing anterior anchorage； impeding this situation prevents the obtention of canine Class I relation and provokes posterior anchorage control in the upper dental arch.(II)\n【save__datas】\t【2011】\tUse of a wrong sized DKL： the appearance of diastemas in the anterior sector is produced by the use of a wrong sized DKL. If a bigger than needed arch is used， the mesial loop will lean on the cuspid braces. During activation only the distal loop will open， but the mesial loop， although it does not open， will receive the tension of the activation and the distal arm of the mesial loop will exert pressure on the canine braces， which will distalize in an isolated way. This will provoke diastemas between the lateral incisors and the canines.(11)\n【save__datas】\t【2013】\tWhen to use a two or four-loop arch?\n【save__datas】\t【2014】\tThe simple arch (two loops) and the double key loop arch(DKL) were designed for space closure.\n【save__datas】\t【2015】\tSimple arches are used in cases in which we first want to distalize canines first (with closed coils or with power chain) with a force that does not surpass 350 g and later on retrude the four incisors by opening the loops (no more than 1mm). These are also recommended when we need posterior maximum anchorage.\n【save__datas】\t【2016】\tThe DKL arches are used when we want to close extrac-tion sites in one single stride， retruding in-block the six anterior teeth with posterior anchorage loss， or， if we need maximum anterior anchorage and posterior anchorage loss， the loops are activated more than 1 mm.()\n【save__datas】\t【2017】\tTMA or stainless steel DKL arches?\n【save__datas】\t【2018】\tThe basic operation of this arch is that upon activation， the loops open and these tend to close again， closing the spaces.\n【save__datas】\t【2019】\tThese arches were first made out of stainless steel， but with the rise of new alloys in orthodontics like Nickel-Titanium and TMA， manufacturers had the alternative to use these materials to fabricate these arches.\n【save__datas】\t【2020】\tSteel is an alloy made out of 75% austenitic steel， 18%chrome， 8% nickel and less than 0.20% of carbon. Its prin-ciple characteristics are high stiffness， low elastic memory， less accumulated energy， low friction level， moderate elastic module， it is easy to bend and has low cost. The energy saved in a steel wire is less than the energy in a TMA wire. This is why these wires exert high forces that dissipate in short periods of time.\n【save__datas】\t【2022】\tDr. Alfredo Bass and cols. made a study in 2005 comparing the mechanical properties of steel and TMA two and four loop arches. The results are as follow：\n【save__datas】\t【2023】\tSteel is harder， therefore， we need to apply more load to open the loops than in TMA wire.\n【save__datas】\t【2024】\tThe simple and DKL steel loops have a saturation curve and a change in its flexibility modulus， which can lead to intrinsic deformation， altering its load distribution. This can happen around 250 g.\n【save__datas】\t【2026】\tA 1 mm activation of the loop of a TMA arch exerts300 g of force and stainless steel 500g of force.\n【save__datas】\t【2027】\tOne of the disadvantages of TMA is the difficulty to manage anterior torque during retraction.\n【save__datas】\t【2028】\tIn synthesis， the use of TMA simple and DKL loop arches for space closure is recommended.--connect--【2029】good overbite control and allow posterior sector sliding. Overbite and torque are not well controlled with smaller arches. Bigger arches limit posterior sector sliding. These arches have 0.7” soldered brass hooks. These hooks are placed with 36 mm or 38 mm of separation between them in the upper arch and with 26 mm in the lower arch. This measurement is taken following the curvature of the arch. The 26 mm measurement in the lower arch is valid for the majority of cases but in the upper arch individual variabil-ity is greater due to the variations in the size of the upper lateral incisors. Therefore， we must have a great inventory with different distances between hooks，(2.13)\n【save__datas】\t【2030】\tAccording to the MBT technique， there are three ways to close spaces：--connect--【2033】a) Active distal ligature type 1 (distal elastomeric ligature).--connect--【2034】b) Active distal ligature type 2 (mesial elastomeric ligature).--connect--【2035】c) Active distal ligature with NiTi coils.\n【save__datas】\t【2036】\tActive distal ligatures type l and 2 are simple， economic and reliable. Placement is easy and have little complica-tions. These active distal ligatures use an elastomeric ligature that is stretched upon activation. This exerts a force between 50 and 100 g if the elastomeric ligature is stretched before placement， in case it is not stretched before placement the force can oscillate between 200to 300 g more. The force exerted by the elastomeric ligature varies according to the type of elastic ligature used， how much was it stretched before placement and how much we stretch it while placing it.(2a)--connect--【2039】a) Active distal ligature type 1 (distal elastic liga ture)： The 0.019”x 0.025\" steel wire is placed on the braces with metallic or elastomeric ligature. We hitch the elastic ligature on the hook of the first or second molar. We use a 0.010” steel ligature. We pass an end of the ligature under the arch. This in-creases the stability of the distal active elastomeric ligature and helps maintain the elastomeric ligature away from the gingival tissues.(2.13)--connect--【2041】b) Active distal ligature type 2 (mesial elastomeric ligature)： the principle is the same as in the type 1ligature， but the elastomeric ligature is hitched to the hook soldered to the arch. The arch is a 0.019\"x0.015”--connect--【2042】stainless steel wire and we place elastomeric ligatures except on the bicuspids. We hitch a 0.010”steel liga-ture to the hook of the first or second molar and after turning on itself a few times we hitch the other end to an elastomeric ligature that is hitched to the hook of the arch. Finally we place an elastomeric ligature on the brace of the bicuspid covering the arch and the active distal ligature. With both types of ligature the elastomeric ligature stretches double its original size. The ligature can be reactivated every 4 to 6 weeks. If hygiene is not good， the elastomeric ligatures can de-teriorate and must be changed in every appointment In some cases， at the end of space closure， it may be useful to use two elastomeric ligatures or complement the active distal ligature with an elastic chain of 10 or12 links from molar to molar(2.13)--connect--【2044】c)\n【save__datas】\t【2045】\tNiTi coils： if the sites to close are too large or if ap-pointment compliance is difficult， NiTi coils can be used instead of elastomeric ligatures. Samuel and cols recommend the application of 150 g as the optimal force for space closure. They found that 150 g coils are more effective than 100 g coils， but not as effective as200g coils. This work confirms prior findings that NiTi coils close spaces better than elastomeric ligatures. Natrass & cols. have confirmed that the force of elasto-meric ligatures declines rapidly after 24 hours and that temperature and the environment have an effect on this process. This loss of force does not happen in the same way as in NiTi coils. Despite scientific evidence that favors NiTi coils， many orthodontists still use power chain for space closure in the majority of cases. If space closure is too fast， incisor torque can be lost and may take months to recuperate after the spaces are closed. Elastic chain is easy to use， economical， and functions--connect--【2046】well in the majority of cases. Even thouhg NiTi coils can close spaces without being replaced during periodic appointments， this is a relative advantage， because during space closure we must take off the arches and check them out and cut off the excess wire in every appointment if necessary.(2.13)\n【save__datas】\t【2049】\t2 Bennett， J.C.，McLaughlin，R.P.

This dental projection is denominated overbite and the norm is 2 mm. Chaconas considers it in percentages and mentions that a normal overbite exists when close to 20% of the buccal surface of the lower inci-sors is covered by the upper incisors.(11.15)\n【save__datas】\t【2098】\tDeep bite predisposes the patient to periodontal disease due to the overcharge of occlusal forces， excessive ten-sion， trauma， functional problems (limitation in lateral movements) and bruxism. Due to the excessive depth of the bite， functional problems that affect the temporal， masseter and lateral pterigoyd muscles occur， and by consequence， the condyle goes backwards and upwards in the articular fossa (vertical growth) due to the lingual eruption of the central incisors， which forces the man-dible and the condyles to go backwards far away from central relation. Therefore these patients are susceptible to TMJ pathology. 1.15.15)\n【save__datas】\t【2099】\tFacial characteristics of deep bite patients may be the following：\n【save__datas】\t【2101】\tBrachicephalic face.\n【save__datas】\t【2103】\tConcave profile.\n【save__datas】\t【2104】\tShort vertical dimension and lower third of the face.\n【save__datas】\t【2105】\tDiminished occlusal plane.\n【save__datas】\t【2106】\tHypodivergent growth tendency.\n【save__datas】\t【2107】\tMandible retrognatia.(1115)\n【save__datas】\t【2108】\tDental characteristics of deep bite patients may be the following：\n【save__datas】\t【2109】\t1， The skeletal base of the mandible canine region is significantly narrower than the corresponding skeletal base of the upper maxilla.\n【save__datas】\t【2111】\tThe upper dental arch is well developed and some-times there is an excess of posterioanterior growth the anterior zone may be sometimes smaller.\n【len<10_filter】\t【2112】\t3.\n【save__datas】\t【2113】\tThe lower dental arch is morphologically normal and has characteristic signs of crowding and lingualization of the lower incisors.\n【len<10_filter】\t【2114】\t4.\n【save__datas】\t【2115】\tRegularly we can observe a noticeable retroclination of the upper and lower incisors.\n【save__datas】\t【2116】\t5\\.

Skeletal deep bite， characterized by a horizontal growth factor. The anterior facial height is reduced； especially the lower third of the face， meanwhile the posterior facial height is excessive.6 When the an-terior facial height is lesser than the posterior facial height the maxillary bases converge and the result is a deep bite of skeletal origin. The alterations of the transversal width can also cause a skeletal deep bite because we can have a wide maxilla and a nar-row mandible. The profile of the patients tends to--connect--【2124】be concave with a prominent chin eminence with labial retrusion. \"5In general， these patients have a di-minished inferior facial third， their growth is horizontal or hypodivergent. Other characteristics that are present are a brachicephalic facial type， increased muscle tone， a square face and perfect lip closure. The diagnosis of this alteration with x-rays and cephalometric radiographs will determine if the discrepancy or alterations are at bone or teeth levels and if the problem lies in the maxilla， in the mandible or both.(1.15.16)\n【len<10_filter】\t【2125】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【2126】\tDentoalveolar deep bite is characterized by molar infraclusion and/or incisor overeruption.\n【save__datas】\t【2127】\tDeep bite produced by molar infraclusion presents the following characteristics：\n【save__datas】\t【2128】\tThe molars have erupted partially.\n【save__datas】\t【2129】\tThe inter occlusal space is ample.\n【save__datas】\t【2130】\tThe tongue occupies a lateral position\n【save__datas】\t【2131】\tThe distances between the basal planes of both maxil-las and the occlusal plane are short.(15)\n【save__datas】\t【2132】\tThe deep bite produced by the over eruption ofthe incisors presents the following characteristics：--connect--【2133】a) The incisor edges of the incisors exceed the occlusal plane.\n【save__datas】\t【2134】\tThe molars have erupted completely.\n【save__datas】\t【2135】\tThe Spee curve is excessive.\n【save__datas】\t【2136】\tThe inter occlusal space is reduced.(16)\n【save__datas】\t【2137】\tDue to the hypodivergent growth， the incisors are com-pressed by the muscles of the lips and their hyper tonicity is going to provoke retroclination of the crowns of the incisors producing a deep bite. Ofthis functional influence and the consequential deviation of the dental eruptive pattern， the rest of the occlusal anomalies will develop， like retroclination， deep bite， mesialization of the buccal segments and overcrowding.\n【save__datas】\t【2138】\tWhile the molars erupt， the anterior deep bite does not allow lateral movements of the mandible and the child becomes a vertical chewer. Aperture and closure move-ments that act like functional stimuli for the growth of the anterior maxillary alveolar apophysis are limited and inhibit mandible development. Anterior deep bites in the primary dentition are very frequent， but they are rarely treated. They can be associated with the presence of Class II malocclusions in development. The decisions of treat-ment are generally postponed until the mixed dentition.\n【save__datas】\t【2139】\tThe indications for such treatment in the primary denti-tion include： lower incisor impact on the palatal mucosa， excessive wear and headaches，(11.15，16)\n【save__datas】\t【2140】\tStrong posterior mastication worsens the bite because it puts posterior teeth in infraclusion. Normally the inferior incisors present a marked retroclination due to blockage by the upper incisors and extrude until they touch the palatal mucosa. In occasions the overbite is so severe that the lower incisors are totally covered by the upper teeth. This excessive overbite may produce trauma in the lower buccal mucosa and in the palatine mucosa of the upper maxilla. Deep bite is a typical clinical sign of Class II divi-sion 2 malocclusions.(11.15)\n【save__datas】\t【2141】\tAcquired deep bite can be caused by the following factors：\n【save__datas】\t【2143】\tThe premature loss of deciduous molars or permanent posterior molars.\n【save__datas】\t【2144】\t3\\. Wear of the occlusal surface or dental abrasion.\n【save__datas】\t【2145】\tDeep bite can be localized in the dentoalveolar or skeletal zone， and treatment will always depend on the affected zone.\n【save__datas】\t【2146】\tThe correction of dentoalveolar deep bite can be obtained by intrusion of the anterior teeth， extrusion of posterior teeth， a combination of both， posterior teeth uprighting and increasing the inclination of the anterior teeth.(11.15.16)\n【save__datas】\t【2147】\tAnterior teeth intrusion may be indicated in patients that show too much upper gum (gummy smile)， or if they have too much dental mass in the four anterosuperior teeth， a great interlip gap or a steep mandibular plane.\n【save__datas】\t【2148】\tIntrusive movements are very violent and may cause root resorption. But Gottlieb showed that using 15-20g of force per incisor there is no measurable root shortening or visible apical resorption.(\"115)\n【save__datas】\t【2149】\tExtrusion of the posterior teeth may be the treatment of choice in patients in which we want to increase inferior facial height， improve facial convexity or if we want to open the mandibular plane.(23)\n【save__datas】\t【2150】\tThere is great controversy surrounding the effects of pre-molar extraction in vertical dimension. Viazis considers extractions of premolar counterproductive in patients with deep bite because the rest of the teeth would move lingually and the bite would deepen more.(2)\n【save__datas】\t【2151】\tDeep bite， apart from producing occlusal irregulari-ties， may intervene in the seating and/or increase of problems in the TMJ. For this， orthodontists have tried for some years to reduce the depth of deep bites using dif-ferent mechanisms from the use of extra oral appliances(feared by the patients because of its anti esthetic effects)， till the most recent elements described in the literature product of clinical investigation with basis in bioengineer-ing applied to the design of elements for dental movement control. Studies in Physics and Biomechanics have given us designs of arches and passive and active elements that are more efficient and plural，(12)\n【save__datas】\t【2152】\tThe options that we will review in this chapter for the opening of the anterior bite are as follows：\n【save__datas】\t【2153】\t\\- Anterior bite plane.\n【save__datas】\t【2154】\tAnterior bite plane with intermaxillary elastics.\n【len<10_filter】\t【2156】\tBypass.\n【save__datas】\t【2157】\tIncisal brace placement.\n【save__datas】\t【2158】\tIntrusion bend.\n【save__datas】\t【2159】\tTip back.\n【save__datas】\t【2160】\tReverse curve arch.\n【save__datas】\t【2161】\tIntrusion arch of Dr Oscar Quiros\n【save__datas】\t【2163】\tUtility arch.\n【len<10_filter】\t【2164】\tCIA.\n【save__datas】\t【2165】\tIntrusive arch with loops.\n【save__datas】\t【2166】\tFace bow.\n【save__datas】\t【2167】\tAnterior bite plane\n【save__datas】\t【2168】\tWith this additment the occlusal plane will open with the help of the anteroinferior teeth， which will contact the acrylic plate provoking a separation or posterior disclusion， facilitating the passive or forced eruption of molars and premolars， which will open the anterior bite，(6.11.15)\n【save__datas】\t【2169】\tHemley， in 1938 affirmed that the bite plane slows the growth of the anterior alveolar process； meanwhile the posterior alveolar process continues growing. He also found that of 22 patients that used the bite plane， only one showed inferior incisor intrusion. Strang says that the--connect--【2170】bite plane induces molar extrusion but does not have an intrusive effect on the anterior segment. Sleichter studied the vertical changes of molars and incisors， and found that the height of the molar region increased while the anterior region had a minimal change. (16.20)\n【save__datas】\t【2174】\tBefore placing an anterior bite plane we must evaluate the type of malocclusion of the patient and its cephalometric characteristics (that determine the growth direction of the mandible). For example， if the mandible rotation tendency is forward and upward (hypodivergent)， the use of the bite plane will favor change of growth direction， and at the same time will facilitate the opening of the bite. In turn， in pa-tients with a mandibular tendency to rotate downward and backward (hyperdivergent) with an increased facial lower third， the use of an anterior bite plane is contraindicated.\n【save__datas】\t【2175】\tIf the patient is in the mixed dentition， the anterior bite plane will assist the extrusion of the posterior segment， maintaining contact with the lower incisors， so these will not extrude， leveling the Spee curve， opening the bite and increasing the facial lower third.(1620)\n【save__datas】\t【2177】\tAdvantages\n【len<10_filter】\t【2178】\t1，\n【save__datas】\t【2179】\tEasy to make.\n【len<10_filter】\t【2180】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【2181】\tPromotes mandibular rotation that will tend to open the bite.\n【save__datas】\t【2182】\t3 Increases vertical dimension and the lower third of the face\n【save__datas】\t【2183】\t4Deprograms mandibular muscles.5Diminishes the depth of the Spee curve.\n【save__datas】\t【2184】\tDisadvantages\n【save__datas】\t【2185】\t1\\.

Generally， the presence of a deep spee curve is derived from the extrusion of the anterior sector； this happens when the inferior incisors， during their eruptive phase，do not find their antagonist and erupt until they contact the palatine mucosa； for this reason， the anterosuperior sector elongates inducing a deep bite.\n【save__datas】\t【2365】\tWith the development of alloys， super elastic arches ap-peared in the form of a reverse curve or anti Spee curves(NiTi or TMA)， round and rectangular (each one with advantages and disadvantages).

This effect provokes a negative torque increase at premolar and molar levels increasing their anchorage(cortical anchorage). Increasing the posterior sector an---connect--【2376】chorage will augment the effect of the arch on the anterior sector and this way we can intrude the incisors without proclining them.\n【save__datas】\t【2377】\tDr Gregoret says that round reverse curve arches will produce：\n【save__datas】\t【2378】\t1\\.

To achieve this we can use reverse curves， intrusive bends and arches with intrusive loops.\n【save__datas】\t【2407】\tThe presence of deep bites is one of the problems that we encounter frequently， to which we apply all our knowledge， but sometimes the resources we posses are inefficient.Not many arches with loops can help us achieve an effective intrusion ofthe anterior teeth， and the existing ones gener-ally wear off before achieving their objective. The intrusion arch of Dr. Oscar Quiros is an excellent option for anterior segment intrusion.\n【save__datas】\t【2409】\tThe arch is made with the anterior segment placed more gingivally than the posterior segment of the arch， this will make the intrusion of the anterior teeth possible； the difference in levels will be established by the amount of intrusion needed，3 mm is an acceptable measure. Due to its design it acts like a very elastic spring that will physiologically intrude the anterior teeth， painlessly and without adverse effects upon teeth and support tissue. (13)\n【save__datas】\t【2410】\tSteps for construction of the Quiros intrusion arch：\n【save__datas】\t【2412】\tFirst make the initial bend and then the helicoidal bend.\n【save__datas】\t【2413】\tThen make the intrusion loops.\n【save__datas】\t【2414】\tMake the same operation on the other side， try on and then ligate it conventionally.\n【save__datas】\t【2416】\tThe arch can also retract the anterior teeth once the required intrusion is obtained， with the advantage that， due to the loops that are integrated in the arch while the wire is activated for the anterior segment， retraction forces are exerted that maintain torque on the teeth to be retracted， which is favorable when we are reducing the dental overjet.13)\n【save__datas】\t【2417】\tIn occasions， during retraction， we can have an adverse effect on the canine that can tend to extrude； but this is easy to correct in a short period of time， placing an arch with a bridged bend with a loop over the canine and a segment of elastic chain.(13)\n【save__datas】\t【2419】\tAdvantages\n【save__datas】\t【2420】\t1\\. This arch produces bodily intrusion of the anterior sector.\n【len<10_filter】\t【2421】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【2422】\tDue to its intrusion loops， the intrusive movement is smooth.\n【save__datas】\t【2426】\tMinimal tooth pain.\n【save__datas】\t【2427】\tIt is a multipurpose arch， because is useful for intru-sion and space closure in the anterior segment.\n【save__datas】\t【2428】\tDisadvantages\n【save__datas】\t【2429】\t1\\. The elaboration is time consuming.\n【save__datas】\t【2431】\tThe loops can impinge if they are not separated from the buccal mucosa.\n【len<10_filter】\t【2432】\t4.\n【save__datas】\t【2433】\tAfter the use of this intrusion arch the placement of a straight wire is difficult.\n【save__datas】\t【2434】\tRecommendations\n【save__datas】\t【2436】\tFor use in patients with short roots.\n【save__datas】\t【2437】\tThe recommended intrusion step is 3 mm.\n【save__datas】\t【2438】\tMake the arch with TMA wire.\n【save__datas】\t【2439】\tConventional techniques use a sequence of round wires to level deep Spee curves. Sometimes reverse Spee curves are incorporated in order to power their effect. The response to this procedure is the extrusion of the lower bicuspids， molar uprighting and forward inclination of the incisors. This incisor inclination puts the roots in intimate contact with the lingual cortex of the symphysis， which makes intrusion difficult，and also provokes a mesial movement of the roots of the molars. These collateral effects manifest more in patients with weak muscles， like in dolichofacial patients， in which we must implement Spee curve leveling mechanics that do not compromise the occlusal plane in the posterior sector， in order to avoid bite opening and an increase of the inferior third of the face.(6)\n【save__datas】\t【2440】\tBy the end of the 50's， Ricketts tried to counteract the secondary effects mentioned before with the use of the utility arch. This is based in the principle that the dental arches are constituted in different sectors； each has its own anatomical， functional and esthetic characteristics. Ricketts divides the lower dental arch in five sectors： incisors， canines， premolars， first molars and second molars，(7.9.14)\n【save__datas】\t【2442】\tMono-radicular teeth that have incisal edges that allow them to cut， constitute the incisor group， they also play an important esthetic and phonetic part.\n【save__datas】\t【2443】\tMolars are multi radicular with an occlusal surface that plays a different masticatory function from the incisor group， and have a null esthetic function.\n【save__datas】\t【2444】\tThe canines， with a different anatomy and function， have an intermediate position between the incisors and premolars， and are placed in the curve of the dental arches. Speaking about trabecular bone volume and proximity to the corti-cal bone， all these sectors are placed in totally different zones of the maxilla and the mandible. If we add to all this the different muscular environments， it is understandable that， given the different characteristics of each sector， in-dividualizing the mechanics applied in each sector makes the overall mechanics of this arch very efficient.\n【save__datas】\t【2445】\tIn order to avoid the negative effects produced by the reverse curve arch， that lengthens treatment time， we recommend the use of the utility arch， which really is a multisectional appliance because it works independently and simultaneously on the molars and the incisor sector This procedure is very effective leveling deep curves，ob taining incisor intrusion in brief periods without negative effects.(6，7914)\n【save__datas】\t【2448】\tBeing an arch that works in three sectors at the same time， we must consider that any activation done will have action-reaction effects， which must be neutralized in order to obtain only wanted movements，6，14)\n【save__datas】\t【2449】\tIntrusive action of the lower utility arch\n【save__datas】\t【2450】\t1\\. A 45° tip back is done to the terminal segments that are inserted in the molar tubes. This is the intrusion activation，(6，14)\n【len<10_filter】\t【2454】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【2455】\tA negative torque of aproximatly 10° to 15° is in-duced in the incisor sector. This torque is placed to separate the apexes from the lingual cortical and to situate them in trabecular bone in order to ac-complish the intrusion movement. The arch loses its intrusion capacity because of the contact of the apexes with the lingual cortical and only a buccal movement will occur， so this arch will not serve its purpose. This radicle-buccal torque activation is essential for the intrusion movement.(6.14)\n【save__datas】\t【2456】\tIntrusion activation of the upper utility arch\n【save__datas】\t【2457】\tThe tip back activation will be done as in the lower arch and the negative torque will not be necessary in the upper utility arch.(6.14)\n【save__datas】\t【2458】\tWith the tip back bend done in the molars， the anterior sector of the utility arch is gingivally located about 10mm from the slot of the inferior braces and 16 mm to18 mm from the slot of the upper braces. With this ac-tivation an intrusive force of approximately 80 g to 100g in the lower incisors and 140 g in the upper incisors is generated. These values respond to the application of100 g of force for every cm’ of root surface consider-ing that the surface that opposes the dental intrusion movement is the transversal surface of the root of the incisors (please refer to Space Closure in Orthodontics， chapter 3).(6，14)\n【save__datas】\t【2459】\tDr Gregoret recommends the placement of sectioned arches for stability in the premolar and molar sectors while the intrusion of the anterior sector is taking place. They do not have any type of activation， are totally passive and can be made of the same caliber as the utility arch or slightly bigger.\n【save__datas】\t【2460】\tParting from this， the anterior sector can be intruded without a negative response from the molars. Without this anchorage reinforcement， they would incline distally with the following alteration of the occlusal plane and the possible creation of a fulcrum as a consequence of the contact points of the mesial cusps.\n【save__datas】\t【2461】\tIntrusion sequence in the permanent dentition\n【save__datas】\t【2462】\tCanine intrusion\n【save__datas】\t【2463】\tOnce the intrusion objectives in the incisor sector are met， the canine intrusion is next， and the procedure is as follows：\n【save__datas】\t【2464】\t1\\. Make a “V\" bend on the lateral bridges of the utility arch at the canine level. This bend must not generate any activation.\n【len<10_filter】\t【2465】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【2466】\tA ligature is placed from the canine brace to the “V\"bend of the lateral bridge， and this is tensed. After adjusting the ligatures on both canines， the anterior sector is ligated， (6.14)\n【save__datas】\t【2467】\t3\\. Once the canine intrusion is accomplished we take off the ligatures and we place a 0.016\" superelastic wire or a higher caliber wire for re-leveling， without taking the utility arch off， remaining two wires in the anterior sector (wire over wire). The objective is--connect--【2469】to re-level the whole dental arch without losing the anterior intrusion.()\n【save__datas】\t【2471】\tOnce re-leveling is obtained we remove both arches and we continue the sequence of continuous arches.\n【save__datas】\t【2473】\tAdvantages\n【save__datas】\t【2475】\tWe do not depend upon patient compliance.\n【save__datas】\t【2476】\tIt produces controlled intrusion movement.\n【len<10_filter】\t【2477】\t4.\n【save__datas】\t【2478】\tIt produces pure intrusion， because the intrusive force passes through the center of resistance of the tooth.\n【save__datas】\t【2479】\tDisadvantages\n【save__datas】\t【2481】\tIf the arch is not well constructed， it can impinge in the buccal surface of the premolars.\n【save__datas】\t【2482】\t3\\.

Place negative torque in the anterior sector.\n【save__datas】\t【2490】\tCIA (Connecticut Intrusion Arch)\n【save__datas】\t【2491】\tThe correction of a deep bite (deep overbite) can be ac-complished with the intrusion of the anterior sector， the extrusion of the posterior sector or a combination of both. This decision must be based in the ideal position of the upper incisor， considering the lip-teeth relation (nasolabial angle) and the vertical dimension of the lower third of the face，(10.23.24)\n【save__datas】\t【2492】\tThere are many ways to intrude the anterior segment； Begg，Ricketts and Burstone employ the same principle： the molar tip back bend. The wire materials used for intrusion with these techniques are diverse， but they all recognize the need to employ a continuous light force.(10)\n【save__datas】\t【2493】\tNickel Titanium alloys (NiTi) are a good option to produce these continuous and light forces. These alloys have high memoryand a low load-deflection ratio that translates into less wire activation appointments，(10)\n【save__datas】\t【2494】\tThe Connecticut Intrusion Arch (CIA) is more commonly used for intrusion of the anterior teeth， but it has other uses， including molar tip back for Class II correction， for anchorage preparation of the posterior segment， correc-tion of minor anterior open bites， occlusal plane leveling and detailing.\n【save__datas】\t【2495】\tThe CIA is manufactured and distributed by Orto Orga-nizers and made out of NiTi wire. There are two available arch sizes： 0.016\"x 0.022\"and 0.017\"x 0.025. The upper and lower have an anterior dimension of 34 mm and 28mm respectively.(10.23.24)\n【save__datas】\t【2496】\tIn the majority of cases the CIA is not placed in the slots of the anterior braces. In the anterior segment， a sectional rectangular arch is placed in the slots from lateral to lateral.\n【save__datas】\t【2497】\tOver this wire the anterior segment of the CIA arch wire is ligated to the sectional wire. This is the reason why the use of triple tubes in the upper molars and the use of double tubes in the lower molars are recommended.(10.23)\n【save__datas】\t【2499】\tThe CIA exerts an intrusive force of 40 g to 60 g due to the“V\"bend placed mesial to the molar tube. With this arch we can achieve pure intrusion， because the intrusion force is directed apically through the center of resistance of the tooth， producing 1mm of intrusion in 6 weeks.

The line of force action passes 25° to 30° bellow the occlusal plane.\n【len<10_filter】\t【2553】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【2554】\tThe force components are the extrusion and distal-izing vectors.\n【save__datas】\t【2555】\t3\\. The extra oral support is the pad that is placed in the back of the neck at the third cervical vertebrae level(21)\n【save__datas】\t【2558】\tThe facial bow is composed by an external bow (facial) and an internal bow (buccal)， joined together in the middle anterior portion.\n【save__datas】\t【2559】\tThe internal arch must be separated 5 mm to 8 mm from the buccal aspect of the upper incisors approximately，and\n【save__datas】\t【2561】\tThis type of extra oral appliance is indicated in Class II divi-sion 1 and 2 malocclusions with brachifacial patterns， with a horizontal growth tendency and a very strong muscular pattern. The correction is favored by the distalization and the predominantly molar extrusion or depression of the palatine plane， and consequently， mandibular rotation. The osseous profile improves， there is an increment ofthe anterior facial height due to the molar extrusion， the anterior overbite is corrected and maxillary protrusion is reduced.\n【save__datas】\t【2562】\tThis appliance works correcting the deep bite through the extrusion and distalization of the upper molars.( 18.21)--connect--【2565】the ends are inserted in the tubes of the upper molar bands. A stop bend must be placed to impede the inward sliding of the internal arch ends in the tubes.\n【save__datas】\t【2566】\tThe external arch also has bends at the endings in which the traction pad is inserted.\n【save__datas】\t【2568】\tA light force is used when we want to move a tooth or a group of teeth； due to this force， the response of the support bone， of the periodontal tissues and of the tooth itself， are favorable； hialinization of the osseous tissue will occur for a brief period of time， and there will be good blood flow with a great affluence of repair and bone forming cells. The dental movement is easier if the tooth is imbedded in trabecular bone and not in the bone cortex. The tooth to be moved must be isolated from the other teeth so it can distalize easier(21)\n【save__datas】\t【2569】\tIn order to better understand the action of the face bow we must briefly analyze its biomechanics：\n【save__datas】\t【2570】\t1\\. Force： It is the factor that alters the position of a body in repose； it changes the direction of its movement or provokes compression or distension of the body (the tooth).\n【save__datas】\t【2571】\t2\\. Point of force application： In the face bow， the point of force application corresponds to the bend or hooks of the outer arm where the pad is attached.\n【save__datas】\t【2572】\t3\\. Line of force action： The spring that joins the hook of the outer arm of the facial bow to the cervical pad determines the line ofaction or the direction of the force. This can be horizontal or oblique， depending on the location of the extra oral support and the outer arm.\n【save__datas】\t【2573】\tCenter of resistance： It is a point located near the trifurcate of the roots of the first upper molar All the force that passes through the center of resistance of the tooth will promote a translation movement of the tooth and there will be no inclina-tion. Based on this principle， when we use cervical traction， we must angle the external arm of the face bow above the occlusal plane， so the resultant force applied to the upper molar passes though its center of resistance， annulling the inclination effect on the molar. Therefore， if the molar is being inclined by the use of the facial bow， we must proceed to the correction of the position of the external arm.\n【save__datas】\t【2574】\t5\\. Fulcrum： It is the center of rotation of the denta movement and its localization varies depending on the line of force. The closer the force passes near the center of resistance the farther the ful crum will be.\n【save__datas】\t【2575】\t6\\. Force magnitude or intensity： It is the amount of force applied through the face bow.\n【save__datas】\t【2576】\t7\\. Resultant： It is the sum of all the vectors that compose the force.\n【save__datas】\t【2577】\t8\\. Force duration： The force can be continuous or in termittent. To correct a Class II， distalize molars and to open a deep bite， 18 to 20 hours of use per day will be necessary.(21)\n【save__datas】\t【2578】\tThe external arm can be short， medium or long.\n【save__datas】\t【2580】\tMedium： The external arm has the same length as the internal arm， ending at the molar tube level.\n【save__datas】\t【2581】\tLong： The external arm is longer than the internal one.21)\n【save__datas】\t【2582】\tAsymmetrical cervical face bow\n【save__datas】\t【2583】\tThis type of force is used for unilateral traction or for asymmetrical force. There are two simple ways to obtain this force：\n【save__datas】\t【2584】\t1\\. Bend the external arm away from the face of the patient on the side where is needed more force.\n【len<10_filter】\t【2586】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【2587】\tAnother way to obtain an asymmetrical force is cutting a piece of wire of an external arm. This is sectioned at the first molar level. On the side that has been cut we will have less force， so the contra lateral side (the side that has not been cut) will exert almost triple the force compared to the side in which wire of the external arm was cut off，(17)\n【save__datas】\t【2588】\tIn order to make the force optimal， we must determine the length and angulation of the external arm， so the line of action of the force passes through the center of resistance of the molar. A molar inclination can accentuate the opening of a bite due to premature contact of the cusps.21)\n【save__datas】\t【2591】\tBibliography\n【save__datas】\t【2592】\t1\\.

Open mouth responds to a lack of evident contact among upper and lower teeth that generally manifests at incisor level， but can be found in the posterior region， or a combination of both. It can appear since early age (three years of age) but is more common to find it between 8 and 10 years of age (mixed dentition period).(3.8.20)\n【save__datas】\t【2621】\tThe treatment of open bite must initiate as soon as possible to improve the possibilities of success， so that patients can benefit from early treatment， and this way we can maintain， restrict or redirect vertical growth.(26，27，30.37)\n【len<10_filter】\t【2622】\tEtiology\n【save__datas】\t【2623】\tOpen bite comes from a series of etiological factors of both hereditary and non-hereditary origine that exert their action in the pre and post natal period over the structures that conform the stomatognathic apparatus. Open bites are mainly caused by an over eruption of the upper posterior teeth or by a vertical overgrowth of the posterior dentoalveolar complex， which results in a posterior rotation of the mandible.\n【save__datas】\t【2624】\tOpen bite etiology can be divided in Local and General.(2，32，37)\n【save__datas】\t【2625】\tDeglutition\n【save__datas】\t【2626】\tIn normal conditions， the tongue is placed on the palate. In abnormal deglutition the tongue is between the upper and lower incisors， in the posterior and the anterior segment， interrupting the muscular equilibrium among lips， cheeks and the tongue. An anomalous tongue position can develop into different types of malocclusions.22.2427.30)\n【save__datas】\t【2627】\tThere are two abnormal lingual positions：\n【save__datas】\t【2628】\tType I lingual position：\n【save__datas】\t【2629】\tIn the type I lingual position， there is a Class IlI malocclu-sion with a flat and prominent tongue， in which the tongue is placed behind the incisors.\n【save__datas】\t【2630】\tThis type of anomaly is related to an anterior cross bite.\n【save__datas】\t【2631】\tType II lingual position：\n【save__datas】\t【2632】\tThe tongue is flat and retracted.\n【save__datas】\t【2633】\tIt is observed in Class II patients due to mandibular retru-sion.(25)\n【len<10_filter】\t【2634】\tSuction\n【save__datas】\t【2635】\tIt is of special interest in the ethiopathogeny of open bite. Bound to the persistence of objects， fingers and lip suction that inhibits the growth of the alveolar processes. Non--connect--【2637】nutritive sucking has a close relation with the seeking reflex that is present at birth. The indiscriminate use of a pacifier， feeding bottle and finger sucking can increase the chance of development of an open bite in the infant. This suction reflex disappears around the seventh month after birth.o)\n【save__datas】\t【2638】\tBreathing\n【save__datas】\t【2639】\tNasal obstruction and mouth breathing habit have been linked to this type of malocclusion， due to this obstruction，the patient beguines to breathe through the mouth so the patient must lower his tongue in order to let air pass through (mouth breathing habit) provoking a muscular unbalance between the tongue and the maxillary bones； the persistence of half open mouth stimulates the growth of the alveolar processes altering the craniofacial growth and provoking an open bite.\n【save__datas】\t【2640】\tThe etiology that initiates mouth breathing has many fac-tors， like allergies， adenoid tissue，enlarged tonsils，chronic inflammation of the air ways， tumoral processes， nasal septum deviation， nasal polyps， nasal orifices narrowing， among others，(5.6，14，30.31.34)\n【save__datas】\t【2641】\tMuscular hipotonicity\n【save__datas】\t【2642】\tTeeth receive and support the mechanical loads of the muscles that maintain teeth in a vertical position in their osseous bases. Hypotonicity tends to stimulate molar over-eruption and to separate the maxillary bone bases，(30)\n【save__datas】\t【2643】\tDentition development\n【save__datas】\t【2644】\tIn certain children the eruption of permanent teeth is sometimes altered chronologically； this contributes to the lack of vertical contact. This results in a transitory open bite aggravated by the tongue interposition.(30)\n【len<10_filter】\t【2645】\tGeneral\n【save__datas】\t【2646】\tGenetics. The genetic influence in the development of bone and teeth is evident， this is why we can say there are hereditary malocclusions； the size， form of teeth and bone are inherited and this leads us to established morphologic patterns.(?730)\n【save__datas】\t【2647】\tCongenital defects. There are congenital defects that can lead to an alteration of the growth of the maxilla and the mandible； palatine fissures， for example.(30)\n【save__datas】\t【2648】\tMuscular alterations. When our mouth is in repose teeth do not occlude and lips are in contact produc-ing a lip seal， that is necessary for swallowing and to avoid saliva leakage. In the absence of this seal， the tongue can produce an unbalance between the lips and the teeth producing a malocclusion. Lip and tongue morphology have influence on this， so does the muscle tone of the lips.(30)\n【save__datas】\t【2649】\tThey can be classified as：\n【save__datas】\t【2650】\tFalse or dental open bite. In this bite the teeth are only proclined without any alteration of the osseous bases and do not extend beyond the canines. These patients have normal facial morphology， a correct bone relation， a pseudobite and dentoalveolar prob-lems.(27.30)\n【save__datas】\t【2651】\tTrue or skeletal open bite. In this type of bite the alveolar processes are involved or deformed and dolichofacial characteristics are added to this.(4) These patients present hyperdivergency among the maxillas， they are generally dolichocephallic， and their lower facial third and vertical dimension are augmented.(27.30)\n【save__datas】\t【2652】\tAccording to the zone where the open bite is located they are divided in：\n【save__datas】\t【2653】\t1\\.

Among orthodon-tic movements， intrusion is one of the most violent and painful， due to the compression of the apical nerves and blood vessels upon alveolar bone.)\n【save__datas】\t【2828】\tThese blocks can be place in the upper and lower dental arches， and they can be fixed or removable.We generally make them with acrylic and they must not cover the pos-terior braces. The ideal period for placement is around 9-12 years of age， when the second permanent molar has not completed its eruption； this does not mean that it can not be used after this age， but it is the period in which can obtain the best results.\n【save__datas】\t【2829】\tIn case there are no fixed appliances， we can extend the acrylic to the buccal aspects of bicuspids and molars； it can be combined with a rapid maxillary expander (RME)， It must be used 24 hours a day for 6 to 8 months.(1011)\n【save__datas】\t【2834】\tA way to substitute the acrylic block is to use resin on the occlusal aspects of the molars.

If necessary do some stripping in the segment to be intruded.\n【len<10_filter】\t【2852】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【2853】\tIf the block is fixed， take it off every two months to clean it and adjust it.\n【save__datas】\t【2854】\t3\\. The acrylic must occlude with the antagonist teeth， so we must wear off the acrylic until all the antagonist teeth make total contact with the acrylic.\n【len<10_filter】\t【2855】\t4.\n【save__datas】\t【2856】\tThe recommended thickness for the posterior bite block is 1 mm to 2 mm； we must not forget that we will provoke an anterior open bite of +3mm due to the scissor effect.\n【save__datas】\t【2857】\t5\\. We must take the bite block off immediately if the patient refers pain in the TMJ.\n【save__datas】\t【2858】\t6\\. In case the second molar has not erupted totally， we must allow its eruption till it reaches the first molar level. If the bite block is made in this moment， we must isolate the occlusal aspect of the erupting second molar with wax and make the appliance over this. This may be inconvenient due to the accumulation of food， so we must reinforce hygiene.\n【save__datas】\t【2859】\tPosterior intrusion block with TMA wire\n【save__datas】\t【2860】\tAnother way to intrude posterior teeth and to provoke a mandible autorotation is placing a posterior intrusion block with TMA wire. This appliance consists in a Hawley plate with Adams hooks for retention and two posterior in-trusive occlusal tracks which are joined to helicoidal 0.032”TMA springs on each side (left and right). The tracks must be made out of high resistance acrylic in order to tolerate the forces of occlusion； the Hawley plate must cover the lingual aspects of the lower teeth to prevent overeruption or unwanted lingual movements. Sometimes we prefer to place buccal shields in the anterior and posterior segments--connect--【2861】for improved retention and to lessen undesired movements of the Hawley plate.\n【save__datas】\t【2862】\tThe helicoidal springs must be progressively activated to maintain continuous pressure on the mandibular neuro-muscular system.(194127)\n【save__datas】\t【2863】\tThis block stimulates upper molar intrusion with con-tinuous use； this type of intrusion is less likely to rebound compared to anterior bite closure. For this appliance， in order to function correctly， certain steps must be taken.\n【save__datas】\t【2864】\tIndications： preferably in patients with an anterior open bite of no more than 6 mm. The best age for the use of this appliance is between 9 and 12 years of age.\n【save__datas】\t【2865】\tCounter indications： patients with a diminished lower facial third， and skeletal open bites.\n【save__datas】\t【2866】\tUse： as many hours as possible night and day. The appli-ance is placed in the mouth， activated， and the degree of--connect--【2868】aperture must be measured at the moment of installment. In two or three weeks the first changes must be observ-able， we can obtain 10 mm of closure on the anterior re-gion， depending on the age of the patient and the problem that caused the open bite. The best effects are obtained in young patients with open bites due to mouth breathing or sucking habits once the causing agent is eliminatedL..\n【save__datas】\t【2875】\tAdvantages\n【save__datas】\t【2877】\tThe intrusive movement is less violent due to the helicoidal springs.\n【save__datas】\t【2878】\t3\\. Less root resorption due to the flexibility of the TMA wire，\n【save__datas】\t【2880】\t4\\. Patients with this appliance do not report pain.\n【save__datas】\t【2881】\t5\\. The intrusion of molars and premolars will be in block. This is why the acrylic must contact all the antagonist teeth that are going to be intruded.\n【save__datas】\t【2882】\tDisadvantages\n【save__datas】\t【2883】\t1\\.

We can identify this malocclusion when the lower teeth are in a buccal or labial position in regard to the upper teeth， in a unilateral， bilateral， anterior and/or posterior manner.(72422.31) These malocclusions can have a skeletal or dental component or a mix of both， they are relatively easy to treat if they are intercepted at an early age； doing so can avoid the need for surgical correction in the future.(724)\n【save__datas】\t【3123】\tWe can divide this type of malocclusion in：\n【save__datas】\t【3124】\t1Sagittal type cross bite (anterior cross bite).2Transversal type cross bite (posterior cross bite).\n【save__datas】\t【3125】\tIn this chapter we will discuss the many treatment options for the correction of this malocclusion.\n【save__datas】\t【3127】\tAnterior cross bite is one of the most common orthodontic problems in growing patients. It generally occurs in the primary and mixed dentition as the result of a disharmony in the skeletal， functional and dental components of the child. This is characterized by one or more anterosuperior teeth that occlude behind the lingual aspect of the antero-inferior teeth.71222)\n【save__datas】\t【3128】\tWe know that anterior cross bite can de caused byaretru sive upper maxilla， a protrusive mandible or a combination of both (skeletal type cross bite)； but when one or more teeth are affected individually， the cause can be purely--connect--【3130】dental， in which we can find upper incisor palatoversions with or without buccoversions of lower incisors，(1215) An anterior cross bite can appear as a predisposing factor in the development of a Class III malocclusion.\n【save__datas】\t【3131】\tEtiology of anterior cross bite\n【save__datas】\t【3132】\tHereditary influences，(1233)\n【save__datas】\t【3133】\tHabits (to chew with the mandible forward can force the upper incisors to retrocline).2)\n【save__datas】\t【3134】\tInadequate dental arch length. This problem can pro voke the lingual deviation of one or more permanent tooth during eruption.(23)\n【save__datas】\t【3136】\tA traumatic lesion in the deciduous dentition that can occasionally displace the developing permanent tooth， forcing it to erupt with a palatal inclination and provoking an anterior cross bite.(233)\n【save__datas】\t【3137】\tSupernumerary teeth that are buccally placed.\n【save__datas】\t【3138】\tAnterosuperior teeth overcrowding.(33)\n【save__datas】\t【3139】\tBy general rule， developing Class III malocclusions express themselves as an anterior cross bite in the mixed denti-tion. They can be dental， functional or skeletal. To make a diagnosis， the doctor must evaluate the following：\n【save__datas】\t【3140】\tThe profile of the patient.\n【save__datas】\t【3141】\tInclination of the maxilla.\n【save__datas】\t【3142】\tInclination of the upper and lower incisors.\n【save__datas】\t【3143】\tThe presence of a functional displacement between centric relation and centric occlusion.(5)\n【save__datas】\t【3144】\tHow to differentiate between a dental and a skeletal cross bite\n【save__datas】\t【3145】\t■ Dental evaluation： We must observe if the Class III molar relation is accompanied by an underjet. If the incisors are in edge to edge relation and the lower incisors are retroclined， we must suspect a compensated Class III malocclusion， meaning that the upper incisors are proclined and the lower incisors are retroclined to compensate the skeletal discrepancy. In case there is an underjet， this must be confirmed with a functional evaluation.)\n【save__datas】\t【3146】\t■ Functional evaluation： We must evaluate the rela-tion between the mandible and the maxilla to determine--connect--【3148】if there is a discrepancy in centric relation (CR) or in centric occlusion (CO). The forward positioning of the mandible can produce an abnormal dental contact that can generate a forward mandibular displacement. Patients with a forward mandibular displacement during closure or maximum intercuspidation may have a Class I skeletal pattern，a normal facial profile and a Class I molar relation in CR， but with a dental and skeletal Class III pattern in CO， a situation known as pseudo Class IlI malocclusion takes place. The elimination of the CO-CR displacement must reveal if it is only a simple Class I malocclusion or a compensated Class III malocclusion. On the other hand， a patient without deviation during closure most probably has a true Class III malocclusion.(55)\n【save__datas】\t【3150】\t■ Profile evaluation： This evaluation implies an exami-nation of the facial proportions， chin and face position， for which we must perform the following analysis：\n【save__datas】\t【3151】\t1\\. We must determine if the profile is concave，straight or convex. Generally patients with maxillary defi-ciency have a concave profile that manifests as a flattening of the infraorbitary ridge and of the zone next to the nose.(5)\n【len<10_filter】\t【3153】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【3154】\tChin position： we must cover the upper and lower lip toQ evaluate the position of the chin according to the nose， to the upper portion of the face and the forehead.

(12.33)\n【save__datas】\t【3171】\tThere is a Class III molar relation in centric oc-clusion and a Class I relation in centric relation， meaning that a mesial mandibular displacement must be made to attain intercuspidation.\n【save__datas】\t【3172】\t-The patient can reach an edge to edge incisal rela-tion in centric relation.\n【save__datas】\t【3173】\tThe facial profile is straight in centric relation and concave during maximum intercuspidation.\n【save__datas】\t【3175】\tA false ANB alteration can result from the cepha-lometric analisys.(33)\n【save__datas】\t【3180】\tFunctional anterior cross bites usually involve all four up-per incisors and the degree of version has little importance， due to the fact that the cross bite has been established by mandibular propulsion， causing a low tongue position， premature contact of temporary canines that are not worn down， entrap the maxilla， resulting in a functional forward displacement of the mandible to obtain maximum intercuspidation，(5.1231)\n【save__datas】\t【3182】\tThe classification of pseudo Class III comes from the fact that it is not an osseous hyperplasia or hypoplasia； man-dibular hyper propulsion originates this malocclusion. The osseous bases are well related and the origin of the problem is dental.(12)\n【save__datas】\t【3183】\tMany authors recommend that functional anterior cross bites in the primary dentition must be corrected as soon as they are identified， to favor optimal dental and skeletal development，(51231)\n【save__datas】\t【3184】\t3\\. Skeletal anterior cross bite：\n【save__datas】\t【3186】\tThe patient has a molar and canine Class III rela-tion in centric occlusion and centric relation.\n【save__datas】\t【3188】\tAn edge to edge incisor relation cannot be ob-tained in central relation.\n【save__datas】\t【3190】\tThe patient has a concave profile and a retrusive upper lip， predominant chin and a diminished lower third.\n【save__datas】\t【3191】\t-In the cephalometric analysis the SNA angle is smaller， SNB is increased and ANB is negative.\n【save__datas】\t【3192】\tHorizontal growth pattern.(3)\n【save__datas】\t【3195】\tVariables that can influence the correction of anterior cross bites\n【save__datas】\t【3196】\t1.The displacement from anterior centric relation to centric relation. The presence or absence of anterior displacement from centric relation (CR) to centric occlusion (CO) during mandibular closure must be established as a part of the diagnosis. The study of centric occlusion will determine the existence or not of a functional Class III problem. The patients with an anterior displacement are classified as pseudo Class Ill； the majority of the patients have a Class I molar relation in CR. Aside from the anterior displacement， other signs of pseudo Class III malocclusions are：--connect--【3197】a) The capacity of the patient to establish certain contact between the incisal edges of the upper incisors with the incisal edges of the lower inci sors in the most retrusive mandibular posture.--connect--【3198】b) The upper incisors can be more inclined toward the palate than normal.--connect--【3199】c)\n【save__datas】\t【3200】\tThe lower incisors can be more buccally inclined than normal\n【save__datas】\t【3201】\tWhen there is no detectable anterior displacement， the chances for being in the presence of a true Class III malocclusion increase. Aside from the lack of anterior displacement， other signs of true Class III malocclusion are：--connect--【3202】a) The incapacity of the upper and lower incisors to establish an edge to edge contact.--connect--【3203】b) The upper incisors can have a buccal inclina-tion.\n【save__datas】\t【3204】\tLower incisors can have a lingual inclination\n【save__datas】\t【3205】\tAlso， the skeletal relation indicates mandibular protrusion or maxillary retrusion.\n【save__datas】\t【3206】\tThe distinction between true Class III malocclusions and pseudo Class III maloclusions have a great impact upon the treatment plan， the prognosis and the stability of the correction. Pseudo Class III malocclusions can be treated in a very short period of time and rebound is easy to prevent. True Class III malocclusions are difficult to treat and to maintain， can require a very long time period of treatment\n【save__datas】\t【3207】\tIf the horizontal overbite is -2 mm to-3mm and only one tooth is involved， the tongue can be used to cor rect the anterior cross bite when the patient is in the primary or mixed dentition， only if there is enough space for the tooth. Once this has been corrected，the occlusion itself will prevent the relapse of the cross bite，(10)\n【save__datas】\t【3208】\t3\\. Anterior arch length. A crossed upper incisor must have enough space to be moved. If there is not enough available arch length， we must create the sufficient space before trying to uncross it. In straight wire mechanics， open coils are regularly used to create enough arch length to move the tooth to its appropri-ate position. In patients with a lot of overcrowding the extraction of a premolar and lengthy orthodontic treatment may be needed.(5.12)--connect--【3209】if treatment begins at a young age， and can sometimes culminate in maxillofacial surgery (5.12.30)\n【len<10_filter】\t【3210】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【3211】\tOverbite.Overbite has great impact upon treatment and retention of the teeth evolved in the cross bite When an anterior cross bite presents a deep anterior overbite， a posterior bite plane will be needed so the upper incisor can move forward without any occlusal interference from the lower incisors.Once this is cor rected， the stability of the retention will depend upon the presence of an adequate overbite. So，patients with incisor cross bite， associated with little or no overbite， are more difficult to treat and to retain.(5.12)\n【save__datas】\t【3214】\t5\\. Mandibular teeth alignment. The alignment of the upper teeth must not commence until the antero-superior teeth have been uncrossed. The premature alignment of the lower teeth usually complicates the treatment of the anterior cross bite (5)\n【save__datas】\t【3216】\t6\\. Retention. As explained before， an adequate over-bite and a normal inclination of the longer axis of the tooth to be treated are important for the stability of retention. Once the bite is uncrossed， the stabil-ity can be checked by taking off the wire from the braces for a two to three week period. If the upper or lower teeth remain stable， a retainer will not be needed. But if the teeth move toward the palate or the lips， they may need additional treatment and a retainer will be necessary.((55)\n【save__datas】\t【3219】\tPosterior cross bites are occlusal alterations on the trans-verse plane. (13.16) This type of bite has the buccal cusps of upper molars and premolars occluding on the fossas on the lower molars and premolars， in a way that， the lower teeth surpass bucally the upper teeth during occlusion，(11.14.16)\n【save__datas】\t【3220】\tThe cusp to cusp occlusion is an intermediate situation between normal occlusion and posterior cross bite. In this anomaly， there is no cuspid to fossa occlusion and it is considered an incomplete posterior cross bite.(16)\n【save__datas】\t【3222】\tEtiology of posterior cross bite\n【save__datas】\t【3223】\tThe most frequent etiological factors of posterior cross bite are：\n【save__datas】\t【3224】\t1\\. Genetic factors\n【save__datas】\t【3225】\tNMaxillary hypoplasia： Maxillary compression due to a lack of development can be accompanied with two different clinical patterns：--connect--【3226】a) Maxillary compression with dental overcrowd-ing， and lack of space for the eruption of the upper canines.--connect--【3227】b)CCompression with protrusive incisors with a Class II anteroposterior relation.\n【save__datas】\t【3228】\tIf there is a combination of transversal hypoplasia and insufficient maxillary anteroposterior development， the characteristic clinical pattern is a Class III caused by insuf-ficient maxillary development.Co Sometimes we can find insufficient hemi-maxillary development，presenting itself as an asymmetrical compression with posterior cross bite with the absence of mandibular deviation.(16)\n【save__datas】\t【3229】\tAccording to Chaconas and Schoder， the majority of pos-terior cross bites are caused by skeletal problems due to bilateral maxillary compressions.\n【save__datas】\t【3230】\tMandibular hyperplasia： presents itself in the trans-versal and anteroposterior planes， this is why posterior cross bites caused by mandibular hyperplasia in Class I are not frequent， but they are in true Class III cases.(16)\n【save__datas】\t【3231】\t■ Malformative syndromes： posterior cross bite can be associated with malformative syndromes like Treacher-Collins， Robin complex， achondroplasia， hemifacial mi-crosomia， congenital hemi-maxillary hypertrophy， etc\n【save__datas】\t【3232】\t2\\. Habits\n【save__datas】\t【3233】\tMouth breathing： Patients that breathe through the mouth as a habit usually share certain facial fea-tures， like \"adenoid fascia\" that can be resumed in half open mouth， insufficient nasal development with small nostrils， a short upper lip and dark rims under the eye lids.\n【save__datas】\t【3234】\tThe majority of the studies about the occlusal characteris-tics of mouth breathers show a high prevalence of posterior cross bites. Some authors establish a cause-effect between mouth breathing and posterior cross bite， because dur-ing mouth breathing the lips are partially open and the tongue is low， restraining the transversal development of the maxilla.(16)\n【save__datas】\t【3235】\tIt is also very common to find posterior cross bites in patients with hypertrophic tonsils or adenoids. But there are studies that sustain that the height of the up-per maxilla usually normalizes after the adenoid tissue is removed (2.16)\n【save__datas】\t【3236】\t■ Anomalous suction： the suction reflex is present in the newborn and tends to disappear with growth. The baby feeds and explores the environment with this reflex placing any object in between the gums， like a pacifier， a finger， the lower lip or a sheet. Suction is maintained until the teeth and mastication appear， if this reflex persists after the child is four years old， it is considered a habit.(216)\n【save__datas】\t【3237】\tThe most frequent suction habit is finger sucking， ofone or more fingers. The repercussions of this habit can derive in：--connect--【3238】a) A lower tongue position， so the tongue does not exert any pressure upon the palate--connect--【3239】b)\n【save__datas】\t【3240】\tBuccinator muscles hyperactivity， that tends to compress the palate.\n【len<10_filter】\t【3241】\tC)\n【save__datas】\t【3242】\tThe palate deepens and collapses， due to the active pressure that the finger exerts against the palate.\n【save__datas】\t【3243】\tThe possible alterations as a consequence of the habit are specially dental， and if they persist or are executed with--connect--【3244】greater force， can affect the alveolar process. Many studies done in children with posterior cross bite have encountered a very high prevalence of finger sucking habits in these patients. The proportion of girls with posterior cross bite is slightly higher than boys with the same problem. This difference is attributed to the fact that girls have a higher frequency of finger sucking habit.(216)\n【save__datas】\t【3245】\tAnother suction habit is pacifier habit. The prevalence of posterior cross bite in patients in the mixed dentition that have a suction habit is greater， and this habit has been catalogued as an important etiological factor in the development of this malocclusion.\n【save__datas】\t【3246】\tAccording to Larsson， posterior cross bite usually disap-pears spontaneously in the permanent dentition， due to the fact that the habit is interrupted before the eruption of the premolars and permanent canines，(16)\n【save__datas】\t【3247】\tInfantile deglutition： the typical deglutition pattern of a child before teeth erupt is characterized by the fact that the tongue is placed between the gingival pads and is projected forward. Deglutition is controlled by the contact of the lips， the tongue and the perioral muscles(16) The persistence of infantile deglutition can be provoked by hypertrophic tonsils， mouth breathing or psychological sucking habit. The tongue is interposed between the teeth to stabilize the mandible and to seal the oral cavity. The lack of tongue pressure and strong pressure of the buccinator muscles provoke a deficient transversal development of the maxi-lla， which is usually associated with an anterior open bite because the anterior teeth have not erupted yet.(2.16)\n【save__datas】\t【3248】\t■ Lingual interposition： the persistence of this habit is similar to the one just described， but the action of the tongue is prolonged through time. The role of the tongue in the etiology of malocclusions is related with a series of variables， like position， pressure， volume and time(16)\n【save__datas】\t【3249】\t3\\. Interferences and occlusal factors\n【save__datas】\t【3250】\tThe anatomic characteristics of teeth serve as a guide to es-tablish a correct occlusion， so any type of alteration in teeth anatomy or in the eruption sequence can provoke the devel-opment of posterior cross bites. The most common cauise of unilateral posterior cross bites is a functional deviation of the mandible， generally produced by occlusal interferences or premature contacts. The presence of occlusal interferences in the deciduous canines that are too long may be the cause--connect--【3251】of cross bites， because these teeth provoke a lateral deviation of the mandible during closure.(216)\n【len<10_filter】\t【3252】\t4.\n【len<10_filter】\t【3253】\tTrauma\n【save__datas】\t【3254】\tDental trauma in the deciduous dentition can displace the primary teeth or the buds of the permanent teeth， provoking an anomalous inclination of the upper teeth toward the palate and the apparition of a dental posterior cross bite. The same can occur if the trauma provokes the displacement of the permanent teeth.\n【save__datas】\t【3255】\tOther types of trauma can provoke mandibular or condyle fractures， that cause grave facial asymmetries in patients that are growing and the apparition of skeletal cross bites.(2.16)\n【save__datas】\t【3256】\tA. third group of trauma are the ones caused during birth with the manipulation of instruments.\n【save__datas】\t【3257】\t5\\. Other causes\n【save__datas】\t【3258】\tSome other factors exist that in an indirect way can favor the presence of posterior cross bites. One of them is an-kyloglossia. A short lingual frenum maintains the tongue in a low position， favoring the apparition of maxillary compression. (16)\n【save__datas】\t【3259】\tTypes of posterior cross bites\n【save__datas】\t【3260】\tPosterior cross bites can be：\n【save__datas】\t【3261】\tBilateral， which affects both maxillary hemiarches.\n【save__datas】\t【3262】\tUnilateral， affecting the right or the left hemiarch.\n【save__datas】\t【3263】\tOf an isolated tooth(16)\n【save__datas】\t【3264】\tThe following classification was proposed by Moyers(1966)， still being applied today.()\n【save__datas】\t【3265】\tFunctional cross bite\n【save__datas】\t【3266】\t■ These are produced when there is an occlusal inter ference that displaces the mandible to the left or the right during the last phase of closure.\n【save__datas】\t【3267】\tThey are unilateral cross bites.\n【save__datas】\t【3268】\tThere may be a chin deviation.(13)\n【save__datas】\t【3269】\tLower dental midline deviation as a consequence of the mandibular deviation(2)\n【save__datas】\t【3270】\tAlteration of the mandibular mechanics duringaper-ture： during this movement， the condyle of the side of the deviation will suffer a rotation movement； meanwhile the other side has a downward and forward movement. This alteration can induce asymmetric growth of the mandible therefore this problem must be immediately treated as soon as it is detected.(13)\n【save__datas】\t【3271】\tThe most frequent presentation of this malocclusion is a unilateral posterior cross bite， generally associated to a functional mandibular deviation，(16)\n【save__datas】\t【3272】\tFrom the cephalometric point of view we can find：\n【save__datas】\t【3273】\t-In the sagittal sense， there is a slight tendency to a osseo-dental Class III， a distal position of the upper molar； more linguoversion and retrusion of the upper incisors and moderate protrusion of the lower incisors.\n【save__datas】\t【3274】\t-In the vertically， we can find a dolychofacial ten-dency.\n【save__datas】\t【3275】\tTo make this diagnosis， we must manipulate the mandible to centric relation without dental occlusion. If the cross bite is functional， the midlines will coincide， the chin deviation will disappear and unstable transversal cusp to cusp rela-tion becomes evident (13)\n【save__datas】\t【3276】\tTreatment： sometimes they are corrected by eliminating the interference with occlusal grinding or crown remodel-ing of one or more teeth. In some cases the use of a dento alveolar expander will be needed，(13)\n【save__datas】\t【3278】\t2\\. Dentoalveolar cross bite\n【save__datas】\t【3279】\tIt can affect one tooth or a group of them.\n【save__datas】\t【3280】\tIn this malocclusion， there is an alteration in the di-rection of the longer axis of the upper and/or lower teeth， but the basal bone is not altered.\n【save__datas】\t【3281】\t■ The buccal cusps of the upper premolars and/or molar occlude in the fossas of the opposing lower teeth.\n【save__datas】\t【3282】\tThey are very frequent， in the primary and in the mixed and permanent dentition.\n【save__datas】\t【3283】\tGenerally， unilateral dento alveolar cross bites are functional， they are the most frequent alterations that af-fect a single tooth，(12-13.16)\n【save__datas】\t【3284】\tTreatment： Expanders like the Quad Helix， the Tandem or the palatine expander are used.(3)\n【save__datas】\t【3286】\t3\\. Skeletal cross bites\n【save__datas】\t【3287】\t■ They are produced by alterations in the transversal dimensions of the maxilla or the mandible， provoked by a growth alteration in some or both of them and can be observed in any stage of development，03)\n【save__datas】\t【3288】\tThe most frequent alteration is the insufficient growth of the upper maxilla. If the cross bite is unilateral it is usu-ally a transversal hypo-expansion of the maxilla， capable of premature cuspid contacts， that can result in a lateral deviation of the mandible.(36)\n【save__datas】\t【3289】\tThe etiological factors can be mouth breathing habits， atypical deglutition and thumb sucking， and can only be treated with orthopedics， only ifthe patient still has growth potential； if not， it must be corrected by surgical disjunction or surgically assisted orthopedic disjunction.(3)\n【save__datas】\t【3290】\tThe most frequent cause for this type of cross bite is mouth breathing， where we can observe a notorious com-pression of the maxilla that shortens the distance between molars， premolars and canines.\n【save__datas】\t【3291】\t■ It can also occur as a consequence of an asymmetry of the shape of the mandible (laterognatia). Mandibular--connect--【3292】laterognatia implicates a permanent deviation of the mandible； the morphology of the mandible can be altered on the condyle， the ramus， or the body(\n【save__datas】\t【3293】\tTreatment： the treatment of these cross bites is accom-plished with rapid maxillary expansion， and for this， appli-ances like the Hyrax or Hass are used， and in severe cases， orthognatic surgery is required.(13)\n【save__datas】\t【3296】\t4\\. Scissor bite\n【save__datas】\t【3297】\t■ It is the one in which the palatal aspect of an upper premolar or molar contacts the buccal aspect of the lower antagonist.(1316)\n【save__datas】\t【3298】\tIt generally affects only one tooth and can be caused by an eruption problem (a lingual deviation of the eruption trajectory of the lower teeth or buccal of the upper teeth).\n【save__datas】\t【3299】\tIt can also be caused by iatrogenic causes， like the excessive activation of an expansion appliance.()\n【save__datas】\t【3300】\tWhen all the teeth are in scissor bite， it is generally caused by a retrognatic mandible and it is called Brodie syndrome. This generates serious mandibular locking that causes traumatic micrognatia， because it impedes the growth of the mandible.(5.26)\n【save__datas】\t【3301】\tTreatment： the correction of this type of cross bite can only be done if it is dentoalveolar in nature. Expanders with inverse activation are used； buccal arches and sometimes crossed intermaxillary elastics are worn. 3)\n【save__datas】\t【3302】\tScissor bite can also be：\n【save__datas】\t【3303】\tBilateral or Brodie syndrome， which affects both hemiarches，\n【save__datas】\t【3304】\tUnilateral， if it affects the right or left hemiarch.\n【save__datas】\t【3305】\tOf an isolated tooth (16)\n【save__datas】\t【3307】\tDiagnosis of posterior cross bites\n【save__datas】\t【3308】\tFor the diagnosis of posterior cross bites we must elaborate a complete dental history chart， perform an intraoral and extraoral clinical exploration， a cephalometric trace over an X-ray， a posteroanterior X-ray (PA)， and an analysis of mounted study models on a semi adjustable articulator to view the position of the mandible in centric relation. Ir order to make an accurate diagnosis we must localize the precise site of the alteration， if it is localized only in the maxilla， the mandible or both(16)\n【save__datas】\t【3309】\t1\\. Tooth inclination. The buccolingual inclinations of the posterior teeth involved in a cross bite provide valuable information. If an upper molar in cross bite has a palatal inclination， it will have an advantageous position due to the fact that the correction of the cross bite improves with the buccal inclination of the molar On the other hand， if the upper molar in cross bite has a buccal inclination， it is probable that the cause is a narrowing of the entire upper arch in relation to the width of the lower arch. In these cases， the widening of all the upper arch is convenient with rapid maxillary expansion (RME)， instead of the further inclinement of the upper molars，)\n【save__datas】\t【3310】\t2\\. Lateral functional displacement during mandibu lar closure. The majority of patients with unilateral posterior cross bite displace their mandible to the side of the cross bite during closure in CO. The lateral displacement means that the cross bite is bilateral， and consequently， easy to treat with an appliance that can move both sides of the maxilla buccaly. In general， the lower dental midline is displaced to the side where the posterior cross bite is localized.\n【save__datas】\t【3311】\tWhen the displacement is not easily detected， we must ask the patient to open wide； if the lower den-tal midline is displaced toward the facial midline of the patient， or if it aligns during complete aperture with the upper dental midline， there is a functional displacement present. A relaxing occlusal guard used during one or two weeks can verify the presence or absence of such displacement. Occlusal guards or deprogramming guards help to detect lateral dis-placements in patients with mastication muscles that are programmed to close the mandible in a deviated position. If a complete examination discards the existence of a displacement， the cross bite is caused by a skeletal asymmetry.\n【save__datas】\t【3312】\t3\\. Estimation of the necessary expansion. If the necessary expansion of the upper arch is between2 mm to 4 mm and the upper molars are inclined toward the palate， a variety of removable or fixed appliances can be used， like the Quad Helix， the ther-mal expander， Tandem Loop， transpalatine arches， overlay， etc. If the upper expansion needed oscillates between 4 mm to 6 mm the best appliance to use is the Hyrax. A patient that needs more than 12 mm of expansion may require the use of a combination of a\n【save__datas】\t【3313】\tHyrax type screw with orthognatic surgery (surgical expansion).5)\n【save__datas】\t【3315】\tAge of the patient. In children and young adoles-cents， posterior unilateral and bilateral cross bites are easily treated. Patients with a unilateral posterior cross bite present a mandible displacement that can predispose the patient to temporomandibular joint disorders. These unilateral posterior cross bites with lateral displacement can be corrected in the primary， mixed or permanent dentition， being detected and treated at an early age.)\n【save__datas】\t【3316】\tPosterior cross bites in adolescents can be successfully corrected； but the expansion with a Hyrax is not easy， because the middle palatal suture is ossified making separation difficult. For these patients we recommend the expansion with a Hyrax screw assisted by surgical expansion.(5)\n【save__datas】\t【3317】\tAdults with bilateral posterior cross bites (without displacement between CR and CO) are sometimes left with this functional bite. This is because，in adults， posterior cross bites are mainly corrected inclining the upper and lower molars； the results are usually unstable and tend to rebound.\n【save__datas】\t【3319】\tThese malocclusions must have early treatment for vari-ous reasons， among them：\n【save__datas】\t【3320】\t● Once the posterior cross bite is installed it will not correct spontaneously.\n【save__datas】\t【3321】\tIt provokes wear of the crossed teeth.\n【save__datas】\t【3322】\tIt provokes periodontal problems due to occlusal trauma，\n【save__datas】\t【3323】\tIt provokes interferences in the growth and develop-ment of the dental arches.\n【save__datas】\t【3324】\tIn cases of functional cross bites， these show a lat-eral mandibular shift due to the presence of occlusal interferences with condyle position alterations. The condyle on the side of the cross bite is deviated to the posterosuperior side， meanwhile the condyle on the normal side places itself in the anteroinferior side of the temporal glenoid cavity.\n【save__datas】\t【3325】\tIf these deviations are corrected at an earlyage， we will obtain adequate eruption of the permanent teeth.\n【save__datas】\t【3326】\tThe skeletal relation of the osseous bases is improved.\n【save__datas】\t【3327】\tIt provides mouth closure without deviations.\n【save__datas】\t【3328】\tThe treatment for posterior cross bite must commence as soon as the malocclusion is diagnosed， being conditioned to the maturity and cooperation degree of the patient. The most indicated treatment for the correction of skeletal type cross bite is through maxillary disjunction.\n【save__datas】\t【3329】\tDisjunction\n【save__datas】\t【3330】\tWe usually require palatal expansion for the correction of skeletal transversal discrepancies with the combina-tion of orthodontic and orthopedic movements.(17 Rapid maxillary expansion (disjunction) is done to increase the transversal dimension to correct skeletal cross bites， and at the same time， to increase dental arch length. For this purpose we utilize expanders that produce intense trans-versal forces on the lateral dentoalveolar sectors of the upper dental arch.\n【save__datas】\t【3331】\tInitially， the transverse forces will buccaly incline the lateral segments， and if the forces are strong enough， the disjunc-tion of the mid palatal suture can occur (disjunction)， the same happens with all the suture complex of the maxilla. Rapid maxillary expansion (RME)， is indicated when the expansion necessities are greater than 4 mm or 5 mm and when the origin of the discrepancy is skeletal.(13.17)\n【save__datas】\t【3333】\tSome authors recommend slow expansion (0.5 mm to 1mm per week)， because they say that a physiologic suture adjustment occurs. 17 But other studies indicate that if the expansion is slow， all that we are going to obtain is a dental--connect--【3334】expansion (teeth in a buccal position) rather than a basal expansion. Those who support RME have as theoretical fundament that applying a rapid force to the posterior teeth， these teeth would not have enough time to incline and that the force will transfer to the suture and the suture will open， meanwhile the teeth will minimally move. We can obtain 0.2 mm to 0.5 mm per day with inter molar length increment of up to 8 mm.30)\n【save__datas】\t【3335】\tRME is obtained in 10 to 30 days， but the expander must remain in the mouth during six months to allow new bone to form in the suture，(30) The goal of palatal disjunction is to maximize skeletal movement and to minimize dental movement， meanwhile the physiologic midpalatal suture adjustment takes place.\n【save__datas】\t【3336】\tEffects on the maxillary complex. When the forces applied to the teeth and the maxillary alveolar pro-cesses exceed the necessary limits for orthodontic dental movement， a disjunction is produced.The pressure that orthopedic force exerts， is going to act upon the midpalatal suture splitting it. A compres-sion of the periodontal ligament that will incline the alveolar processes and a gradual aperture of the mid palatal suture will occur. From the frontal point of view， the separation occurs in a pyramid form， the base is located toward the anterior dental sector and the fulcrum is on the Nasion point. Occlusally， the expansion is greater in the anterosuperior sector at the incisor level (fan aperture) than at the posterior edge of the suture at the molar level， where the transversal dimension is maintained by the pterygoid processes that， being of endochondral origin， have structures that are hardly modifiable with this therapy. All this provokes a descent and forward position of the “A point of approximately 1mm to 2 mm， (61925.30.34.35)\n【save__datas】\t【3337】\tII.Effects on the alveolar processes. Because the bone is resilient， the inclination of the alveolar processes occurs early during disjunction. The majority of the forces applied tend to dissipate within 5 to 6 months and once the stabilization is terminated， any residual force can provoke a rebound effect， which makes overcorrection necessary. The slower we make the expansion， the more dental expansion effect and less basal expansion we will have. When an osseous or basal expansion is done， a force that produces hyalini-zation anchors the teeth to the bone and the aperture--connect--【3338】of the suture happens. The dental organ begins to move after three weeks， thanks to the indirect osseous resorption that intervenes in the dental alveolus. For this reason， we must take advantage of these three weeks to activate the disjunction appliance， meanwhile， the teeth serve as support for the expander to oppose maximum resistance due to the ligament hyalinization. If the applied force is light and slow， the hyalinization tissue is minimal， and therefore， we will have more teeth buccoversion than suture aperture.(530.34)\n【save__datas】\t【3339】\tIII. Dental effects\n【save__datas】\t【3340】\ta. The disjunction provokes the opening of a distema between the central incisors. This diastema closes in 2 to 4 weeks due to the reciprocal traction of the transeptal fibers that connect the central incisors， thus producing an increase of arch length.(13.30.34)\n【save__datas】\t【3342】\tb. The transeptal periodontal fibers unite the crowns of the incisors rapidly， and the roots converge in only four months.(30.39)\n【save__datas】\t【3343】\tC： A slight extrusion and palatinization of the central incisors can be observed. It is believed that the pala-tinization is caused by the stretching of the perioral muscles.(6)\n【save__datas】\t【3344】\td. A change in the axial inclination of the molars ac-companied with a slight extrusion is observed. This inclination provokes a positive torque of the teeth， and with this， a lowering of the palatal cusps below the occlusal plane.(13.30)--connect--【3345】e， It favors the correction of anterior open bite， most of all in patients in the primary or mixed dentition. The RME provokes a slight advance of the \"A\"point，(13)\n【save__datas】\t【3346】\tIV. Effects over the mandible. It has been proven that the results of the rapid maxillary expansion result in a simultaneous expansion of the lower arch. Hass observed an increase of 4 mm to 6 mm in the inte-canine and inter-molar width. The mandible tends to rotate downward and backward due to the inclination and extrusion of the upper molars. For this reason the anterior bite opens.(30.35)\n【save__datas】\t【3347】\tV. Effects over the adjacent facial structures， An occlusal x-ray examination shows that the midpalatal suture aperture extends through the horizontal processes of the palatal bones， but the distance between the two expanded halves is very narrow. It is very important to remember that the main resistance to RME is not the suture but the structures that surround it， most of all the sphenoid and zygomatic bones. The resistance increases significantly in the parts closer to the base of the skull.\n【save__datas】\t【3348】\tAnatomically， RME also produces an increase of the width of the nasal cavity due to the descent of the floor of the nasal cavity， resulting in an increase of the permeability of the airways. The nasal cavity widens 1.9 mm in average and at the lower turbinate level the average is between 8mm to 10 mm.(25，30，34)\n【save__datas】\t【3349】\tDisjunction indications\n【save__datas】\t【3351】\tIt is done in patients whose maxillary suture system has not fully matured.03)\n【save__datas】\t【3353】\tIn collapsed upper dental arches related to a Class III skeletal malocclusion.\n【save__datas】\t【3354】\t3\\.

This maxillary traction is possible because the craniofacial complex is very malleable and--connect--【3496】we can obtain significant changes in the three planes of space.

Petit modified the basic concept of Delaire， changing the anatomy of the face mask， he also increased the magnitude of the generated force exerted by the appliance and also reduced treatment time.(919)\n【save__datas】\t【3499】\tThis appliance (also called inverted traction mask) in com-bination with a fixed palatal expansion appliance (Hyrax)， is the proposed method of treatment for the interception of true skeletal Class III malocclusions with an anterior cross bite.

The course ofaction in these cases is to flatten this curve； this can be done applying torque on the solder point of the bands with the transpalatal arch to correct， the buccal position of the tooth or the cross bite， depending on the position of the tooth.(19)\n【save__datas】\t【3828】\tOn the other hand， these arches can be activated to establish and maintain the width of the arches， prevent molar rotations，correct mesiodistal asymmetries，correct asymmetric and symmetric cross bites and to correct third order axial inclinations.(5)\n【save__datas】\t【3829】\tAnother situation that can be presented is the unilateral constriction of the upper arch； generally it is a posterior cross bite or a dentoalveolar edge to edge， in which we can use for the correction of this problem a transpalatal arch with an extension arm that is in contact with all the palatal aspects of the teeth that are in cross bite(it is the same principle as the Quad Helix). This arm is going to exert pressure over these teeth， and with the action of the fixed appliances， is going to favor the correction of the malocclusion producing a unilateral dentoalveolar expansion of the maxilla， increasing this way the dental arch length.\n【save__datas】\t【3831】\tAdvantages\n【len<10_filter】\t【3832】\t1.\n【save__datas】\t【3833】\tIt is a fixed appliance in which we do not need patient cooperation.\n【save__datas】\t【3835】\tEconomic and easy to make.\n【save__datas】\t【3836】\tAlthough it is cement activated， we can perform subsequent activations， simply plying the lateral arm near the solder joint point.\n【save__datas】\t【3837】\t5\\.

We must do some stripping on the teeth involved in the posterior cross bite， to liberate the contact points and to ease their movements，\n【len<10_filter】\t【3848】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【3849】\tWe recommend over expanding 1 mm to 2 mm due to the rebound effect.\n【save__datas】\t【3850】\t3\\. Once the bite is uncrossed， we must leave the appli-ance cemented for 3 months.\n【len<10_filter】\t【3851】\t4.\n【save__datas】\t【3852】\tOnce the retention time period has passed， we can cut off the arm and leave the transpalatal arch as moderate anchorage.\n【save__datas】\t【3853】\t5\\. The omega of the transpalatal arch must be separated1 mm to 2 mm from the palatal mucosa，\n【save__datas】\t【3854】\tInverted NiTi arch\n【save__datas】\t【3855】\tThe use of an inverted NiTi is indicated in those pa-tients that have a bilateral posterior cross bites in the mixed dentition with no more than 2 mm of cross bite， in which we need to expand the dentoalveolar process to correct the malocclusion. This method is based upon the elasticity that the NiTi wires have and the tendency that the arches have to return to their original position.(2) To apply this technique we must use 0.018\"x0.025\"or 0.019\"x0.025\" rectangular NiTi wires， to prevent the wire from turning around in the slot of the brace. Bioforce wire， from GAC， is much easy to manipulate if sprayed with tetrafluoroethane before placing them inverted. We must take account that the first movement that these teeth are going to experience is a crown inclination， meaning that it is into the teeth are going to tip first due to the compres-sion of the periodontal fibers； after this the alveolar process will remodel. This is the moment in which the bodily movement will begin.\n【save__datas】\t【3857】\tAdvantages\n【save__datas】\t【3859】\tWe do not depend upon patient cooperation.\n【save__datas】\t【3860】\tThe bite can be corrected in 2 to 3 weeks； taking into account that the optimal force to move an upper first molar is around 120 g (with this force the molar will move 1 mm per month)， and the force generated by the Bioforce arch is around 280 g in the posterior sector which means that the movement will take half of the required time.\n【len<10_filter】\t【3861】\t4.\n【save__datas】\t【3862】\tBecause it is a rectangular wire the molar torque can be controlled during the dentoalveolar expansion.\n【save__datas】\t【3863】\tDisadvantages\n【save__datas】\t【3864】\t1\\. We must have a strict control of the appointments in patients that need to correct their posterior cross--connect--【3865】bite with these NiTi inverted arches， because the wire will be placed active and the movement that will be generated is constant and very fast， if we do not have this control， non-desired movements can happen.\n【save__datas】\t【3866】\t2\\. The patient can refer pain， because this is a fast move-ment.\n【save__datas】\t【3867】\t3\\. The tubes and the posterior braces can debond due to the force generated by the arch.\n【len<10_filter】\t【3868】\t4.\n【save__datas】\t【3869】\tThe arch will produce an excessive proclination of the anterior sector.\n【save__datas】\t【3870】\tRecommendations\n【save__datas】\t【3871】\t1\\. We must not leave these arches more than 60 days in the mouth in order to avoid undesired movements.\n【len<10_filter】\t【3872】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【3873】\tTo counteract the proclination of the anterior sector we recommend the use of Class II elastics and to ferulize the sector with 0.012\"stainless steel ligature wire.\n【save__datas】\t【3874】\t3\\. In case the patient refers pain， prescribe Tylenol for the first two days.\n【save__datas】\t【3875】\tThe overlay is a useful appliance for dentoalveolar expan-sion. It consists of an open 0.028\" or 0.036\" stainless steel wire that is going to be inserted in the accessory tubes of the bands of the first upper molars and bound to the arch wire with stainless steel ligature wire. The overlay is indicated in unilateral， bilateral posterior cross bite cases， because it produces an upper dento alveolar expansion (mainly the molars). The term overlay applies to every wire or accessory wire placed over the main arch wire， to expand， intrude or，--connect--【3878】in this case， the overlay is placed to produce dentoalveolar expansion in the correction of posterior cross bites.\n【save__datas】\t【3879】\tAdvantages\n【save__datas】\t【3880】\t1， This arch is indicated in cases in which inter arch discrepancy is not greater than 1 mm or 2 mm.\n【save__datas】\t【3882】\tWe do not depend upon patient cooperation.\n【save__datas】\t【3883】\tIt does not need any reactivations.\n【save__datas】\t【3884】\tDisadvantages\n【save__datas】\t【3886】\tIt is not indicated in patients with bad oral hygiene because it tends to retain food particles\n【save__datas】\t【3887】\tRecommendations\n【save__datas】\t【3888】\t1\\. We must not tense the ligature wire too much because we can debond some braces，\n【save__datas】\t【3890】\tThe expansion produced is dentoalveolar， so it will provoke the extrusion of the palatal cusps， thus， the bite is going to open and the lower third of the face is going to increase.\n【len<10_filter】\t【3891】\t4.\n【save__datas】\t【3892】\tOnce the bite is corrected， we must maintain the overlay in the mouth for a 3 month period to allow the bite to settle.\n【save__datas】\t【3893】\t5\\. Not recommended in cases of more than 2 mm of--connect--【3894】discrepancy.\n【save__datas】\t【3895】\t6\\. It can be activated uni or bilaterally depending on the case，\n【len<10_filter】\t【3896】\t7.\n【save__datas】\t【3897】\tIt can be combined with an open main arch or a straight NiTi arch.\n【save__datas】\t【3898】\tCrossed elastics or\"Z\" elastics\n【save__datas】\t【3899】\tAny application of a force through an elastic induces and uses a certain combination of force and displacement， in which the elastic deforms due to the pressure exerted and at the same time the force is liberated. This principle is applied to all intraoral elastics that are used to co-assist in the orthodontic treatment.“Z\" elastics are an important auxiliary that we use in orthodontic therapy to uncross a tooth or a group of teeth. The elastics are placed on the palatine aspects of the upper teeth to be uncrossed to the buccal hooks of the lower teeth. The elastics must be 1/8”in diameter. The effect and activation of these elastics are incremented by the mandibular movements.(29)\n【save__datas】\t【3901】\tWe must bond direct adhesion buttons on the palatine aspects of the teeth that we want to uncross， and from these buttons， place the\"Z\" elastics stretching them to the buccal hooks of the lower teeth.\n【save__datas】\t【3903】\tAdvantages\n【save__datas】\t【3904】\t1\\. It is a very effective orthodontic auxiliary for the un-crossing of an individual tooth or a group of teeth.\n【save__datas】\t【3906】\tEconomic.\n【save__datas】\t【3907】\t3Easy to place and to take off by the patient.\n【save__datas】\t【3909】\tThe uncrossing of the bite is relatively fast.\n【save__datas】\t【3910】\tDisadvantages\n【save__datas】\t【3911】\t1\\. We depend 100 % upon patient cooperation for the elastics to be effective.\n【len<10_filter】\t【3912】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【3913】\tThe elastics retain foul odors due to humidity absorp-tion.\n【save__datas】\t【3914】\t3\\. The elastics can easily break. This happens because the patient \"bites\" the elastics when the patient oc-cludes.\n【len<10_filter】\t【3915】\t4.\n【save__datas】\t【3916】\tDental contact points are produced， which can pro-voke TMJ alterations.\n【save__datas】\t【3917】\t5\\. Not always well accepted by the patient.\n【save__datas】\t【3918】\t6\\. Due to the force produced by the elastics， the lower braces or the direct adhesion buttons may debond.\n【len<10_filter】\t【3919】\t7.\n【save__datas】\t【3920】\tIf we prescribe elastics with too much force， the pa-tient can refer tooth pain or TMJ pain.\n【save__datas】\t【3921】\tRecommendations\n【save__datas】\t【3923】\tIt is recommendable that after we have uncrossed any tooth， 3 months before we take off the braces we should perform supracrestal fiberotomy on the tooth that was crossed， because these cases are very likely to rebound，\n【save__datas】\t【3925】\tWe must have a periodic control over the use of the elastics， because the crossed tooth can move more than planned and provoke a scissor bite.\n【save__datas】\t【3926】\t4\\. We must tell the patient to change the elastics every24 hours.\n【save__datas】\t【3927】\t5\\. The recommended elastics will be of 6 Oz with a 1/8\"diameter.\n【save__datas】\t【3928】\t6\\. We can tell the patient to chew gum， in order to increment mandibular movement and to distend the elastics， accelerating the dental uncrossing.\n【save__datas】\t【3929】\t7\\. We recommend stripping in the tooth to be uncrossed and the neighboring teeth in order to extend a bit more the contact surface of the tooth and to accelerate the process.\n【save__datas】\t【3930】\t8\\. If the collapse is only in the maxilla， the lower teeth should be ferulized in order to avoid their lingualiza-tion.\n【save__datas】\t【3931】\t9\\. To accelerate the dental uncrossing， we can place a bite plane to open the posterior bite.\n【save__datas】\t【3932】\t10.We can place open arches on the upper dental arch and closed arches on the lower dental arch.\n【save__datas】\t【3933】\t11\\. We must obtain the adequate space for the correct positioning of the tooth in the arch.\n【len<10_filter】\t【3935】\tHass\n【save__datas】\t【3936】\tThis appliance was the first rapid maxillary expander and was popularized by Hass in the 60’s. It is constituted by：\n【save__datas】\t【3937】\t1\\. Cemented bands on the first upper premolars and molars.\n【len<10_filter】\t【3938】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【3939】\tPalatine connection wires that are soldered to the bands， which can also be extended through the buc---connect--【3940】cal aspects of the premolars and molars， in order to provide stiffness to the appliance.\n【save__datas】\t【3941】\t3\\. Two acrylic components assented on the palatine vault in contact with the palatal mucosa.\n【len<10_filter】\t【3942】\t4.\n【save__datas】\t【3943】\tAn expansion screw imbedded in the acrylic compo-nents on the midline of the palate.\n【save__datas】\t【3944】\tDr. Hass， in his studies， sustains that this appliance pro-duces a bodily movement of the teeth due to the acrylic support of the appliance，because these forces are not only applied on the teeth， but also on the soft and hard tissues of the palate，(19)\n【save__datas】\t【3945】\tThis appliance， in its active phase， liberates lateral forces， and in its passive phase contains the obtained expansion. The active phase begins 24 hours after the appliance is placed and it must be activated two times in the morn-ing and two times at night. This phase is going to last 2to 3 weeks depending upon the degree of collapse of the maxilla. The passive phase of the treatment consists in the aSSIV permanence of the appliance in the mouth during 3 to 6months， period in which the suture will reorganize and the accumulated forces will dissipate，(18)\n【save__datas】\t【3947】\tAdvantages\n【save__datas】\t【3948】\t1\\. The Hass expander can liberate forces between 4Kg to 5Kg， ideal for the separation of the mid palatal suture.\n【save__datas】\t【3950】\tIt is a rigid appliance due to the presence of the acrylic palatal components\n【save__datas】\t【3952】\tIn cases in which this appliance is going to be used with a face mask， the acrylic must be extended to cover the occlusal aspects of the molars and premolars.\n【save__datas】\t【3955】\tDisadvantages\n【save__datas】\t【3956】\t1\\. Oral hygiene becomes a bit more difficult.\n【len<10_filter】\t【3957】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【3958】\tGingival inflammation of the palatal vault caused by the acrylic components.\n【save__datas】\t【3959】\t3\\.

A very strict control is indispensable to avoid any excessive expansion.\n【save__datas】\t【3968】\t4\\. Once the expansion process has ended， ferulize the screw in the obtained position with ligature in the perforations of the screw， or block the screw with acrylic to avoid any movement.(3)\n【save__datas】\t【3970】\t5\\. In case the gingival tissue becomes irritated， we rec-ommend the removal of the appliance and indicate the use of a mouth wash with clorhexidine gluconate(please refer to Lesions and Urgencies during Orth-odontic Treatment chapter).\n【save__datas】\t【3971】\t6\\. The use of an expander with acrylic on the occlusal aspects of the teeth can be very useful to impede the over-inclination of the molars and premolars.\n【len<10_filter】\t【3972】\t7.\n【save__datas】\t【3973】\tDo not extract any premolars until the expansion has been completed.\n【save__datas】\t【3974】\t8\\. We can use the primary first and second molars as anchorage of the bands， but only if the molars have good root length.\n【save__datas】\t【3975】\t9\\. Do not move any molars or premolars before the expansion， because this can increase the mobility and inclination of the molars and premolars，(25)\n【len<10_filter】\t【3976】\tHyrax\n【save__datas】\t【3977】\tIt is the most commonly used rapid maxillary expansion screw in patients that are in the mixed or early permanent dentition. It was designed by Briederman and it is totally--connect--【3978】made of stainless steel and does not have any acrylic， so it is very hygienic.\n【save__datas】\t【3979】\tThe appliance is constituted by：\n【save__datas】\t【3980】\t1\\. Four bands，2 on the first premolars and 2 on the first permanent molars.\n【save__datas】\t【3981】\t2\\. An expansion screw placed on the midline of the palate separated 3 mm from the palatal mucosa. This separation is important， because when the maxilla is separated ， the palatal vault descends.(1934)\n【save__datas】\t【3982】\t3\\. It also has two palatal support arches soldered to the band providing more rigidity to the appliance. In case the premolars have not erupted yet， the extension arms are contoured up to the first primary molar.\n【save__datas】\t【3985】\tAdvantages\n【save__datas】\t【3986】\t1\\. It is very hygienic because it does not have any acrylic.\n【save__datas】\t【3988】\tDepending on the transversal requirements of the patient we can choose among 8 mm， 11 mm and13 mm screws.\n【save__datas】\t【3989】\t3\\. It is a very effective appliance.\n【len<10_filter】\t【3990】\t4.\n【save__datas】\t【3991】\tThe addition of acrylic on the occlusal aspects of the molars and premolars will prevent the over-inclina-tion of the teeth that serve as anchorage.\n【save__datas】\t【3994】\tExtremely strong.(3)\n【save__datas】\t【3995】\tWe can obtain orthopedic effects even in patients in which growth has almost ceased.\n【save__datas】\t【3996】\t8\\. It modifies the mandibular posture， placing it in a lower and backward position， due to the extru-sion of the palatine cusps of the upper molars and premolars，(34)\n【save__datas】\t【3997】\t9\\.

During the contention period we must block the appliance with ligature passing it through the acti-vation orifices of the screw. We can also block the screw with acrylic.\n【save__datas】\t【4024】\tSurgical disjunction\n【save__datas】\t【4025】\tSurgical disjunction is indicated in adults with skeletal type unilateral or bilateral posterior cross bite， in which the medial palatine suture is completely ossified and the discrepancy between the dental arches is greater than12 mm. This disjunction consists in surgically disarticulat-ing the upper maxilla with a series of osteotomies； after this is preformed a Hyrax expansion screw is placed. The osteotomies are done on the lateral walls of the maxilla. and on the medial palatine suture， then the Hyrax screw with 4 turns is placed.(2)\n【save__datas】\t【4026】\tOnce the osteotomy is done， we indicate two activations twice a day to the patient until the posterior cross bite is completely uncrossed.\n【save__datas】\t【4030】\tAdvantages\n【save__datas】\t【4031】\t1\\.

There are many non-extraction treatment modalities for Class II malocclusion. One of them consists in converting the Class II molar relation into a Class I molar relation； in order to accomplish this we must distally displace the upper first molars，(15.38)\n【save__datas】\t【4091】\tThe most frequent dentoskeletal disharmony in the Anglo-Saxon population is the Class II malocclusion. This distoclusion may be the result of a retrognatic man-dible， of a prognathic maxilla or a combination of both， although some authors (McNamara， Hilgers， Chaconas， Proffit) coincide in that mandibular deficiencies are more common than maxillary excesses， but in many occasions the distal relation is a product of the mesiogresion of the posterosuperior sectors that bring as a consequence the lack of proper space for the correct alignment of the anterior teeth.(23.35) Dentally， the mesiobuccal cusp of the first upper molar occludes in front of the buccal sulcus of the first lower molar. The disadvantage of this lies in the lack of available space in the upper dental arch， creating the need to utilize appliances that can generate or stretch the available space in order to act distally and transversely.(36.38)\n【save__datas】\t【4092】\tOne of the first appliances used for molar distalization was the Head Gear， used by Angle in 1887. In 1961 Kloehn pro-posed the early treatment with the head gear to redirect the growth of the maxilla and exert \"a slight force on the teeth that must be moved. The objective of Kloehn was to distal-ize the upper molars in order to obtain a functional relation with the lower teeth. Graber noticed that， when the extra oral traction was used upon the first upper molar， when the second upper molar had not fully erupted， the first molar--connect--【4093】inclined distally but did not move in a bodily manner. In order to prevent the inclination of the molar； Cetlin in 1983combined the extra oral force with an intraoral force. He used the first force partially and the intraoral force (with removable appliances) was used full time. The force of the removable appliances， used constantly， inclines the crown distally and the head gear controls the position of the root， resulting in a bodily movement of the molar.(29) The principle of extra oral distalization is that the line of action must pass through the center of resistance of the molar. In order to accomplish a successful distalization treatment the amount of force applied and the time of use are very important. There are many criteria over the amount of force that must be applied and the time of use of the head gear. Tenenbaum suggests 12 ounces or 300g force that can be incremented. Muir and Reed recommend500 g per side. The extra oral traction must be worn for at least 12 hours a day， but preferably it must be between 14to 16 hours in average.(5，29.33，36，38)\n【save__datas】\t【4094】\tThe extra oral arch must be separated 3 mm to 5 mm from the anterior teeth approximately and must be adjusted each time we to obtain a desired movement.(29.36)\n【save__datas】\t【4095】\tDuring distalization we must be sure the molars do not have any occlusal interferences， in case there are， we should place an anterior bite plane in order to aid in the distalization. Unilateral distal movements will be done modifying the outer arm of the appliance (Please refer to Open Bite chapter).\n【save__datas】\t【4096】\tThe use of the extra oral arch can provoke many movements：\n【save__datas】\t【4097】\t1\\. A distal force and a flattening of the occlusal plane， in which the extra oral traction must be applied over the center of resistance of the molar.\n【save__datas】\t【4099】\tA distal force and a settlement of the occlusal plane， in which the extra oral traction must be applied under the center of resistance of the molar\n【save__datas】\t【4100】\t3\\. A distal force without changes of the occlusal plane， in which the extra oral traction passes through the center of resistance of the molar. (26，35，36.38)\n【save__datas】\t【4101】\tUnfortunately， we need 100% cooperation of the patient with this appliance.\n【save__datas】\t【4103】\tThere are three very important points that we must keep in mind during first upper molar distalization：\n【save__datas】\t【4104】\t1.According to Bussick， the best moment to distalize the molars is before the second molars are totally erupted. Gianelly recommends distalization when there is a space between the distal aspect of the first upper molar and the semi erupted crown of the second molar.(36.38)\n【len<10_filter】\t【4105】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【4106】\tIt is important to keep in mind that mouth aperture is done upon the condoyle axis， so aperture and closure movement are like the movement of a pair of scissors (scissor or hinge effect)； we must keep in mind this effect because the distalizing movement tends to open the bite just like when we place a pen in the closing movement of a pair of scissors； the more we distalize the molar the more we are going to open the bite.(36.38)\n【save__datas】\t【4107】\tThis effect is favorable in patients with deep bites， but coun-terproductive in patients with open bite or hyperdivergent growth tendency； this is why this effect must be taken into consideration during distalization.(36，38)\n【save__datas】\t【4109】\t3\\. Constant forces move teeth faster than intermit-tent forces.\n【save__datas】\t【4110】\tDue to the fact that distalizing forces move teeth against the normal mesial movement tendency (that is always present) they were rejected for a long time. But with the arrival of new elastic materials， many orthodontists have reapplied this technique again.(5)\n【save__datas】\t【4111】\tThe distalizing appliance must include the following characteristics：\n【save__datas】\t【4112】\tMust not require patient cooperation.\n【save__datas】\t【4113】\tHigh degree of biomechanical control.\n【save__datas】\t【4114】\tCompact design.\n【save__datas】\t【4115】\tMinimal interference when the patient eats or speaks.\n【save__datas】\t【4116】\tAbsence of pain during the distalizing process.\n【save__datas】\t【4117】\tEasy activalion.\n【save__datas】\t【4118】\tCompatibility with other orthodontic techniques.\n【save__datas】\t【4119】\tAutomatic cessation of the distalizing movement.\n【save__datas】\t【4120】\tMust be easy to clean. 15-79，15，17.1822-2426，33.35.36.38)\n【save__datas】\t【4121】\tDistalizing indications\n【save__datas】\t【4122】\tUnilateral or bilateral dental Class II relation.\n【save__datas】\t【4123】\tIncreased overjet (up to 5 mm).\n【save__datas】\t【4124】\tIncreased overbite (deep bite).\n【save__datas】\t【4125】\tMidline discrepancy.\n【save__datas】\t【4126】\tMinimal or non-existing dental overcrowding.\n【save__datas】\t【4127】\tPatients with early mixed or permanent dentition.\n【save__datas】\t【4128】\tPatients with upper dentoalveolar protrusion.\n【save__datas】\t【4129】\tPatients with minimal skeletal problems.\n【save__datas】\t【4130】\tNormo or hypodivergent patients.\n【save__datas】\t【4131】\tPatients that do not accept extractions.\n【save__datas】\t【4132】\tAnother indication for upper molar distalization is when we decide to extract a permanent second molar (due to caries or other causes) complicated with anterior overcrowding or an ectopic canine. In these cases the third molar will occupy the space of the extracted second molar.(1.5-7.9.15，17，18，22-24，26，33，35，36.38)\n【save__datas】\t【4133】\tDistalization counter indications\n【save__datas】\t【4134】\tPatients that grow vertically.\n【save__datas】\t【4135】\tDolichocephalic patients.\n【save__datas】\t【4136】\tPatients with open bite tendency.\n【save__datas】\t【4137】\tOverjet greater than 5 mm.\n【save__datas】\t【4138】\tIn some cases with tongue protraction.\n【save__datas】\t【4139】\tIn adult patients we must employ another type of treatment1.5-7915，1718.22-26.26，33，35，36.38)\n【save__datas】\t【4140】\tRecommendations\n【save__datas】\t【4141】\t本 In young patients， the best moment to distalize is before the second molars are totally erupted.

To keep the patient comfortable， the distal portion of the wire is bent toward the palate. Usually there is none or very little discomfort to the patient.(16，3134)\n【save__datas】\t【4168】\tWe must compress the coil 10 mm in order to activate it. This means that the coil， in a passive state， is 10 mm larger than the space between the distal wing of the brace of the first premolar and the tube of the first molar. (16313940)\n【save__datas】\t【4169】\tDuring distalization， the coil opens and loses force， in this moment we can replace it with a larger one or we can place a sliding acrylic pearl on the mesial or distal end of the coil and compress it again.(2631.40)\n【save__datas】\t【4170】\tWith the 100 gof activation， the coil can distalize the up-per molar 1.5 mm per month， with approximately 20% of anterior anchorage loss，(23.31，39.40)\n【save__datas】\t【4171】\tThe compressed coil slides the molar on the arch wire， which can be continuous or sectioned.\n【save__datas】\t【4174】\tMiura and cols. compared the properties of japanese NiTi coil with traditional stainless steel coil. They found that NiTi coil has more resilience and maintains a more constant and light force than steel coil. Kelles studied the amount of millimeters distalized in a unilateral manner with a NiTi open coil in combination with an anterior bite plane. The NiTi coil was placed from the distal wing of the brace of the first premolar to the tube of the first molar(the first premolars were anchored with a Nance button). He determined that the NiTi coil could move the molar distally 4.9 mm in 6.1 months with 5.2\" of distal tipping， but， as negative side effects there was also 1.3 mm of loss of anterior anchorage due to mesial migration of the first premolar (anchored with a Nance Button)， there was also--connect--【4177】a 1.8 mm increase of incisor proclination and 2.1 mm of overjet increase，(31，34)\n【save__datas】\t【4178】\tAdvantages\n【save__datas】\t【4180】\tEasy to activate.\n【save__datas】\t【4181】\tThe cost is minimal.\n【save__datas】\t【4182】\tHygienic.\n【save__datas】\t【4183】\tWe do not depend upon patient compliance.\n【save__datas】\t【4184】\tDisadvantages\n【save__datas】\t【4186】\tThere is anterosuperior anchorage loss.\n【save__datas】\t【4187】\tRecommendations\n【save__datas】\t【4188】\t1\\.

A super elastic 0.018\"x0.020”NiTi wire that exerts a force between 100 g to 200 g is used. In order to move the molars distally with this wire， we must configure a loop with the wire that opens during activa-tion，(23.2547) Due to the fact that this arch wire cannot be bent conventionally， the loop is done in the following manner：\n【save__datas】\t【4200】\t1\\. Two kwik stops are fixed on the arch wire， one on the distal aspect of the brace of the first premolar (distal stop) and the other one on the mesial aspect of the molar tube (mesial stop).\n【len<10_filter】\t【4201】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【4202】\tSubmerge the arch wire in cold water for 20 seconds； the wire can also be cooled with ice and Ortho Ice (tetrafluo-roethane) before the insertion， this will soften the wire(martensite phase) and placement will be easier.(25.27)\n【save__datas】\t【4204】\t3\\. The distance between the stops is 5 mm to 6 mm larger than the space between the distal aspect of the brace of the first premolar and the mesial aspect of the molar tube. The wire is inserted in the molartube--connect--【4207】and the mesial stop is closed， then the distal stop is closed against the brace of the first premolar； the first premolars must be anchored with a transpalatine arch or a Nance button. This is going to act as anchorage reinforcement. In occasions this button is going to extend all the way to the palatine aspects of the inci-sors like an anterior bite plane. (25，3247)\n【save__datas】\t【4212】\tThe molars are moved distally while the wire tries to flatten in order to recover its original form. In this mo-ment， due to the body temperature (37° C)， the arch wire transforms from a martensitic phase (soft) to an austenitic phase (hard).\n【save__datas】\t【4213】\tWith the use of super elastic NiTi arches and coils the loss of anchorage becomes evident with the increase of the overjet and of the incisor overcrowding.\\[31.34，39，47)\n【save__datas】\t【4214】\tSuccess rates using super elastic NiTi wires and coils：\n【save__datas】\t【4215】\t1.VWhen the molars are moved distally in the late mixed dentition， the procedure is successful in 90% of the cases and molar correction can be obtained in 4 to 8months.\n【len<10_filter】\t【4216】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【4217】\tIn adolescents， when the molars are moved distally after the eruption of the second molars， they tend to move slower and anchorage loss is increased (anterior proclination). The cuspid to cuspid molar relations are well corrected， but severe Class II relations are much more complicated to resolve. The majority of cases are treated successfully， but the incisors need anterior anchorage to avoid protrusion that can reach up to 2mm. We can obtain up to 1 mm.\n【save__datas】\t【4218】\t3\\. In adults， the rate of successful treatments is highly variable and more failures are noted (2325.31，34.3739.47)\n【save__datas】\t【4219】\tIn both cases (coils and super elastic wires)， the molars must be overcorrected 2 mm approximately.Overcorrec-tion is necessary for two reasons；\n【save__datas】\t【4220】\t1\\. Loss of anchorage will occur inevitably during premo-lar canine and incisor retraction and overcorrection itselfhelps to compensate the loss of anchorage. This means that the millimeters that are going to be lost during space closure are the same millimeters of the overcorrection. The loss of anchorage can be mini-mized if the premolars and the canines are allowed to drift distally.\n【save__datas】\t【4221】\t2\\. The crowns of the distalized molars move more dis-tally than their roots (tipping).

These magnets are made out of Samarium Cobalt magnets (MMI， Modular Magnetics Inc.，NY， NY)\\*This magnetic system， that does not require patient coopera-tion， generally moves distally the crowns of the molars in a slightly minor rate than Super Elastic NiTi wires.(424.29) This system consists of 2 magnets with opposing poles(negative with positive)， and are placed on a sectioned wire. One of the magnets is placed on the mesial aspect of the molar tube， while the other one on the distal aspect of the brace of the second premolar. This last magnet is ferulized to the brace of the first and second premolars with0.014\" stainless steel ligature. They must be reactivated every 2 weeks and will provide 8 ounces of force (200 g to225 g).(15.24)As anchorage a modified Nance button is used and the range of distalization obtained is around 3.7 mm to 5 mm (4，14，15，42). This procedure is done in the late mixed dentition after the eruption of the premolars and in the permanent dentition， being a promising appliance for adults.\n【save__datas】\t【4402】\tThe sequential activation of the magnets (every two or four weeks) produces a force that moves distally the upper first molars. According to Gianelly， approximately 25% of the total dental movement consists in a mesialization of the anchored premolar， which indicates a slight loss of anchor-age. In a time period of 4 to 5 months a space equivalent to the diameter of a premolar can be produced in front of the first upper molar(414，42)\n【save__datas】\t【4403】\tSpeaking about biological effects， magnetic forces turn red blood cells 1/3 thinner and elongated， therefore， although the periodontal capillaries are compressed， blood will still--connect--【4404】flow smoothly， provoking little edema and periodontal root inflammation with little discomfort to the patient. It has been proven that the static magnetic field can stimulate the enzymatic systems， cell proliferation and osteogenesis； also it does not provoke any effect in the dental pulp or in the gingival tissue that is close to the magnets，(15.24.43)\n【save__datas】\t【4405】\tThe correct orientation of the magnets is very important， the same thing applies to the proper distance between them， be-cause ifthey are too separated they lose effectiveness，because the repulsion force is diminished and their durability can alsc diminish. These magnets， like the NiTi coils， are very effective， because both are capable ofexerting light and constant forces， but some studies state that NiTi coils are more effective than repelling magnets，(15264243)\n【save__datas】\t【4406】\tThe anchorage loss when the magnets are employed in order to move the first and second molars distally is observed in an overjet increase. This means that two thirds of the space created with the use of magnets to move the first and second molars distally represent molar movement and a third of the space represents loss of anchorage The use of magnets fre-quently moves the crowns of the molars 0.5 mm per month when the second molars have not erupted yet.429，4243)\n【save__datas】\t【4408】\tAdvantages\n【save__datas】\t【4410】\tIt produces a light and constant force for a long period of time.\n【save__datas】\t【4411】\t2We do not depend upon patient cooperation.\n【save__datas】\t【4412】\tUnilateral or bilateral distalization.\n【save__datas】\t【4414】\tMinimal pulp alterations.\n【save__datas】\t【4415】\tMinimal root resorption.\n【save__datas】\t【4416】\tDisadvantages\n【save__datas】\t【4418】\tLoss of anchorage.\n【save__datas】\t【4419】\tFood retention due to the acrylic anchorage.\n【save__datas】\t【4420】\tWe cannot place braces on the anterior sector.\n【save__datas】\t【4421】\tIt distalizes molars at a rate of 0.5 mm per month\n【save__datas】\t【4422】\tAs other distalizers， it does not produce bodily move-ment.\n【save__datas】\t【4423】\tRecommendations\n【save__datas】\t【4424】\t1\\.

Hilgers in 1992. This appliance produces distalization with little inclination compared to other methods， and at the same time allows rotational control over the molars with minimal mesial premolar anchorage displacement. McNamara， in an ample study， recommends this appliance as an effective distalizer with minimal effects upon the vertical dimension，(89.11，3641) But Ghosh and Nanda (1996) evaluated 41 patients treated with the Pendulum and found that 57% was molar distaliza-tion and 43% was loss of anterior anchorage of the upper first premolar. The authors also reported an average 15.7° of distal inclination of the upper first molar. Bussick and Mc Namara (2000) suggested that the Pendulum is much more effective if it is anchored on the deciduous upper second molar with an unerupted permanent upper second molar(this reduces the possibility of an undesired opening of the bite)(810，12.30) They also found in their study that the upper molar moved distally an average of 5.7 mm， with 10.6° of distal tip and 0.7 mm ofextrusion. The upper first premolar moved mesially 1.8 mm with 1.5° of mesial tip and 1 mm of extrusion. Also the lower third of the face increased 2.2mm--connect--【4430】and there were no significant differences among patients--connect--【4431】with hyper hypo or normo divergent patterns.(0.151930) Burkhardt and cols. in 2003 conducted a study in which they found that the Pendulum produces a clockwise de-scent and rotation (aperture of the mandibular plane) of1.2%. They found that the upper incisors proclined 2.8， the upper molar moved distally 5.9 mm， with a distal inclina-tion of 10° and 1.7 mm of extrusion.(131920.30，41)\n【save__datas】\t【4434】\tThis distalizer basically has 3 sections：\n【save__datas】\t【4435】\t1\\.

After the distalization is complete， cement a moder-ate or maximum anchorage on the distalized molars for 3 to 4 months at least， or until space closure is completed.(11，12，13)\n【len<10_filter】\t【4464】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【4465】\tTo avoid a posterior cross bite， activate the omegas of the arms with a slight expansion.\n【len<10_filter】\t【4466】\t3.\n【save__datas】\t【4467】\tWe must instruct the patient how to clean the acrylic button with pressurized water in order to avoid food accumulation.\n【save__datas】\t【4468】\t4\\.

We must have strict control of the appointments， be-cause if the rests debond， the forces will mesialize the anterosuperior segment.\n【save__datas】\t【4471】\tDistal Jet\n【save__datas】\t【4472】\tWithin the arsenal of fixed distalizers that have been cre-ated in the last years we find the \"jet\" family， which were designed by Drs Aldo Carano and Mauro Testa (1996)， and are presently marketed by American Orthodontics. Within this family we find the Distal Jet， an appliance designed for upper molar distalization， in an individual manner (only the first molar) or in conjunction (the first and the second molar). This appliance distalizes in a bodily manner because the distalization force is located near the center of resistance of the molars.(5610，3644)\n【save__datas】\t【4473】\tThis appliance is very similar to the Pendulum， but it has two advantages. First， the upper molars are distal-ized without the palatal movement that happens with the pendulum. Second， the Distal Jet can easily convert into a Nance button after the molar distalization has taken place.(5.6.4)\n【save__datas】\t【4474】\tThe Distal Jet is composed of：\n【save__datas】\t【4477】\tTwo telescopic tubes imbedded in the acrylic of the Nance button.\n【save__datas】\t【4478】\t4Two NiTi open coils.5Two stops or screws.\n【save__datas】\t【4479】\tThe distalizing wires can be 0.036\" stainless steel wire； the distal part of the wire， bent as a bayonet， is going to be inserted in the palatine sheaths of both molars， and the mesial ends are inserted in the telescopic tubes that are imbedded in the acrylic of the Nance button. This is go-ing to work as a piston because the wire can slide freely in the telescopic tube. Over each tube a NiTi open coil and a screw are slipped on. The distalizing force is given by the total compression of the coil， which is accomplished by sliding the screw distally and adjusting it to its new position. The pair of telescopic tubes will be parallel to the occlusal plane and as close as possible to the center of resistance of the molar.(5.644)\n【save__datas】\t【4480】\tThe Nance button can be anchored on the first or second premolar. If the first premolars are used as anchorage， the second premolars will move with the molars during distalization， but the loss of anchorage and the overjet will increase. If we anchor the Nance button to the second pre-molars， we will have less anchorage loss， but the treatment time will increase because the canine and the premolars would have to be distalized in mass.\n【save__datas】\t【4482】\tIn the mixed dentition， the second deciduous molars are usually chosen as anchorage， but only if they have at least a third of the root present(33)\n【save__datas】\t【4483】\tThis appliance distalizes in average 0.91 mm per month when the first and second molars are present and a bit more when only the first molar is erupted. The Distal Jet produces a distal inclination (tip) of0.6 for each millimeter of distalization.The force exerted by the open coils is 180 g to 240gat the moment of maximum activation. We recommend the use of the 180g coil when only the first molar is present and the 240 g coil when the first and second molars are present(5.33)\n【save__datas】\t【4484】\tThe removal of the upper third molar is recommended in adults before we initiate the molar distalizing movement. The interferences of the third molar can be an obstacle that can put at risk the effectiveness of the distalization. But in patients in which the third molars are still high and are not in contact with the roots of the second molars， the extraction of the third molar is not indicated.(5.6，2444)\n【save__datas】\t【4485】\tAdvantages\n【save__datas】\t【4486】\t1\\.

But studies made by Patel (1999) show that the stability of the anchorage unit diminishes with the use of braces during distalization.Drs Carano and Testa recommend the use of the Distal Jet before the placement of braces in the upper dental arch.\n【save__datas】\t【4493】\t6\\. 80% of the space obtained is due to the distal move-ment of the upper first molar and 20% is due to the loss of anterior anchorage.(5，633)\n【save__datas】\t【4494】\tDisadvantages\n【save__datas】\t【4495】\t1\\.

We can take advantage of this while we treat brachyfacial patients， but this fact can pose a problem in the treatment of dolichofacial patients， especially those that have a protractile tongue habit.\n【save__datas】\t【4500】\tRecommendations\n【save__datas】\t【4502】\tIf the screw or the stop is in intimate contact with the palatal mucosa， the distalizing process will not occur.\n【save__datas】\t【4503】\t3\\. The screw and the stop must be separated from the palate 1 mm to 2 mm.\n【save__datas】\t【4504】\t4 An incorrect position of the Distal Jet can in-crease the friction in the telescopic tube； and high level of friction can reduce the rate of molar distalization.\n【save__datas】\t【4505】\t5\\. The open coils must be totally compressed once a month， until we reach a Class III or Super Class molar relation.\n【save__datas】\t【4506】\t6\\. After we obtain the molar distalization， we can remove the open coils and convert the Distal Jet into a Nance button； this is done by applying ligh activated or self curing acrylic in the wire base.\n【len<10_filter】\t【4507】\t7.\n【save__datas】\t【4508】\tUse Class II elastics and/or ferulize the anterior segment with ligature， with an acetate or with a bite plane in order to reduce anterosuperior pro-clination.\n【save__datas】\t【4509】\t8\\. We must instruct the patient how to apply pressurized water under the Nance button in order to avoid food accumulation.\n【save__datas】\t【4510】\tCetlin plate\n【save__datas】\t【4511】\tThis distalizer was developed by Dr. Norman Cetlin in1983.It consists of an acrylic plate that has 2 TMA springs that emerge from the palatine aspect and contour the me-sial aspect of the molar to be distalized or they are inserted in the tubes of the molar bands. It also has 2 retainer wires on the premolars and a buccal rectangular or round wire covered with a slight film of acrylic， which functions as anchorage to counteract the mesial forces and avoids upper incisor proclination，(1526)\n【save__datas】\t【4512】\tWe must place an elastomeric separator in the mesial aspect of the molar before we place the Cetlin plate. This way we can insert the TMA wires in between the molar and the second premolar and we can skip the placement of the separator.5.26.29)\n【save__datas】\t【4513】\tThe plate is used full time， except during meals， and can be combined with a cervical traction face bow during sleep time. The springs of the plate incline the molars distally， and the face bow can tip distally the roots of the molars， this way we can maintain an upright molar position.(2)\n【save__datas】\t【4514】\tDistalizing plates are useful not only for obtaining ad-ditional space， but also to regain space lost due to the premature exfoliation or extraction of the deciduous second molar. In these cases we can use the plate without the extra oral traction.(29)\n【save__datas】\t【4517】\tAdvantages\n【save__datas】\t【4518】\t1\\. The orthodontist controls the distalization.This de-pends directly on the amount of millimeters the TMA springs are activated.\n【save__datas】\t【4520】\tMinimal anterior segment proclination due to the acrylic shield on the buccal arch.\n【len<10_filter】\t【4521】\t4.\n【save__datas】\t【4522】\tWhen the plate is combined with the face bow the distal tip of the molar crown is diminished.\n【save__datas】\t【4523】\tDisadvantages\n【save__datas】\t【4524】\t1\\. Due to the fact that the plate is removable， we depend upon patient compliance.\n【len<10_filter】\t【4525】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【4526】\tDue to the distalizing force， the plate can be expelled from the maxillary teeth.\n【save__datas】\t【4527】\tThe distalizing movement is slow.\n【save__datas】\t【4529】\tThe treatment must be divided in two phases， first the distalization phase and then the orthodontic phase.\n【save__datas】\t【4530】\tRecommendations\n【save__datas】\t【4531】\t1\\. The distalizing springs must be activated 1 mm per month.\n【len<10_filter】\t【4532】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【4533】\tAfter the molars have been distalized， we must place a Nance button or a transpalatine arch on the distalized molars.\n【save__datas】\t【4534】\t3\\. It is best to insert the TMA springs in the extra oral tubes， because in doing so the plate becomes more stable.\n【len<10_filter】\t【4535】\t4.\n【save__datas】\t【4536】\tPlace the Cetlin plate in a glass of water or mouth wash when the patient is eating. Doing so will lessen foul odor absorption.\n【save__datas】\t【4537】\tVeltri distalizer\n【save__datas】\t【4538】\tThis distalizer was developed by Dr Nicolas Veltri in 1999and is marketed by Leone. It is constituted by a palato-sagittal expansion screw， cemented at 90°to obtain bilateral molar distalization. The screw is linked to the bands of the first upper molars and to the upper second premolars (or on the upper second deciduous molars). Anchorage is ac-complished by a Nance button that is soldered to the body of the screw. The screw is activated twice a week. Knowing that each activation equals 0.2 mm， the appliance distalizes approximately 1.5 mm per month. The complete correc-tion of a Class II molar relation (approximately 5 mm) will require， in average， 3 and a half months of treatment. At the end of the active phase of distalization， the screw is ferulized or blocked with acrylic and the arms that link the screw to the bands of the second premolars are cut off. The appliance now becomes a ferulized screw， a Nance button with bands on the molars，(1.36.4549)\n【save__datas】\t【4543】\tAdvantages\n【save__datas】\t【4544】\t1 From the biomechanical point of view， the distal izer can produce a bodily first molar movement Due to the ruggedness of the screw-arms-bands set， the point of force application is at the screw level. Therefore， the force vector passes close to the center of resistance of the upper first molars.\n【save__datas】\t【4545】\t2\\. The activation of the distalizer is very easy； we just have to activate the screw.\n【save__datas】\t【4546】\t3\\. It is esthetic.\n【save__datas】\t【4548】\tIt converts into a passive anchorage. We do this by cutting the arms that link the premolars to the expansion screw.\n【save__datas】\t【4549】\t6\\. Some cases treated with this distalizer suggest that the anchorage loss that occurred in the anterior segment of the upper maxilla with this appliance was less than the loss experienced with the Jones Jig or the Pendulum.\n【save__datas】\t【4550】\tDisadvantages\n【len<10_filter】\t【4551】\t1.\n【save__datas】\t【4552】\tWe depend upon patient cooperation， because the activation is done by the parents of the patient.\n【len<10_filter】\t【4553】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【4554】\tThe cost of the appliance increases due the cost of the screw.\n【save__datas】\t【4555】\t3\\. Due to the force exerted， the Nance button can im-pinge itself in the palate.\n【save__datas】\t【4556】\tAnterosuperior sector proclination.\n【save__datas】\t【4558】\tWe must invest laboratory time to fabricate it.\n【save__datas】\t【4559】\tRecommendations\n【save__datas】\t【4560】\t1\\. In case the upper first molars are rotated， we should correct this anomaly before we distalize the molars.\n【save__datas】\t【4562】\tTeach the parents how to activate the screw.\n【save__datas】\t【4563】\tThe screw should be separated about 2 mm to 3 mm from the palatal vault.\n【save__datas】\t【4564】\t5\\. The screw must be activated twice a week.\n【len<10_filter】\t【4565】\tK loop\n【save__datas】\t【4566】\tThis system was developed by Dr Valrun Kalra in 1995and is commercialized by Ortho Organizers. This system consists in a compressed loop that resembles a horizontal K that will exert the distalizing force and a Nance button cemented to the upper first premolars or to the first decidu-ous molars， the button will provide anchorage，(22.24)\n【save__datas】\t【4567】\tThe K loop is made with 0.017\"x0.025\"TMA wire，the ends of the wire will be bent 20° occlusally and will be inserted in the molar tube and in the brace of the first premolar. These bends lessen molar tip once the K loop is activated. Each loop will be 8 mm high and 1.5 mm wide.\n【save__datas】\t【4569】\tWith the first activation the molar will move 4 mm， if we want more distalization it can be reactivated 2 mm after6 or 8 weeks of treatment. The rate of anchorage loss is 1mm of mesial movement of the first premolar per 4 mm of distal movement of the molar a similar result is obtained using magnets or NiTi coils，(22.26，36)\n【save__datas】\t【4571】\tTo activate this wire we must place a pair of stops on the arms ofthe K loop. One is placed mesial to the tube of the molar and another distal to the brace of the first premolar， this will prevent slippage and will distalize the molars. These stops will be 1.5 mm long.(22.26.36)\n【save__datas】\t【4572】\tThe K loop is distended 2 mm to 3 mm its original size. During placement， it is compressed and due to the memory of the TMA wire the molar distalization will occur(22)\n【save__datas】\t【4574】\tAdvantages\n【save__datas】\t【4575】\t1\\. We can place molar and premolar intrusion and ex-trusion movements， this will depend upon how off or centered the loop is between the molar and the premolar.\n【save__datas】\t【4577】\tHygienic.\n【save__datas】\t【4579】\tEasy to place and take off.\n【save__datas】\t【4580】\tEasy to elaborate.\n【save__datas】\t【4581】\tWe do not depend upon patient cooperation.\n【save__datas】\t【4582】\tDisadvantages\n【save__datas】\t【4583】\t1\\. Maladjusted or long loops can injure the inner lining of the cheek or the gums of the patient.\n【len<10_filter】\t【4584】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【4585】\tAnterior segment proclination.\n【save__datas】\t【4586】\tRecommendations\n【len<10_filter】\t【4589】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【4590】\tReactivate the loop every one and a half or two months，\n【save__datas】\t【4591】\t3\\.

These are placed between the first molar and the first premolar and are imbedded in acrylic as perpendicular to the occlusal plane as possible.\n【save__datas】\t【4597】\t3 Two TMA distalizing springs (similar to the ones on the pendulum) that are inserted in the palatal sheaths of the molars and the acrylic of the button of a modi-fied Nance button.\n【save__datas】\t【4598】\tDuring screw activation (2/4 of a turn per week) the distalizing springs are simultaneously set in action，--connect--【4600】and in this way the molar distalization is produced. Dr Belussi recommends the alternate activation of the right and the left screw every 4 days， this means that the same screw is activated every 8 days； the objective of this is to not to apply a lot of force on the palate， avoiding irritation，(3.27.49)\n【save__datas】\t【4601】\tAdvantages\n【save__datas】\t【4602】\t1Distalization control.\n【save__datas】\t【4603】\tIf the screw does not turn any more and we have not accomplished the desired molar position， we must activate the TMA spring.\n【save__datas】\t【4604】\t3\\. The activation of the distalizer is easy， because it is done in the screws.\n【len<10_filter】\t【4605】\t4.\n【save__datas】\t【4606】\tEsthetic.\n【save__datas】\t【4607】\tDisadvantages\n【save__datas】\t【4608】\t1\\. We depend on patient compliance，because the activa-tion of the appliance is done by the parents.\n【len<10_filter】\t【4609】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【4610】\tDue to the force exerted， the Nance button can im-pinge itself in the palate.\n【save__datas】\t【4612】\tThe Nance button can be difficult to clean.\n【save__datas】\t【4613】\tWe must invest laboratory time to fabricate it.\n【save__datas】\t【4614】\tRecommendations\n【save__datas】\t【4615】\t1\\. When we activate the springs that go in the molar tubes， we are going to obtain molar derotation， inclinement and buccal version； when the screw does not turn any more we can distalize the molars activating the springs. The activation must be done by the orthodontist.\n【save__datas】\t【4617】\tOnce the distalization has concluded we must cut the wire that connects the premolars to the acrylic but-ton and transform the button into a Nance Button； this will give us enough anchorage， meanwhile the premolar and canines continue distalizing.\n【save__datas】\t【4618】\t4\\. We must instruct the patient in how to clean the bot-tom of the Nance button with pressurized water in order to avoid food accumulation，\n【save__datas】\t【4619】\t1\\.

There are also those that are not physiologic. like suction， that can be of a thumb or another finger， a pacifier or a lip； mouth breathing， lingual interposition in repose and immature deglutition，()\n【save__datas】\t【4678】\tNon-physiologic oral habits are one of the main etio-logic factors that cause malocclusions or dento-skeletal deformities， which can alter the normal development of the stomatognathic system， and can cause an unbalance between the oral and perioral muscle forces， which can finally lead to an osseous deformity that can have major or minor repercussions， depending on the age in which the habit begins； if the habit is picked up at a very young age， more damage will be caused because the bone has more modeling capacity at a very young age.2 If we act soon we will be more capable of modifying the growth pattern ofthe jaws and of the dental arches. If we eliminate the deform-ing habit before the patient is three years old， the problem usually corrects itself spontaneously，(36721，23.25)\n【save__datas】\t【4679】\tHowever， it is also certain that for a habit to be established during the growth and development of an infant there are factors that predispose the appearance or not of an oral habit； one of them is breast feeding. Breast feeding contributes much more than optimum feeding to the infant， because it has immunologic factors， anti-inflam m maaitory cells， growth factors， enzymes and hormones，that complement the development capacity of the child， it also benefits the overall health of the mother， it strengthens the bond between the mother and child and， during nursing， the set of oral muscles are stimulated and the structures of the stomatognathic system are mobilized，--connect--【4680】thus stimulating normal growth and development. Nev-ertheless， if the child is bottle fed， the suckling baby does not close his lips with the same force as a breast fed baby； the action of the tongue to regulate the excessive flow of milk is affected and all this brings as a consequence a weaker stimulation of the oral muscles and it will not promote the adequate growth and development of the stomatognathic system， which will favor the acquisition of non-nutritive sucking habits as thumb or finger suc-tion， pacifier， labial， or other object suction. The presence of some of these habits can alter the occlusal pattern in later stages of development of the child.\n【save__datas】\t【4682】\tSome studies indicate that 81.8% of infants that were bottle fed had some type of non-nutritive sucking habit and 88.2% of infants that were breast fed did not have anv non-nutritive sucking habit.(7)\n【save__datas】\t【4684】\t1\\. Instinctive： Like the suction habit， it is functional at the beginning of life， but can be harmful if it persists with time.\n【save__datas】\t【4685】\t2\\.

Pre-school (2 to 5 years)，if suction is occasional， it does not have any detrimental effect on the dentition； if it is continuous or intense， it can cause primary teeth malposition； if the habit is abandoned before the 6 years of age， the defor-mity is reversible in a high percentage of cases with relative ease.\n【save__datas】\t【4694】\tC.

Other abnormal habits that can cause maloc-clusions are lower lip interposition or sucking， pacifier suction or nail biting (onychophagia).()\n【save__datas】\t【4702】\tFinger sucking habit\n【save__datas】\t【4703】\tThe survival of the newborn depends upon instinctive oral suction that will allow nutritional satisfaction and a sensation of security and well being； this mechanism serves as a way to interact with the outer world. The suction re-flex constitutes an innate response that is produced by a--connect--【4704】stimulus to the oral region， in a way that when something contacts the lips or the cheeks， the infant directs his move-ments to the stimuli and will try to introduce the stimulat ing object into the mouth. This early nerve organization allows the child to feed from his mother； so prenatal and neonatal suction is physiologic，(18.20.25) This suction reflex is considered normal until 3 years of age， moment in which with the appearance of the deciduous teeth it is gradually replaced with mastication； this is why it is considered--connect--【4705】bad habit，when the habit persists in the presence of the deciduous teeth in the mouth.(3.515)\n【save__datas】\t【4706】\tThe most common suction habit is finger suction of the thumb or of one or more fingers， this generally provokes an anterior open bite and a distal mandibular position， caused by the pressure exerted by the hand and the arm.(13，15，23)\n【len<10_filter】\t【4707】\tEtiology\n【save__datas】\t【4708】\tLarson considers artificial lactation as an etiologic factor of non-nutritive sucking， due to the fact that it is fre-quently brief and requires less physical effort； the baby is not sleepy due to the lack of physical fatigue and does not exhaust all the natural suction instinct the baby has.(3.11) Late suction habits are the result of psychological frustrations due to family and school misfortunes. The child takes refuge in suction to escape the real world that seems very harsh. Non-nutritive sucking can emerge as a manifestation of other underlying psychopatholo-gies， or， as an associated disarray to other behavior alterations. So， some children with a finger sucking habit present other problems like enuresis， withdrawal and nail biting.(3.20)\n【save__datas】\t【4709】\tFinger sucking presents itself in moments of depres-sion， boredom or tiredness and it generates tranquility and induces sleep. The presence of the habit lessens with age and a high percentage of children abandon the practice around 3 or 4 years of age； after this age psychological， phonoaudiology and dental approaches must be undertaken.(25)\n【save__datas】\t【4710】\tStress is a potent stimulant for the development of a thumb sucking habit. It is probable that it is one of the causes of its high frequency， considering that today children are submitted to a lot of stress.\n【save__datas】\t【4711】\tThe Freudian psychoanalytic theory states that a child goes through different phases in their mental development， and for this to be satisfactory， the finger sucking habit must be satisfied during the oral phase. If the habit still persists in the next phase of emotional development， the habit will remain \"set\" and will continue.(20)\n【save__datas】\t【4712】\tThe repercussions of this habit derive in a low tongue position， that ceases to exert pressure on the palate， the hyperactive buccinator muscles tend to compress the pal-ate， the offending finger applies pressure over the dental arches and also exerts pressure against the palate.)\n【save__datas】\t【4713】\tOral effects of finger sucking habit\n【save__datas】\t【4714】\t1\\.

This will depend upon the position that the offending finger or fingers have， the duration， intensity and the frequency of the repetition of this habit， the dentofacial pattern and the initial occlusion， the finger that is introduced in the mouth and the leverage that it exerts， and finally the type of osseous tissue it acts upon. 32023)\n【save__datas】\t【4736】\tOfthe factors mentioned before， duration is the most criti-cal function in dental movement， a duration of 4 to 6hours originates important dental movements.It is important to mention that the majority of intents to eradicate this conduct with strong words， punishments or any other aggressive conduct towards a child that has this habit have been counterproductive because far from eliminating it， it has only reinforced this conduct making it stronger and more frequent.\n【save__datas】\t【4737】\tWe must not mistake abnormal suction habits with a normal child development phase or oral phase， when perception and touch are in their peak in the mouth.(23)\n【save__datas】\t【4738】\tIf the child really does have the suction habit is because it has the psycho-emotional need to practice it， at least emotionally. Children that have oral habits intimately tied to their emotional state practice them in moments of anguish and anxiety. Prolonged finger suction can cause emotional difficulties in the infant because it usually generates frustration symptoms in the child that wants to abandon the habit but cannot do so， this will retard its emotional maturity and will create difficul-ties to the child to obtain satisfaction out of activities proper to his or her age， so the child tends to isolate and becomes introvert.(5，13.23.25)\n【save__datas】\t【4739】\tWe must be very careful if we want to eliminate the habit. From the Freudian point of view an abrupt interference can provoke the appearance of antisocial behavior， much more difficult to live with than the habit itself. For this motive， the general practitioner must have enough psychological training in order to refer the patient with a specialist for adequate treatment.(5.6.15.21)\n【save__datas】\t【4740】\tA simple Hawley plate will impede the introduction of a finger against the palate； this will take the pleasure out of the suction habit， and gradually the child will drop the habit. A grill can be added to the plate just as a reminder， but the child must know the purpose of the appliance.\n【save__datas】\t【4741】\tWe must keep in mind that the malocclusion can be cor-rected at any time， but a serious psychological problem can persist a lifetime， with much more serious sequels than the malocclusion itself (23)\n【save__datas】\t【4744】\tThe decision to interfere with a non-nutritive suction habit in the primary dentition must be based upon the following factors：\n【len<10_filter】\t【4745】\t1.\n【save__datas】\t【4746】\tIf the finger habit is tied to a developing Class II malocclusion， the skeletal malocclusion will worsen while the habit continues.\n【save__datas】\t【4747】\t2\\. It is believed that finger habits are less detrimental or ever benefit dental development if the child is developing a Class III malocclusion or if the child is prognathic.\n【save__datas】\t【4748】\t3\\. Anterior open bites derived from finger sucking habits usually do not need to be treated because there is a spontaneous correction after the habit is abandoned especially if it ceases before the patient reaches three years of age.)\n【save__datas】\t【4749】\t4\\. The attitude of the child： the child must always be part of the decision-making process， this way the child will not consider the intervention as a punishment.\n【save__datas】\t【4750】\tPacifier suction habit\n【save__datas】\t【4751】\tSuction is one of the first manifestations of physiologic activity that a human being develops， because it cor-responds with a basic organic need， which is to be fed. The newborn sucks food， but even in periods in which the child is not being fed， the child is still sucking， placing between the gums any object， like a pacifer， a finger， the lower lip or a toy.(?8)\n【save__datas】\t【4752】\tThis non-nutritive suction of fingers， toys， pacifiers， lips or other objects not related with the intake of nutrients is considered a normal activity in fetal and neonatal development， which also calms and comforts them. The use of the pacifier as a comforting object is a widely extended practice， but continuous use during the deciduous dentition is associated in the majority of cases with an increase in the prevalence of posterior cross bites and anterior open bites.(416) It also creates injurious habits like not grabbing adequately with the mouth the nipple of the mother because the infant--connect--【4754】becomes accustomed to the latex nipple of the pacifier Does not generate adequate neuromuscular stimuli for the functional matrix of the stomatognathic system and predisposes the fixation of oral habits.\n【save__datas】\t【4755】\tBenefits of the pacifier\n【save__datas】\t【4757】\tAnother benefit is that it stimulates the maturation ofthe suction reflex in premature infants， most of all children submitted to nasal gastric tube feeding， which facilitates a faster transition to a oral feeding， reducing hospita internment time.(16)\n【save__datas】\t【4759】\tThe pacifier has been associated with a lesser incidence of sudden death syndrome； it presumably avoids the obstruc-tion of the airways， preventing the backward movement of the tongue. Furthermore， it would avoid certain positions， which also diminish the frequency of this syndrome，even though there is no association between the use of the paci-fier and sleep position.\n【save__datas】\t【4760】\tIn summary， although there is evidence in favor； we cannot recommend it vet.\n【save__datas】\t【4761】\tRisks in the use of the pacifier\n【save__datas】\t【4762】\tAbout the risks， the pacifier would reduce the duration of breast feeding； the reason for this is that the infant develops \"nipple confusion， because the pacifier suction pattern is different and interferes with the acquisition of the necessary abilities for breast feeding. Children with nipple confusion do not stimulate enough the maternal nipple and are going to suck less， thus the mother will produce less prolactine.(i6)\n【save__datas】\t【4763】\tMalocclusion is another risk， being anterior open bite the most frequent， which usually resolves by itself when the habit is abandoned precociously. Most severe， but less fre-quent is posterior cross bite， which can have a deleterious effect upon the craniofacial growth of the child. The use of the pacifier and the incidence of posterior cross bite have been significantly correlated， most of all when the habit is prolonged more than 36 months. It is considered that such relation is because the oral position of the pacifier entails a lingual displacement over the mandible and an elongation of the orbicular and buccinator muscles. These changes provoke an increase in the mandibulartransversal distance and a diminution of the maxillary transversal distance. Children that present this habit suffer an alteration of the oral flora and hypertrophy of the lymphatic system and they usually are mouth breathers， which also contributes in the development of malocclusions.(16)\n【save__datas】\t【4764】\tThe presence of oral ulcers is also described， specifically in the posterior third of the palate (Bednar aftous ulcers)， that are due to a traumatic effect produced by the inten-sive use of non-orthodontic type pacifiers. Furthermore， accidents caused by the cutting edges of pacifiers have--connect--【4765】been reported， with the production of wounds with the characteristic shape of this implement， and there is a risk of aspiration of home made pacifiers， at home and in the hospital.(16)\n【save__datas】\t【4766】\tThe use of a pacifier can promote the appearance of feeding bottle syndrome (multiple caries in the deciduous denti-tion)， caused by the prolonged use of a pacifier impregnated with sugar based products.(16)\n【save__datas】\t【4767】\tWe must suspect the presence of Candida in the pacifier when a treatment for oral Candida fails.(16)\n【save__datas】\t【4768】\tA safe pacifier is a one piece pacifier， with a big 4.4 cm shield， rigid or semi rigid， but flexible enough not to provoke any trauma. It must have anti choking orifices， a holding ring with a safety pin， to avoid any contact with the floor if the pacifier falls. We must clean it every time the patient uses it or when it falls on the floor， but it must never be introduced in sugar or chlorine. Adults must not place it in their mouths； we must change it as soon as it deteriorates.(16)\n【save__datas】\t【4769】\tBefore the teeth erupt， the typical infantile deglutition pattern is characterized by the separation of the maxillas， the tongue is interposed between the gingival pads and the mandible is positioned forward， this way the tongue can press the nipple against the upper dental arch during breast feeding. At this point deglutition is controlled by the contact of the lips， tongue and the perioral muscles. After the teeth erupt， the deglutition pattern changes， the point of the tongue is placed on the palate， the dental arches contact each other and there is no lip contrac-tion (315) The typical adult deglutition pattern usually develops around 5 years of age.\n【save__datas】\t【4770】\tAtypical deglutition， also called lingual interposition， is produced when the infantile deglutition pattern still persists after the eruption of the anterior teeth. 0 Occasionally， it can also be affirmed that infantile deglutition is a phenom-ena derived from the presence on an anterior open bite.(21) If an anterior open bite did not exist， the tongue would not obturate the hole to obtain a correct seal during deglutition. Although many authors support this theory， many contro-versies persist about the direction of the arrow of cause-effect in the relation between infantile deglutition-anterior open bite， which justifies certain therapeutic approaches，like--connect--【4771】the elimination of the cause of the open bite and to close it if necessary， or waiting for the automatic correction of the abnormal deglutition pattern or to reeducate the posture of the tongue first， as an indispensable condition for the closure of the open bite.\n【len<10_filter】\t【4772】\tEtiology\n【save__datas】\t【4773】\tAmong the etiologic factors that favor the installment of this habit we can quote：\n【save__datas】\t【4775】\tBottle feeding.

But sometimes， once the cause of mouth breathing is eliminated， the perioral muscles must be rehabilitated with functional exercises to promote adequate lip seal， so the way the patient breathes must be reeducated with respiratory exercises because the patient breathes through the mouth by habit. The muscle exercises must be done with a buccal shield or a Trainer. Both are going to obstruct the flow of air through the mouth， and， as a result， breathing must forcefully be done through the upper air ways.?) The stimulation of the upper air ways through respiratory exercises can have a positive influence upon the growth of contiguous bone structures.

This appliance will have a favorable influence in the development of the lower dental arch， because it will separate the lip from the anteroinferior teeth， producing spontaneous lower arch expansion.(910)\n【save__datas】\t【4900】\tNail biting habit (onychophagia)\n【save__datas】\t【4901】\tFinger sucking and nail biting are daily and common ex-amples of developmental habits. They are often considered automatic reactions that can manifest in stressful or frus-trating situations， or if the patient is bored or fatigued. The habit of nail biting coincides regularly with finger suction； authors like Meneghello consider this habit as an indicative of emotional conflict that must alert the doctor， this is the reason why the patient must not be reprimanded.(23)\n【save__datas】\t【4903】\tThe incidence of nail biting is exceptionally high. Both sexes are equally affected but females worry more due to the esthetic problem so they seek help much more than males. Surveys show that close to 45% of children during puberty， around 25% of university students and more or less 10% of adults older than 35 years of age bite their nails compulsively. Generally the patients bite all their nails.\n【save__datas】\t【4904】\tThis habit does not cause occlusal problems because it only exerts pressure through the longitudinal axis of the tooth. But some authors believe that onychophagia interferes with the normal development of the face and can bring as a consequence， depending mainly on the frequency， intensity and of the predominance of the vertical growth component face，whose result in conjunc-tion with atypical deglutition is the triggering factor of anterior open bite.\n【save__datas】\t【4906】\tSome think that the etiology of this habit is the conse-quence of a behavior that was not conveniently finished at the appropriate time when the patient was 2 or 3 years old， when the child was sucking a finger or a thumb. It is also affirmed that at the moment in which the deglutition pattern changes， when the fist teeth appear， the impulse to bite is installed. In this period a more solid diet is required to compensate this impulse. One way to exercise mastica-tion is to offer the infant a steak so the infant can hold it and begin to bite and suck， even before the complete eruption of all the deciduous teeth. If this impulse is not satisfied the child will seek things to chew， mainly the nails， so the onychophagia habit is installed.(23)\n【save__datas】\t【4907】\tEffects of the habit\n【save__datas】\t【4909】\tOnychophagia in a critical phase can damage the nail bed and the germinal matrix of the nail.\n【save__datas】\t【4910】\t3\\.

In a patient with ferric anemia we can find a concave of spooned shaped nail， confusing it with a symptom related to onychophagia.\n【save__datas】\t【4914】\tIn order to correct onychophagia， we must first make the patient realize that he or she has a problem， that the patient must want to stop the habit， taking in account that this unsatisfied need to bite obeys to a psychoemotional state of anxiety. To begin we must give to the patient a rubber object to bite and we must ask the patient to bite the object five minutes without stopping every time the patient feels the urge to bite his or her nails. We can also ask the patient to do the same exercise during five or ten minutes if the patient feels anxious. Another alternative to eliminate the habit is to place night guards on both dental arches covering the occlusal aspects of molars and premolars， in order to slightly lift the bite and to difficult the practice of the habit，\n【save__datas】\t【4915】\tIn this chapter we will show the different options to elimi-nate oral habits， these options will be divided in restricting and stimulating appliances.\n【save__datas】\t【4916】\tI.

Unfortunately， these are foreign bodies that are in intimate contact with oral tissues anc can play an important part in accidents， and may initiate a lesion in soft and hard tissues， turning this problem intc an orthodontic urgency. The number of orthodontic emergencies is directly proportional to the quality of the materials used. Good quality materials and their correct use (doses， curing times， etc.) will represent a decline in the number ofemergencies. This decline in appointments will translate in an increase of the confidence of the patient in our treatment， and consequently the patient will be more willing to cooperate with us.(15)\n【save__datas】\t【5211】\tWhen an emergency situation arises， the patient contacts us via telephone call or e-mail； our secretary or assistant must look for the chart of the patient to determine the type of appliance the patient has in the mouth and the date of the next appointment， and we must classify the type of emergency and program the appointment according to the priority. This emergency appointment represents a stressful situation for the patient and the orthodontist， and is going to require a fast response from the office staff in order to resolve the problem； an excessive delay in the attention of these appointments may occasionally unleash iatrogenic dental movements by a deformed wire， the aspiration of a wire or an expander， or to the extreme that the patient“tears off\" the appliances ifhis or her problem is not swiftly resolved. This way we are going to classify urgencies in two groups：(15)\n【save__datas】\t【5212】\tThe programmed visit. A maladjustment of a re-movable appliance， the blockage of an expansion apparatus， brace or band bonding failure， the loss of--connect--【5213】a separator or a ligature， etc. are situations that can be programmed for an appointment (as soon as possible) but generally do not require immediate action.(15)\n【save__datas】\t【5214】\tThe immediate visit. Other situations， like a lesion caused by the arch wire or the loops， the loosening of a rapid palatal expander or an anchorage appliance， the insertion of soft tissue in the hooks of the braces or tubes， the deformation of the arch wire， loose auxiliary elements (risk of aspiration)， etc. These ur-gencies must trigger immediate action to counteract possible secondary effects that can potentially gener-ate anguish to the patient.()\n【save__datas】\t【5215】\tWhen the patient comes to our office， we can identify the site and degree of the lesion. These lesions can be rounded up in three groups\n【save__datas】\t【5216】\tLesions produced by extra oral-appliances， These are made by appliances like extra-oral arches， facial masks，tandems，etc.\n【save__datas】\t【5217】\tLesions produced by intra-oral appliances. These are very common during orthodontic treatment and are caused by fixed or removable appliances； for example， rapid maxillary expanders， lingual arches， transpalatine arches， braces and loose molar bands； these appliances can injure tissues like the marginal gum up to the bone of the palatal vault.\n【save__datas】\t【5218】\tLesions produced by bad hygiene habits. These are caused by a lack or reduction in the frequency of teeth brushing of the patient. This manifests itself with a gingival hyperplasia， and in extreme cases， in enamel decalcification.4)\n【save__datas】\t【5219】\tOne of the major concerns of our patients when they begin orthodontic treatment is pain， for this reason we must know the etiology， pathogenesis and possible solutions to this problem. Some of the most frequent questions are：Does orthodontic treatment hurt? Why does dental movement hurt? How long will the pain last? How can we eliminate pain during treatment? We will try to explain this as easily as possible and without complications.\n【save__datas】\t【5220】\tTeeth are bound to the alveolar bone through the peri-odontal insertion， which is composed by the root ce-ment， the periodontal ligament and the alveolar bone. The cement (completely avascular) is barely modified by orthodontic forces， but all the attention lays on the two other components： the periodontal ligament and the alveolar bone.(927)\n【save__datas】\t【5221】\tThe periodontal ligament occupies a space of 0.5 mm between the alveolar wall and the cement， this ligament is responsible for the dental joint. It is constituted mainly of collagen fibers inserted on one side in the root cement and the other side in alveolar bone. It is mingled with blood vessels， cellular elements， nerve endings and interstitial liquid. Blood vessels are responsible for nutrition of the periodontal ligament and will serve as an access vehicle for the cells responsible for cortical bone and ligament remod-eling. The existing nervous endings will transmit pressure sensation and proprioceptive notion. Periodontal fibers and interstitial liquid together form， an effective shock absorbing and force dissipater system of the physiologic forces applied for a brief period during the orthodontic movement，(13.27)\n【save__datas】\t【5222】\tThe third and last component of the periodontium is alveo-lar bone that can be divided in two parts： the fasciculated portion (hard laminated portion of bone)， that lines the internal surface of the alveolus and the lamellar portion(spongy bone). As in cement， the fasciculated portion receives the insertion of the periodontal fibers. The pro-cess occurs in this manner： when force is applied on the tooth， it moves inside the alveolar socket， this provokes the stretching of some periodontal fibers and the compression of other fibers. At the same time the interstitial liquid of the fibers is also compressed against the osseous walls. As the liquid slowly drains out of the alveolus， it also exerts hydraulic resistance against dental movement. Periodontal fibers and interstitial liquid act in conjunction against the--connect--【5224】iWhat happens at cellular level? The tissue response is similar to an inflammatory process， in which histamine is liberated by the mastocytes of the attacked region. This histamine has immediate action over the blood vessels of the periodontal ligament provoking vasodilatation and opens spaces between endotelial cells that conform the walls provoking a permeability increase (this first local re-action is called immediate response)； later， prostaglandins are produced which increase vasodilatation and vascular permeability. Due to this increase of permeability mono cytes come out of the interior of the blood vessels and they fuse and convert into multinuclear cells called osteo-clasts， which are responsible for resorption of the alveolar cortical bone in which the ligament is being pressed. On the other hand， in the region with periodontal ligament tension undifferentiated mesenchyma cells transform into osteoblast and fibroblasts that form osseous tissue and collagen fibers respectively. Clinically this period is characterized by a slight or moderate dental pain without tooth movement. All this happens from the first seconds the orthodontic force is applied till the second day (the first 24-48 hours).(9.19.27)\n【save__datas】\t【5225】\tOn the third day， the osteoblasts and the osteoclasts initi-ate the bone remodeling process， with apposition on the periodontal fiber tension side and resorption on the os-seous side compressed by the ligaments. In this moment， the tooth begins to move in the direction of the applied force and pain disappears，(7)\n【save__datas】\t【5226】\tWe have the wrong idea that if we apply more force we will have more tooth movement. When we apply heavy forces there will be excessive pressure on the periodontal tissues. In these regions， generally on the ligament pressure side， blood flow will slow down or almost cease，provoking degeneration or necrosis of the periodontal fibers. This phenomenon is known as hyalinization. The hialinized areas slow down dental movement， the more hialinized areas are present， the slower the dental movement will be. Clinically the patient will refer a moderate to severe pain and chewing will be uncomfortable for some days.(2427)\n【save__datas】\t【5227】\tSolutions to orthodontic pain\n【save__datas】\t【5228】\tAmong the options we have to reduce pain in orthodon-tics， we can count with three alternatives， which are the following：\n【save__datas】\t【5229】\tAnalgesics，\n【save__datas】\t【5230】\tL正Vibratory stimuli\n【save__datas】\t【5231】\tITherapeutic laser.\n【save__datas】\t【5232】\tI. Analgesics(3.9)\n【save__datas】\t【5233】\tAn excellent alternative for this problem is the use of non opiod analgesics. These inhibit the biosinthesis of pros-taglandins and thromboxanes due to the interference of cyclooxigenase. They possess analgesic， anti-inflammatory， antipyretic and anti-rheumathoid properties. The non-opioid analgesics are classified as：\n【save__datas】\t【5234】\tAntipyretic analgesics.\n【save__datas】\t【5235】\tNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID).\n【save__datas】\t【5236】\tAntipyretic analgesics\n【save__datas】\t【5237】\tThese control pain elevating the pain threshold， and act upon the thermoregulator center of the hypothalamus producing antipyresis. They do not have anti-inflam-matory properties. Among these analgesics we can find the following：(3.9)\n【save__datas】\t【5238】\t1\\. Acetaminophen (Tylenol， Tempra， Winasorb， Datril， Panadol，Sinedol)\n【save__datas】\t【5239】\tThe only aniline derivate currently in clinical use， and is the antipyretic analgesic of first choice in orthodontic treatment.

When the patient chews gum， preferably sugarless gum like Trident Xtra Care that contains Recal Dent (a remineralizer)， a vibratory stimuli is produced that reestablishes blood circulation that pro-duces as a consequence a diminishment of the ischemia This is a non-pharmacologic，non-invasive method and we generally have the full cooperation of the patient we instruct the patient to start chewing gum 15 or 20minutes after. We change the arch wire. This is done before the pain appears because if the patient chews gum when the pain is present the discomfort will not disappear. Some authors recommend the combination of analgesics (one hour before the appointment) with the posterior vibratory stimuli，(2529)\n【save__datas】\t【5373】\tIII. Therapeutic laser\n【save__datas】\t【5374】\tThe word laser is an acronym composed by the words\"Light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation? (8.30.31)\n【save__datas】\t【5375】\tLasers can be classified according to different aspects：\n【save__datas】\t【5376】\t1\\. According to their active media (solids， liquids or gases).\n【len<10_filter】\t【5377】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【5378】\tAccording to their wave longitude (ultraviolet， visible or infrared).\n【save__datas】\t【5379】\tAccording to their clinical application they are divided in：\n【len<10_filter】\t【5380】\t1.\n【save__datas】\t【5381】\tSoft laser.\n【save__datas】\t【5382】\t2\\. Power laser.(30)\n【save__datas】\t【5383】\tThe soft or therapeutic laser is used for analgesic， anti inflammatory and tissue regeneration purposes (recom-mended in orthodontics). Within this group these stand out： Helium-Neon (He-Ne)， Gallium Arsenide (GaAs)and Gallium Arsenide and Aluminum (Ga-As-Al).(30)\n【save__datas】\t【5384】\tThe power laser or surgical laser is used for surgical purposes mainly. The most used in dentistry are： CO2laser， the Nd-YAG (Neodinium/Ytrium-Aluminum-Garnet) laser， the ND-YAP laser， the Holmium-YAG laser， the Argon laser， the Eximer laser and the Er-YAG (Erbium： Ytrium-Aluminum-Garnet) laser. This last laser can partially substitute the high speed hand piece； this is one of the newest and more promising to work upon hard tissue (bone-teeth)， because it emits a wave longitude that is well absorbed by hidroxiapatate and water. It is designed to work in soft and hard oral tissues， and unlike other lasers， this one does not have an haemostatic coagulant effect while it cuts； anothei difference is that the laser does not travel through a flexible fiber optic rod； this laser requires an articulated arm and a special hand piece.(3o)\n【save__datas】\t【5385】\tAccording to the laser being used， we can produce a bio-logical effect at cellular level that consists fundamentally in a selective stimulation of the mitochondria that will result in an increase of the production of ATP thus there will be an increase in cellular metabolism that is known as \"bio-stimulation\"(30)\n【save__datas】\t【5386】\tThe therapeutic laser action is studied at two levels：\n【save__datas】\t【5387】\tAt cellular level.\n【save__datas】\t【5388】\tAt systemic level.\n【save__datas】\t【5389】\t1， At cellular level： it is said that the therapeutic laser is a bio-stimulant or a bio-regulator and it acts on three cellular structures basicallv：\n【save__datas】\t【5390】\tMitochondria： increasing the transformation of ADP into ATP， thus obtaining more intracellular energy.\n【save__datas】\t【5391】\tCell membrane： The laser repolarizes the mem-brane when it is depolarized. While it is acting it normalizes the intra and extra cellular ionic situation； as a result we obtain more cellular vitality and the functions of the cells tend to normalize.\n【save__datas】\t【5392】\tCell protoplasm： some investigations have dem-onstrated the possibility that the photons of the laser emission can interfere with the ultra weak cellular structure photon production centers. This phenomena facilitates the intra-structural energetic reactions， as well as the highly oxygen consuming intracellular metabolic cycles that confirm a cell activation action.(30)\n【len<10_filter】\t【5393】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【5394】\tAt systemic level：--connect--【5396】this effect is transmitted from the irradiated zone to the central nervous system， obtaining as a result analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects，(30)\n【save__datas】\t【5397】\tThe laser that we use at Centro de Estudios de Ortodoncia del Bajio (CEOB) is the diodic laser (GaAs)， it is a thera-peutic laser that emits in the infrared range close to 904nanometers of wave length and has a range in soft tissue of 3 to 6 cm and 1 cm in low density bone tissue (like the upper maxilla)() These types of lasers produce potent analgesia， anti-inflammatory effect， tissue regenerative effect and a slight haemostatic effect. Once the laser has been absorbed by the tissues， the photons interact with diverse cell structures.The diodic laser does not produce ionizing radiation and because the potency is limited and not focalized， it does not provoke tissue or cellular necro-sis. We must be very careful not to direct the laser to the eyes， because the transparency of the cornea can allow the laser to affect the retina. This is why the patient and the--connect--【5399】orthodontist must wear polarized protective eye gear or Ray-ban G-40 lenses.(333)\n【save__datas】\t【5400】\tThe skin of the zone where we are going to apply the la-ser must be cleaned thoroughly， without any presence of substances that may reflect the light of the laser and， in particular any metallic or reflective media. If there is no other remedy， the patient and the orthodontist must wear protective eye gear(333)\n【save__datas】\t【5402】\tCosmetics should not be used before or after laser applica-tion， because it has been demonstrated that after the ap-plication， skin is more prone to absorption； this is because the blood vessels are dilated， therefore gels and creamscan be more easily absorbed. In patients with sensible skin the point of the laser must move in a circular motion， if this is not done， skin micro burns can occur(33)\n【save__datas】\t【5403】\tLaser dosage in orthodontic treatment\n【save__datas】\t【5404】\t4 minutes at 2000 Hz are applied in the upper and lower areas depending on the site where the orth-odontic movement is occurring. This is done in a sweeping or circular motion.(33)\n【save__datas】\t【5405】\tAnother measure to diminish pain is to apply 2 min-utes at 4000 Hz on the path of the nerve in the dental arch in which orthodontic force is being applied.(3)\n【save__datas】\t【5406】\tIn TMJ treatments we must ask the patient to open as wide as possible， this allows maximum laser penetra-tion.(30)\n【save__datas】\t【5407】\tIn case the pain persists， we can apply the laser directly in the trigeminal nerve 4 minutes at 4000 Hz These activations are done after the orthodontic force is applied.(33)\n【save__datas】\t【5408】\tThe first application of the laser must be placed on the most painful spot， so the patient can appreciate the benefits of the treatment，(33)\n【save__datas】\t【5409】\tThe applications must not last more than 30 minutes.(a)\n【save__datas】\t【5411】\tExternal apical root resoption (EARR)\n【save__datas】\t【5412】\tThis is a common consequence of orthodontic treatment. This phenomenon has been published for more than 100years as one of the secondary effects of orthodontic treatment(Keim，2001).(10.14)\n【save__datas】\t【5413】\tTen Cate (1980) mentions that the cell responsible for EARR is the odontoclast， that has cytologic and functional characteristics like the osteoclast. EARR begins appearing mainly in the periodontal ligament pressure zone in which we will find ligament fibers dissolved by odontoclasts， which produce shallow resorption sites with the appearance of a honey comb. The pulp reaction， immediate to the external stimuli， is an increase in vascularization， hyperemia and pulp calculus formation.(5716)\n【save__datas】\t【5414】\tKaley and cols. (1991) mention that orthodontic forces allow root cement localized resoption which exposes dentine to osteoclastic activity. Nevertheless， cement is repaired in two ways：\n【save__datas】\t【5415】\tFunctional fast repair\n【save__datas】\t【5416】\tNon-functional delayed repair.\n【save__datas】\t【5417】\tFunctional fast repair is characterized by a fast cement apposition with well defined Sharpey fibers. This type of repair is found in EARR superficial lesions. The repair pro-cess in the apical area is characterized by hypercementosis that is generated as a secondary effect， the closure of the apical opening， cement exostosis and the displacement of the pulp tissue toward the tension site， preceded by selec-tive secondary dentine deposition sites.2)\n【save__datas】\t【5418】\tNon-functional delayed repair is characterized by the absence of Sharpey fibers and by the slow deposition of repair cement. This repair is sometimes found in moderate lesions and frequently in severe EARR lesions with great root dentine exposition. The response of the dentine does not have tertiary dentine.(7.10.12)\n【save__datas】\t【5419】\tMany studies coincide that the teeth that are more suscep-tible to EARR are：\n【save__datas】\t【5421】\tUpper central incisors.\n【save__datas】\t【5422】\tLower incisors.\n【save__datas】\t【5423】\tThe distal root of the first lower molar.\n【save__datas】\t【5424】\tLower second premolars.\n【save__datas】\t【5425】\tUpper second premolars (2021)\n【save__datas】\t【5426】\tSome of the factors that favor root resorption are：\n【save__datas】\t【5427】\t1\\. Swinging movements， The majority of the stud-ies report that the severity of the root resoption is directly related to the time length of the orthodontic treatment. The average root resoption that we are going to find in an average orthodontic treatment is approximately 1 mm to 1.5 mm.(12.14)\n【save__datas】\t【5428】\t2\\. Long term heavy forces in orthodontic treatment. This is why the application of light and constant forces is recommended. Ricketts states that 100 g/cmis an optimal force.\n【save__datas】\t【5429】\t3\\. Habits. Protractile tongue， nail biting， thumb sucking.(14)\n【len<10_filter】\t【5430】\t4.\n【save__datas】\t【5431】\tExcessive closeness of the dental roots to the bone cortical. We must calculate the width of the margins of the cortical bone before we initiate orthodontic treatment， because the dental movement against buccal or lingual bone may initiate root resoption or fenestration.(2)\n【save__datas】\t【5432】\t5\\. Dental trauma.Orthodontic movements can begin 4or 5 months after a tooth has received a trauma with a force less than 70 g Linge and Linge mention that the loss of root length in traumatized teeth is 1.07mm compared to 0.64 mm of non traumatized teeth.(26)\n【save__datas】\t【5433】\t6\\. Racial group. Asian patients show less EARR than Anglo-Saxons， and these show less than Hispanic pa-tients.\n【save__datas】\t【5434】\t7， Root anatomy. Long and thin roots or pipett form apexes are more susceptible to EARR.\n【save__datas】\t【5435】\t8\\. Increased overjet. Class II division 2 patients have an increased risk of root resorption due to the intrusion of the anterior segment necessary for overbite cor-rection and the torque applied to correct the palatine inclination of the incisors.(2166)\n【save__datas】\t【5436】\t9\\. Brace size.Mini braces produce less EARR because they have more inter-brace distance. The greater the inter-brace distance， the less root resoption will occur. (12)\n【save__datas】\t【5437】\t10\\. Continuous occlusal trauma. Wrongly applied orthodontic forces can cause occlusal trauma that may implicate root resorption.\n【save__datas】\t【5438】\t11\\.

These are the most aggressive orthodontic movements at root apex level； these forces affect the blood that flows to the dental pulp and nay cause necrosis and calcification. An unmeasured intru-sive force can also derive in a dental anquilosis.(26)\n【save__datas】\t【5445】\t18\\. Mid-palatal suture expansion. This treatment can damage the teeth on which the expander is supported， it can also damage the furca and the apexes of pre-molars and molars. (20)\n【save__datas】\t【5446】\tThe administration of thyroxine diminishes EARR in the maxillary incisors， this suggests that thyroid function plays an important clinical role in the ethyology of EARR； Loberg and cols. (1994) concluded that patients who had thyroid supplement (0.5g.) did not present any collateral clinical effect and the roots had good morphology after the orthodontic treatment.\n【save__datas】\t【5447】\tTeeth with endodontic treatment are more resistant to EARR due to their increased dentinal density and hardness.\n【save__datas】\t【5448】\tLesions in soft tissue (gums， mucosa， and skin) during orthodontic treatment are very frequent. Depending upon the type and place of injury， will be the urgency that we are going to face in our office. These lesions are easy to eliminate and generally subside as soon as we remove the aggressing agent.(4.15)\n【save__datas】\t【5449】\tOral lesions\n【save__datas】\t【5450】\t■ Gingival inflammation. An orthodontic treatment that does not respect the periodontum is inadmissible also inadmissible is a periodontal treatment that excludes future improvement of the occlusion thanks to orthodontic treatment. The orthodontic movements are going to act over the periodontum， so we must consider the relation between orthodontics and periodontics. Furthermore， the orthodontic treatment is going to improve the condi-tion of the patient， only if infection and inflammation are controlled. But apart from any esthetic consideration， malocclusion is the cause of many periodontal problems； fixed orthodontic appliances are the cause of de demise of the oral hygiene conditions of the patient. The lack of an appropriate dental hygiene program is an important factor that can initiate a case of gingivitis or periodontitis. Some investigations about this topic have demonstrated the relation between periodontal disease and the use of braces. Sadowsky and BeGole demonstrated that there is--connect--【5452】greater prevalence of moderate periodontitis in patients that wear braces (P<0.05) than in patients that do not wear braces， Furthermore， they showed that the prevalence is greater in extraction cases. Davies， Shaw， Worthington， M. Anddy， Dummer and Kingdon mention that braces--connect--【5455】are responsible for plaque accumulation， but the lack of dental hygiene on behalf of the patient is the main cause of plaque accumulation.(2.6，15.23)\n【save__datas】\t【5456】\tBefore we initiate an orthodontic treatment we must set an appointment show the patient how to brush their teeth properly. In this appointment we must explain in detail how to brush their teeth and how to use other hygiene auxiliaries (like the interdental brush， mouthwash， dental floss， tooth paste， etc.).(623)\n【save__datas】\t【5457】\tRecommendations\n【save__datas】\t【5458】\t1\\. Correct tooth brushing technique done at least 3 times a day.\n【len<10_filter】\t【5459】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【5460】\tUse tooth pastes with Triclosan 0.3%， these pastes sig-nificantly reduce the percentage of gingival bleeding zones. Bexident Triclosal Gingiprotector is a dental paste formulated to control and prevent dental caries and plaque.The formula is based in free and ciclodex-trine encapsulated 0.3% Triclosan， a soothing and--connect--【5461】effective anti plaque agent and 0.22% sodium fluoride， an effective anti caries agent.

Two separate processes occur in the gums after applying an orthodontic force. In the first one， there is a lesion in the fibers of the connec-tive tissue in which collagen fiber ruptures. In the second one， collagen and elastine are activated， meanwhile the collagenese tissue is inhibited， and it affects the extra cellular matrix of the gum. Orthodontic forces applied--connect--【5480】in adults must be light (it prevents root and periodontal damage) and interrupted (the tissue reorganizes after the force magnitude diminishes).In the site in which--connect--【5481】care while making excessive buccal movements because it can produce gingival recession.(4615)\n【save__datas】\t【5482】\t■ Poorly adapted bands. This lesion is produced by poorly adapted bands， or by an excess of cement or a band that is larger than the one required for the molar.

Immediately remove the power chain or the cause of the irritation.\n【save__datas】\t【5506】\tUse topical analgesic and antiseptic gels or oint-ments. The ointment must contain benzocaine and benzoin in order to accelerate healing， to diminish the buildup of dental plaque and to lessen the in-flammation of the affected zone (Kanka). Another alternative is the use of a gingival protector (Bexi-dent Encias gel)， it contains 0.20% chlorhexidine and dexpanthenol that has soothing and regenera---connect--【5508】tive properties. Both gels must de applied two or three times a day with the tip of a finger or the applier after meals.

Once these stimuli disappear when the orthodontic treatment is over and normal function is reestablished， the tissues affected by the dental movements will recuperate their structure in a new position. Teeth must be considered potentially unstable and must be contained in their new position. If the teeth are in equilibrium with the perioral and intraoral muscles and if there is dental， muscular and articular stability， the retention phase should not be a problem. 7.24.26)\n【save__datas】\t【5695】\tStudies of post treatment changes have shown that， witl time， certain movements of the treated teeth will occur The recommendation to use a retainer is based on the--connect--【5696】possibility that the factors that caused the malocclusion would still present and may affect the alignment and the occlusion of the teeth after the treatment is completed. The cases that show rebound will clinically show a moder-ate increase of the overbite and the overjet， but the most evident rebound signs will be present in the lower incisor region. This zone has long been considered the \"house foundation， especially during the last phases of growth and development. So， we must be very careful with the lower incisor region.(4.16，20，23.34)\n【save__datas】\t【5697】\tIn order to reduce rebound of the lower incisors， 13 prin-ciples have been enunciated：\n【save__datas】\t【5698】\t1， Allow the lower incisors to align by themselves， through serial extractions or with a lip bumper in the early mixed dentition period.\n【len<10_filter】\t【5699】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【5700】\tOvercorrect lower incisor rotations as early as pos sible.\n【save__datas】\t【5701】\t3\\. Perform stripping on the lower incisors during treatment and again during retention. This improves stability.\n【len<10_filter】\t【5702】\t4.\n【save__datas】\t【5703】\tAvoid incrementing the inter canine width during active treatment.\n【save__datas】\t【5704】\t5\\. Extract premolars in cases where the discrepancy in the mandible is 4 mm or more， except when facial esthetics impose something else.\n【save__datas】\t【5705】\t6\\. To more movement more rebound. Because of this we must always overcorrect.\n【len<10_filter】\t【5706】\t7.\n【save__datas】\t【5707】\tUpright the lower incisors to 90° to the mandibular plane， when the facial profile allows it.\n【save__datas】\t【5708】\t8\\.

Place the retainers the same day the braces are re-moved，\n【len<10_filter】\t【5712】\t12.\n【save__datas】\t【5713】\tVWe must recognize that sometimes we must compro-mise with esthetics， and sometimes retention will be for life.\n【save__datas】\t【5714】\t13\\. We must remind the patient the duration of reten-tion and the time that the retainer must remain in the mouth (24 hours).223)\n【save__datas】\t【5715】\tFollowing these \"principles\"will not completely eliminate rebound. The only sure way to obtain it would be to indicate retention for life.\n【save__datas】\t【5716】\tThrough time， the reduction of the mandibular arch di-mension in treated or non-treated malocclusions appears to be normal physiological phenomena. The contraction and the degree of reduction of the length of the dental arch is variable and unpredictable； but many clinical pointers can be followed to diminish the arch collapse：\n【save__datas】\t【5717】\t1\\. Try to obtain the best occlusion， health， and oral function as possible.\n【len<10_filter】\t【5718】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【5719】\tTry avoiding expansion of the lower dental arch， unless otherwise is imposed because of facial pro-file problems， or to coordinate the occlusion with maxillary expansion in order to correct a cross bite or a constricted maxilla\n【save__datas】\t【5720】\t3\\.

In this case， we can ask the patient to wear an upper retainer full time. Later， this time can be reduced progressively until the retainers are used only at night， meanwhile we must observe if any movement occurs. If these occur the retention period must be longer. Eventually the patient will cease to use the upper retention.\n【save__datas】\t【5745】\tThe protocol for long term retention varies among specialists. The degree of patient cooperation after treat-ment may vary even more. Some specialists believe that if the form of the dental arch is maintained (specially inter-canine width)， the contact points are flattened with stripping， and with fiberotomy preformed were needed， retention is almost not necessary. Some other works suggest that if we want to maintain teeth in their position， retention must be permanent. Any of these approaches can be appropriate for certain cases but not for all. Each orthodontist must establish his own protocols to follow，(20)\n【save__datas】\t【5746】\tTo understand the retention subject we must be clear about the concept of stability. Drs Mc Nelly， Mc Morris， Echeverri Guzman， Manns， Okesson， speak about two types of stability：\n【save__datas】\t【5747】\t● Dental stability.\n【save__datas】\t【5748】\tMandibular orthopedic stability.\n【save__datas】\t【5749】\tIt is said that a tooth is stabilized when maintains its posi-tion in the dental arch in the three planes of space. This can only be possible if the interproximal contact points (mesial and distal， which will stabilize the tooth in this sense) remain stable. It is also indispensable to have an excellent relation with the antagonist teeth through inter-occlusal--connect--【5750】contact points， which will maintain the teeth stable in the vertical and bucco-lingual or bucco-palatine sense.\n【save__datas】\t【5751】\tIts the postural stability of the mandible with the condyles centered in the glenoid fossa and affronted to its anterior wall. This position is induced by the synchronic activity of the elevating muscles and is stabilized by the simul-taneous bilateral dental contacts. In this manner， we observe a coincidence of central relation (CR) with the maximum intercuspidation position (MIP). These two concepts， dental stability and mandibular orthopedic stability are closely tied.\n【save__datas】\t【5752】\tInter-occlusal undesired contacts provoke mandibular instability that will provoke a muscular and dental altera-tion and a lack of coincidence between CR and MIP. With this lack of coincidence， the mandible will present two closure arches： a centric one， corresponding to CR and an eccentric one that will have a greater quantity of inter occlusal contact points. In these cases， when the mandible closes in CR， inclined contact points are established that will provoke sliding vectors during closure and in this way， the probabilities of dental instability and possible rebound are increased. This frequently results in antero-inferior overcrowding or a buccal movement of an upper incisor. On the contrary， if the treatment was successful and if we obtained an occlusion in which MIP coincides with a mandibular CR position， the closure movements will describe a single arch and the case will have optimal stability conditions.\n【save__datas】\t【5753】\tIf we want to study the stability conditions of a finished case， we must mount the case in an articulator that will allow us to easily visualize the compatibility of mandibular MIP and CR. After this evaluation， we have at hand many resources to improve this compatibility. If there is a moder-ate occlusal alteration，a retainer with elastic additaments can be used (springs， rackets， etc.) to correct the slight rebounds and to improve the stability. Sometimes an oc-clusal adjustment is necessary at the end of the treatment to improve stability. Occasionally this occlusal adjustment requires selective wear downs or sometimes an occlusal remodeling.\n【save__datas】\t【5754】\tIf our treatment creates a MIP with the mandible in CR and if the closure movements describe a single arch， we can avoid many rebounds.\n【save__datas】\t【5755】\tIn some cases， the premature contacts in CR will be in the slopes that due to their direction will not produce any mandibular displacement. But the generated forces may dissipate mesially in the upper dental arch provoking movements on the teeth of the dental arch that may cause rebound in the anterior sector.\n【save__datas】\t【5756】\tWithout any doubt， the persistence of anomalous inter occlusal contact points produce mandibular instability and generate force vectors that produce dental movement with rebound in the most vulnerable sectors.(\n【save__datas】\t【5757】\tOne of the main causes that can alter the results of an orthodontic treatment is post-treatment growth. Among these changes， we find lower incisor overcrowding， overbite and overjet rebound and the return to a Class II malocclusion.(6，10，26)\n【save__datas】\t【5758】\tThere is no doubt that growth， in particular residual growth， has influence upon post-treatment stability. We must take into account the growth pattern of the patient， and we must make a wise selection of the reten-tion appliance based in the nature and extension of the dento-facial dysplasia (growth pattern). The duration of retention must depend upon the state of maturity of the patient and growth.(13.16)\n【save__datas】\t【5759】\tIf we treat a growing child， we must place a bonded lingual retainer and check the patient annually. After growth has been completed，and supposing that we have met all our treatment goals， we can remove the fixed retainer and place a removable one. Parker says：\"Teeth move during all our life， like hair changes color through all our life， so he recommends that the retainers must be worn two or three nights a week for an indefinite time. Some authors recommend that retention should last as much as the time required for the correction of the malocclusion (orthodontic treatment)， but thi：time must be increased in patients with periodontal problems. Once this retention time is completed， we gradually liberate the patient from the retainers， until the patient only has to use them at night.(71923)\n【save__datas】\t【5760】\tThe rotation rebound of a single tooth or an anterior open bite， dental spacing， etc. can be explained by local factors， including the incapacity of the periodontal fibers to reorganize， narrow airways and lack of adaptability of the soft tissues.( Circumferential supracrestal gingival fiberotomy is a useful procedure that diminishes rebound in rotated teeth. But in these cases， a retainer must be--connect--【5761】worn for several months until the gingival fibers reorient.() After the supracrestal fiberotomy， the most notable characteristic is an increment in dental mobility. This mobility is due to the incision of the transeptal fibers that bound teeth with other teeth； this gradually dimin-ishes in 2 to 4 weeks. Teeth that are orthodontically moved， after the extraction of an adjacent tooth， push the gum and create a connective and epithelial tissue fold. After the final closure of the extraction site， this excess of gingival tissue will appear as a yestibular and lingual papilla in between the closed together teeth. The rebound can be diminished with the surgical removal or the excess of gum in between the closed together teeth(38)\n【save__datas】\t【5763】\tHawley Retainer\n【save__datas】\t【5764】\tIt is the most utilized retainer.

This wire is made out of 0.028\" or 0.036”round stainless steel wire.

In order to obtain more stability during bonding， we can pour some acrylic on the occlusal surfaces of the premolars and the molars， this way we will obtain a occlusal guide that will help us bond the retainer.\n【len<10_filter】\t【6260】\t4.\n【save__datas】\t【6261】\tThen we place the wire and the acrylic in the mouth and we bond the retainer If we want a stronger bond we can sand blast the areas of the wire that are going to be covered with the dabs of resin.\n【save__datas】\t【6264】\tUpper fixed retainers are not as frequently used as lower ones， because they are prone to fracture because of the occlusal contact. But in some adult cases they are essential if we want to assure good retention.\n【save__datas】\t【6265】\tSome patients present persistent spacing (especially in the midline) or other movements of the upper incisors. In these cases， the advantages of the upper fixed retainers surpass the risk of fracture. Before placing them we must evaluate the overbite and overjet of the patient. We must be careful not placing the wire near the incisal contact area. We can use twisted wire or preformed bars from central incisor to central incisor (1 to 1) and it is placed--connect--【6266】in a similar way as a fixed lower retainer. We must tell the patient to be careful with the wire to avoid fractures. With the proper care they can stay in the mouth a long period of time.(20)\n【save__datas】\t【6268】\tThe consideration of the use of retainers placed on the buccal aspect of upper incisors is now frequent. They can be useful in the short term for adult patients that want the braces taken off rapidly. In a few months this can be replaced with traditional retention methods. In adolescents a vestibular fixed retainer can be useful during the mixed dentition period， while we wait the eruption sequence. In other cases it may be necessary to use fixed buccal retainers to contain certain teeth， for example， in cases with extreme rotations or in premolar extraction sites or in impacted canine cases. This is a way to avoid the high rebound tendency in these cases.(20)\n【save__datas】\t【6270】\tRemovable retainers vs fixed retainers\n【save__datas】\t【6271】\tDr. Interlandi suggests that retention should be indefinite for this reason he recommends that retainers should be removable. He states that the fixed mandibular retainer from canine to canine is not the ideal retainer for several reasons：\n【save__datas】\t【6273】\tIt does not control premolar and molar alignment\n【save__datas】\t【6274】\tIt does not impede space reopening in the extraction sites， unless it is bonded from premolar to premolai or molar to molar.\n【save__datas】\t【6275】\t4\\. It does not maintain perfect alignment of the incisors unless the lingual wire is bonded to every incisor which can make proper hygiene difficult with the subsequent accumulation of calculus.\n【save__datas】\t【6276】\t5\\. This retainer is not recommended in patients with bad oral hygiene or patients that accumulate cal-culus easily.\n【save__datas】\t【6277】\t6\\. If any incisor debonds from the retainer it will misalign， and the orthodontist will be obligated to realign it again，\n【save__datas】\t【6279】\t7\\. Likewise， if a canine debonds (which happens ir20% of the cases in the first 3 years (the incisors will misalign and the orthodontist will be obligated to align it again.\n【len<10_filter】\t【6280】\t8.\n【save__datas】\t【6281】\tThe fixed retainer makes use of dental floss difficul so the general practice dentist or the patient， sooner or later will request its removal.\n【save__datas】\t【6282】\t9\\. The fixed retainer makes syndesmotomy difficult， in case it is indicated.\n【save__datas】\t【6283】\t10\\. The chair time to bond a fixed retainer is greater than the time to adjust a removable appliance.(I1)\n【save__datas】\t【6284】\tDr Interlandi recommends the use of a fixed mandibular retainer only when the patient does not want a remov-able retainer.\n【save__datas】\t【6285】\tA removable mandibular retainer has many advantages over a fixed retainer；\n【save__datas】\t【6286】\t1\\. Being from molar to molar， it maintains the entire arch aligned， not only inter-canine width.\n【len<10_filter】\t【6287】\t2.\n【save__datas】\t【6288】\tThe removable retainer does not allow extraction site reopening， and does not allow incisors， premolars or molars to rotate.\n【save__datas】\t【6289】\t3\\. The removable retainer serves as a space maintainer(in patients that are going to receive a prosthetic replacement).\n【len<10_filter】\t【6290】\t4.\n【save__datas】\t【6291】\tWe can test dental stability with the removable re-tainer， just tell the patient not to use the retainer.\n【save__datas】\t【6292】\t5\\. If the patient does not use the retainer for weeks or months and if he can place it again without dif-ficulty， it will indicate that there is stability； in this case we can suggest to the patient the intermittent use of the retainer.\n【save__datas】\t【6293】\t6\\. If the patient does not use the retainers (without inter-acting with the orthodontist) and if there was a slight rebound we might revert it by asking the patient to use the retainer full time until it fits properly (because there is a guided dental movement by the retainer).\n【save__datas】\t【6294】\t7\\.

After all， asthma affects approximately 17million Americans， including 5.3% of the adult population along with 6.3 million children. The numbers reflect the fact that we all know at least one person diagnosed with asthma. Perhaps you or one of your family members has asthma. Perhaps， like many of my own friends and relatives， you want to ask questions about the asthma care you've received from your doctor. You want to know more， understand asthma better， and learn about contemporary developments.\n【save__datas】\t【140】\tThe second question you will likely immediately want to ask me personally is：“Why did you write 100 Questions i Answers About Asthma?\"I am a practicing lung specialist， board certified in internal medicine as well as in pulmonary medicine， with a particu-lar interest in asthma care， particularly in adults. In the more than twenty years since I graduated from medical school， the medical community's understanding of asthma has increased tremendously， our views on effective treatment have changed a great deal， and highly effective medicines have been developed and brought to h1market. I evaluate and treat patients with asthma on a daily basis in my professional life. Successful asthma treatment includes more than medication prescriptions， however. It requires an exchange of information， which goes hand-in-hand with effective communica-tion.

Wbat is asthma?\n【save__datas】\t【172】\tAsthma is a chronic lung (respiratory) condition. From a patient’s perspective， it is characterized by symptoms of varying intensity and frequency. Asthma symptoms are related to the lungs and to breathing. Some people with asthma have very mild disease and have no symp-toms for much of the year. Individuals whose asthma is at the other end of the asthma spectrum may require several daily lung medications taken on a regular basis in order to normalize lung function and attain a symp-tom-free state. In its most severe“life-threatening”manifestation， asthma can be responsible for recurrent hospitalizations， severely compromised quality of life， andl even death. Physicians who specialize in asthma care firmly believe that even the most severely affected asthma sufferers can be successfully treated. With proper medical care and cooperation between patient and physician， asthmatics should lead a full and satis-fying life.\n【save__datas】\t【173】\t2\\. How many Americans bave asthma?\n【save__datas】\t【174】\tAsthma is a very common lung disease. It has been described in all age groups， from childhood into the“golden years.\"Asthma affects approximately 17 mil-lion Americans，including6.3 millionchildren\n【save__datas】\t【176】\tTable1 Asthma in the United States\n【save__datas】\t【177】\t· Approximately 17 million Americans have asthma， including 6.3million children younger than 18 years of age.\n【save__datas】\t【179】\t· There were 4，269 reported deaths from asthma in 2001 in the U.S.\n【save__datas】\t【180】\t·Asthma-related health costs are estimated at $14 billion dollars annually.\n【save__datas】\t【181】\t·Asthma is responsible for approximately 14 million missed school days and 14.5 million missed work days annually.\n【save__datas】\t【182】\tAstbma is the--connect--【183】most common--connect--【184】chronic disease--connect--【185】of childhood.\n【save__datas】\t【186】\t3\\. Is it true that asthma is on the upswing?\n【save__datas】\t【187】\tYes， there are more “cases”of asthma now than ever before in the United States. The prevalence of asthma is increasing in other industrialized countries world-wide as well. Prevalence is the total number of cases of a disease in a population at any given point in time.Of great concern to physicians are urban neighborhoods， such as parts of Harlem and of the South Bronx in New York City， where asthma in children has become epidemic and represents a health crisis.\n【save__datas】\t【188】\tGemmas comment：\n【save__datas】\t【189】\tIs asthma more common in urban than rural areas? Enui-ronmental factors are very important in the city， but many--connect--【190】of the “triggers\" that plague urban environments may also--connect--【191】be found in rural areas， such as volatile organic compounds(found in uarnishes， aerosol sprays， household disinfectants，--connect--【192】and similar products)， peeling paint， mold， decaying wood--connect--【193】in older buildings， not to mention the beavy smoke from--connect--【194】those romantic'wood fires that uacationers love to build--connect--【195】when they go to the country. My own childhood was spent in a small Midwestern town with no significant heauy industry or other causes of enuironmental pollution， yet it was marked for me by an annual parade ofseasonal aller---connect--【196】gies， colds， and a perpetual wheezing croup.\"\n【save__datas】\t【197】\t4\\. Wlby is asthma so common?\n【save__datas】\t【198】\tAsthma is very common， affecting approximately 1 of every 10 Americans--connect--【199】at--connect--【200】some point in their life， according to 2001 data from the CDC's National Health Interview Survey. It is not clear why asthma--connect--【201】has become such a prevalent chronic condition. One theory holds that physicians have become more adept at diagnosing asthma correctly so that the more pre-cise identification and more accurate counting of asthmatics has lead to a perceived increase in diag-nosed cases of asthma. Unfortunately， the opposite is true： The diagnosis of asthma is too often over-looked， particularly in older age groups and in ado-lescents， especially teenage girls. The fact is that asthma has truly become more common. A more likely theory implicates various environmental fac-tors. Smoking， for example， became socially accept-able for women after World War II. Infants of mothers who smoke are at risk for the development of wheezing and asthma in childhood. Increasing air pollutants and particulates found in urban or indus-trial areas may also play an important role. From the perspective of an asthma specialist， the enactment of anti-smoking laws banning smoking in all indoor public places， such as in New York City， is a crucial step toward improving air quality for all.\n【save__datas】\t【202】\t5\\. Asthma is a disease ofchildren， isnt it?\n【save__datas】\t【203】\tAsthma is frequently diagnosed in children and is the most common chronic disease of childhood. Asthma. however， is not simply a disease of childhood. Asthma affects adults as well. Many asthmatics are diagnosed well into adulthood. Although some adultswith asthma may previously have experienced asthma as a child， others develop the condition for the first time as an adult. Asthma can thus develop at any age.\n【save__datas】\t【204】\tAsthma is not--connect--【205】simply a--connect--【206】disease of--connect--【207】childbood.\n【save__datas】\t【208】\t6\\. How do buman lungs work?\n【save__datas】\t【210】\tThe area where the trachea divides into the right and left mainstem bronchi is called the carina. After the split， the right and left mainstem bronchi leading to each lung subdivide further into smaller and smaller tube-like passages， via the branching tracheo-bronchial tree. As the bronchi continue to subdivide into succes-sively narrower and narrower bronchi， they ultimately end in the tiniest subdivision， the bronchiole. Each bronchiole leads to the lung air sacs， the alveoli.\n【save__datas】\t【213】\t“waste product.”--connect--【214】right lung left lung\n【save__datas】\t【216】\tInhaled oxygen (see Part\n【save__datas】\t【218】\tAbnormal accumulation of carbon dioxide in the body and the bloodstream is detrimental to health and is seen in certain forms of respiratory failure. The process that is responsible for the body’s oxygen uptake and its carbon dioxide removal (or excretion) is called respira-tion. Respiration is the primary crucial function of the lungs and respiratory system. Physicians occasionally refer to respiration as “gas exchange.” Gas exchange takes place in the deepest lung， at the level of the alve-oli. Oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange takes place along a specialized zone where each air sac (alveolus) is in intimate contact with fine， minute blood vessels called capillaries. The capillary bed completely encir-cles the alveoli along the alveolar-capillary membrane. Elevations in blood carbon dioxide levels above normal lead to additional accumulation of acids in the blood-stream. As acids continue to build up in the body， res-piratory failure can ensue.\n【save__datas】\t【219】\t7\\. Do lungs continue to develop after--connect--【220】birth?\n【save__datas】\t【221】\tYes. Humans’ lungs continue to grow and develop after birth. The specialized gas-exchanging lung units called alveoli， where oxygen is exchanged for carbon dioxide， develop postnatally. In fact， the majority of the lung alveoli-nearly 85%-are formed after birth， during the first three years of life. The blood supply within the capillary network matures in parallel with alveolar development from birth to 3 years of age. Mucus cells also develop after birth.\n【save__datas】\t【222】\tBecause the majority of alveoli develop postnatally， the first three years of life can be viewed as a potentially vulnerable period. Young children afflicted with severe--connect--【223】pneumonia or tuberculosis during alveolar develop-ment， especially in the pre-antibiotic era， for example， were left with some degree of pulmonary impairment. Similarly， it is crucial that babies and young children be raised in cigarette and smoke-free homes to maxi-mize normal lung maturation.\n【save__datas】\t【224】\tAfter the age of three， the lungsarebasicallv formed， but not fully grown. As our bodiesgrow through adolescence to adulthood， so too do our lungs. Adolescence represents a sseeccoonndd“vulnerable”window. indicate that teenagers who smoke are left with lung function that is less than predicted when compared to healthy nonsmoking tteeeennss.. The finding of stunted lung function development in adolescent smokers is espe-cially notable in girls.\n【save__datas】\t【225】\t8\\. What causes asthma?\n【save__datas】\t【226】\tAsthma has no single， easily identified cause. Multiple causes and the interaction of several factors may be necessary to cause the disease. Studies have implicated a familial component. The tendency to develop asthma has an inherited basis. If one or both parents have asthma， for example， their child has a greater likeli-hood of developing asthma， as comparedto another child whose parents have nopersonalhistory of asthma. Similarly， studies of large populations of twins， comparing asthma and allergy in pairs of identi-caland fraternal twins， point to an inherited factor required for asthma development. The actual mode of inheritance is not known. Researchers around the world are working to identify a chromosomal basis for asthma. Investigation into different genes on certain\n【save__datas】\t【227】\tAsthma bas no--connect--【228】single， easily identified\n【save__datas】\t【229】\tCause.--connect--【230】chromosomes has yielded interesting results， but an“asthma gene\" has yet to be discovered. Advances in molecular biology will hopefully lead not only to the identification of primary asthma genes， but also to the genes responsible for disease severity (asthma severity-modifying genes)， as well as for response to standard treatments (asthma treatment-modifying genes).\n【save__datas】\t【231】\tClinicians have long noted that certain viral infections seem to be related to the development of asthma in predisposed iindividuals. Physiciansfoorr example describe\"asthmagenic\"viruses that cause typical respi-ratory infection and symptoms at first， only to leave the patient with an asthma-like condition. Asthma often goes hand-in-hand with allergies， especially in children and teens. Asthma is more common in per-sons with atopy， allergic rhinitis， and eczema. Some types of asthma， called occupational asthma (discussed in Question 40)， are related to specific industrial set-tings and exposures.\n【save__datas】\t【233】\tGemmas comment：\n【save__datas】\t【234】\tIt's especially important to remember that asthma is tricky.--connect--【235】changing weather conditions， humidity holding particles in--connect--【236】the air， smoke， and volatile organic compounds all can pro-duce asthma symptoms.

In addition， environmental influences have been recognized as--connect--【243】significant in the emergence of clinical asthma. The precise interplay between--connect--【244】environmental and hereditary factors leading to asthma is still insufficiently--connect--【245】understood. It is has long been noted that that some environmental exposures--connect--【246】are associated with progression to asthma while other types ofexposure might--connect--【247】possibly prevent or delay the development ofasthma in susceptible persons. The--connect--【248】complex relationships are the subject ofongoing research， at the molecular level，--connect--【249】in laboratory animals， and in human populations.\n【save__datas】\t【250】\tIndoor environments play a greater role than outdoor ones in terms of asthma development.\n【save__datas】\t【251】\tThe 2000 report on： Clearing the Air： Asthma and Indoor Air Exposures from the\n【save__datas】\t【252】\tInstitute of Medicine concludes that there is sufficient evidence to support a causal relationship between asthma development and exposures to house dust mite(increased risk of asthma)， environmental tobacco (probably increased risk). Cockroach， cat， and dog carry a\"maybe\" increased risk.\n【save__datas】\t【254】\t9\\. Do allergries cause asthma?\n【save__datas】\t【255】\tAllergies--connect--【256】and astboma--connect--【257】frequently--connect--【258】coexist in a--connect--【259】giuen--connect--【260】indiuidual.\n【save__datas】\t【261】\tThe answer depends on what you mean by “cause.”On one hand， the condition we call “asthma”is a disease that is different from allergy. On the other hand， aller-gies and asthma frequently coexist in a given individ-ual. An individual with significant allergies is more likely to also carry a diagnosis of asthma than someone without any allergies. Specific allergies can also be a type of external trigger for asthma exacerbations and increasing symptoms. For example， a child with asthma who is also allergic to cats will likely develop symptoms of his asthma if exposed to cats. For that child， cat exposure will worsen asthma， but it won’t cause it.\n【save__datas】\t【262】\tThe most severe form of an allergic reaction is called anaphylaxis. An anaphylactic reaction， especially if untreated， can involve the respiratory system and the lungs. It leads to bronchospasm and narrowed airways， with edema or swelling of the air passages. The ana-phylactic allergic response can cause wheezing， cough， and difficulty breathing-symptoms indistinguishable from asthma. An anaphylactic reaction can occur in response to many agents， including bee venom and certain medications. It is considered a true medical emergency because it is potentially life threatening.\n【save__datas】\t【263】\t10\\. Is asthma preventable?\n【save__datas】\t【264】\tIn an individual who has been diagnosed with asthma， the focus of contemporary treatment emphasizes pre-vention of symptoms such as breathlessness， chest dis-comfort， cough， mucus production， and wheezing. Certain asthma medications， sometimes referred to as“controller medicine，”are designed and prescribed to--connect--【265】maintain normal lung function， and to prevent an exac-erbation of asthma—what used to be called an asthma“attack”(see Questions 12 and 14 for more on this sub-ject). Identification of an individual's asthma triggers and avoidance of exposure to the triggers are other ways to prevent an asthma exacerbation.\n【save__datas】\t【266】\tPrevention of the development asthma in a given indi-vidual is the subiect of tremendous research. Patients， pulmonary specialists， allergists， and immunologists are all very interested in understanding the root causes of asthma. Right now， there is no known way to com-pletely prevent the development of asthma. Because asthma tends to run in families， physicians often make suggestions to try and modify the emergence of aller-gies and/or asthma in a child thought to be--connect--【267】at--connect--【268】increased risk for the development of the disease. Based on epidemiological studies， physicians may advise newparents with asthma to follow special guidelines in caring for their newborn. Many recom-mendations concern the baby's diet and environment. For example， an exclusive diet of mother’s milk for at least the first 6 months of life appears to delay， and possibly defer， the development of allergy and asthma. Similarly， early introduction of solid food is frowned upon in an infant at increased risk for asthma. Certain highly allergenic foods should not be part of a toddler's diet. The foods responsible for most food allergy in children include cow’s milk， eggs， nuts， and fish. More specifically， 90% of all allergic reactions to food are caused by eight foods： cow’s milk， egg， peanut (which is a legume， not a true nut)， tree nuts (such as walnuts， cashews， and hazelnuts)， fish， shellfish， soy， and wheat. In addition to dietary guidelines， physicians stress the--connect--【269】importance of a 100% smoke-free home.

What is the “bygiene hypothesis?”\n【save__datas】\t【271】\tThe hygiene hypothesis is a theory that attempts to explain the increased prevalence of allergy and asthma in affluent， industrialized nations. It also strives to elu-cidate factors that are responsible for the development of asthma in individuals.\n【save__datas】\t【272】\tThe British epidemiologist David Strachan advanced the hypothesis in 1989after studying the health records of approximately 17，000 British children. The hypothesis proposes that the rising prevalence of asthma and allergic diseases parallels the decreasing prevalence of infections in childhood. Over the last100 years， urbanization， advances in public health， improved sanitation， and the adoption of cleaner living environments， along with the introduction of antibi-otics， have all lead to reduction in infectious illnesses in children. During the same period of time， the occurrence of asthma and the allergic diseases has increased. The hygiene hypothesis links the two obser-vations.The hypothesis suggeststhat the reduced exposure to “dirty” environments and to infectious agents at a specific point in childhood leads to less stimulation of certain parts of the growing child's immune system. Changes consequently fail to take place in the maturing immune response and， in turn， predispose that child to an increased risk of developing allergies or asthma.\n【save__datas】\t【273】\tEpidemiological studies of large groups of people both with and without asthma have noted that two envi---connect--【274】ronmental factors seem to protect against the develop-ment of asthma： attendance at a day-care facility before the age of 1 year and the presence of a dog in the family home before birth and onward. Both fac-tors support aspects of the hygiene hypothesis. Early exposure to “dirty，”less sanitary environments appears to lead to a lower occurrence of asthma in that spe-cific， exposed population. Research continues in the area of the hygiene hypothesis. Is there an age at which a child's immune system needs to be“stimu-lated”in a specific way， by certain environmental agents or viruses， in order for asthma not to develop? If such were the case， specific interventions or medica-tions could be developed to modify a child’s risk of asthma. The hygiene hypothesis remains controversial， and at present it represents an intriguing theory that is far from definitive.\n【save__datas】\t【275】\t12\\. What is the contemporary view of--connect--【276】asthma， and how does it differ from--connect--【277】traditional views?\n【save__datas】\t【278】\tFor many years， asthma was viewed as a disease of airway narrowing， or bronchoconstriction. In the traditional view， the bronchial passages， especially those encircled by specialized muscle fibers， became narrowed or con-stricted， and an inevitable “attack”would follow. The tra-ditional explanation emphasized that constriction of the bronchial tubes was the primary event in asthmatics. The focus of asthma treatment centered on attempts at reversing constricted breathing passages. Consequently， treatment consisted mostly of relief of airway narrowing once symptoms developed and became established. Emphasis was placed on treatment of “attack”symp-toms， rather than on preventive measures.\n【save__datas】\t【279】\tThe principal--connect--【280】plaver”or--connect--【281】culprit”in--connect--【282】astoma is--connect--【283】inflammation.\n【save__datas】\t【284】\tThe contemporary perspective on asthma recognizes the importance of bronchoconstriction， but assigns it a secondary role. The principal “player”or “culprit”in asthma is inflammation. In the contemporary model of asthma， asthmatics experience periods of active disease or exacerbation， along with quiescent periods of remis-sion(Table 2). Duringanexacerbation， there is increased inflammatory activity in the asthmatic lung. The inflammation， if unchecked， leads to mucus gland stimulation with excess cretions， and to eventual bronchoconstriction， or--connect--【286】airway\n【save__datas】\t【288】\tInarrowing.The in-creasedmucus leads to cough. The bronchoconstric-tion isresponsible for symptoms of breathlessness， wheezing， and chest tightness.\n【save__datas】\t【289】\tIndividuals with asthma have a propensity to develop an enhanced inflammatory response in their lungs. They are said to have an innate state of lung“baseline hyperreactivity.” A specialized lung test， called the methacholine challenge (bronchoprovocation) test(discussed in Question 29)， is helpfulto clinicians when evaluatingindividualssuspectedof having asthma and a state of lung hyperreactivity. The ten-dencyto increased baseline hyperreactivity is likely\n【save__datas】\t【290】\tTable 2 Asthma： Quiescent versus Exacerbated\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Inactive， asymptomatic asthma  | Active，exacerbated asthma  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| --- | --- |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Inflammation absent， quiescent  | Heightened inflammation  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Air passages are clear of mucus  | Mucus production increases  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Air passages are clear of mucus  | → leads to cough， clear mucus  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Air tubes are patent， “fully”open  | Air tubes narrow， constrict  |\n【save__datas】\t【None】\t| Air tubes are patent， “fully”open  | → leads to wheezing， tightness， breathlessness  |--connect--【291】hereditary. Increased baseline hyperreactivity explains why， for example， asthmatics are more “sensitive\"to inhalation of different environmental stimuli such as cold air， strong odors， or cigarette smoke. The pres-ence of bronchial hyperreactivity is of great interest to asthma researchers. It is tempting to speculate about a medication that could modify a persons bronchial hyperreactivity and so reduce the severity of his or her asthma.\n【save__datas】\t【292】\tThe current understanding of asthma as a disease pri-marily of inflammation， with secondary airway nar-rowing and constrictionas--connect--【294】consequence of an increased inflammatory response， has both research and practical implications. It allows for preventive interventions and for more directed medications. Con-trolling and limiting airway inflammation controls asthma symptoms and allows for normal lung func-tion， an excellent prognosis， and a healthy lifestyle. Prompt treatment of an exacerbation， if and when it occurs， always includes anti-inflammatory treatment in addition to specific treatment of bronchoconstriction. Recognition of the importance of inflammation in asthma has lead to a better understanding of asthma， and to the development of more effective treatment.\n【save__datas】\t【295】\tAsthma exacerbations often occur predictably and inevitably following certain exposures， such as the onset of cold winter temperatures， for example. Some individuals “get an attack”every fall at the change of season and must forego daily routines including work and school， or avoid leisure activities. Treatment of established symptoms of \"an attack” in the traditional view might include a burst of medications， hopefully in the office setting， but possibly in the hospital. The\n【save__datas】\t【296】\tTable 3 The Contemporary View of Asthma\n【save__datas】\t【297】\tThe modern view of asthma emphasizes the all-important role of inflammation.\n【save__datas】\t【298】\tConsequently， contemporary asthma treatment includes：\n【save__datas】\t【299】\t· avoiding factors that increase lung inflammation\n【save__datas】\t【300】\t· medications that have anti-inflammatory properties\n【save__datas】\t【301】\tThe traditional view erroneously assigned a primary role to airway nar-rowing (bronchoconstriction).\n【save__datas】\t【302】\tBronchoconstriction， or airway narrowing， is the consequence of a more powerful stimulus： airway inflammation.--connect--【303】contemporary view of asthma， however， emphasizes a preventative approach (Table 3).

Wbat is an \"exacerbation”ofasthma?\n【save__datas】\t【325】\tAsthma is characterized by periods of exacerbations and remissions. An exacerbation of asthma refers to an increase in lung inflammation and represents a period of increased asthma activity. It indicates a flare of the disease. An exacerbation of asthma manifests itself as the development of pulmonary symptomatology. Examples of exacerbation or“flare”symptoms include wheezing， coughing， nighttime symptoms， increased mucus production from the lungs， breathlessnessOr dyspnea， and chest pressure or discomfort (Table 4).\n【save__datas】\t【326】\tTable 4 Asthma Exacerbations： Symptoms\n【save__datas】\t【327】\tSymptoms are wbat an individual experiences.

Measurement of lung function also typically reveals reduced values. An exacerbation usually begins with mild symptoms. If unchecked， a mild exac-erbation will worsen and become more severe. Mild exacerbations， identified early and treated appropri-ately-perhaps with increased use of inhaled medica-tion-can be “nipped in the bud\" with minimal， if any， disruption of health and lifestyle. More advanced exac-erbations may， however， require the use of additional medication， such as steroid tablets. Severe or rapidly progressive exacerbations can require hospital-based or emergency department intervention and treatment.\n【save__datas】\t【344】\tNote that the term “asthma exacerbation\" has sup-planted the outdated concept of“asthma attack.”Exac-erbation more accurately describes the gradual nature of the buildup in lung inflammation during a disease flare. An exacerbation of asthma， even of the milder type， should never be ignored or dismissed as insignifi-cant. Asthma treatment plans are helpful in providing a guide to initial self-management of symptom flares(Table 5).\n【save__datas】\t【345】\t15\\. What is a wheexe?\n【save__datas】\t【346】\tA complete physical examination includes auscultation of the lungs with a stethoscope. The physician places the chest piece of the stethoscope on the patient’s upper torso and listens as air enters and exits the lungs. The patient is then asked to take several deep breaths， breathing through his or her mouth. The physician pays close attention to the symmetry of the breath sounds and to any audible abnormalities.\n【save__datas】\t【348】\tTable 5 Asthma Exacerbations： Key Points\n【save__datas】\t【349】\tAn exacerbation of asthma reflects increased lung inflammation. An exacerbation is a flare of disease activity.\n【save__datas】\t【350】\tQuick and appropriate intervention and response to a developing exacerbation will limit its extent， and restore normal lung function.\n【save__datas】\t【351】\tAlthough asthma exacerbations develop and “build up”gradually， if untreated， they can rapidly amplify and may ultimately lead to hospital-ization， respiratory failure， and even death.\n【save__datas】\t【352】\tNever ignore increasing or worsening asthma symptoms such as wheezing， cough， mucus production， nighttime awakenings， breath-lessness， uncomfortable breathing， or chest tightness. Not all symptoms need to be present to define an exacerbation.\n【save__datas】\t【353】\tExacerbation symptoms will vary from individual to individual.\n【save__datas】\t【354】\tPrevention of exacerbations is a goal of contemporary asthma management.\n【save__datas】\t【355】\tRemember that asthma and its symptoms are controllable.\n【save__datas】\t【356】\tA wheeze refers to an abnormal breath sound made when air travels though a breathing passage (airway) that has become narrowed. The narrowing can be due to mucus secretions trapped in the airway or to the air-way muscles'constriction or tightening. In asthma， the airway narrowing is reversible. Medications prescribed for asthma help the narrowed airway return to its nor-mal size. A wheeze is best described as a high-pitched whistling sound. Wheezing can occur while breathing in (inspiratory wheezing， during the inspiratory phase o OIf the breath)， while breathing out (expiratory wheez-ing， during the expiratory phase of the breath)， or dur-ing the entire breath. Asthma isone of several conditions that can cause wheezing. If wheezing is severe， it can be heard without a stethoscope.\n【save__datas】\t【357】\tWheezing in--connect--【358】asthma--connect--【359】indicates that--connect--【360】the astoma is--connect--【361】actiue.\n【save__datas】\t【362】\tWheezing in asthma reflects ongoing lung inflamma-tion and airway narrowing， or bronchoconstriction. The presence of wheezing in asthma indicates that the asthma is active， and that more intensive and effica-cious treatment is warranted. Wheezing should never be ignored. If airway narrowing and inflammation are left untreated， there is a real risk of the disease worsen-ing， which can become potentially life threatening.\n【save__datas】\t【363】\t16\\. Will I know when I wheeze?\n【save__datas】\t【364】\tGemmas comment：\n【save__datas】\t【365】\tIn my teens I attended a boarding school in northern New\n【save__datas】\t【366】\tYork State. I found that in winter I could always develop a noisy “wheexe ifI opened a window and took big gulps of cold air. The choking cough and noisy breathing that followed--connect--【367】was enough to get me excused from what was called winter\"sport” (usually shoveling snow off a basketball court!)， and--connect--【368】that was what I wanted. I didn't think I was sick，\" just\"smart.\" Certainly， I never discussed these symptoms with a--connect--【369】doctor， because they serued me well： they excused me from--connect--【370】unwanted activity. Of course， such wheezes might not have--connect--【371】been diagnosed as asthma (as discussed in Question 91).\n【save__datas】\t【372】\tMost individuals with asthma can recognize when they are wheezing. They may become aware of the abnormal sound of wheezing as inhaled air travels though narrowed bronchial passages：“It sounded like a cat purring in my chest.\" Others may notice an uncomfortable mid-chest pressure. Wheezing should never be ignored or dismissed as unimportant.\n【save__datas】\t【373】\tWheezing--connect--【374】should neuer--connect--【375】be ignored or--connect--【376】dismissed as--connect--【377】unimportant.\n【save__datas】\t【378】\tIn people with a variant type of asthma called “cough-variant asthma，”wheezing is absent， replaced by a dry，--connect--【379】nonproductive cough. The emergence of wheezing， or persistent dry cough in the case of cough-variant asthma， is always significant and must be reported to the treating physician. The development of wheezing indicates inadequate asthma control and may herald the beginning of an exacerbation of the disease. The same is true of a cough in cough-variant asthma because the cough is equivalent to a wheeze.\n【save__datas】\t【380】\t17.Does wheezing mean that I haue--connect--【381】asthma?\n【save__datas】\t【382】\tNo， not necessarily. The to and fro movement of air through the lungs and tracheo-bronchial tree should always be silent. A wheeze is an abnormal sound pro-duced by turbulent flow of air through the lungs. There are many different causes for wheezing (Table6). However， the occurrence of a wheeze by itself with-out any other symptoms is unusual. It is therefore important to note if the wheezing is recurrent or if it is associated with other lung symptoms such as breath-lessness， cough， or mucus production.\n【save__datas】\t【383】\tMedical students learn that “not all that wheezes is asthma.”Although most people with asthma will at some point experience wheezing， not everyone who wheezes has a diagnosis of asthma. Some people who wheeze will have a lung condition other than asthma， while others will wheeze even though there is no iden-tifiable lung condition and the lungs appear com-pletely normal. In the first category are those with a cigarette-related lung disease such as COPD， for example. Other lung diseases， such as bronchiectasis or bronchiolitis， can also lead to wheezing. Certain infec-\n【save__datas】\t【384】\tTable 6 Causes of Wheezing\n【len<10_filter】\t【385】\tAsthma\n【save__datas】\t【386】\tForeign body aspiration COPD chronic obstructive bronchitis emphysema Bronchiectasis Lung infections， infectious bronchitis， bronchiolitis， croup Allergic reaction (severe，anaphylactoid) Congestive heart failure GERD (gastro-esophageal reflux disease)\n【save__datas】\t【387】\tDrug induced (beta-blockers)--connect--【388】tions of the lungs can cause wheezing in completely normal lungs. Some people without lung disease who have a type of heart dysfunction called “congestive heart failure” can wheeze if they take in too much fluid. Still others might wheeze after a severe allergy such as to a bee sting， for example. Gastric reflux， called“GERD”(gastro-esophageal reflux disease)， is a disease of the digestive system and is an example of a nonpulmonary condition that can mimic asthma. Sim-ilarly， vocal cord dysfunction syndrome， or“VCD，”affects the voice box (larynx) and is often confused with asthma. Finally， and especially in children， a wheeze can be caused by a foreign body trapped in the bronchial tree. Young children， in particular， explore the world by putting objects in their mouth. From there， it's a short trip “down\"into the breathing pas-sages. A foreign body should be retrieved， or “fished--connect--【389】out”of the lung passages， usually via bronchoscopy. Medical iournals and textbooks have described the successful retrieval of many disparate items， from fish or chicken bones to coins， toy fragments， or even a coffee stirrer.\n【save__datas】\t【390】\t18\\. Why do I cough after jogging，--connect--【391】running， or exercise.\n【save__datas】\t【392】\tThe presence of a cough is always abnormal. There are many reasons why a person might develop a cough. Each one of us has experienced a cough at some point in our lives， when ill with a respiratory infection or a head cold， for example. Most coughs due to colds are short lived. When a cough lasts longer than two or three weeks， or develops in a particular pattern， take note. The majority of individuals with chronic cough have one of three causes： asthma， gastric reflux， or sinus disease. Cough that regularly occurs with exer-cise， in the setting of aerobic activity， strongly suggests the presence of asthma， unless proven otherwise.\n【save__datas】\t【393】\tThe presence--connect--【394】fa cough is--connect--【395】always--connect--【396】abnormal.\n【save__datas】\t【397】\tExercise is considered1aa“trigger\" in all persons with asthma.

In young children in par-ticular， cough with exertion should never be ignored； it may be the “tip off” to the diagnosis of asthma.\n【save__datas】\t【398】\tExercise does--connect--【399】not cause--connect--【400】asthma but--connect--【401】acts as a--connect--【402】stimulus.\n【save__datas】\t【403】\t19\\. Could my symptoms be due to a--connect--【404】condition other than asthma?\n【save__datas】\t【405】\tYes， depending on what your symptoms are. Medical students and physicians in specialty training are taught11cugcc1the skill of \"differential diagnosis.” When reviewing and analyzing a patient's report of symptoms， the--connect--【406】physician generates a list of different possible condi-tions that could theoretically be responsible for the symptoms. That list of possible conditions is called the differential diagnosis. The physician then ranks the possibilities in order of likelihood. The most likely， based on the information available， is listed first. The next sstteepp usually involves attempting to confirm， or“rule in\" the doctor’s initial diagnostic impression by performing specific tests as needed， in addition to the physical eexamination. For example， the differential diagnosis of a persistent， dry cough that lasts more than a month might include asthma， postnasal dis-charge and drip， or gastro-esophageal reflux disease(GERD)， either alone or in combination.\n【save__datas】\t【407】\tSome conditions mimic asthma (Table 7). For exam-ple， vocal cord dysfunction syndrome can exhibit symptoms similar to asthma. Specific types of heart disease， such as congestive heart failure， can be mis-taken for asthma. Some physicians even use the term“cardiac asthma，”a misnomer， to describe the wheezing sounds associated with congestive heart failure. Simi-larly， lung diseases other than asthma can be responsible for symptoms suggestive of asthma. Emphysema and chronic obstructive bronchitis can “look like”asthma， but a significant history of smoking cigarettes is usually present. Pulmonary sarcoidosis can cause wheezing. Rare lung diseases like obliterative bronchiolitis or eosiniphilic pneumonia are also occasionally in the dif-ferential diagnosis of asthma-like symptoms.\n【save__datas】\t【408】\t20\\.

The abnormality that characterizes COPD is called“obstructive dysfunction.”Several different lung condi-tions typically exhibit the obstructive dysfunction pat-tern of abnormality on pulmonary function testing. They include emphysema， chronic obstructive bronchi-tis， exacerbated asthma， and bronchiectasis. The two first diseases， in particular， share several features. Both--connect--【429】emphysema and chronic obstructive bronchitis are asso-ciated with cigarette smoking. Both exhibit obstructive dysfunction on spirometry that does not completely reverse with medication， and thus demonstrate a“fixed”or “irreversible”type of obstructive dysfunction. Both cause respiratory symptoms such as breathlessness or cCoOugh. Interestingly， emphysema and chronic obstruc- tive bronchitis frequently coexist in the same person， usually a current or former cigarette smoker.\n【save__datas】\t【430】\tPartly because emphysema and chronic obstructive bronchitis appear at first glance to be so similar， physi-cians have taken to using the term COPD to refer specifically to either emphysema or chronic obstructive bronchitis， or even to a combination of both. The use of COPD as a kind of shorthand for a disease， whether emphysema or chronic obstructive bronchitis， has taken hold among medical professionals as well as the general public， despite disapproval from some linguistic purists.\n【save__datas】\t【431】\t21\\. Is COPD related to asthma?\n【save__datas】\t【432】\tNo， not really. Asthma is a specific lung disease that is separate and different from emphysema and chronic obstructive bronchitis. COPD is often used to describe emphysema， chronic obstructive bronchitis， or a combi-nation of both. COPD， therefore， refers to diseases that are not asthma. COPD is not related to asthma， although COPD and asthma do share apparent similarities. In some individuals， COPD can coexist with asthma.\n【save__datas】\t【433】\t22\\. What are the similarities and--connect--【434】differences between asthma and COPD?\n【save__datas】\t【435】\tCOPD and asthma are lung ailments. Asthma and COPD are often confused because they can both give rise to similar symptomatology， and are sometimes--connect--【436】treated with the same medicines. Both conditions can variably lead to symptoms of breathlessness， wheezy breathing， coughing， and mucus production. Some medicines prescribed for the treatment of asthma， such as the inhaled B2agonist inhalers and theophylline， for example， are also used in COPD treatment. Asthma and the conditions caused by COPD may also demon-strate a similar pattern of abnormality on pulmonary function testing called “obstructive dysfunction.”\n【save__datas】\t【437】\tTo a pulmonologist， COPD and asthma are completely different. The single most common cause of COPD is cigarette smoking. COPD is a disease of mid to late adulthood. COPD is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States， and is a significant cause of lifestyle limitation. COPD's obstructive dysfunction， as noted on pulmonary function testing， is fixed or “irreversible.”Asthma has a genetic basis. It affects all ages. The diag-nosis of asthma is compatible with a long and full life. By definition， the obstructive dysfunction on pulmonary function tests in asthma is reversible.\n【save__datas】\t【438】\t23\\. Are there medical conditions that can--connect--【439】mimic asthma or make it more severe?\n【save__datas】\t【441】\tSeveral--connect--【442】medical--connect--【443】conditions can--connect--【444】mimic asthma.\n【save__datas】\t【445】\tVocal cord dysfunction syndrome， along with dysfunc-tion and tumors of the voice box， are good examples.\n【save__datas】\t【446】\tThe non-pulmonary asthma mimics include cardiac diseases， such as congestive heart failure (CHF)， and digestive diseases， principally reflux andgastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). Finally， certain prescription medications can produce asthma-like symptoms in susceptible individuals. The antihyper-tensive medicines known as ACE-inhibitors can give rise to a nagging dry cough that is easily mistaken for an asthmatic symptom. Beta-blocker medication， used in the treatment of glaucoma and cardiovascular dis-ease， can cause wheezing and breathlessness， often indistinguishable from asthma.\n【save__datas】\t【447】\tMedical conditions such as sinusitis， allergic rhinitis， and reflux (GERD) can make asthmatic symptomatol-ogymorepronounced， particularly if theyare not addressed and treated appropriately.

Because the cords swing together instead of moving apart， the flow of air into the trachea and lungs becomes compromised. Wheezing occurs as air is forced through the abnormally narrowed vocal cord opening. Other symptoms of VCD include a change in voice quality， hoarseness， throat or chest tightness， and difficulty swallowing.\n【save__datas】\t【454】\tVCD is often misdiagnosed as asthma， especially as difficult-to-control， or refractory， asthma. Clues to its diagnosis include non-response to asthma treatment， a preponderance of throat symptoms， as well as the absence of nocturnal symptomatology that is so char-acteristic of asthma.VCD can occur in childhood. adolescence， or adulthood， but is more common in people who are in their 20s to 40s. In younger patients， VCD may occur during competitive sports and seems to have an association with a driven or high-achieving personality style. Psychological factors may be impor-tant in adults as well. Among adult patients， women predominate， as do female healthcare workers， for rea-sons that are not understood.\n【save__datas】\t【455】\tIf VCD is suspected， referral to a specialized center familiar with diagnosis and treatment of VCD should be strongly considered. It is especially important to deter-mine whether VCD is present alone， or whether there is a dual diagnosis of asthma and VCD， as they can occa-sionally exist together in the same patient. Treatment of VCD includes discontinuance of any non-indicated medication， particularly steroidsS..Specialized speech therapy is the mainstay of treatment and is accompanied， when indicated， by relaxation exercises and psychological support.\n【save__datas】\t【456】\t25\\. What is gastro-esophageal reflux--connect--【457】disease (GERD)，and why does it affect--connect--【458】my asthma?\n【save__datas】\t【459】\tGERD is an acronym for gastro-esophageal reflux dis-ease， a medical condition related to the regurgitation of stomach acid. GERD is a very common condition and can be experienced as heartburn and indigestion. Acid refluxing from the stomach can irritate the vocal cords. Hoarseness and a cough akin to throat clearing may ensue. Finally， any acid reaching the uppermost respira-tory passages can cause coughing and even wheezing， similar to asthma. GERD not only mimics asthma symptoms， but can also worsen stable asthma. The good news is that GERD is highly treatable. Treatment con-sists of straightforward dietary and lifestyle modifica-tions， as well as medication to reduce the stomachs acid production. Sometimes measures as simple as avoiding carbonated beverages， fried foods， and caffeine， eating frequent， smaller meals， or not eating for three hours before bedtime will do wonders for reflux symptoms. Better reflux control will lead to improved asthma con-trol and reduced asthma symptoms.\n【save__datas】\t【460】\tGERD not--connect--【461】only mimics--connect--【462】asthma symp---connect--【463】toms， but can--connect--【464】also worsen--connect--【465】stable astoma.\n【save__datas】\t【466】\t26\\. How is the diagnosis ofasthma--connect--【467】establisbed?\n【save__datas】\t【468】\tGemmas comment：\n【save__datas】\t【469】\tAs an older adult in my 60s， I bad， at different times， two--connect--【470】primary care physicians： one whose specialty was gastroin-testinal medicine， the other whose specialty was cardiology.\n【save__datas】\t【471】\tIn routine interuiews， they both asked if I coughed on a daily basis， and of course I said yes. Yet neither one sug---connect--【472】gested that I should see a pulmonologist， and I was not sur-prised， since I was used to coughing and thought of it as\n【save__datas】\t【473】\tnormal.\" My asthma was diagnosed only when I turned--connect--【474】up for a routine visit in the cardiologist’s office with a bad--connect--【475】cold and a wbeeze. In the light of my experience， it’s easy--connect--【476】for me to believe that asthma is underdiagnosed.\n【save__datas】\t【477】\tThe diagnosis of asthma is often straightforward， but can also be frustrating and elusive. Asthma can mani-fest differently in different individuals because of its waxing and waning nature， as well as its variability. A physician evaluating a patient with a typical， or“text-book，\" presentation will likely be able to correctly diagnose asthma at the first visit. A patient with vari-ant or atypical symptoms may require repeat visits or specialized diagnostic testing to confirm the suspected diagnosis of asthma. Usually， more severe forms of asthma are easier to pinpoint and diagnose accurately. Consider some examples in each category. A previ-ously healthy， nonsmoking young adult who reports an episodic history of intermittent wheezing， cough， chest discomfort， and breathlessness with exposure to cold winter air is describing a history typical of asthma. The college student who sees the doctor because of a \"nag-ging cough，” and who is concerned about chronic or recurrent “bronchitis and colds，” might actually be asthmatic. Similarly， the teenager who gets “really winded”playing racquetball， and then “gets used to”coughing for a few hours after each match， could cer-tainly have asthma as well.\n【save__datas】\t【478】\tAsthma can be confidently diagnosed when specific symptoms， physical examination findings， and special-ized test abnormalities are present. The first step in the evaluation of suspected asthma is a complete medical history， during which the doctor and the patient meet face to face for an in-depth conversation and exchange of information. The patient will describe in detail what--connect--【479】symptoms he or she is experiencing， and the physician will ask a series of directed questions regarding lung health， followed by more general health inquiries. In this fashion， the physician will obtain information not only about the patient’s specific pulmonary symptoms， but also about the presence or absence of allergies，and other medical or surgical conditions. Other important background information derives from review of the patient's medication history， along with their travel， occupational， and social history. Some questions may at firstsoundintrusive， but shouldnonetheless be answered truthfully. When I ask a patient if there is wall-to-wall carpeting in the bedroom， or who does the vacuuming， for example， I’m far from interested in dis-cussing domestic decorating or cleaning arrangements. Rather， I'm gathering facts to help me decide whether a allergic response to the home environment is a possi-bility. Similarly， when I ask， “Is anyone else at home coughing， too?”or“Is anyone at home a smoker?”， I’m searching for clues to help me hone in on the correct diagnosis. All conversations between my patients and I are entirely confidential； truthfulness between us is an important part of the successful doctor-patient rela-tionship. Just as I would never think of telling a patient an untruth， so， too， do I count on my patients to pro-vide me with an accurate description or history.\n【save__datas】\t【480】\tAfter history-taking comes the physical exam. Most lung specialists will perform a directed physical， with special emphasis on the respiratory system. One can expect measurement of vital signs， including blood pres-sure， respiratory rate， pulse， and if necessary， tempera-ture. The lungs are examined by inspection， percussion， and auscultation. Inspection refers to a visual“look.”Do both lungs move in and out with each breath， for exam-ple? Percussion involves gently tapping on the chest.

Auscultation requires a stethoscope. As described in Question 15， the examiner will ask the patient to inhale and exhale deeply and regularly during auscultation. The presence or absence of wheezing is especially significant.\n【save__datas】\t【494】\tAfter the history and the physical exam are completed， the doctor will be able to generate a list of diagnostic possibilities， called “the differential diagnosis.” The doctor’s “clinical impression’rates the possible diag-Doses in order of likelihood. Sometimes it may be obvious to the doctor that asthma is present. If not， and if asthma is high on the list of possible explana-tions for a patient's symptoms， then additional diag-nostic testing is often obtained (Table 9).\n【save__datas】\t【495】\t27\\. What diagnostic tests are used to help--connect--【496】diagnose asthma?\n【save__datas】\t【497】\tThe most helpful diagnostic tests for asthma are pul-monary function tests， often referred to as PFTs (dis---connect--【498】cussed in Question 28). Other useful tests include S 11blood tests and X-ray studies. Additional， more special-ized studies may be indicated. An example of a special-ized study is skin-prick testing for suspected allergy. Blood tests are useful in getting an overall picture of a person's health， as well as in excluding other diagnoses.\n【save__datas】\t【500】\tnt of immune function and allergies， for example， can be performed in part via blood testing. X-ray studies include conventional chest X-rays， as well as three-dimensional chest CT (computed tomogra-phy)scans. Chest X-rays and CT sscans provide intor-mation about the anatomy or structure of the lungs and larger breathing passages. In quiescent， controlled asthma， the chest X-ray should be entirely normal.The same is true of the chest CT scan. During an exacerba-tion， however， the lungs'appearance on an X-ray may suggest what radiologists call “hyperinflation，\" and the CT might reveal “air-trapping.\"Both findings reflect the uneven lung filling and emptying when breathing occurs through inflamed， constricted air tubes.\n【save__datas】\t【501】\tMRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scanning and PET (positron emission tomography) scanning， while useful in other types of lung diseases， are not required in asthma. The same is true of nuclear medicine scans， such as ventilation-perfusion scans， and gallium scans.\n【save__datas】\t【502】\t28\\.

Spirometry is the most useful of the PFTs when it comes to asthma diagnosis and treat---connect--【528】ment.\n【save__datas】\t【529】\tSpirometry， in turn， includes two important--connect--【530】sub-tests. The first is called the “peak expiratory flow，”abbreviated PEF. The second is the FEV， the forced expiratory volume in one second. Measurements of PEF and FEV are thus parts， or sub-tests， of the spirometry portion of the PFTs. The availability of inexpensive， highly portable， and easy-to-use peak-flow monitors makes it possible for every asthmatic to measure his or her peak flow at home on a daily basis. FEV measurements， on the other hand， require the use of a spirometer， which is far more costly， requires special maintenance， and is impractical for home use. Self-monitoring of PEF allows an asthmatic insight into his or her condition and permits an assessment of asthma control. Both PEF and FEV play a pivotal role in the National Asthma Education and Preven-tion Program's (NAEPP) asthma diagnosis， classifica-tion， and treatment guidelines.\n【save__datas】\t【531】\tTo perform spirometry and PEF， the patient is first asked to take a maximal， deep breath of room air. Then， that biggest single breath is forcefully and rap-idly exhaled iinnttoo aa mouthpiece connected to the spirometer， or peak flow meter.The maneuuver iS repeated several times during testing to ensure accu-rate， reproducible values. The spirometer measures the exhaled lung volume， as well as the flow of air through the mouthpiece for the time that exhalation takes place. The spirometry measurements are recorded by the spirometer， and are printed out and graphed for review and future reference. Each individual patient measurement is compared to a predicted value. The predicted values for pulmonary function tests are based on three variables： (1) age， (2) height， and (3) gender. Predicted values are different for a 21-year-old， six-foot-tall man than for a five-foot-tall， 46-year-old--connect--【532】woman. Therefore， the PEF value， or FEV， that is considered normal for a short， older female with asthma would be abnormally low if obtained by a tall， adolescent male with asthma.\n【save__datas】\t【533】\tBecause asthma is characterized as a disease of lung emptying， exhalation time is abnormally prolonged in asthma. Anyone with active asthma who attempts to blow out all the candles on a birthday cake with one sin-gle mighty blow of air knows about impaired“lung emp-tying” firsthand! Depending on the degree of asthma and other factors， such as how much airway narrowing， or bronchospasm， ispresent， full exhalation during spirometry might last as long as 12 to 14 seconds rather than the normal 5 to 6 seconds. The FEV and PEF val-ues reflect the efficiency and status of lung emptying， and thus provide information about how an asthmatic's lung function is affected by his or her condition.\n【save__datas】\t【534】\tThe FEV is defined as the volume of air that is exhaled in the first second of forceful exhalation as measured by spirometry. If asthma is poorly controlled， it will take longer than predicted for the lungs to fully empty. Since total exhalation time is prolonged in asthma， then it follows that the amount or volume of air exhaled in the first second of exhalation is reduced as compared to a predicted normal. The FEV will be decreased in symptomatic or poorly controlled asthma. With treatment， the lungs should empty more effi-ciently， and the FEV value should return to normal.\n【save__datas】\t【535】\tJust as active or exacerbated asthma prolongs exhala-tion， flow of air through narrowed air passages is reduced. Spirometry in active asthma also reveals reduced flow rates. The peak flow is the single greatest value of flow measurement that occurs as the lungs--connect--【536】start to empty. Peakflows reflect the flow of air through the larger， so-called “conducting”airways in asthma. Peak flow generally “tracks\"asthma activity. Monitoring peak flow at home initially identifies an asthmatic's predicted PEF， along with his or her “per-sonal best”measurements， obtained when the asthma is well controlled. Home-based PEF monitoring can then help identify even a mild exacerbation and guide medication adjustment up or down， depending on how the PEF value fluctuates from the “personal best.”Self-administered PEF measurements over time are a component of asthma action plans.\n【save__datas】\t【537】\t29\\. Wbat is a methacholine challenge(bronchoprouocation) test?\n【save__datas】\t【538】\tA methacholine challenge test is a diagnostic test used in the evaluation of suspected asthma. The metha-choline challenge is also used for research purposes to study airway hyperreactivity. Under special circum-stances it plays a role in the clinical arena. It is one type of a class of specialized tests called bronchoprovo-cation tests. Cold-air exercise tests are another exam-ple of a bronchoprovocation test.\n【save__datas】\t【539】\tA bronchoprovocation test might be ordered in the evaluation of suspected asthma. It is not considered a“routine\"test. Usually， the patient describes subtle symptoms suggestive of asthma. Spirometry and other pulmonary function testing are entirely normal. History， physical examination， blood tests， and X-rays fail to reveal an alternative diagnosis or medical explanation for the reported symptoms. The bronchoprovocation test is then indicated to further evaluate for the possibil-ity of asthma. It is an extremely powerful test for elimi-nating or \"ruling out\"asthma. In other words， if the test--connect--【540】is \"negative，\"then asthma is not present. However， if the test is “positive\" and the symptoms correspond， then the patient likely has asthma. People with asthma demon-strate an increased sensitivity to the inhalation of methacholine and therefore obtain a “positive” test result. The converse statement is not true： Although everyone with asthma has a“positive\"result on metha-choline testing， not everyone demonstrating a “positive”result on methacholine testing will have asthma.\n【save__datas】\t【541】\tThe actual methacholine challenge test is usually per-formed in a hospital pulmonary function lab. The test involves obtaining a baseline spirometry measurement， and then repeating spirometry after inhalation of higher and higher concentrations of methacholine. The baseline spirometry values should be normal， which is why the challenge test is indicated. If the spirometry measurements remain close to baseline val-ues after inhalation of increasing doses of metha-choline， the test is said to be “negative，\" and asthma is effectively ruled out. If， on the other hand， the spirom-etry values decline significantly after the methacholine inhalation， or if wheezing or other symptoms develop， the test is reported as “positive.\" The testing immedi-ately stops at that point， and an inhaled， short-acting bronchodilator is administered to relieve symptoms and reverse the abnormal lung function.\n【save__datas】\t【542】\t30\\. What is arterial blood gas (ABG)--connect--【543】sampling?\n【save__datas】\t【544】\tWhen a physician wants information on how effi-ciently a patient’s lungs are functioning， an arterial blood gas (ABG) can provide the answer. The ABG is ablood test. Performance of a routine bloodi test--connect--【545】requires blood taken from a vein， often from the area near the elbow crease. For an ABG test， however， blood is drawn from an artery instead of a vein， and it is analyzed immediately for oxygen (O2) content， car-bon dioxide (CO))， and pH， a measure of acidity. The radial artery in the wrist is a frequent site for ABG sampling. The ABG gives information about the arte-rial blood’s oxygen and carbon dioxide content， as well as the blood's acidity. Because the lungs are responsible for the extraction of oxygen from the outside air as well as for the removal of carbon dioxide， analysis of the artery sample for those gases indicates how well the lungs are functioning.\n【save__datas】\t【546】\tThe main function of the respiratory system is to carry out respiration： the exchange of O， for CO. Respira-tion provides the body’s vital organs with oxygen and allows for removal of accumulated “waste products，”primarily， acid. After the blood supply passes though the lungs and picks up oxygen， it becomes oxygen-rich and carbon dioxide-poor. The oxygen-rich blood is then pumped by the heart to the entire body-via the arteries-in order to supply organs with needed oxygen.\n【save__datas】\t【547】\tAlthough an ABG is not a routine test in outpatient asthma management， it is frequently used in intensive care. If a person is suffering a severe asthmatic exacer-bation， the ABG will reveal decreased oxygen and car-bon dioxide. If the asthma worsens further， carbon dioxide may rise， and the pH will drop， indicating a dangerous buildup of acid. Such a scenario may indi-cate life-threatening asthma. If such is the case， respi-ratory failure will ensue from continued carbon dioxide accumulationandoxygendeprivation；treatment includes “life support\"with a ventilator. Patients on--connect--【548】ventilator assistance may require frequent ABG moni-toring to assist physicians in selecting optimal ventila-tor settings and to ensure adequate oxygen delivery to vital organs.\n【save__datas】\t【549】\t31\\. What is bronchoscopy?\n【save__datas】\t【550】\tBronchoscopy is a lung procedure that allows the physician to look directly into the bronchi and to obtain samples or biopsies of any abnormalities found in the bronchial tree. Bronchoscopy is said to be “diag-nostic”when it is carried out to assist physicians in investigating a lung abnormality. A bronchoscopy is eiit1 when performed to remove excess lung secretions or to retrieve aspirated (inhaled) foreign bodies. There aretwo 1types of bronchoscopes (the instruments used to perform bronchoscopy)： flexible bronchoscopes and rigid bronchoscopes.\n【save__datas】\t【551】\tFlexible bronchoscopy is also called flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy， or FOB. Pulmonologists perform FOB， as do thoracic (chest) surgeons. FOB is usually per-formed with the patient sedated， but breathing on his or her own. The bronchoscopist passes the broncho-scope instrument (or scope， for short) through the nose or the mouth， through the vocal cords， and into the trachea. From there， the bronchoscopist can enter and visually inspect the main bronchi and all narrower divisions. The scope enters the lung passages the same way air does. The scope has a light at its tip， as well as a channel， through which the bronchoscopist can inject local numbing medication， pass biopsy tweezers， and suck up any secretions. FOB is often used diag-nostically in the investigation of masses or abnormali-ties seen on chest X-ray studies.\n【save__datas】\t【552】\tA rigid bronchoscopy is always performed in the oper-ating room by a thoracic (chest) surgeon with the patient unconscious under anesthesia. The rigid bron-choscope is larger and less maneuverable than the flex-ible scope. It is considered superior to the flexible scope in two specific settings： when dealing with bleeding within the lung， and when retrieving larger aspirated (inhaled) foreign bodies. It also allows for the placement of bronchial stents in specialized circum-stances. Most rigid bronchoscopies are indicated for therapeutic purposes.\n【save__datas】\t【553】\tBronchoscopy is not routinely performed in the care of someone with asthma. Rare situations involving very severe asthma， when marked accumulation of mucus extensively blocks the bronchial passages， can require bronchoscopy to remove the thick， obstruct-ing mucus plugs.\n【save__datas】\t【554】\tHaving well-controlled asthma is not a contraindica-tion to undergoing bronchoscopy if it is required for evaluation of another (non-asthma) lung condition. It is important that a patient’s asthma be quiescent and inactive when the bronchoscopy is performed. In par-ticular， if a person scheduled to undergo bronchoscopy is wheezing， the procedure should be cancelled and the wheezing brought under control before proceeding with the test.\n【save__datas】\t【556】\tAstama：Classification--connect--【557】and Variant\n【len<10_filter】\t【558】\tForms\n【save__datas】\t【559】\tWhat is the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP)?\n【save__datas】\t【560】\tWhat is cough-variant asthma?

Although much was known about asthma itself， treat-ment and outcomes were clearly suboptimal， especially when viewed from a national perspective. The NAEPP's primary goal is to improve asthma care in the United States. Its main focus is education： to teach health profes-sionals， asthma patients， and the general public about asthma. The program strives to improve the quality of life for those with asthma and hopes to decrease asthma-related morbidity and mortality. The NAEPP is adminis-tered and coordinated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ National Institute of Health's National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI).\n【save__datas】\t【566】\tThe NHLBI convened a panel of medical experts as part of the NAEPP in order to improve the clinical manage-ment of asthma in the United States， and to stimulate additional research on asthma.

What is cougb-variant asthma?\n【save__datas】\t【690】\tCough-variant asthma is a type of asthma with cough as the principal， and sometimes only， symptom. A per-son with cough-variant asthma experiences dry gener-ally nonproductive cough without wheezing Or breathlessness (Table 15). The cough can be consid-ered as a “wheeze equivalent.\" It may be provoked by triggers such as cold air or viral upper respiratory tract infections. Like “typical\"asthma， there may be a sig-nificant nocturnal component. Cough-variant asthma has been described in all age groups， from toddlers to\n【save__datas】\t【691】\tTable 15 Cough-Variant Asthma\n【save__datas】\t【692】\tImportant points about cough-variant asthma include：\n【save__datas】\t【693】\t·Cough-variant asthma is a subclass， or variant of asthma.\n【save__datas】\t【694】\t·Although individuals with asthma can experience cough as one symptom along with wheezing and breathlessness， individuals with the cough-variant form have only cough as a symptom， usually with-out wheezing or breathlessness.\n【save__datas】\t【695】\t·The chest x-ray is normal.\n【save__datas】\t【696】\t·Pulmonary function tests are normal.\n【save__datas】\t【697】\t·Methacholine challenge testing is abnormal， or“positive.”\n【save__datas】\t【698】\t·Corticosteroids， either inhaled or in pill form， are effective treat-ments and should be part of the treatment regimen.\n【save__datas】\t【699】\tThe response to oral corticosteroids can be dramatic， with marked improvement in as little as 24 hours.\n【save__datas】\t【700】\t·A person with dry cough for three weeks or more should be evalu-ated for possible cough-variant asthma， especially if the chest x-ray and pulmonary function tests are normal1..\n【save__datas】\t【701】\t·Other caus O1es of chronic dry cough of three weeks duration or morewith normal chest x-ray and spirometry include： (1) gastro-esophageal reflux (GERD)， (2) post-nasal drip or discharge， and (3) post-viral cough following a viral respiratory illness.--connect--【702】seniors. The chest X-ray is normal in cough-variant asthma， as is spirometry and pulmonary-function test-ing. The diagnosis may require bronchoprovocation testing， such as a methacholine challenge test. Treat-ment requires anti-inflammatory steroid medication. Inhaled steroids can be effective， and a two-week trial is often helpful. If there is no response to the inhaled steroids， then a course of oral (pill form) steroids is indicated， which can often yield prompt and dramatic improvement. Bronchodilators are often part of the treatment regimen， along with corticosteroids. Studies indicate that up to 30% of individuals diagnosed with cough-variant asthma will， in time， go on to develop typical asthma.\n【save__datas】\t【703】\t38\\. What is “exercise-induced asthma(EIA)”?\n【save__datas】\t【704】\tExercise is a common asthma trigger. Individuals with inadequately controlled asthma often experience vari-able cough， wheezing， and breathlessness with exertion and exercise. Exercise-induced asthma (EIA) is a clini-cally different phenomenon. EIA does not reflect inadequately controlled asthma. Some physicians con-sider it a subtype of asthma while others view it as a possible precursor to asthma， and prefer the descriptive term “exercise-inducedbronchospasm” toclearly emphasize that EIA is not a separate disease.\n【save__datas】\t【705】\tIndividuals with EIA experience respiratory symptoms in the setting of aerobic exercise. The symptoms may include dry cough， wheezing， and shortness of breath， along with chest discomfort.

Symptoms can also first develop after exer-cise ends.Treatment includes proper attention to warm-up and cool-down maneuvers， as well as pre-scription medication. Medicines effective in the treat-ment of EIA include oral leukotriene modifiers as well asinhaled， short-acting B2 agonists， and/or inhaled cromolyn. If inhalers are prescribed， they should be taken about 20 minutes prior to the warm-up routine. In EIA， airway narrowing occurs secondary to vigor-ous exercise. The mechanism responsible for EIA implicates inhalation of cold dry air， specifically， fluxes in humidity and temperature within the airways dur-ing rapid breathing.\n【save__datas】\t【707】\tGemmas comment：\n【save__datas】\t【708】\tAs I noted before， my daughter was not diagnosed with--connect--【709】asthma until she was in ber 20s， but she now feels that she--connect--【710】had EIA as a teenager when she began running with school--connect--【711】teams.

In the late1960s， Dr. Max Samter published a series of articles characterizing the triad and further elucidated the nature of the aspirin intolerance. Dr. Samter greatly advanced knowledge in the area， and perhaps in recog-nition of the fact， the asthmatic triad is also known as“Samter’s Syndrome.”\n【save__datas】\t【726】\tAspirin， or acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)， is a widely pre-scribed and consumed drug with beneficial anti-inflam-matory， anti-fever， and pain-relieving properties (Table16). It is very useful， as well， as a mild\"blood thinner\"in the treatment of heart diseases and in certain types of stroke prevention. The consumption of aspirin in the United States has been estimated at approximately 80billion tablets per year. In many ways， aspirin is an ideal medication： inexpensive， safe， and highlyeffective(Table 17). In some people with asthma， however， aspirin is a dangerous medication. The term “aspirin-induced asthma，”or AIA， refers to the development of wheezing and bronchoconstriction after the ingestion of aspirin， or aspirin-like products called NSAIDs—nons-teroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. AIA usually occurs in the setting of severe， chronic asthma and is more com-mon among females. Approximately 10% to 20% of people with asthma also have AIA. It is estimated that， of those asthmatics with AIA， 50% have steroid-dependent asthma classified as chronic persistent， 30%have moderate persistent disease， and 20% have mild intermittent or persistent asthma.\n【save__datas】\t【727】\tSymptoms of AIA include， first and foremost， an acute exacerbation of asthma within three hours of taking aspirin or one of the NSAIDs.

AIA is a cause of near-fatal asthma.

The oral leukotriene modifier medications (zafirlukast， zileuton， and montelukast) are useful in blocking and preventing the response to aspirin and NSAIDs to a variable extent in AIA. If aspirin therapy is deemed essential for medical reasons， then the asthmatic with AIA should be referred to an allergist with expertise inaspirin desensitization.

Desensi-tization could， for example， be considered for an asth-matic known to have AIA and who must take small daily doses of aspirin to prevent a second heart attack.\n【save__datas】\t【751】\t40\\. What is occupational asthma?\n【save__datas】\t【752】\tGemmas comment：\n【save__datas】\t【753】\tI worked for many years in a large public building， which--connect--【754】was often described as a \"sick\" building， in part because of--connect--【755】its faulty ventilating system. I often noticed breathing--connect--【756】problems， especially when water in the radiators leaked，--connect--【757】leaving the industrial carpeting on my office floor damp--connect--【758】and probably moldy. Although the building was studied--connect--【759】several times by environmentalist specialists and always--connect--【760】found to be sick，\" public funds to fise these problems were--connect--【761】never made auailable.\n【save__datas】\t【762】\tOccupational asthma describes asthma that is caused by exposure to a precise， defined substance in the workplace environment. Although figures vary from country to country and are difficult to pinpoint， it is estimated that 5 to 15% of newly diagnosed asthma in working adults is due to occupational (or workplace) exposure. Many physicians fail to consider the possi-bility of occupational asthma in adults with newly identified asthma and can remain unaware of the dis-ease specifics. Symptoms of occupational asthma may be indistinguishable from “classic\" asthma. An astute physician will enquire about current and past jobs held by an adult in whom asthma is newly diagnosed. Another clue to the diagnosis can be provided by close observation of any temporal associationsbetween work， leisure time， and respiratory symptoms. Serial peak flow measurements during an entire month， for--connect--【763】example， while at work as well as on weekends or days off， can be helpful in identifying patterns that might suggest occupational asthma. It is crucial to correctly identify occupational asthma because the key to suc-cessful treatment is prompt removal of the patient from the workplace exposure that is causing the asthma. If occupational asthma is properly identified in a timely manner， and if the exposure to the offend-ing agent ceases within a certain period of time， then the prognosis is favorable. If exposure continues， how-ever， there is a point of \"no return\" past which a person with occupational asthma may have permanent respi-ratory symptoms and disability， even if the exposure ceases at a later date.\n【save__datas】\t【764】\tOccupational asthma is different from work-aggra-vated asthma.Work-aggravated asthma refersto preexisting asthma that worsens at work. For exam-ple.aa person with aa history of easily controlled asthma in adolescence might develop an increase in asthma symptoms asan adult when working out-doors during cold winter months. Another example of work-aggravated asthma involves asthma that worsens at work because of irritant exposures， such as might be the case for a bartender with asthma working in a restaurant full of cigarette smoke or an asthmatic indoor garage attendant inhaling automo-bile exhaust fumes.\n【save__datas】\t【765】\tTrue occupational， or work-related， asthma is a poten-tially serious medical condition with significant socio-economic repercussions.The immunologistand allergist Dr. David I. Bernstein's 1993 characterization of occupational asthma has been widely accepted as--connect--【766】the standard definition of the disease. The definition states：“Occupational asthma is a disease characterized by variable air flow limitation and/or airway hyper-responsiveness due to causes and conditions attributa-ble to a particular occupational environment and not to stimuli encountered outside the workplace.”\n【save__datas】\t【767】\tThere are two general types of true occupational asthma (OA). Experts have classified the two types as“asthma with latency”and “asthma without latency.”The first type of OA is asthma that develops over time， caused by repeated inhalation of sensitizing work exposures to a specific substance， usually a large pro-tein. Examples of sensitizing agents include formalde-hyde， mineral dusts， animal proteins， flours，and grains. More that 250 different workplace substances have been reported to cause occupational asthma. Many different manufacturing industries are involved， from baking， to veterinary work， to paint and circuit board production. Interestingly， not all workers in a certain industry and with clear-cut exposure actually go on to develop asthma. Studies suggest that atopy and cigarette smoking may predispose some persons to the development of occupational asthma. The second， more unusual type of OA involves the emergence of“new\"asthma after a single， intense， and often dra-matic exposure to potent respiratory irritants， such as bleach， chlorine gas， or strong acids， for example. Chemical spills and workplace accidents are often implicated. The term“RADS”was coined by Dr. Stu-art M. Brooks and his co-workers in 1985. The term describes “reactive airways dysfunction syndrome，” a type of OA “without latency\" that begins abruptly， usually within 24 hours of an intense， inhaled-irritant--connect--【768】exposure that persists for longer than three months and behaves like“typical”asthma.\n【save__datas】\t【769】\tOccupational asthma is more than a single entity， as the above clearly indicates. If OA is suspected， medical evaluation and consultation by an occupational health physician should be considered.\n【save__datas】\t【771】\tAsthma：Treatment\n【save__datas】\t【772】\tStrategies\n【save__datas】\t【773】\tWhat are written asthma management and action plans?\n【save__datas】\t【774】\tWhy should I use medicine if I feel fine? What are the goals of asthma treatment?\n【save__datas】\t【775】\tMy asthma is active； how do I know whether I should go to the nearest hospital emergency room?\n【save__datas】\t【776】\tHow do I know whether my physician is a specialist in asthma treatment?\n【len<10_filter】\t【777】\tMore...\n【save__datas】\t【778】\t41\\. What are asthma management and--connect--【779】action plans?\n【save__datas】\t【781】\tThe key feature of any written asthma plan is that it is individualized. Just as two people with asthma will have different manifestations of their disease， so， too， will they have different treatment and action plans. A person whose asthma usually exacerbates when suffering from a cold， for example， will likely have instructions in their plan to quickly double the dose of inhaled steroid med-ication at the earliest cold symptom. Another person， whose asthma has only rarely been triggered by cold symptoms， will not need to increase his or her controller medication as quickly， or to the same extent as， the first person. Another point to remember is that if you have been provided with an action plan， it should be reviewed and revised (as needed) at every visit.

Many doctors， however， especially physicianspracticingin private practice rather than in clinic or hospital set-tings， don’t like written asthma plans. The most com-mon reason for an asthmatic not tollowing a written action plan is quite simply that his or her physician has neverprovided one. Studies of written action plans， both here and abroad， have yielded inconsistent results. Some report that most patients， especially chil-dren， clearly benefit from written asthma plans. The implementation of the action plan ideally reduces hos-pitalization and improves asthma control. Other stud-ies suggest that it is not the written plan that improves outcommeess，. but rather the focused attention of the physician and the enhanced interaction between patient and healthcare provider. In other words， as long as the proper advice on increasing and adjusting medication in asthma is provided， the outcomeis improved regardless of whether the instructions were given in writing as part of a plan or verbally during an office visit or over the telephone.\n【save__datas】\t【824】\tMost patients，--connect--【825】especially--connect--【826】children，--connect--【827】clearly benefit--connect--【828】from written--connect--【829】asthma plans.\n【save__datas】\t【830】\t42\\. Why should Iuse medicine ifI feel fine?\n【save__datas】\t【831】\tA major advance in the medical profession's under-standing of asthma is the recognition of the crucial role of lung and airway inflammation. If an individual with\n【save__datas】\t【832】\tYour breath-ing should be--connect--【833】comfortable--connect--【834】all the time.--connect--【835】asthma has ongoing lung inflammation， his or her asthma will not be properly controlled， and that indi-vidual will experience one or more different asthma symptoms. Too many people with inadequately treated asthma “adapt”to abnormal lung function， and con-sciously or not， learn to live with their symptoms. I clearly recall， for example， a middle-aged patient of mine who during her initial visit with me reported that she would always take a taxi to and from work in Man-hattan all winter long despite the expense. Rather than walk， wait for a bus， or take the subway， she always pre-ferred to “go by cab” during the winter because of the development of cold-induced dry cough and uncom-fortable breathing. When the temperature would dip below 40°F， she could walk only very brief distances before she would experience cough and breathlessness. She was， when I first met her， proud of how she had“learned to live\"with asthma， which she referred to as her “condition.” She believed then that she was--connect--【837】model patient by “toughing it out.\" She was mistaken， however， and did not realize that she should have been taking a combination of asthma medicine instead.\n【save__datas】\t【838】\tIn asthma management， the primary treatment goal is the absence of daily daytime and nighttime symptoms. Your breathing should be comfortable all the time. During a normal day， you should have no awareness of your breathing， which should be quiet， effortless， and automatic. If your asthma falls into a classification other than the NAEPP's mild intermittent， then you are likely to be prescribed daily “controller”medication along with “quick-relief”or “rescue”inhaled medicine as I did for my taxi-traveler patient. The“controller”medicine addresses the inflammatory component of--connect--【839】asthma. The medicine is designed to be taken daily， around the clock， to keep the inflammation controlled and quiescent. It is a preventive medicine. You should use it as prescribed， especially if you have no symp-toms. The fact that you have no symptoms means that the medicine is working perfectly! Continue taking it! If you stop your medicine because you “feel fine，” you may not “feel fine”for long. Instead of stopping medi-cine on your own， contact your asthma doctor for advice. The fact that you feel healthy certainly indi-cates that your treatment has been effective. It may also be a hint that now that your asthma symptoms have responded to treatment， you may ready to “step down\"that particular treatment.\n【save__datas】\t【840】\tWhat about my patient who suffered daily symp-toms from Thanksgiving until Easter? After her first visit several years ago， and the prescription of two different inhalers， she was no longer symptomatic in the cold weather. Together we learned that her asthma requires only infrequent doses of inhaled， short acting B2 agonist bronchodilator therapy in the spring and summer for control. In the late fall and through the winter， she needs to take additional medicine daily. She begins using the inhalers as soon as the weather cools and before she develops the cold air induced cough and breathlessness. Now that she has control over her asthma， she has more choices of how to get to work! She also decided to get a small dog (which shed always wanted) and proudly walks the pup before and after work， in all kinds of nasty weather!\n【save__datas】\t【841】\t43\\.

Other triggers are more individual or idiosyncratic. Strong odors or perfumes， as well as cigarette smoke， can all be asthma triggers. Asthmatics who have specific aller-gies will notice that allergens are triggers， too. This is often the case in a cat-allergic person， for example， who begins to experience chest discomfort， tightness， wheezing， and shortness of breath after visiting a home with cats in residence. Some foods， sulfite food additives， as well as certain medications can trigger asthmatic symptomsin susceptible persons.The importance of identifying an individual's asthma trig-gers cannot be overstated. Modern asthma treatment includes identification of each patient's asthma triggers in order to avoid exposure to them as much as possible. By completely avoiding， or at least minimizing， expo-sure to triggers， asthma symptoms are greatly reduced. Often， medication can be decreased as well.\n【save__datas】\t【867】\t44\\. What are the goals ofasthma--connect--【868】treatment?\n【save__datas】\t【869】\tThe principal goal of asthma therapy is control of all symptoms (Table 20).

An effective asthma regimen will succeed in achieving a minimal requirement for short-acting B2 agonist “rescue\"medication. An effective asthma regimen will also ensure minimal， if any， side effects from the prescribed medicines. Lung function should normalize with proper asthma care. Symptoms should be absent or minimal during the daytime， as well as at night (Table 21). Sleep should be restful and uninterrupted. There should be no absences from work or school due to asthma. Exacerbations should also be few (or none)， and far between. When an exacerbation does develop， it should be recognized immediately and treated aggressively. When people can “forget” that they have asthma， except for the fact that they have to take medicine， and when they can fully participate in work， play， and sports， and enjoy life without limita-tion， then the principal goal of asthma treatment has been successfully met.\n【save__datas】\t【885】\tTable 21 Major Goals of Asthma Treatment\n【save__datas】\t【886】\t·Daytime symptoms should be absent or minimal.\n【save__datas】\t【887】\t·Nocturnal symptoms should be absent or minimal； sleep should be restful and uninterrupted\n【save__datas】\t【888】\tElimination of absences from work or school because of asthma； parents of children with asthma should similarly not have any missed days of work because of the child’s asthma.\n【save__datas】\t【889】\t· Full participation in sports and team competitions； regular aerobic exercise is an important component of good asthma management， as well as a key feature of a healthy lifestyle.\n【save__datas】\t【890】\t·FExacerbations should be nonexistent or“few and far between.\"Thev should be addressed and treated promptly and effectively.\n【save__datas】\t【891】\t·Requirement for “rescue treatment，\"usually in the form of a short-acting inhaled B2 agonist (inhaled or oral， in the case of young chil-dren)， should be minimal.\n【save__datas】\t【892】\tMedicines for asthma treatment should be associated with minimal， if any， side effects.\n【save__datas】\t【893】\t45\\. Will asthma lead to loss ofoxygen?\n【save__datas】\t【894】\tWell-controlled， stable， treated asthma does not affect the body’s oxygen levels. If lung function is normal-ized， gas exchange also continues normally. For exam-ple， an asthmatic experiencing chest tightness or wheezing that responds to two puffs of a rescue inhaler every few days is not in any danger from low blood oxygen levels.\n【save__datas】\t【895】\tAsthma initsmoree6extremeforms can leadto reduced oxygen levels. Both severe exacerbations of asthma， as well as life-threatening asthma， have the potential to significantly interfere with the lungs ability to extract oxygen from the air. In particular， when bronchospasm， swelling， and mucus accumula-tion narrow the bronchial passages， oxygen levels may dip. The emergency treatment of an asthma exacerbation that brings a patient to the emergency room， for example， always begins with supplemental oxygen， given by either an oxygen mask or nasal prongs. In an asthmatic emergency， it is always bet-ter to err on the side of safety and automatically prescribe supplemental oxygen，rraather thanrisk reduced oxygen.\n【save__datas】\t【896】\t46\\. Wbat is an asthma specialist?\n【save__datas】\t【897】\tAn asthma specialist is a physician who has a special interest in treating patients with asthma， and who has completed post-doctoral training either in adult or pediatric lung diseases (pulmonary medicine)， or in allergy and immunology. A physician is a medical doc-tor who has graduated from college and from medical school. After medical school， a future asthma specialist will continue post-doctoral training， called internship--connect--【898】and residency， for three to four years in a broad field such as adult internal medicine， family practice， or pediatrics (Table 22). Much of this time is spent in a hospital setting or in a clinic. After internship and res-idency training， the future asthma specialist will spend an additional three to five years in even more special-ized training. Such additional training is called a fel-lowship. Fellowships in the fields of adult pulmonary medicine lead to adult asthma specialization， whereas those in the field of pediatric pulmonology train asthma specialists for children. Fellowships in allergy and immunology train physicians to care for asthma patients of all ages.\n【save__datas】\t【899】\tThere are two types of medical schools in the United States. The majority of medical schools-numbering close to 125—are allopathic medical schools and grant the M.D. degree after four years of post-college study. There are also approximately 20 osteopathic medical schools in the United States， with far fewer students enrolled. Osteopathic schools grant the D.O. degree. The D.O. stands for “Doctor of Osteopathy.” Allo-pathic medicine has existed for centuries. Andrew Tay-lor founded the discipline of osteopathic medicine less than 150 years ago， in 1874. The philosophy of osteo-pathic medicine differs from the allopathic. Osteopa-thy seeks to treat the “whole patient”and emphasizes the importance of the musculoskeletal system， as well as the importance of “osteopathic manipulative treat-ment.\"In the past， requirements for admission to an osteopathic medical school were considered to be less stringent than for admission to an allopathic medical school， but that has changed.

Board certifi-cation indicates that the physician has met stringent training and testing qualifications. Many asthma spe-cialists also enjoy teaching medical students， interns， residents， and fellows， and are members of a medical school faculty.\n【save__datas】\t【905】\tGeneral pediatricians， who take care of the majority of children with asthma， are experienced in asthma treat-ment， but are not technically “true”asthma specialists--connect--【906】because they have not completed the specialized training described above. The same is true for family practitioners and general adult internists who treat adult asthmatics.\n【save__datas】\t【907】\t47.How do Iknow whether my physician--connect--【908】is a specialist in asthma treatment?\n【save__datas】\t【909】\tThe best way to ascertain whether your treating physician specializes in asthma treatment is to ask the doctor directly. Make sure that your asthma physician is primarily a clinician or a doctor who“takes care of patients for a living.” Some lung physi-cians are more accurately described as physician-sci-entists. Although trained in respiratory medicine or allergy， they spend the great majority of their profes-sional life in the laboratory， advancing our under-standing and knowledge of the scientific aspects of asthma. Such physician-scientists might， for exam-ple， develop a new medication for asthma treatment or research the way asthma genes are transmitte They are asthma specialists.They advance the knowledge of asthma， but are not involved with the direct delivery of health care. The concept of special-ization thus includes not only sophisticated medical training beyond that of a general doctor， but also a real and abiding interest in asthma and in caring for people with asthma.\n【save__datas】\t【910】\t48\\. Do I need to consult a pbysician wbo--connect--【911】specializes in asthma?\n【save__datas】\t【912】\tReferral to an asthma specialist is advised under two general circumstances： the “tricky” diagnosis， and the need for “special”evaluation or treatment. In the first--connect--【913】circumstance， referral leads to resolution of a diagnos-tic puzzle. Asthma might be a suspected yet unproven diagnosis， either because of atypical symptomsOr because of a competing illness. In the second circum-stance， referral leads to improved asthma control. Dif-ficult-to-control asthma can reflect a myriad of factors， from adverse socioeconomic circumstances tto a rare form of corticosteroid-resistant asthma.\n【save__datas】\t【914】\tIn the United States， the majority of individuals with asthma receive their care from physicians who are generalist doctors，suchasfamily practitioners， internists， and pediatricians. The decision to seek care from an asthma specialist can be a matter of patient preference， but is more frequently a consequence of severity of disease. Consultation from an asthma spe-cialist is indicated and appropriate when a person's asthma is not well controlled. An example is someone who has daily symptoms， frequent absences from work or school， or who requires hospitalization for asthma despite good adherence to a treatment plan. Similarly， asthmatics classified as having severe per-sistent asthmashould receive their care from an asthma specialist.\n【save__datas】\t【915】\tThe most recent update of the NAEPP's Expert Panel Report (2002) addresses the question of when referral to an asthma specialist is mandatory and when it should be considered. Any adult with severe persistent asthma， or any patient who requires “Step 4”asthma treatment， should be under the care of a physician with an expertise in clinical asthma management. Similarly， referral to an asthma specialist should be considered for adults with moderate persistent asthma requiring“Step 3”treatment.--connect--【917】bave allergies?\n【save__datas】\t【918】\tMany people think they may be allergic to certain foods or aeroallergens， such as pollens or dog dander， for example. A good observer might notice that after exposure to the suspected agent， an allergic symptom， such as itchy， watery eyes， nasal stuffiness， or throat tingling develops. At the other extreme， a person might be allergic and not make the connection. Either way， consultation with an allergy specialist or allergist can be extremely helpful and is highly recommended in order to determine whether or not an allergy is present.\n【save__datas】\t【919】\tAllergists are experts in identifying specific allergies. Their tools include a detailed history along with a physi-cal examination. Sometimes blood tests are obtained. Skin \"patch\" testing with extracts of the suspected aller-gen are usually performed for greater precision in reach-ing a conclusion. It is just as important to know whether you are allergic to a substance as it is to find out that you are not. If an allergy to a specific allergen is confirmed， dP then allergen avoidance is usually recommended. For example， a person allergic to penicillin should never take penicillin-containing antibiotics. If complete allergen avoidance is not practical， then medication may be required. Such would be the case for someone who is allergic to ragweed and resides in the northeastern United States in late summer.\n【save__datas】\t【920】\tAllergists are also qualified to administer immuno-therapy， a special type of allergy treatment also known is “allergy shots.\" Immunotherapy is reserved for very specific types of allergy accompanied by very specific symptoms. It requires a skilled allergist and a motivated--connect--【921】patient who is willing to undergo treatment for at least three years， initially getting injections once a week. Immunotherapy is highly effective if prescribed prop-erly， but it is not for mild symptoms， or for symptoms that are easily controlled with antihistamine medication and allergen avoidance measures.\n【save__datas】\t【922】\t50\\. What is immunoglobulin E(IgE)?\n【save__datas】\t【923】\tImmunoglobulins are protein molecules that circulate in the bloodstream.They are part of the body's immune response to a stimulus perceived as foreign， such as bacteria， parasites， or allergens. There are five classes of immunoglobulins， named G， A， M， E and D， and abbreviated： IgG， IgA， IgM， IgD， and IgE. Each class has its own characteristics. IgE is an immunoglobulinthat rises incertainsituations. including in the setting of an allergic response. Persons with allergy and asthma will often demonstrate ele-vated IgE blood levels as compared to a \"normal\" sub-ject with neither allergy nor asthma. IgE plays an important， central role in several \"allergic”conditions：asthma， allergic rhinitis， atopic dermatitis (also known as eczema)， certain food allergies (e.g.， peanuts， fish)， urticaria (hives)， and anaphylaxis. Recent understand-ing of the pivotal role of IgE has lead directly to the development of a new and novel medication that blocks the effects of IgE， as discussed in Question 73. By blocking IgE， the allergic response is lessened or eliminated， offering promising treatment for asthma and severe food allergies.\n【save__datas】\t【924】\t51\\.

The simple fact that your asthma is more active might not in itself warrant an emergency room visit. If your asthma responds to increased “stepped-up\"treatment as advo-cated in the NAEPP’s guidelines， or as outlined in your asthma care plan， then you might simply need to check in with your asthma provider.

Keep in mind that each individual's asthma is unique in its own way. Some individuals may experience rapidly worsening exacerbations， for example， and the rate of how rapidly your asthma tends to progress should cer-tainly be taken into account as well.\n【save__datas】\t【946】\tI always remind my patients that emergency rooms are open and staffed 24 hours a day for a reason—because they are needed! Asthma unresponsive to stepped-up home treatment is exactly the type of condition that emergency rooms are geared to treat. The key is not to hesitate to proceed to the emergency room if your asthma specialist advises you to， or if the protocol you’re following as part of your asthma action plan calls for it. Don’t delay! Trying to “tough it out\" will only make it harder to control your exacerbation. It is better to inter-vene early and quickly. Consider， as part of your“routine”asthma care， discussing ahead of time with your asthma doctor how best to handle increased asthma symptoms， when to start steroid therapy， when to telephone for advice， and when to go to the emergency room.\n【save__datas】\t【947】\t52\\. What kind ofemergency\"treatment--connect--【948】can I expect wben I get to the--connect--【949】emergency room：\n【save__datas】\t【950】\tThe actual treatment you receive in the emergency department of the hospital depends on the individual characteristics of your asthma， other health conditions you may have， as well as the severity of your symptoms when you arrive in the emergency room. In general， you can expect three components to your emergency care. The first will consist of immediate treatment with supplemen-tal oxygen， bronchodilators， and anti-inflammatory medi-cines to gain control of the asthma exacerbation. The--connect--【951】second component to your care will consist of careful assessment of the degree of asthma severity， along with close monitoring of your condition and overall response to treatment. The third component will determine whether any other superimposed conditions are present and how they might impact your asthma.\n【save__datas】\t【952】\tYou can expect to be given supplemental oxygen to breathe， either via nasal prongs or a mask. You will likely be given repeated doses of short-acting B2inhaled bronchodilator therapy in succession by a neb-ulizer， or MDI (metered-dose inhaler) with a spacer or holding chamber. A temporary intravenous catheter(TV) may be inserted into a vein in your arm to allow for rapid administration of fluids to counter any dehy-dration. Steroids in pill form or via the IV (if already placed) will be prescribed to reduce airway inflamma-tion. Other inhaled treatments and intravenous medi-cine may be prescribed on a case-by-case basis. As your treatment gets underway， you will be examined with close attention to vital signs and the lung exam. Your pulse and oxygen level will likely be monitored by a special sensor called a pulse-oximeter. The pulse-oximeter clips onto your fingertip and is painless. You may be asked to wear a cardiac monitor， which is made up of thin wires that are attached to the skin of the chest and connect to a monitor screen. The emergency room doctor and nurse assigned to your care will keep aclose watch on you as you receive the prescribed treatments. Some hospitals also have respiratory thera-pists on duty in the emergency room， and they will certainly play a role in your care as well. You will be asked to perform serial peak-flow measurementsSttO help gauge your response to treatment.\n【save__datas】\t【953】\tYou can expect to spend at least 4 to 6 hours under-going emergency treatment of asthma.You mav undergo a chest X-ray and blood tests if an infection is suspected. You may be asked if you know what triggered your asthma. Under the ideal circumstances， your exac-erbation will become controlled in the emergency room， and your asthma will be stabilized. Your symptoms will lessen， and your peak flow will rise into a safe zone and remain there during your emergency room stay. You will be given specific instructions for stepped-up asthma care， and will need to contact and see your regular asthma doctor for a visit within a few days of the emer-gency room visit. If， on the other hand， your exacerba-tion cannot be controlled within 6 to 12 hours of aggressive management， you will likely be admitted to the hospital for continued care. If the physicians treating you in the emergency setting advise hospitalization， then agree. You must take their best medical advice， no matter how inconvenient it may seem! The “worst case”sce-nario consists of an individual who misjudges the sever-ity of an exacerbation and waits too long for treatment， or who doesn’t follow recommendations and ends up with out-of-control asthma that can lead to respiratory failure， and sometimes even death.\n【save__datas】\t【954】\t53\\. Can someone really die ofastbma?\n【save__datas】\t【955】\tYes， asthma can be fatal. Over 4，000 people die each vear in the United States from uncontrolled asthma. Asthma is a highly treatable disease. Death from asthma is especially tragic because each one of those deaths is theoretically 100% preventable.\n【save__datas】\t【956】\t54\\. What are the characteristics of“fatal”or near-fatal”asthma?\n【save__datas】\t【957】\tFatal and near-fatal asthma have been the subject of much interest and study by physicians. By obtaining as much information as possible on persons who die or almost die of asthma， we can hopefully learn how to prevent similar deaths in the future.\n【save__datas】\t【958】\tThe majority--connect--【959】of persons--connect--【960】with near-fatal or fatal--connect--【961】nefh帅asthma tend to--connect--【962】underestimate--connect--【963】the severity--connect--【964】oftheir--connect--【965】symptoms.\n【save__datas】\t【966】\tThe majority of persons with near-fatal or fatal asthma tend to underestimate the severity of their symptoms and present for care only after several days of clearly worsening symptoms.The symptoms are usually responses to triggers that can include a viral infection， intense exposure to allergens， noncompliance with pre-scribed asthma treatment， air pollution， changes in weather， or severe emotional stress. By waiting for a period of days before intervening to control the exac-erbation， the opportunity for effective treatment is lost； in other words， it is too late by the time help is on the way. In most cases of fatal or near-fatal asthma， the actual disease can be controlled， but “human patient factors\"adversely modify the outcome.\n【save__datas】\t【967】\tThe more unusual scenario of very rapidly progressive asthma that exacerbates dramatically over the course of several hours occurs in the minority of patients with near-fatal or fatal asthma (Table 24). Some individuals have a particularly aggressive and severe type of asthma that， despite ideal and perfect compliance with medical treatment and recommendations， does lead to severe complications. Those persons should be under the care of an asthma specialist and may be candidates for cutting-edge therapies.\n【save__datas】\t【968】\tTable 24 Fatal Asthma： Risk Factors\n【save__datas】\t【969】\t·Prior history of sudden， rapidly progressive severe exacerbations\n【save__datas】\t【970】\t·Prior history of intubation for asthma， ever\n【save__datas】\t【971】\t·Prior history of admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) for asthma，ever\n【save__datas】\t【972】\t·Two or more hospitalizations for asthma in the last 12 months\n【save__datas】\t【973】\t·Three or more visits to a hospital emergency room for asthma exacerbation in the last 12 months\n【save__datas】\t【974】\t·Either an emergency room visit or a hospitalization for asthma in the last 30 days\n【save__datas】\t【975】\t·Asthma requiring the use of two (or more) canisters of“rescue quick-relief\"short-acting B agonist inhalers in the last 30 days\n【save__datas】\t【976】\t·Current requirement for and use of oral (pill form) steroid medication\n【save__datas】\t【977】\t·Recent steroid taper\n【save__datas】\t【978】\t·Allergy or sensitivity to mold (Alternaria test)\n【save__datas】\t【979】\t·Lack of awareness of worsening asthma； difficulty in perceiving worsening asthma symptoms\n【save__datas】\t【980】\tOther superimposed complicating serious medical illnesses (heart disease， diabetes， etc.)\n【save__datas】\t【981】\tSerious psychiatric illness\n【save__datas】\t【982】\t·Severe psychosocial problems\n【save__datas】\t【983】\t·Lower socioeconomic status\n【save__datas】\t【984】\t·Urban residence\n【save__datas】\t【985】\t·Illicit “recreationaldrug use and/or abuse\n【save__datas】\t【986】\t55\\. What is \"respiratory failure\"?\n【save__datas】\t【987】\tRespiratory failure occurs when the lungs and respira-tory system become unable to provide the body with sufficient oxygen and fail to “blow off” accumulated carbon dioxide. If the major disturbance is primarily an inability of the respiratory system to meet the body's oxygen requirement， then “hypoxemic”respira-tory failure is present. If carbon dioxide and acid levels rise within the body because the lungs are unable to keep up their excretory function， then “hypercarbic”--connect--【988】respiratory failure occurs. Both a mixed hypoxemic and hypercarbic pattern may coexist.\n【save__datas】\t【989】\tRespiratory failure can be very gradual， and may develop and progress slowly over time， from months to years， as in the case of \"chronic\"respiratory failure， for example. Cigarette-related emphysema is one example of gradual respiratory failure. Asthma is not typically a cause of chronic respiratory failure. Acute respiratory failure， as the name implies， occursrapidly overra period of hours to days.\n【save__datas】\t【990】\tFatal or near-fatal asthma are both causes of acute respira-tory failure. In either situation， acute versus chronic， there comes a point where the respiratory failure becomes so marked that the body will become deprived of adequate oxygen， and be subjected to dangerously rising levels of carbon dioxide and acids. Sampling of arterial blood gases(ABGs) in fatal and near-fatal asthma， for example， show low values of oxygen (the PaO， value is < 60 mmHg) and rising levels of carbon dioxide (the PaCO， value rises above 41 mmHg). As the lungs no longer function effec-tively and \"fail，\"other organs will begin to fail in response. The brain， in particular， is very sensitive to low oxygen levels， as well as to elevations in carbon dioxide values， each of which are harmful separately. As the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels become more abnormal， conscious-ness becomes impaired. Coma and death will ensue. An individual with progressive respiratory failure is usually critically ill and in danger of death without aggressive medical intervention and life support.\n【save__datas】\t【991】\t56\\. Wbat is endotracheal intubation?\n【save__datas】\t【992】\tEndotracheal intubation is performed in the setting of respiratory failure due to any cause， including respira-tory failure from asthma. It is considered a potentially--connect--【993】life-saving medical intervention. Patients who require endotracheal intubation are critically ill， because their lungs are unable to take in oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide. The procedure itself can be performed in an emergency room， an intensive care unit， or out of hos-pital，“in the field，” provided the appropriate equip-ment and qualified medical personnel are available. Ambulance crews with ACLS (advanced cardiac live support) certification are trained in endotracheal intu-bation. The procedure itself consists of the temporary placement of a soft， flexible， plastic “breathing tube”through the nose or mouth， past the voice box (lar-ynx)， and into the trachea or main breathing tube. Endotracheal intubation serves three major functions. It keeps a person's airway open in situations when it would otherwise close off causing asphyxiation， such as in the case of decreasing levels of consciousness. It also allows for the removal， by suctioning， of any mucus that has accumulated in the airways. Perhaps most importantly， however， endotracheal intubation allows a doctor to provide the intubated patient with breaths and extra oxygen to inhale， thus taking over the work of breathing from failing lungs. In order to take over a person's breathing， the end of the endotracheal tube is connected to a ventilator. A ventilator is a machine that is designed to provide individualized support to a patient in respiratory failure， due to any cause. The support provided by the ventilator consists of breaths along with supplemental oxygen.\n【len<10_filter】\t【995】\tAstoma\n【save__datas】\t【996】\tMedications：New and Old\n【save__datas】\t【997】\tWhat medications are helpful for asthma?\n【save__datas】\t【998】\tWhat is the difference between a medicine's generic names and brand names?\n【save__datas】\t【999】\tWhy are so many asthma medicines in inhaler form?\n【save__datas】\t【1000】\tWhat is the correct way to use my dry powder inhaler (DPI)?\n【save__datas】\t【1001】\tHow can I tell when my inhaler is nearly empty?

What medications are belpful for--connect--【1004】astoma?\n【save__datas】\t【1005】\tMany different classes of medicines are useful in the treatment of asthma. The NAEPP's asthma classifica-tion helps define the severity of a person's asthma and assists in guiding therapy. Notice that for each asthma classification， the NAEPP makes specific suggestions about the best type of medicine to use for treating that specific level of asthma.\n【save__datas】\t【1006】\tAsthma medicines are generally prescribed in a“step-wise\" approach. The physician will begin with one class of medicine and add or reduce medication based on the patient's symptoms control， lung function， and overall state of well-being. A person with mild inter-mittent asthma， for example， might be instructed to use a short-acting B2 inhaler as needed for symptom relief. With the onset of winter and colder tempera-tures， that individual's symptoms may start to become more prominent and increase. The inhaled， short-act-ing B2 medicine that formerly kept asthma symptoms under control is now required several times daily. No longer mild intermittent， our patient’s asthma has“moved up”a classification to become mild persistent asthma. Just as the classification has “moved up，\" the treatment is“stepped up.\" For our previously mild intermittentasthmatic who developed increasing wheezing that was not easily controlled with intermit-tent inhalations of the prescribed short-acting B inhaler， an additional， second medication with anti-inflammatory properties， such as an inhaled steroid， would be a good choice. After a certain period of time and when good asthma control is achieved， it would then be appropriate to consider a “step down，”espe---connect--【1007】cially if the stimulus to “stepped up\" asthma has resolved (such as the end of cold winter weather). Asthma treatment has to take into account the often fluid and changeable character of asthma itself.\n【save__datas】\t【1008】\tOne way of classifying asthma medicines is by their method of action. In such a schema， major categories include quick-relief medicines， controller or mainte-nance medicines， and medicines used for the treatment of a flare or exacerbation (Table 25).\n【save__datas】\t【1009】\tQuick-relief medicines are usually inhaled. The inhaled route is preferred because it delivers the medicine directly into the breathing passages. Side effects， if any， are minimal. Why take a pill form of a medicine that leads to measurable drug levels in the entire body when you can deposit effective medicine exactly where it's needed for quick symptom relief? Short-acting B2agents like albuterol， pirbuterol， bitolterol， or terbu-taline in inhaled form are all good examples of ideal quick-relief medicines. Quick-relief or “rescue”inhalers are usually prescribed for use when needed. The onset of action is rapid， and the beneficial effects last between4 to 6 hours. You should keep your quick-relief inhaler handy during the day. Keep it in a briefcase， pocket， purse， or gym bag.

An elderly lady with complicated asthma was assigned to my clinic for her care. At first， she had difficulty understanding how and when to use her inhalers. We reviewed the different medicines， which ones were as-needed “quick relief” for “rescue，\"and which ones were day-in and day-out “controllers” for “mainte-nance.” After a few moments， a broad， triumphant grin spread across my patient’s face. “I got it!” she exclaimed. A minute later， she elaborated， “The white inhaler is like my husband-he’s always there， morn-ing and night； but， the yellow one i1sSlike my boyfriend—he comes around only when I need him!”From that day on， there was no more confusion about those inhalers!\n【save__datas】\t【1016】\t58\\. What is the difference bet ween a--connect--【1017】medicines generic and brand name?\n【save__datas】\t【1018】\tAll medicines have several different names. When a drug is first discovered， it is given a chemical name， which describes the molecular composition of the drug. Chemical names are complicated and cumber-some， with parentheses and subscripts， numbers and initials.The pharmaceutical companyworkingto--connect--【1019】develop the drug for market usually will give the drug an“in-house”or code name， such as RU 486， for exam-ple. The name usually includes letters abbreviating the company's name (MSD for Merck， or GSK for Glaxo Smith Kline， for example)， followed by a number.\n【save__datas】\t【1020】\tAfter approval by the FDA， the ready-for-market med-ication is given both a generic and a trade name. Each generic and trade name must be unique and distinctive8enough to avoid confusion with other products. In the U.S.， the United StatesAdopted Names (USAN) Council assigns a drug its generic name. For example， the generic name for a widely prescribed， short-acting B agent， inhaled， quick-relief medicine is albuterol sulfate. A medicine's generic name is also its “official name.\"The drug's manufacturer then selects the medicine's trade (or brand) name. The FDA must approve the trade name selected by the manufacturer. To use our previous ex-ample， the albuterol sulfate inhaler manufactured by the Schering company isnamed Proventil@， while the inhaler produced by GlaxoSmithKline is Ventolin@. Trade names are often selected to be catchy and easily remembered. The trade name may also reflect a charac-teristic of the medicine. Many respiratory medicines incorporate “air\"or “vent”(as in， ventilation) as part of the trade name. Examples include Singulair@， Advair@， Aerobid@，Maxair@， Xolair@， as well asFlovent@， Serevent@， Atrovent@， Combivent@， Ventolin@， and Proventil@.\n【save__datas】\t【1021】\tWhen a new medicine is discovered， the inventor applies for a patent for the discovery. The patent details the discovery， and in doing so makes it public and open to all (including competitors) while protecting the inventor's right to make， use， or sell the medicine for a--connect--【1022】defined period of time， after which the patent is said to expire. When a medicine is new on the market， and its manufacturer is the only producer of that medicine， only one form of the drug is available to the consumer. As time goes by， the patent protection expires， and other companies may choose to produce the generic form of the medicine. In most cases， the generic form of a med-ication sold in the United States is pharmacologically equivalent to the brand formulation. Most generic med-icine sold in the United States is generally less costly than the brand-name medicine， and is of good quality. In the state of New York， for example， where I practice pulmonary medicine， the pharmacist will dispense a generic formulation of the medication I prescribe for my patient unless I specifically write“DAW”(for“dispense as written\") on the prescription. Similarly， your physi-cian will， in most circumstances， approve that a pre-scription medicine be filled with a generic formulation rather than with a specific brand.\n【save__datas】\t【1023】\tIt is easy to become confused by the fact that a medi-cine will have different names. I usually ask my patients to bring all their medicines with them to my office so that I can make sure they understand what medicines they should take and how to take them. I frequently come across a patient who thinks that he or she is tak-ing “a lot of medicine，” only to discover that the “two different inhalers” are “differentonly to the extent that two different manufacturers are producing the same medicine. If a patient is using inhaled Proventil@ along with inhaled Ventolin@， they are really only using one type of drug： the trade form of albuterol sulfate. Remember that the generic name of a medicine refers to the drug itself， whereas the trade name refers to a specific company's product and brand. Aspirin is--connect--【1025】generic product； Bufferin@ is nott.. To find out the names of your medicines， ask your doctor or pharma-cist. Read labels and package inserts. In the case of an inhaled medication， the inhaler label will always carry the drug’s trade name along with its generic name， albeit usually in smaller print. Even over-the-counter medicines are carefully labeled to specify generic and trade names. A final label-reading “trick\"to remember is that a trademark name is always followed by the @symbol， whereas the generic name is not.\n【save__datas】\t【1026】\t59\\.

Apart from interfering with sleep and rest， they indicate that your asthma is not adequately controlled and that your asthma is becoming more active. Nocturnal awaken-ings should always be reported to your treating physi-cian. In the NAEPP classification， a person with mild， intermittent asthma experiences no more than two nocturnal awakenings in a month. If an asthmatic develops nocturnalsymptomsmorethantwice monthly， the asthma is considered to be “persistent.”Weekly nocturnal awakenings are seen in moderate persistent disease and in severe disease as well.\n【save__datas】\t【1031】\tWhen you awaken with asthma symptoms， it is a good idea to use your quick-relief， short-acting， inhaled bronchodilator. It hopefully will work—your asthma--connect--【1032】symptoms lessen and respond， allowing you to go back to sleep. When you then wake up in the morning， you need to give some thought to your asthma. If your asthma was previously under good control， try to fig-ure out why you have developed nocturnal symptoms. Did you omit (or simply forget) your usual asthma medicine? What was your last peak flow (PEF) meas-urement? Have you been exposed to any known trig-gers? Did you eat a large， heavy meal right before bedtime， with consequent acid reflux? Are you becom-ing ill with a viral cold or sinus symptoms? Are your spring allergies flaring?\n【save__datas】\t【1033】\tIf you have experienced more than two nighttime asthma episodes in the last 30 days， you probably require additional asthma medicine to regain control of your disease and topreventan exacerbation. Stepped-up anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator medicine should be considered， and any co-incident factors， such as reflux， infection， or allergy， should also be addressed. Remember， a major goal of asthma treat-ment includes restful， uninterrupted sleep.\n【save__datas】\t【1034】\t60\\. Why are so many asthma medicines--connect--【1035】in inhaler form?\n【save__datas】\t【1036】\tThe inhaled route of medication delivery represents an ideal method of asthma treatment. The “problem\"with asthma resides in the lung， and in and around the air-ways. It makes perfect sense to administer medicine directly where it is needed， right into the air passages. Inhaled medication goes precisely where it is required， with minimal， if any， absorption by other organs. By limiting medicine in the bloodstream， as well as in other organs， potential drug interactions are avoided，--connect--【1037】and side effects and toxicity are minimized. Inhalers are practical. They travel with you and fit in a pocket or handbag. They work at room temperature. They can be taken without regard to meals or time of day. With proper instruction， children as young as 5 or 6 years of age can successfully use inhaled medications.\n【save__datas】\t【1038】\t61\\. Wbat is the 1987 Montreal Protocol?\n【save__datas】\t【1039】\tThe Montreal Protocol is a landmark， international treaty designed to enhance air quality and to protect the uppermost (or stratospheric) ozone layer. In 1987，24 countries， as well as the European Economic Com-munity， negotiated and signed The Montreal Protocol on\n【save__datas】\t【1040】\tSubstances that Deplete the Ozone Layer. The initial pro---connect--【1041】tocol aimed to decrease the use of ozone-depleting， man-made chemicals by 50% by the year 1999.Addi-tional supplements to the Montreal Protocol， known asthe London， Copenhagen， and Beijing Amend-ments， were adopted in 1990， 1992， and 1999， respec-tively， and further addressed the use and production of various ozone-depleting chemicals，as well\n【len<10_filter】\t【1042】\tas\n【save__datas】\t【1043】\t2timetable for their phaseout.\n【save__datas】\t【1044】\tOzone is a molecule made up of three oxygen atoms and is a essential constituent of our atmosphere. About90% of the ozone resides in a laver between 6 and 25miles above the Earth's surface in a zone called the stratosphere. The presence of the correct amount of ozone in the Earth's stratosphere is crucial and serves to absorb dangerous radiation emanating from the sun. The stratosphere's ozone， in a sense， envelops our planet in a protective envelope. For example， increased exposure to the sun's ultraviolet rays， as would occur--connect--【1045】from depletion of the Earth's protective ozone layer， is associated with an increased risk of developing skin cancer and ocular cataracts in humans. Ozone deple-tion may also adversely affect animal and plant life.\n【save__datas】\t【1046】\tStudies of the ozone layer over the last 30 years have revealed a significant decline in the Earth’s protective ozone layer over Antarctica. The first report of“holes”in the stratospheric ozone layer by British scientists in May 1985has been subsequently confirmed and detailed. A widely used class of synthetic chemicals called chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) has been impli-cated as major source of atmospheric ozone depletion. CFCs contain chlorine， fluorine， and carbon atoms. CFCs were invented in the 1920s， and are， in many ways， ideal compounds. CFCs are nontoxic， noncorro-sive， and nonflammable. They are inert and nonreac-tive with most substances. In the second half of the20th century， CFCs found extensive use as propellants in aerosols and spray cans， as coolants in refrigerators and air conditioners， as solvents in cleaners-particu-larly for electronic circuit boards-and as a blowing agent in the production of foam in devices such as fire extinguishers. Freon@， for example， is a familiar brand of a class of CFCs that was used in refrigeration. CFCs are very stable， and it is now recognized that they can persist in the atmosphere for up to 100 years. And so， even though the production and release of CFCs have been greatly curtailed， the damage to the ozone layer from past use will continue well into the current century.\n【save__datas】\t【1047】\tThe Montreal Protocol was codified by Congress into law in Title VI of the Clean Air Act and stipulated\n【save__datas】\t【1049】\t62\\. Why are my inbaler medicines no--connect--【1050】longer being manufactured?\n【save__datas】\t【1051】\tEffective treatment of asthma， as discussed in Ques-tion 57， requires the inhalation of bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory medicines (Table 26). Metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) were first introduced in the1950s. Despite their complexity from an engineering perspective， MDIs are conceptually simple and user friendly. They are small， convenient， and highly reli-able devices that deliver precise doses of inhaled med-ication directly into the lungs’ respiratory passages. Doctors and patients alike assume that MDIs are“all drug.\"In fact， a large portion of each puff delivered by the traditional MDI is actually inert propellant. The propellant is inhaled， along with the active medication. Rather than being absorbed by the lungs， however， the propellant is rapidly exhaled unchanged， and then fully eliminated from the body. The propellant released by the MDI is thus released into the atmosphere. Until recently， all available MDIs employed chlorofluorocar-bons (CFCs) as propellants. Although CFCs are safe for individuals using MDIs because they are inert and do not accumulate in the body， they are harmful to the\n【save__datas】\t【1053】\tTable 26 Inhalers Commonly Used in Asthma Treatment\n【save__datas】\t【1058】\tMaxair@ Autohaler@ (pirbuterol acetate)\n【save__datas】\t【1060】\tSereventDiskus@ (salmeterol xinafoate powder)\n【save__datas】\t【1061】\tForadil@ Aerolizer@ (formoterol fumarate powder)\n【save__datas】\t【1062】\tAnti-Inflammatory and Anti-Allergy\n【save__datas】\t【1064】\tInhaled Corticosteroid\n【save__datas】\t【1065】\tAerobid@MDI (flunisolide)\n【save__datas】\t【1066】\tAzmacort@MDI (triamcinolone acetonide)\n【save__datas】\t【1067】\tFlovent@ MDI (fluticasone propionate)\n【save__datas】\t【1068】\tFlovent@ Rotadisk@ DPI (fluticasone propionate powder)\n【save__datas】\t【1069】\tPulmicort@ Terbuhaler@ DPI (budesonide inhalation powder)\n【save__datas】\t【1070】\tQvar HFA (beclomethasone dipropionate HFA)\n【save__datas】\t【1071】\tCombination Products\n【save__datas】\t【1072】\tAdvair@ Diskus@ (fluticasone propionate and salmeterol powder)--connect--【1073】environment as they persist in the atmosphere for a long period of time.\n【save__datas】\t【1074】\tIn accord with the Montreal Protocol， the U.S. gov-ernment has banned the use or manufacture of all CFCs (discussed in Question 61). CFCs are no longer used in the manufacture of aerosol spray cans， air con-ditioners， or refrigeration units， for example. As of this writing， MDIs are the only commercial product for which CFCs are still being produced. Because MDIs--connect--【1075】are essential for asthma treatment， the EPA and the FDA have allowed an extension to the timeline ban-ning CFC manufacture， and have proposed and over-seen the gradual phase out of all MDIs containing CFCs (MDI-CFC). No CFC-containing MDI is removed from the market until a safe and effective equivalent medicine is available. The goal is to develop CFC-free alternative MDIs and cease the manufacture of CFCs altogether.\n【save__datas】\t【1077】\t63\\. Wbat is a“Diskus @”? Is it the same--connect--【1078】as a dry powder inbaler (DPI)?--connect--【1080】in addition to the Diskus@： the Turbuhaler@， the Rota-haler@， the Diskhaler@， and the Aerolizer.\n【save__datas】\t【1081】\tDry powder inhalers (DPIs) are devices that allow the self-administration of precisely measured doses of inhaled medicine. DPIs were developed as a conse-quence of the phasing out of chlorofluorocarbon(CFC) containing metered dose inhalers (MDIs). To use a medicine via a DPI， you inhale a very fine pow-der， made up of the actual asthma drug， through the DPI’s mouthpiece. By inhaling deeply and creating a flow of air， you draw the medicine deep into your lungs. There is no propellant to “push\"the medicine along. A few patients I take care of happily report that they “really suck down that medicine， Doc，” after mak-ing the switch from MDIs to DPIs. DPIs and MDIs both dispense very precise doses of medication， but DPIs are fundamentally different from MDIs.The DPI device automatically releases medicine asSyou generate an inward flow of air with your lips around the mouthpiece. The DPI is thus“breath activated.\"The MDI， on the other hand， requires a greater degree of coordination， timing， and skill for you to trigger the release of the medicine just as you begin to inhale.\n【save__datas】\t【1082】\tSome DPIs have a month's supply of asthma medicine already preloaded into the device. You “bring up”each dose as it is needed， usually by clicking a lever or twist-ing the base of the DPI unit immediately before use. Other DPIs require that you open the DPI before each inhalation and place a capsule that contains a sin-gle dose of medicine in powdered form into a groove before snapping the DPI back into place. Medicines provided via Diskus@ or Turbuhaler@ are preloaded with a month's supply of medicine. Use of Rotahaler@--connect--【1083】or Aerolizer@ requires you to load a medicine filled capsule before each use. The Diskhaler@ lets you load up to eight doses at once. By keeping track of how many doses or capsules you have used and inhaled， the DPI technology makes it simple to know when to refill your prescription before you run out of medicine. The design of the Diskus@ stands out and features a small counter that displays how many doses remain in the device.\n【save__datas】\t【1084】\tSeveral different medicines come in DPI form， includ-ing long-acting B2 agonists (such as salmeterol and formoterol)， inhaled corticosteroids (such as budes-onide and fluticasone)， and combination DPIs con-taining differentpotency inhaledcorticosteroids， directly combined with long-acting B2 agonists (such as mixtures of salmeterol and fluticasone). Trade names include：Serevent@ Diskus@， Foradil@Aerolizer@Pulmicort@ Turbuhaler@， Flovent@ Diskus@， Flovent@Rotadisk Diskhaler@， and Advair@ Diskus@.\n【save__datas】\t【1085】\t64\\. What is the correct way to use my dry--connect--【1086】powder inbaler (DPI)?\n【save__datas】\t【1087】\tDry powder inhalers (DPIs) deliver asthma medicine as fine particles of powder. As discussed in Question63， there are many types of DPIs available on the mar-ket. Each type of DPI is manufactured by a different pharmaceutical company， and each type of DPI conse-quently has its unique set of instructions for optimal use. When your physician prescribes a DPI for treat-ment of your asthma， have him or her demonstrate the correct way for you to use the DPI and provide you with any required instructional materials. When you fill the prescription， make sure that the dispensing pharmacist includes the directions provided by the--connect--【1088】manufacturer. Remember， too， that many pharmacists can advise you on proper DPI usage techniques.\n【save__datas】\t【1089】\tEven though each DPI comes with its own set of instructions， all DPIs share similar conceptual and design features. They are prized for their ease of use， reliability， efficiency， and convenience. All DPIsare breath activated. When you inhale through a DPI， a precisely pre-measured dose of medicine is automati-cally released. The way you breathe the medicine in allows it to travel into your airways where it is needed. The general principle is that you inhale the medicine via the DPI mouthpiece starting with “empty\"lungs， and then hold your breath before exhaling and breath-ing normally. The basic technique consists of： (1) an initial exhalation to empty your lungs， (2) fairly rapid inhalation from the mouthpiece， followed by (3) breath holding.\n【save__datas】\t【1090】\tTo use a DPI correctly， you first “prepare\"the pre-measured dose of medicine， either by rotating and clicking the device， advancinga small lever， or by physically inserting powder-containing capsules into a specially designed groove in the device， depending on which type of DPI you have been prescribed. When the medicine is in place， you take a big breath of room air， and fully， yet gently， exhale it into the room. When you feel that your lungsSare completely “empty， quickly place your lips around the DPI's mouthpiece， and take a full， deep breath， inhaling the medicine until you can't breathe in any further. Once you reach the point when your lungs are “full\" of medicine， hold your breath. You should try to hold your breath for 10seconds before exhaling. Count to 10 in your head. After you reach a count of 10， remove the DPI mouth-piece from your lips， and let your breath out. Remem---connect--【1091】ber to exhale into the room. Do not exhale into a DPI device.\n【save__datas】\t【1092】\tThe reason you need to hold your breath after taking the inhaled dose of medicine is to allow the medicine to deposit in the air passages. When you holdyour breath， there is no movement of air in the lungs. Since there is no movement of air， either in or out， your asthma medicine remains in the lungs long enough to be of benefit to you.\n【save__datas】\t【1093】\tBecome familiar with the specific DPI device you have been prescribed. Read the manufacturer's “Instructions for Patient Use” insert provided with the product. Ask your treating physician any questions you may have. I often ask my patients to bring their DPI with them to their appointment so that they can demonstrate how they use it. I am then able to assess the effectiveness of their technique and， if appropriate， make specific sug-gestions. Note that each DPI not only looks unique， but also has specific characteristics. For example， the disposable Diskus@ device is packaged in a foil pouch， and its manufacturer states that a Diskus@ should be used or discarded within one month of opening the foil pouch to prevent the medicine from drying out. The Diskus@ also has a unique dosage counter that shows how many doses of medicine remain in the device. The numbers in the Diskus@ dose indicator turn red when only 5 doses are left to alert you to refill your prescription. When the “0”is displayed， your Diskus@ is empty. You should always keep the inhaler in a horizontal position during use. If you are left handed， you may find it more comfortable and natural to turn the Diskus@ device over and use it upside down， so that the lever is easier to click into position with your left thumb while holding the device in your--connect--【1094】left hand. The Diskus@ should be closed to cover the mouthpiece after each use and does not require any other maintenance or cleaning. Never exhale into a Diskus@ to avoid introducing moisture into the device and damaging it.\n【save__datas】\t【1095】\tThe Turbuhaler@ is similar to the Diskus@ in that it comes preloaded with medicine. Rather than having to push a lever away from you to prepare the dose the way you do with the Diskus@， the Turbuhaler@ requires you to rotate the base of the device all the way to the right until it “clicks.\"The Turbuhaler doesn't actually display the amount of doses remaining in the device， but it alerts you when 20 doses are left. A red mark appears at the top of the window when you are down to 20 doses. When the marking is at the bottom of the window， the Turbuhaler@ is empty. Always re-cap the Turbuhaler@after using it to keep it clean and dry； you can wipe the mouthpiece with a dry cloth， but do not wash the device.\n【save__datas】\t【1096】\tThe Diskhaler@， Aerolizer@， and Handihaler@ devices require that you load the DPI before using it. The Diskhaler@ holds up to 8 doses of medicine at a time and requires simple but regular maintenance and cleaning. The Aerolizer@ and Handihaler@ accept only one dose at a time. The Rotahaler@ similarly requires insertion of a dose before use， as well as regular cleaning. Although one of the first DPIs developed for patient use， the Rota-haler@ has been supplanted in practice by newer DPIs.\n【save__datas】\t【1097】\t65\\. What is the correct way to use my--connect--【1098】metered-dose inbaler (MDI)?\n【save__datas】\t【1099】\tMetered-dose inhalers (MDIs) are convenient， highly portable， and very reliable devices designed to deliver active medicine by inhalation. MDIs are conceptually--connect--【1100】similar to dry powder inhalers (DPIs) (discussed in Question 62). Both MDIs and DPIs allow for the deliv-ery of accurate， predetermined doses of medicine directly to the respiratory passages. MDIs and DPIs also have some basic， fundamental differences. All MDIs use a propellant to “push\"the medicine out of its dosing canis-ter. All MDIs on the market in the United States are manually activated rather than breath activated (with one exception： the Maxair@ Autohaler@). Manually activated means that the medicine is released from the MDI can-ister when you press down on the MDI. Breath activated means that the medicine is automatically released when you inhale deeply. Because MDIs are patient activated(except for the Maxair@ Autohaler@， which is the only breath-activated MDI)， their proper use is technically more demanding and requires more “coaching”as com-pared with DPIs.\n【save__datas】\t【1101】\tThe correct way to use your MDI is best demonstrated by your physician. There are two techniques for “best”use： the open-mouth and the closed-mouth technique. All MDIs come with directions. The directions， or what your pharmacist calls the manufacturer's “package insert，” describe the closed-mouth technique. Pul-monary specialists (such as myself) generally prefer to teach their patients the open-mouth method of using the MDI. Many pulmonary specialists believe that using the MDI with an open mouth enhances the delivery of medicine and favors the inhalation of the more desirable， smaller particles released by the MDI.\n【save__datas】\t【1102】\tMDIs should be kept at room temperature and should not be subiected to sustained temperatures below 59°F or above 77°F. MDIs should be stored in a vertical posi---connect--【1103】tion with the mouthpiece down when not in use. If you notice that the plastic mouthpiece becomes coated with a whitish powder， pull the metal MDI canister out from the plastic mouthpiece and rinse the mouthpiece under warm tap water until it looks clean. Make sure the mouthpiece is completely dry before reinserting the metal canister. It is fine to let the plastic part air-dry.\n【save__datas】\t【1104】\tAll MDIs should ideally be allowed to reach room temperature before use. If you carry your “rescue\"MDI with you， and you are outdoors on an especially cold day， place it in an inner pocket close to your body rather than in a handbag or backpack. Never leave an MDI in the glove compartment or trunk of your car on a hot summer day； its contents are under pressure and can explode in very hot environments (120°F or above). Several years ago， one of my patients didn't seem to be faring as well as I had expected. She was an elderly widow and lived alone in the same big house where she had raised her children. She and I spent an entire office visit carefully going over “what had changed\" to explain her loss of asthma control. Imag-ine my consternation when she confided that she had hit on a “great way\"to remember where she had put her MDIs： She stored them in her refrigerator’s veg-etable drawer! Her medicines were stored in her fridge， at about 40°to 45°F. She would take them from the vegetable bin， and go through the process of using the MDI， not realizing that they needed to be stored in a warmer environment， and certainly warmed to room temperature before use! After we decided that she should keep her medicines on the top of the chest of drawersin the bedroom， her asthma once again became controlled， much to our mutual satisfaction.\n【save__datas】\t【1105】\tThe general concept in using an MDI is that you trig-ger the release of medicine from the MDI while simultaneously inhaling the medication into “empty”lungs. The basic technique consists of： (1) an initial exhalation to empty your lungs， (2) release of a “puff”of medication to coincide with a full， steady， deep inhalation， followed by (3) breath holding.\n【save__datas】\t【1106】\tTo use your MDI， first remove the cap from the mouthpiece. You should ideally stand upright to use your inhaler. If you prefer to be seated， make sure that you sit upright. Hold the inhaler upright， with the mouthpiece at the bottom. Many people find it most comfortable to hold the MDI with their thumb at the lowermost portion and their third finger on the top-most metal portion of the MDI canister. Next， shake the MDI canister to mix the medicine. After shaking the MDI， position the mouthpiece 2 to 3 finger widths(1 to 2 in.) in front of your open mouth. Tilt your head back slightly， and gently breathe out. When you have emptied your lungs， press on the MDI， and as simulta-neously as you can， take a slow， deep breath. Keep breathing inwards， for at least 5 seconds. Once you have inhaled fully， hold your breath to allow the medi-cine to fully penetrate in your lungs and deposit there. Try to hold your breath for 10 seconds. Exhale and resume normal breathing. If your doctor has prescribed a second puff of medication， you may be instructed to wait a minute or more between doses. The MDI-deliv-ered medicine should be going straight into your lungs； consequently， it not should irritate your throat or cause you to cough， nor should it land on your tongue and cause a“weird”taste. It is important that you learn to use your prescribed MDI correctly (Table 27).

Why does my doctor say I should--connect--【1120】rinse my mouth after using my metered-dose inbaler (MDI)?\n【save__datas】\t【1121】\tYour doctor has likely requested that you rinse your mouth after using your inhaler in order to gently wash away any medicine particles that were not inhaled into the lungs and may have remained behind in the throat. In particular， it is important to always rinse your mouth after using any inhaled corticosteroid prepara-tion， whether administered by MDI， DPI， or jet nebu-lizer.The inhaledcorticosteroid medicationsin particular can， if they “land” in your throat， cause--connect--【1122】throat irritation and also occasionally lead to a yeast infection in the mouth or throat called“thrush.”Rins-ing your mouth and gargling is thought to reduce your chances of getting thrush， and decreases the chance you'll experience throat irritation or hoarseness. Remember to spit after rinsing； dont swallow the liq-uid you gargled with!\n【save__datas】\t【1123】\t67.How can I tell when my inbaler is\n【save__datas】\t【1125】\tIt is easy to know whether a dry powder inhaler (DPI) is empty or not because DPIs are specifically designed with counters that keep track of how many doses remain in the inhaler and “remind\" you when to refill your prescription. Preloaded DPIs such as the Diskus@are dispensed by your pharmacist in a moisture-protec-tive foil wrapper. The preloaded DPI must be discarded within 30 days of opening the foil wrapper， regardless of whether or not the counter registers “0”doses. Metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) do not have built-in dose counters. Various strategies have been advocated over the years to help you know when your MDI is empty or nearly empty. One suggestion involved removing the metal MDI canister from its plastic mouthpiece and dropping it into a tall glass of water. If the metal canister sank to the bottom， it was close to full. If it settled halfway to the surface， you still had plenty of medicine. If it started to bob close to the sur-face， it was time to head for the pharmacy for a refill. MDI manufacturers are strongly opposed to immersing the metal MDI canister in water， so most doctors don’t currently recommend “floating”the canister under any circumstances.You cannot tell whether an MDI is--connect--【1126】empty or not by shaking it. It may have propellant in it even after the active medicine has been used up.--connect--【1128】puffs from the MDI， or if 90 days have passed since you opened the sealed， moisture-protective foil wrap-per， whichever comes first.\n【save__datas】\t【1129】\t68\\. What is a spacer device， and why--connect--【1130】should I buy one?\n【save__datas】\t【1131】\tA spacer is a device that is often prescribed with a metered-dose inhaler (MDI). A holding chamber is a type of spacer， and the terms are sometimes used inter-changeably. The benefits of spacer use are at least threefold. The spacer enhances the delivery of the MDIs medication into the lung passages. It reduces potential side effects such as cough， hoarseness， thrush， and throat irritation related to asthma medicine“land-ing”in the throat. More medicine goes where it is needed， and\"less\"where it is not. Spacers also greatly simplify the hardest step for most MDI users： having to coordinate and precisely time inhalation with acti-vation and pumping of the canister. Spacers were given their name because they allow you to “space”MDI activation and deep inhalation in time. You first press on the MDI canister to release the medicine into the spacer device， and a second or so later， you can inhale that same puff of medication from the spacer. What is a one-step procedure with MDIs becomes a two-step process with the MDI-spacer combination.\n【save__datas】\t【1132】\tSpacers make it easier for you or your childwith asthma to use an MDI effectively. Spacers are recom-mended for children， or for anyone who experiences difficulty coordinating deep inhalation and activation of the MDI. They are also indicated when metered-dose inhaled corticosteroids are prescribed. In fact， one inhaled corticosteroid， Azmacort@ (the brand of tri-amcinolone manufactured by Aventis Pharmaceuti---connect--【1133】cals)， is sold with an incorporated spacer device so that any asthmatic using Azmacort@ inhales the medica-tion via its spacer.\n【save__datas】\t【1134】\tSpacers require a doctor’s prescription in the United States， and there are several different brands available on the market today. Your lung specialist may recommend a specific brand or type of spacer that is best for you. All spacers come with instructions for cleaning and use. You should， of course， familiarize yourself with the details of the particular spacer that has been prescribed for you.\n【save__datas】\t【1135】\tOne compact“collapsible”spacer， the InspirEase@， has always reminded me of an accordion. It consists of a special mouthpiece with a disposable plastic reservoir bag at its end. The MDI attaches to the mouthpiece separately. When you are ready to take your asthma medicine， place your lips around the InspirEase@mouthpiece， and press on the (previously shaken) MDI canister which then releases the MDI’s puff into the reservoir bag. You then deeply inhale through the mouthpiece. The reservoir bag collapses inward as you inhale the air and medicine (“sucking in\")， after which you hold your breath. If you inhale too rapidly， the InspirEase@ device emits a whistling sound to alert ou to slow down. It coaches you to develop a good inhalation technique. Many patients like the InspirEase@ device because it requires very little in the way of maintenance. The reservoir bags must be replaced if they become cracked or torn. Washing the bags is not generally advised.\n【save__datas】\t【1136】\tIn contrast to InspirEase@， the majority of lightweight spacers on the market today are rigid devices. The spacers resemble a transparent plastic cylinder. You use a spacer by inserting the mouthpiece of the MDI at--connect--【1137】the far end of the tube， and placing your lips around the spacer’s mouthpiece at the opposite end. First， depress the MDI canister to release the medicine into the spacer， and then a moment later inhale deeply and steadily before holding your breath for 10 seconds or more. Some rigid spacers， such as the Aerochamber@family of products， whistle if you breathe in too fast. Learn to inhale so that the spacer remains silent. Remember to wash any new plastic spacer with mild dishwashing soap and warm water before you first use it. Make certain to rinse it and allow it to air-dry. Do not rub it dry. Plastic spacers are such that they have an electrostatic field that draws some of the MDI's particles toward the inside of the spacer’s walls. Clean-ing the spacer may reduce the electrostatic charge and cause it to dissipate. Most doctors agree that if you have a plastic spacer that you use regularly， you should take it apart according to the manufacturer’s direc-tions， and wash it gently in dishwashing soap and warm water every 2 to 4 weeks. As of this writing， there is one commercially available non-electrostatic spacer on the North American market. The Pari Res-piratory Equipment Company’s Vortex@ isSaanovel spacer made of aluminum. Because it is not made of plastic， and therefore non-electrostatic， it improves the consistency of the MDI medication delivery； no medi-cine particles are attracted to the spacer walls， and more particles remain available for inhalation. Another convenient advantage to the aluminum spacer is that it can be washed in a dishwasher!\n【save__datas】\t【1138】\t69\\. Wbat is a nebulixer?--connect--【1140】nebulizer creates a fine mist of medicine particles that are easily inhaled into the lungs’ breathing passages. Nebulizers can be fitted with either a mouthpiece or a facemask. Babies and very young children are candi-dates for the latter. Many different medications used in asthma treatment are manufactured in a liquid form suitable for nebulization. The two major types of nebu-lizers are jet nebulizers and ultrasonic nebulizers. Most pulmonologists prefer jet nebulizers for their patients. If you or your child has been prescribed Pulmicort@Respules@， which is an inhaled steroid preparation， it must be administered by a jet nebulizer. The Respules@should not be given by ultrasonic nebulization.\n【save__datas】\t【1141】\tThe machine that“transforms\"the liquid medication into a fine mist is the nebulizer， and the part of the appa-ratus that permits the mist to be inhaled is the air com-pressor. All nebulizer units consist of a nebulizer proper， as well as a small cup to hold the liquid form of medica-tion. Special tubing connects the nebulizer proper to an air compressor that shoots air though the medication cup and transforms the liquid medicine into a fine mist suit-able for inhalation. Several studies have revealed that the different nebulizers available on the market have differ-ent medication-delivery profiles. Although all nebulizers work in a similar way， you should familiarize yourself fully with the nebulizer that your physician prescribes for you or your child. Read any directions for use and main-tenance carefully. Many nebulizer manufacturers main-tain Web sites for their products and can be a good source of information for patients.\n【save__datas】\t【1142】\tTo use your nebulizer you will need to： (1) assemble the nebulizer and air compressor， (2) take the nebulized med-ication (“treatment\")， which should last about 15 to 20minutes， (3) clean and prepare the nebulizer for the next--connect--【1143】use， and (4) every other day， clean more thoroughly. Here are some general guidelines on how to use your nebulizer， using a mouthpiece. Babies and young children will need to use a special mask rather than a mouthpiece.\n【save__datas】\t【1144】\tUnderstand that your individual machine may require slightly different handling. First always collect all the equipment and medicine you will require， including the nebulizer， tubing， medicine， and the compressor. Wash vour hands. Use a clean nebulizer and fill the medication cup\"with one dose of your medicine as directed by your physician. Connect the air tubing between the nebulizer and the compressor， along with a finger valve if your setup requires one. Attach a mouthpiece (or mask) to the nebulizer. Turn the compressor on and check that the nebulizer is producing a medication mist. Now you’re ready to place your lips around the mouthpiece. You should stabilize the mouthpiece between your teeth. Remember to hold the nebulizer upright to avoid spills， and to increase its effectiveness. Breathe gently and calmly. Try to breathe in deeply for 3 to 5 seconds before holding your breath for up to 10 seconds， and then exhale normally. If your nebulizer has a finger valve， you should cover the hole in the finger valve while you inhale， and uncover the valve when you exhale. Repeat， drawing deep breaths， followed by breath holds until the nebulizer begins to make sputtering sounds. The sputtering sound signals that your treatment is finished.\n【save__datas】\t【1145】\tWhen all the medication solution has been nebulized. take the nebulizer setup apart. Wash all the parts-except for the tubing and the finger valve-in liquid dish soap and water. Rinse in tap water， and shake off any excess water droplets. Reconnect the different parts and run the compressor to dry the nebulizer.\n【save__datas】\t【1146】\tWait until the nebulizer is completely dry before stor-ing it. If you use a nebulizer daily， you should also per-form a more in-depth cleaning every 48 hours or so. To do so， wash your hands first. Then， put aside the tub-ing and valve. Prepare a fresh solution of distilled white vinegar and hot water. The proportions are： 1 part white vinegar to 3 parts hot water (one quarter white vinegar to three quarters hot water). Soak all parts of the nebulizer (except the tubing and mask) in the vine-gar and hot water solution for 60 minutes. After an hour， remove the nebulizer parts and rinse them under running water. Throw away the soaking solution. After rinsing in fresh water， shake off any excess--connect--【1147】water--connect--【1148】droplets. Reconnect the different parts of the setup， and run the compressor to dry the nebulizer. Wait until the nebulizer is completely dry before storing it. Make it a point to find out whether the compressor unit you are using requires specific maintenance or cleaning.\n【save__datas】\t【1149】\t70\\. Is medication in nebulized form--connect--【1150】more effective than that in an inbaler?\n【save__datas】\t【1151】\tThe surprising answer is： “No， not necessarily， and not usually.” Several studies have demonstratedthat inhaled asthma medication in MDI form is just as effective as that administered via a nebulizer， provided that a spacer is used with the MDI and the patient has mastered appropriate MDI technique. MDIs are inex-pensive， basically maintenance free， highly portable， and very convenient. Nebulizers are more cumber-some， require a power source， and need frequent clean-ing. The same medicine that can be administered in two or three minutes by an MDI will take at least a quarter of an hour by nebulization. There are a few specific instances when a nebulizer rather than an\n【save__datas】\t【1152】\tMDI-spacer setup might be considered. Babies and very young children who are too young to learn MDI technique should receive their medicine by nebuliza-tion， usually via a face mask. Most children can be taught correctMDI technique when they are of kindergarten age， particularly if there is a motivated adult in the home to supervise and encourage the child. Many such children can also be prescribed a nebulizer to keep in reserve at home for “emergency\" use under the guidance of a doctor in the case of a severe exacer-bation. A patient of any age who cannot master correct MDI-spacer technique will require medication admin-istration by nebulizer. Persons who are unable to use MDIs， perhaps because of physical or neurological impairments， can usually receive their prescribed medi-cine via a nebulizer. Finally， some individuals with very compromised lung function cannot inhale from an MDI deeply enough to benefit and should switch to a nebulizer. The last scenario is unusual in a person with asthma alone and is more likely with a cigarette-associ-ated lung condition， such as advanced emphysema.\n【save__datas】\t【1153】\t71\\. Are steroids dangerous medicines?\n【save__datas】\t【1154】\tNo， not if you take steroids exactly as prescribed by your physician. Each and every prescription medica-tion for sale in the United States has passed the FDAs rigorous approval process. Steroids are no exception； like any other class of medicine， steroids are safe and effective when prescribed appropriately， and when used exactly as directed. Steroids are not inherently any more or less “dangerous\" than other medicines. Like any other medicine， they do carry potential side effects， especially if used in pill form chronically (long term) and in large doses. Steroid preparations have--connect--【1155】important and diverse medical uses. The development of inhaled corticosteroid medicines in MDI and DPI forms has revolutionized the treatment of asthma and transformed the lives of countless asthmatics for the better. Steroids come in forms other than pills and inhalers. An allergic child with eczema may be treated with a steroid cream， for example. Similarly， ophthal-mologists may prescribe steroid eye drops for specific conditions. Steroids are a powerful medicine in the pulmonologist’s and allergist's armamentarium， and they can be life saving in certain medical situations， such as a severe exacerbation of asthma.\n【save__datas】\t【1156】\tWhy， then， might people think of steroids as “danger-ous?”Some confuse anabolic steroid medications with corticosteroids. Anabolic steroids have been abused by some weight builders and athletes to help them “bulk up”and build muscle mass. Corticosteroids are com-pletely different medicines from anabolic steroids and are used extensively in allergy and asthma manage-ment. Another reason you might think of steroids as dangerous is because they have to be taken exactly as directed. If your doctor instructs you to take tapering or decreasing doses daily， for example， then you should follow the physician's directions to the letter. There are at least two important reasons for you not to stop tak-ing the pill form of corticosteroids abruptly. The first reason is that if prescribed for asthma treatment， there is a good chance that the asthma will flare anew if the steroid dosage is decreased all at once. The second rea-sOnapplies in the scenario of an individual who requires steroids on a more long-term basis. Our bodies all produce a form of steroids that is required for health. The right and the left adrenal glands located above each kidney are responsible for meeting the\n【save__datas】\t【1157】\tSteroids are--connect--【1158】considered safe--connect--【1159】wben taken--connect--【1160】exactly as--connect--【1161】prescribed.--connect--【1162】for bona fide--connect--【1163】medical--connect--【1164】indications.--connect--【1165】body's steroid requirements. The steroids produced by the adrenal glands are referred to as the body’s “endoge-nous steroids.\" When the adrenal glands detect“extra”steroid medication in the bloodstream over time， they reduce their own endogenous steroid production. If the adrenal glands are exposed to a significant amount of steroid medication， they will fairly quickly respond by completely shutting down the body’s own vital manu-facture of steroids. As long as a person continues to take his or her prescribed steroid medication， the adrenals remain “lazy”and cease the production of endogenous steroids. When steroid medication is grad-ually reduced， the adrenal glands have time to “wake up，” and will eventually resume producing endogenous steroids for the body’s needs. If， on the other hand， long-term steroid pills are not tapered and are stopped abruptly， the adrenal glands will not have sufficient time to recover and to restart the manufacture of endogenous steroids. The body will be left without any steroids at all， and an “adrenal crisis\"—a true medical emergency-may ensue. The treatment of adrenal crisis includes steroid administration.\n【save__datas】\t【1166】\tSteroids are considered safe when taken exactly as pre-scribed， for bona fide medical indications. Let’s say that your asthma has become more active. Despite the fact that you are using inhaled， long-acting B2 agonists， along with an inhaled， high-dose corticosteroid， you are also requiring a short-acting rescue inhaled B2 agonist every 4 to 6 hours for relief of breathlessness. Your peak flow values have decreased. You are experiencing noc-turnal awakenings because of respiratory difficulty. You feel rotten. Your physician will undoubtedly prescribe a“steroid burst”for you. A“steroid burst”is a prescription--connect--【1167】for corticosteroid pills that you will take daily for a lim-ited period of time (usually 6 to 21 days， depending on your asthma). You will begin with higher doses， in order to get your asthma under control， followed by gradually decreasing doses， before finally tapering off the medi-cine. You can expect to begin to feel an improvement in your asthma exacerbation， with lessening of symptoms in as little as 6 to 12 hours after the first dose of steroid pills. When used properly， steroids are truly miraculous in their effectiveness. Prednisone and medrol are two different steroids in pill (or oral) form that are fre-quently prescribed in the treatment of asthmatic exacer-bations and of severe allergic reactions. They are also sometimes given as controller therapy in very small daily doses in the treatment of severe persistent asthma. A5 mg dose of prednisone is equivalent to a 4 mg dose of medrol. I usually advise my patientswho require steroids to \"start them early and get off them quickly，”so they can take advantage of the beneficial qualities when treating an exacerbation and minimize potential side effects.\n【save__datas】\t【1168】\t72\\. Wbat are possible steroid side effects?\n【save__datas】\t【1169】\tThe potential side effects of steroids are well described in the medical literature and are related to： (1) the daily dose of steroid taken， (2) the total duration of steroid therapy， and (3) individual characteristics. A person who requires 60 mg of prednisone daily for 6 weeks， for example (an admittedly unusually high and prolonged dose in asthma treatment)， can expect to develop differ-ent side effects as compared to a person taking 40 mg of prednisone for one day， 35 mg the next day， then 30 mg the day after， and so forth， tapering down by 5 mg each--connect--【1170】day for a total of 8 days of therapy altogether. Note too that oral (pill form) steroids affect different people in different ways. Steroids can cause mood elevation and increased energy. Some people may experience insomnia. Steroids stimulate appetite； food “tastes better.\" Because steroids can lead to water retention along with an increase in appetite， weight gain often occurs， particu-larly with longer duration of use. Steroids can cause blood pressure to rise and can cause “glucose intoler-ance，”which makes diabetes harder to control. With long-term use， steroids can lead to acne and cause the skin to bruise easily. Some people develop a rounded facial appearance that， like most other steroid side effects， is not permanent and will disappear after the steroid medication has been tapered and discontinued. Long-term steroid treatment can lead to “thinning”and weakening of bone， and cause a type of osteoporosis called glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIO).\n【save__datas】\t【1171】\tGIO iss being increasingly recognized in respiratory patients. There is some uncertainty and controversy regarding what a \"minimum\"safe， daily steroid dose is from the perspective of bone health. Clearly， steroids in pill form are of far greater concern than inhaled steroids when it comes to glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. Not all persons on glucocorticoids develop bone loss or GIO. Some experts quote a dose of 5 mg of prednisone by mouth daily for 3 to 6 months or more as placing a patient at risk for the development of GIO. Others quote a dose of 7.5 mg in pill form daily. One prelimi-nary study examined bone density in asthmatics taking inhaled steroids for 6 years and detected reduced bone density in several parts of their bony skeleton. GIO can be prevented or reversed with early and timely treat-ment. Ways to prevent and treat GIO include： (1) pre---connect--【1172】scription of the smallest effective dose of steroids， (2) favoring inhaled steroids for asthma treatment rather than oral (pill form) steroids， (3) adding calcium(1500 mg/day) and Vitamin D (800 IU/day) supple-ments daily， (4) performing regular weight-bearing exercises， (5) speaking to your physician about the pos-sible need for bone density measurement tests， and (6) taking a class of medicines called biophosphonates for the prevention and/or treatment of GIO， if medically appropriate. The FDA has approved risedronate for the prevention and treatment of GIO， and the medicine alendronate for the treatment of GIO.\n【save__datas】\t【1174】\tAstbma：AHeal--connect--【1175】th矾y\n【save__datas】\t【1176】\tLifestyle\n【save__datas】\t【1177】\tWhat's new in asthma treatment?\n【save__datas】\t【1178】\tMy asthma worsens each month near my period.

IgE is an antibody. IgE is produced by the body in minute quantities and normally circulates in the bloodstream in very small amounts. Under certain conditions however， the body's (and blood or serum) level of IgE can rise significantly. High serum IgE lev-els have， for example， been associated with persistent wheezing， allergy， and bronchial hyperresponsiveness. IgE plays a pivotal role in allergy， in asthma， and in the other “atopic diseases， such as eczema， seasonal aller-gic rhinitis， peanut allergy anaphylaxis， and hives. To better understand the central role of IgE， it is impor-tant to first review our understanding of the body's allergic response.\n【save__datas】\t【1202】\tWhen a person has an allergy to a specific allergen， the allergy has developed over time. In order for an allergy to emerge， a person must first be exposed to an aller-gen. With continued exposure，“sensitization” to the allergen takes place， and only then， with continued exposure to the allergen， will an allergic response develop. The genesis of a specific allergy in an individ-ual with certain innate genetic characteristics requires at least two successive steps： a preliminary exposure to2112allergen， followed by sensitization to that same allergen. Many individuals are not “allergy prone，”meaning that even though they may have repeated， frequent allergen exposure， their immune system does not become sensitized， and allergic symptoms never develop. Consider， for example， two siblings who live in a home with a cat. One child has no allergic symp-toms. The other child experiences itchy eyes， runny nose， chest tightness， and wheezing upon any exposure--connect--【1203】to the family cat. The second child's immune system has reacted to the continued exposure and sensitization to cat allergen by making antibodies against cat pro-teins. The antibodies made in the course of the allergic response are IgE antibodies. The IgE directed against cat protein is the“culprit\"in the allergic response.The child's elevated IgE levels contribute significantly to the child's asthma symptoms. The increase in an aller-gic individuals IgE levels and IgE antibodies are easy for doctors to measure and assess. A simple blood test will yield values for total IgE. There are two tests for specific IgE： one is a skin “prick\"test， the other is an IgE-specific blood test measurement against the aller-gen， called a RAST test. To continue with our prior example， the cat-allergic child will demonstrate an ele-vated total IgE blood measurement， a positive skin test to cat allergen， and a high level of cat-directed IgE(anti-cat IgE) in the blood on RAST testing.\n【save__datas】\t【1204】\tScientists have been able to very precisely study and analyze effects of IgE in humans at the cellular level. Researchers have been able to map out how exactly the IgE in concert with “effector”cells in our bodies， such as macrophages， T cells， B cells， and activated mast cells， interact and release substances that create the symptoms of an allergic response. The sophisticated research has not only advanced our understanding of how allergy and asthma “develop，” but has also sug-gested pathways for new asthma and allergy medica-tions.. In particular， a novel medication， Xolair@(omalizumab)， was developed specifically for patients with IgE-mediated asthma. The FDA granted Xolair@its approval in June of 2003. Xolair@ treats asthma by a unique and completely different mechanism from other existingasthma medicines. Xolair@actually--connect--【1205】binds the IgE circulating in the body. The IgE is blocked by the medication and does not interact with cells， meaning that IgE cannot exert its asthma-caus-ing effects. Xolair@ became available in the U.S. by prescription in July of 2003. It is approved by the FDA for treatment of moderate persistent or severe persist-ent asthma in adolescents and adults who meet two additional specific criteria. One is the presence of a positive skin test， or RAST blood test for a year-round allergen， such as dust mite or mold， for example. The second criterion requires that inhaled corticosteroid treatment be ineffective in adequately controlling the patient's asthmatic symptomatology\n【save__datas】\t【1206】\t74\\.

Hormonal changes， possibly related to risesin leukotriene levels， have been studiedd aas a ppoossssible explanation for the increase in asthma symptoms. The first step in treating premenstrual asthma is to identify whether it is in fact present. A symptom diary together with daily peak-flow recordings can be helpful. If con-firmed， premenstrual asthma can be treated with one or more of the following， depending on symptom severity and individual characteristics： (1) stepped-up controller medicine， (2) a trial of oral leukotriene mod-ifiers， and (3) in severe cases， hormone therapy or oral contraceptive medication to suppress ovulation.\n【save__datas】\t【1209】\t75\\.

Supplements should never replace good eating habits and healthful food selections. Many foods in the American diet are， in fact， further fortified with vitamins and nutrients. Vitamin deficien-cies in our society are usually due to an illness (often of the intestinal tract) that interferes with the body’s abil-ity to absorb the vitamins present in food， rather than a vitamin deficiency in the diet or food itself.\n【save__datas】\t【1228】\tA closer review of vitamins reveals that there are two categories of vitamins： fat-soluble vitamins and water-soluble vitamins. Fat-soluble vitamins include Vitamins A，D，E， and K. If taken in amounts exceeding the body's immediate requirements， the “extra”fat-soluble vitamins are stored in the body's fatty tissues. If still more fat-solu-ble vitamins are ingested， vitamin toxicity can develop. Water-soluble vitamins， on the other hand， are not stored by the human body. The B vitamins and Vitamin C are examples of water-soluble vitamins. If you take a tablet of Vitamin C， for example， most of it is eliminated in your urine. Your body absorbs what is requires and the kidneys excrete the rest. Since the majority of the dose of the water-soluble vitamins people add to their diet in pill form ends up in their urine， many nutritionists joke that Americans have the“healthiest\"and most expensive toi-let water in the world!\n【save__datas】\t【1229】\tThe U.S. National Academy of Science’s National Research Council has established guidelines on the amount of various nutrients men and women should eat at different ages. The guidelines constitute the“RecommendedDietary Allowances，” or RDAs often referredto as RecommendedDailysic\n【save__datas】\t【1230】\tAllowances. In 1997， the National Academy of Sci-ence’s Institute of Medicine published an updated report that modified recommendations for calcium， Vitamin D， fluoride， magnesium， and phosphorus， and that eliminated the name RDA in favor of DRIs， or“Dietary Reference Intakes.\" Most healthy persons with good eating habits easily meet the DRIs. Note that adequate calcium intake is especially important in growing girls and teenagers. Many young girls drink soda daily or with meals. The large amounts of soft drinks consumed by adolescents may be responsible for their increasingly inadequate calcium intake. The Institute of Medicine has also added a new category， tolerable upper intake levels (ULs)， to caution against excess intake of nutrients like Vitamin D that can be harmful in large amounts.\n【save__datas】\t【1231】\tWhat if you don’t quite fit into the “healthy adult with asthma eating a balanced diet” category described above? There are， of course， specific circumstances that may lead your physician to advise you to regularly sup-plement your diet with a multivitamin tablet or miner-als. Those situations are not just asthma related. For example， all pregnant women should take a folic acid supplement to help prevent neural tube defects in the developing fetus. So， it goes without saying that the recommendation for folic acid supplementation also applies to pregnant women with asthma. Of particular importance for the reader is the person with severe food allergy who requires the elimination of an entire food group. A child with a peanut allergy does not need to compensate for the lack of peanuts in his diet， for example， but another child unable to drink milk or eat cheese certainly should be placed on calcium sup-plements ttoo ensure an adequate intake of calcium.\n【save__datas】\t【1232】\tFinally， if your calorie intake is reduced or limited (by dieting or loss of appetite) below 1，200 calories (as a general cut off)， you should most likely take a multivi-tamin and mineral supplement on a regular basis. Be sure to check with your doctor if you think you may require vitamin or mineral supplements.\n【save__datas】\t【1233】\t76\\. Is obesity related to asthma?\n【save__datas】\t【1234】\tA suspected relationship between obesity and asthma continues to stimulate medical interest. Physicians as well as the general public have long postulated a link between obesity and asthma. The prevalence of both obesity and asthma are rising in parallel in Western societies. Severalhuman population studieshave demonstrated an association betweenbeing over-weight and the likelihood of carrying an asthma diag-nosis. Yet， the precise relationship between the two conditions remains controversial.\n【save__datas】\t【1235】\tDoesasthmaa(cause obesity? Does obesity cause asthma? Or， is there a common underlying factor that causes both asthma and obesity? The scientific pul-monary community has started to tackle these ques-tions. One traditional theory maintains that asthma， particularly less than optimally managed asthma， leads to a more sedentary lifestyle. According to the theory， certain asthmatics do not exercise， either because of a mistaken belief that exercise is “bad”for asthma or because their asthma is not well controlled and flares with exercise. Because of lack of exercise， the asthmatic becomes more out of shape， more sedentary gains more weight， and ultimately joins the ranks of the obese. An alternative theory suggests that obesity is the primary event， and that the obese state leads to--connect--【1236】changes in the lungs and airways， and ultimately asthma. Both theories have their merits， but neither one satisfactorily explains why asthma does not affect males and females equally. A third， more contempo-rary approach， with intriguing supportive data in labo-ratory animals， attempts to sort out the influence of chromosomal changes and hormonal factors that might confer predispositions to both asthma and over-weight status. In 1994， a protein molecule called leptin was identified in humans. Leptin is primarily pro-duced by fatty tissues. Leptin and a second fprotein called ghrelin are both suspected of playing important roles in the regulation of food intake， energy balance， andultimately of weight. Of interestto lung researchers， lung and airway cells have receptors for leptin on their surfaces， and leptin furthermore stimu-lates the proliferation of the lung and airway cells， act-ing as a kind of stimulatory lung growth factor. Some preliminary studies in humans have documented ele-vated blood leptin levels in certain types of marked obesity. The finding raises the tantalizing possibility that there could be an association between obesity and asthma on one hand， and abnormal blood levels of lep-tin and even ghrelin on the other.\n【save__datas】\t【1237】\tA key to better understanding the obesity-asthma link may come from the study of girls and boys in puberty and adolescence. More than 1，000 babies born between May 1980 and January of 1984 were entered at birth in the ambitious and ongoing Tucson Children’s Respira-tory Study. Nearly 1，300 subjects were enrolled in the study， and have been followed and reassessed at regular intervals for over 20 years by Dr. Fernando Martinez and his team. The study was designed to study respiratory health and illness over time， in a prospective fashion. In--connect--【1238】particular， the development of asthma was carefully eval-uated. In 2001， Dr. Martinez and his co-workers reported that females who became overweight or obese between the ages of 6 and 11 years of age had an increased risk for developing new asthma symptoms dur-ing early adolescence. They found that girls-but not boys-who became overweight between 6 and 11 years of age were 5 to 7 times more likely to develop new asthma symptoms at ages 11 and 13， compared to girls who did not become overweight or obese at ages 6 and11 years. Boys who became significantly overweight between 6 and 11 years of age did not exhibit an increased risk for the development of asthma or asthma-like symptoms. The strongest association between over-weight status and asthma risk was seen in females who underwent puberty before the age of 11 years. Being overweight is associated with earlier onset of puberty. Could there be a common factor that leads to overweight status in girls， followed by early puberty and then the development of asthma? The findings are especially interesting because it has long been observed that new cases of asthma in females are especially common in the adolescent years. Further， the male (2：1) preponderance of asthma seen in young， school-age children changes over to a female preponderance by adulthood. A role for female hormones has long been suspected， and the data from the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study supports this theory and suggests avenues for further research.\n【save__datas】\t【1239】\tApart from consideration of the links between obesity and asthma risk， being overweight is medically unde-sirable. Even my patients with very well-controlled asthma symptoms report that their breathing is “so much easier”when they maintain a “comfortable”weight. They feel more limber， less achy， and describe greater endurance. It makes sense that if you carry--connect--【1240】excess weight on your frame， it literally “feels” as ifyou are transporting additional pounds as you walk around. How can you tell whether you or your child are obese? An obese adult is， by definition， a person who weighs30% or more above their predicted or ideal body weight. One useful and handy formula for calculating an adult’s ideal body weight requires knowledge of your height. Females are allowed 100 pounds for the first 5 feet of height， and 5 more pounds for each addi-tional inch above 5 feet. A few additional pounds are added or subtracted for persons with large or small frames. So， a 5'3”woman should ideally weigh about115 pounds. The formula for men is similar： A man is allowed 106 pounds for “the first\"5 feet of height， and6 additional pounds are added for every additional inch over 5 feet. A 6-foot tall man of average build would thus be expected to weigh 178 pounds. As for women， there is a correction for individuals with small and large frames.\n【save__datas】\t【1241】\tIdeal body weight for children is best determined by computation of the body mass index (BMI). BMI is a measure that can also be used in adults. Assessment of BMI requiresaccurate measurement of height and weight， ideally in meters and kilograms. The BMI is the weight (in kilograms) divided by the square of the height(in meters). You will need to obtain a table of predicted BMI for any age to compare your childs BMI to the standard. A child with a BMI greater or equal to the 95th percentile for his or her age is considered obese. If you prefer not to do the math， there are several clever Web sites that ask you to enter data such as your weight， height， and age， and then calculate your ideal body weight and BMI for you. Simply go to your preferred search engine， and type a phrase such as： \"ideal body weight cal---connect--【1242】culator，”or“BMI computation”to navigate among the different sites， and learn how you compare!\n【save__datas】\t【1243】\t77\\. Is caffeine good for people with--connect--【1244】asthoma?\n【save__datas】\t【1245】\tCaffeine is a naturally occurring compound. The Ger-man analytical chemist Friedrich Ferdinand Runge(1795-1867) discovered caffeine in 1819， apparently at the urging of Goethe， who had encouraged Runge to study and analyze coffee. We now know that caffeine is naturally present in foods such as coffee beans， tea leaves， cacao beans (used to make chocolate)， kola nuts， guarana， and mate. Caffeine is also frequently added to beverage products， such as carbonated soft drinks and drinks marketed as “energy drinks.” It is also available in pill form， either alone (NoDoze@， Vivarin@)， or as an additive， to aspirin for example， as in Anacin@ and Excedrin@.\n【save__datas】\t【1246】\tResearch studies of the effect of caffeine in humans confirm that caffeine is a bronchodilator. It improves pulmonary function， and although it is a weak bron-chodilator， it clearly has beneficial effects on direct measurements of lung function， such as the vital capac-ity， the FEV，and expiratory flows (discussed in Ques-tion 28). Studies of the human metabolism of caffeine reveal that ingested caffeine is metabolized by the body and transformed into three separate compounds. Caf-feine metabolites are paraxanthine， theobromine， and theophylline. Theophylline is a well-known bron-chodilator， used in pill form for decades in the treat-ment of several lung ailments， including asthma， chronic obstructive bronchitis， and emphysema. The effects of orally administered caffeine are maximal at--connect--【1247】about 2 hours after ingestion and wear off after approx-imately 6 hours. Incidentally， if you are undergoing pul-monary function testing as part of an evaluation of possible asthma， you should avoid caffeine for at least 4hours prior to lung testing. So， to get back to the ques-tion about caffeine being “good” for people with asthma-if you enjoy caffeinated beverages， know that the caffeine they contain will， if taken in high enough doses， provide bronchodilatation， and improve your lung function modestly. Sounds good to me!\n【save__datas】\t【1248】\t78\\. What sports can asthmatics--connect--【1249】participate in?

Studies estimate that nearly 80% of asthmatics develop one or more symptoms of cough， breathlessness， or wheezing from exercising. Those individualss have， by definition， incompletely treated asthma. If your asthma interferes with your ability to exercise， then your asthma requires better control. Clinicians tend to differentiate between a person with asthma in whom exercise is one of sev-eral triggers， anda person who only experiences asthma symptoms in the setting of exercise. The latter individual probably carries a diagnosis of exercise-induced asthma， or EIA (discussed in Question 38). Remember that well-controlled asthma is compatible with a full and active lifestyle (discussed in Question44). If you do experience exercise-related symptom flares of asthma， your asthma treatment needs improvement and fine-tuning. An“improved treat-ment regimen does not automatically mean that you require additional medicine. You may require a change as simple as taking your medicine sooner in the day， before you exercise， for example. Just as importantly， an“improved”treatment regimen does not mean that you should no longer exercise or participate in sports that you enjoy. An interesting fact about asthma and exer-\n【save__datas】\t【1273】\tExercise itself--connect--【1274】is a broncho-dilator!--connect--【1275】cise is that exercise itself is a bronchodilator! With exercise， the lungs’passages actually dilate and open up more. Exercise is good for the lungs! You have a responsibility to report any exercise-related symptoms to your physician or asthma specialist. Your treating doctor has a responsibility， in turn， to address the emergence of exercise-related symptoms and advise you on appropriate measures and treatment.\n【save__datas】\t【1276】\tSuccessful treatment of asthma always includes a pre-scription for aerobic exercise. A balanced exercise program， tailored to a person’s specific interests and abilities， is ideal and inherent to good health. Exer-cise can be separated into aerobic， flexibility， and anaerobic activities. The first achieves cardio-pul-monary fitness， the second targets the range of mus-cle and joint motion， and the third focuses on muscle build-up and strength. Pedaling a bicycle is an exam-ple of aerobic exercise. As you pedal faster， your heart and lungs work in tandem to provide oxygen to exer-cising muscles while excreting acids from the accu-mulating effort. Yoga is an example of a flexibility exercise. Weightlifting is an anaerobic exercise. A good exercise regimen can incorporate a balance of all three types of exercise， with particular emphasis on aerobic activities.\n【save__datas】\t【1277】\tStudies have identified factors that tend to trigger asth-matic symptoms during exercise. A leading hypothesis implicates the rapid inhalation of dry， cold air as the major contributor to exercise-induced asthma. Mouth breathing， in particular， bypasses the nasal passages， which serve to warm and moisten inhaled air before it enters the lungs. Another contributor to exercise symp-toms is obvious， but all too common： poor adherence to--connect--【1278】treatment. In other words， if you are not taking your pre-scribed asthma medicine and you are experiencing flares in your asthma symptoms， then going outdoors to snow-shoe through the woods on your winter vacation， for example， will undoubtedly provoke additional symp-toms! Make sure that your asthma is under satisfactory control before exercising. Apart from taking your medi-cines， you may find it useful to measure your peak flow， and use the PEF value to make an objective decision about participation in sports that day.\n【save__datas】\t【1279】\tThe third factor in exercise-induced asthma relates to the type of exercise itself. Some types of exercise are especially advisable in the setting of asthma， while oth-ers are viewed as more likely to trigger asthma. In the latter category， distance running or cross-country ski-ing， for example， can cause symptoms of cough， breathlessness， or wheezing. Distance running， cycling， and skiing involve very good aerobic conditioning， but the activity is steady， without breaks or interruption， and includes exposure to the outdoors， with extremes of temperature， aeroallergens， and sometimes atmos-pheric pollutants as well. Athletic activity that incor-porates breaks in the intensity of exertion is less likely to cause asthma symptoms by， in a very real sense， allowing time for you to “catch your breath.\"Examples include competitive sports such as tennis， soccer， field hockey， basketball， baseball， and lacrosse， among oth-ers. I encourage exercise and sports for all of my patients. The fact that distance activities have been shown in research studies to be more likely to provoke exercise-induced asthma symptoms in no way leads me to discourage my patients with asthma from cycling， running in a marathon， or cross-country skiing， if they so desire. My patients tell me what athletics they want--connect--【1280】to participate in. My job is to help control their asthma and allow them full and satisfying participation in their chosen exercise routine.\n【save__datas】\t【1281】\tParentssometimes wantto know whatsporttO encourage for their child with asthma. Swimming is an excellent form of exercise for asthmatics of any age. The warm and humid air in indoor swimming is espe-cially gentle for asthmatic lungs and unlikely to trigger symptoms. Swimming isalso outstanding aerobic exercise. It develops muscle groups symmetrically， and helps develop a healthy awareness of breathing while increasing a person’s overall fitness and well-being. Since swimming is not a contact sport， musculoskeletal injuries are rare. Note， too， that swimming is a form of exercise that you never grow out of. It is truly a “for-ever sport!\"Be aware that swimming in a cold atmos-phere， in water that is too cold， or in a heavily chlorinated pool can trigger asthma. Ozone treatment and disinfection of swimming pools has been com-monly practiced in Europe for over 50 years， and is slowly being introduced and accepted in the United States. Swimming pools disinfected primarily with ozone have enhanced water clarity， along with greatly reduced chemical odors. The pool water is purer and far less irritating to skin， eyes， and lungs. If you live in anareawith a choice of pools， you may want to research whether any of the pools are primarily disin-fected with ozone. The first commercial indoor pool in of the state of New York to be primarily disinfected by ozone， for instance， is located in New York City， at the92nd Street YMHA in Manhattan.\n【save__datas】\t【1282】\tTo successfully incorporate exercise and sports in your asthma treatment， keep your asthma well controlled，--connect--【1283】consult with your physician regarding any special exer-cise or sport-specific required measures， and build up to your desired level of activity gradually and steadily. Additional， more specific recommendations focus on preventive measures before each exercise session. Sev-eral inhaled asthma medications are especially useful when administered preventatively， shortly before exer-cise. The medicines include the inhaled， short-actingB. agonists， as well as inhaled cromolyn and nedocro- P24mil. Depending on the degree of your asthma and what your maintenance treatment is， your asthma could greatly benefit from a dose of inhaled medicine before exercise. It is far better， and medically more desirable， to take an inhaled medicine for your asthma before exercise than it isto attempt exercise and develop any combination of breathlessness， cough， chest tightness， uncomfortable breathing， or wheezing. If symptoms occur， chances are that you will not achieve a satisfying workout and may even have to stop prematurely. You will then be in the position to “play catch-up\"in your attempt to treat the emerging symp-toms. If your doctor instructs you to administer two puffs of an inhaler in the setting of exercise， take the inhalations before your workout to protect your lungs， and to prevent exercise-induced symptoms.\n【save__datas】\t【1284】\tLet’s say for example that you have mild intermittent asthma and are treated with “as-needed”inhaled， short-acting B2 agonist medication. Your asthma symptoms have been extremely well controlled. You now notice that you are developing asthma symptoms on the days that you participate in an aerobic dance class. You are then instructed to inhale two puffs of the inhaled medicine 30minutes before your dance class to \"protect”your lungs. The results are striking. Not only does your asthma--connect--【1285】become controlled as before， but now you are able to keep up with the instructor and her demanding moves.\n【save__datas】\t【1286】\tAnother clinical scenario takes advantage of the fact that the leukotriene modifier class of asthma treatment1Salso very helpful in the treatment of exercise-induced asthma (EIA). A fit， healthy young man recently consulted me because of cough. On his first office visit， he explained that he had set his sights on running a marathon. He was very knowledgeable about running techniques and had embarked on a well-planned training regimen， after work and on weekends. As he continued to train， he developed an episodic cough. Itt1turnedoutthat my future marathoner had two diagnoses： seasonal allergic rhini-tis (“hay fever\") and exercise-induced asthma (EIA). He was determined to achieve his goal of becoming a distance runner and competing in \"a few big marathon races.\" I was determined to treat his symptoms and control the EIA. I am happy to report that we both achieved our goals! I treated him with a once daily tablet of montelukast (Singulair@)， one of the leuko-triene modifier medicines. On cold winter days， when he insisted on running outdoors despite the inauspi-cious weather， he premedicated with two puffs of an inhaled， short-acting B2 agonist before his warmup. He was happy， and not coughing； I was happy with his lung function， and he was able to compete in and fin-ish both the New York City and Boston marathons.\n【save__datas】\t【1287】\tAlways--connect--【1288】perform a--connect--【1289】warm up--connect--【1290】before--connect--【1291】exercising，--connect--【1292】and a cool-down--connect--【1293】afterwards.\n【save__datas】\t【1294】\tIn addition to inhaling any preventative and protective asthma medicine， always perform a warm up before exercising， and a cool-down afterwards. The warm-up activity takes advantage of the fact that exercise is a--connect--【1295】bronchodilator. When you warm up， your goal is to perform enough activity to allow the bronchial tubes to “open up”\"a bit more. Depending on your sport， you should perform about 10 minutes of light exertion， enough to break a sweat. You could， for instance， do repeated， brief (10 to 30 second) sprints. Stop exercis-ing immediately after you complete your warm-up， and then wait for at least 30 minutes before getting down to your \"real exercise. Avoid cold air as much as possible. Cover your nose and mouth during outdoor sports in cool air to help warm the air you inhale. Some people like to wear a scarf or pull a neck gaiter over their mouth to keep warm. If you are a runner， switch to an indoor treadmill in a heated gym on very cold days. Similarly， if you live in an area with signifi-cant air pollution at certain times of the year， consider moving your workout indoors on polluted days. Most daily newspapers publish measures of air quality on the weather page. If your area is subject to a day or more of atmospheric\"ozone alerts\" during hot， muggy summer days， for example， pay attention， protect your lungs， and move the exercise indoors. Similar advice applies if you have allergic asthma triggers such as tree or grass pollens. If you are planning to exercise outdoors， and the atmosphere has high air concentration of specific allergens that you know trigger your asthma， use your common sense. Try to prevent an allergic flare and consider moving the activity to an indoor， air-condi-tioned venue.\n【save__datas】\t【1296】\tIn conclusion， well-controlled asthma is no barrier to fitness and sport. If you require inhaled medicine， make certain you take it before exercise， even if your PEF is normal and you feel fine. Remember to warm--connect--【1297】up and cool down. View your physician as your ally， and report any concerns you may have about exercis-ing with asthma.\n【save__datas】\t【1298】\t79\\.

One obvious rea-son is that you may need to use your inhaled asthma medicine during the flight， or at the airport， and you will want to have it handy. You should not pack medi-cine in your checked luggage. Checked suitcases are stored in the hold of the aircraft. The hold is neither heated nor pressurized the way the passenger cabin is. Most medicine needs to be kept at room temperature. Also， checked suitcases are not infrequently waylaid or lost， unlike a bag you keep in your possession.

You should also travel with epinephrine auto-injectors if you have experienced anaphylaxis from severe allergy. If you are traveling outside of the United States， it is a good idea to check in with your physician ahead of time to see if there are any additional medicines you should bring along， such as corticosteroids， antibiotics， or epinephrine.

Woat should Ido?\n【save__datas】\t【1306】\tIn the past， asthma of any type and of any severity was viewed as an absolute contraindication to scuba diving. Scuba diving requires inhalation of dry compressed air though a mouthpiece， which many people find uncom-fortable. Scuba diving can， on a more serious note， lead to the development of a condition known as fatal arterial gas embolism and barotrauma. Asthma classically places an individual at increased risk of diving complications because of air trapping， bronchospasm， and mucus plug-ging in asthmatic airways. Asthma patients were advised that scuba diving was \"off limits，\" although snorkeling on the surface was acceptable. Today， with careful medical screening and medical preparation， some individuals with mild， well-controlled asthma can go scuba diving， after detailed medical evaluation and “clearance”by a physician familiar with diving and asthma. Studies performed by physicians with a specialty in diving medicine in the United States and abroad have yielded specific recom-mendations and guidelines. For example， people with exercise-induced asthma (EIA) should not dive. Simi-larly， any asthmatic who requires inhalation of an inhaled B2 agonist \"rescue quick-relief\"inhaler should be prohib-ited from diving for at least 48 hours following the last dose of bronchodilator.\n【save__datas】\t【1307】\tBefore answering your question， I would need to know more about your asthma， your overall level of fitness， as well as your swimming and diving skills.

Influenza produces widespread， sporadic respiratory illness each year during fall and winter in the Northern hemisphere. It has also been known to occur in epi-demic or pandemic forms. The symptoms of influenza include the sudden， abrupt onset of chills and high fever in the range of 102°F to 103F. Severe general-ized aches and pains， often most intense in the back and the legs， accompany the fever. Exhaustion is com-mon， as is headache and loss of appetite. Pain felt“behind\"the eyeballs is often reported. Respiratory symptoms are initially mild； a scratchy or sore throat--connect--【1313】can accompany a slight dry cough. The lung symptoms develop later and come to dominate the picture with persistent and productive cough as an unmistakable feature. Fever can last up to 5 days in uncomplicated cases. After other symptoms subside， weakness and fatigue may linger for as long as several weeks.\n【save__datas】\t【1314】\tUnfortunately， not all persons who become ill with influenza have an uncomplicated course as described above. Severe， fulminant， or fatal pneumonia can com-plicate influenza. Influenza is responsible for more than 35，000 deaths and 110，000 hospitalizations each year in the U.S. alone. Many of the deaths and hospi-talizations occur among personswith underlying health conditions that place them at increased risk for complications. Increasing age (age 50 years or older)， as well as very young age (age 2 years or younger) also place individuals at increased risk of influenza compli-cations. Pregnancy isa common risk for influenza complications. Asthma1Salso consideredd aarisk. Influenza can now be diagnosed in a few minutes in a doctor’s office. If you have symptoms of influenza， your doctor may advise you to have a nasal wash per-formed to be tested for the influenza virus. If you test positive for influenza， you might then be a candidate for immediate treatment with the antiviral medicines oseltamivir (Tamiflu@)， which is FDA approved for treatment of influenza for those aged 1 year and older， or zanamivir (Relenza@)， which is approved for older children and adults. Zanamivir is administered by inhalation and may be less desirable in asthmatic indi-viduals. Both medicines shorten the time period dur-ing which you can transmit influenza to others and help to reduce the severity and duration of your illness， provided they are taken very early in the course of influenza. Oseltamivir， for example， is effective only if--connect--【1315】startedwithin 48 hours of the onset of influenza symptoms. Taking either medicine later in the course of an established influenza infection does not provide benefit. Oseltamivir is also approved for the prevention(prophylaxis) of influenza in exposed and at-risk adults， as well as adolescents aged 13 years and older. Neither oseltamivir nor zanamivir are considered a substitute for influenza vaccination.\n【save__datas】\t【1316】\tThe single best way to prevent influenza is vaccination(Table 30). Vaccination against influenza virus causes the body's immune system to manufacture protective antibodies. The antibodies produced in response to suc-cessful vaccination will help fight off influenza when and if a person becomes exposed to the virus. Detailed studies of the structure of the influenza virus reveal that the virus wraps itself in a protective envelope or coat. Different strains of influenza virus carry (or“express\") different proteins on the surface of the viral envelope or coat. Influenza is considered a tricky and clever virus because of its ability to change the proteins on its coat. Even subtle changes increase influenza’s ability to invade the human body and to cause illness. Antibodies directed against one specific strain of influenza are actually specific against that particular strain's envelope proteins. So， the body needs to produce specific yet dif-ferent antibodies against different influenza virus enve-lope proteins in order to effectively protect against different strains of virus. Antibodies against one strain are unlikely to offer protection against a different strain with a different coat or envelope. Different strains of influenza circulate each “flu season\"which is why you can “get the flu” for two or more years in succession. It is also the reason that each year， governmental health agencies advise vaccine manufacturers on what strains\n【save__datas】\t【1317】\tTable 30 Recommendations for Influenza Vaccination\n【save__datas】\t【1318】\tIndications for Yearly Influenza Vaccination\n【[*]_filter】\t【1319】\tVaccination is the best way to prevent illness from influenza.\\* Asthma is an indication for yearly influenza vaccination， beginning at 6 months of age.\n【save__datas】\t【1320】\tWho should receive the influenza vaccine?\n【save__datas】\t【1322】\t· Anyone aged 6 months or older with asthma\n【save__datas】\t【1323】\t·Healthy babies and children aged 6 months to 23 months\n【save__datas】\t【1324】\t· Pregnant woman who will be in their second or third trimester of pregnancy during influenza season\n【save__datas】\t【1325】\t· Persons aged 6 months and older with a chronic respiratory (lung) or cardiovascular (heart) condition\n【save__datas】\t【1326】\t·Persons aged 6 months and older with diabetes， chronic blood， kid-ney or immune system disease\n【save__datas】\t【1327】\t·Nursing home and chronic-care facility residents\n【save__datas】\t【1328】\t·A child or teen receiving long-term aspirin therapy\n【save__datas】\t【1329】\t·Persons likely to transmit influenza to others at high risk for the development of influenza complications.

A different influenza vaccine is thus developed and pro-duced each year. The influenza vaccine available each fall in the United States is directed against three (3) specific influenza strains that health authorities believe will cause most of the serious illness for that year’s fall and winter influenza season. The vaccine you receive in the fall of 2005， for example， can be expected to protect you from the common disease-causing strains of influenza circulating in the United States during the winter of 2005 and 2006.\n【save__datas】\t【1337】\tTwo different types of influenza vaccines are available for prevention of influenza in the United States： the inactivated influenza vaccine， and the live， attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) (Table 31).

It is given by injection into a muscle. The inactivated vaccine is the familiar “flu shot”that has been in clinical use for many years. The LAIV， or live， attenuated influenza vaccine， contains a weakened strain of influenza. The LAIV is administered intranasally， by spraying into the nostrils. The LAIV was first licensed in the United States in2003. It is manufactured by Wyeth and is named Flu-Mist@. Like the inactivated influenza vaccine， LAIV stimulates the body’s production of protective antibodies directed against three strains of influenza currently in circulation. Both vaccines are administered each year， ideally in October or November. LAIV， as of this writ-ing， is only approved for administration to healthy per-sons between ages 5 and 49 years. It is not approved for use in pregnancy， nor is it approved in the setting of asthma at the present time.\n【save__datas】\t【1354】\tBecause influenza can be a fatal and devastating ill-ness， especially in certain groups of individuals， vacci-nation is recommended for those at high risk of developing medical complications from infection with influenza.“Medical complications” is term that encompasses hospitalization， severe illness manifesta-tions， respiratory failure， and death. All persons with asthma， including children as well as adults， are candi-dates for yearly influenza vaccination. Unvaccinated healthy persons can get sick with influenza， and in turn pass the infection along to others. Only in a few， very specific circumstances is vaccination absolutely contraindicated. A person who has experienced a sig-nificant egg allergy， or an allergic reaction to a prior influenza vaccine or to any constituent of the vaccine， should not receive the influenza vaccine. Anyone who has been diagnosed with a neurological condition--connect--【1355】called Guillain-Barre Syndrome should consult closely with a physician knowledgeable about the risks of vac-cination. In general， influenza vaccination is very safe and effective. You cannot get“the flu” from influenza vaccination， nor can the vaccination cause an infection. It is possible， however， to become ill with influenza even if you received the vaccine， as the vaccine does not protect against all strains of influenza. I remind my patients that the goal of influenza vaccination is to protectthem from becoming severely ill from influenza. I still consider vaccination a success if they come down with a milder form of illness that slows them for a few days， but does not lead to an exacerba-tion of their asthma or to hospitalization.\n【save__datas】\t【1356】\t82\\.

Which is--connect--【1364】only to say that taking charge ofones asthma is not an easy--connect--【1365】matter.\n【save__datas】\t【1366】\tDust mite is a common indoor year-round allergen； allergy to dust mite has been associated with allergic rhinitis and asthma in children， as well as in adults. If you or your child are diagnosed with an allergy to dust mite， your physician will likely advise you on measures you can take to reduce your exposure to dust mite.\n【save__datas】\t【1367】\tDust mites are eight-legged arachnids related to the spider family. Their cast skin and fecal matter are two constituents of house dust that many people are aller-gic to. Dust mites live indoors and are present in nearly all homes in areas where the relative humidity is50% or greater for much of the year. Dust mites are microscopic； you cannot see them without a magnify-ing microscope. They thrive in warm， dark， humid environments， and live off flecks of human skin. They do not drink free water， but absorb moisture from the surrounding environment. They are often found in bedding， in upholstered furniture， and in carpeting and draperies. They are fairly ubiquitous in the United States， and their presence in a home in no way implies poor housekeeping. That said， we know of several ways to reduce a person's exposure to dust mites. First， dust mites cannot survive at a high altitude or in very dry environments. Could that be why， several generations ago， asthmatics were often sent “to the desert”or“to the mountains\"to gain a respite from their symptoms? Was the relocation no more than a move to an area free of dust mite allergen? On a more practical note， ways to reduce your home’s dust mite burden includes removing carpeting and heavy cloth draperies. Con-sider washable curtains or blinds. Avoid overstuffed furniture made of fuzzy fabric. An alternative to removing carpeting involves thorough， daily carpet vacuuming with a high-quality vacuum cleaner， possi-bly one fitted with a HEPA filter. Steam clean or shampoo carpets and rugs at least once a year.\n【save__datas】\t【1368】\tThe bedroom merits special attention. Most of us spend at least 7 hours out of 24 sleeping in bed， with our head on a pillow or two， wrapped up in sheets， blankets and comforters. Bedding is a favorite location of dust mites. So， while we blissfully slumber away we--connect--【1369】are in close contact with dust mite antigen， inhaling allergic material all night long. The solution? To inter-rupt the replication of dust mites， while reducing the amount of allergen that reaches us. The first goal is easy to achieve： since the dust mites have a life cycle of2 weeks and cannot survive elevated temperatures， simply launder sheets， mattress pads， and washable blankets in hot water at least once every two weeks. Hot water is water heated to a temperature of at least130F. The hotter， the better! Items that cannot be washed frequently， such as pillows， comforters， and mattresses and box springs， are best encased in spe-cially designed covers. The allergen impermeable cov-ers are available from retailers specializing in allergy products. If your physician advises you to encase your bedding， make certain the covers you purchase are rated for dust mite protection. Most covers are of high quality and are unobtrusive； you wont even know you’re sleeping on one. They usually require washing once a year， and carry a warranty for up to 20 years of use. Stuffed animals are dust mite magnets， and many children love to collect and sleep with them. Encour-age your child to keep the collection in a location other than the bedroom and consider identifying one “spe-cial\"stuffed toy to sleep with. Then， if possible， laun-der the favorite in your washing machine in hot water every two weeks， just as you would bedding. Unfortu-nately， not all stuffed animals are machine washable. Despair not! Plan“B\"involves placing the furry toy in a sealed plastic bag， and placing the stuffed animal in your freezer for 24 to 48 hours once or twice a week.\n【save__datas】\t【1370】\tShould someone with dust mite allergy invest in an air purifier? Be sure to ask your physician or allergist PO before buying one. Among the options currently avail---connect--【1371】able， only a few have been studied in the medical (as opposed to the industrial) literature. Machines that are designed to filter the air in an enclosed space through a fine， high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter are， if used correctly， very efficient in trapping particles of a defined size (usually as small as 0.3 microns). HEPA filters thus reduce the airborne concentration of microscopically small airborne particles， including many aeroallergens， likepollens and dust mites. HEPA-filtering machines must be selected based on the square footage of the enclosed space they will filter. The machines usually contain both a carbon pre-filter， and a true HEPA filter. The pre-filter should be changed every 3 to 6 months， and the HEPA filter should be replaced every year. HEPA filters are expen-sive but effective. HEPA filter units do not require much maintenance， apart from filter changes and are engineered to run 24 hours a day. They have the disad-vantage of being rather noisy， and they do tend to dry the ambient air. The correct way to run a HEPA unit is to close the room's windows and doors， and set the unit’s fan on “high” when you are not home. When you are in the room， at night， for example， set the unit’s fan on the highest level you can tolerate from the perspective of noise.\n【save__datas】\t【1372】\t83\\.

It is a myth and a great disservice to all persons diagnosed with asthma to view asthma as a disease of the mind， or of a somehow disturbed frame of mind. Asthma trig-gers are exposures that precipitate or worsen a persons asthma (discussed in Question 43). In some people with asthma， strong emotions can function as a trigger. Conversely， flares of asthma symptomatology， espe-cially if severe， can lead to strong emotional responses.\n【save__datas】\t【1390】\tDuring an exacerbation of asthma， breathing is com-promised and extremely uncomfortable. It is very frightening not to be able to breathe normally and effortlessly， and instead experience a sensation of suf-focation.

As symptoms of wheezing and breathlessness progress， the child’s parents become more and more worried， and start to panic a little； they yell at the child to “relax and take it easy.\" They argue about whether to proceed to the emergency room， or to call the pediatrician after hours.\n【save__datas】\t【1391】\tYou can certainly imagine that the child is likely to become upset， too， and may start crying and acting“emotionally.”The child’s asthma is not a“psychologi-cal disease，” but his response to the exacerbation， as well as to the reaction of the adults around him， might be wrongly attributed to an emotional problem.\n【save__datas】\t【1393】\tSpecial Topic：Astomaand\n【save__datas】\t【1394】\tPregnancy\n【save__datas】\t【1395】\tAre asthma medicines harmful to my unborn child?\n【save__datas】\t【1396】\tWill pregnancy make my asthma worse.\n【save__datas】\t【1397】\tWill I be able to breast-feed my baby if I'm taking medicine for my asthma?\n【len<10_filter】\t【1398】\tMore...\n【save__datas】\t【1399】\t84\\.

Studies of asthma in pregnancy reveal that about one third of pregnant women with asthma will have no change in the degree of their asthma； one third will experience a lessening of their asthma symptoms and a decreased need for medication； and one third of will have worsening of the asthma in pregnancy. Approximately 1 of every 3 pregnant women with asthma will thus experience more asthma sympto-matology and require an increase in asthma medication.

In my practice， for example， I ask my pregnant patients with asthma to see me on a monthly basis， with about the same fre-quency that they visit the obstetrician. Some women may require more frequent appointments， and some less.\n【save__datas】\t【1406】\tNow that you are pregnant， you and your asthma doc-tor have an“extra”to think about and to take into con-sideration. The special “extra\" is， of course，the developing fetus. One of the goals of prenatal care for mother and child is the maintenance of a healthy preg-nancy to“term.” Term refers to the time at which the--connect--【1407】pregnancy is sufficiently advanced to permit the birth of a healthy， fully developed infant， and is defined as anytime after 37 weeks of gestation. A baby's “due date”is calculated so that it falls exactly 40 weeks after the first day of the mother’s last menstrual period. The developing infant is carried in the mother’s uterus (or womb). The intrauterine environment is an ideal envi-ronment for the fetus， with controlled temperature， oxygen， nutrients， and stimuli. The fetus’ oxygen is supplied via the mother's bloodstream through the pla-centa. The mother’s blood oxygen， in turn， reflects her lung function. The overriding principle of asthma treatment in pregnancy is the provision of adequate oxygen to the developing fetus by careful and aggres-sive treatment of maternal asthma. The risks of uncon-trolled asthma to the mother and infant are far greater than the possible or potential risks of medication(Table 32).\n【save__datas】\t【1408】\tThe outcome of pregnancy for a woman who has well-controlled asthma can be expected to be no different from the outcome of a woman without asthma. The emphasis is on the concept of well-controlled asthma. The goals of asthma treatment in pregnancy parallel those of asthma treatment in general. Compliance with prescribed medication is emphasized along with peak flow (PEF) monitoring. Avoidance of known asthma triggers is encouraged as much as possible. Influenza vaccination is recommended for women who have no contraindication to the vaccine， and who will be in their third trimester of pregnancy during the fall and winter influenza season. Influenza vaccination is safe in preg-nancy. The vaccine should not be administered if the patient is allergic to eggs or is allergic to any of the con-stituents of the vaccine.\n【save__datas】\t【1412】\tTable 32 Asthma and Pregnancy： Key Points\n【save__datas】\t【1413】\tIn pregnancy， about one third of asthmatic women experience a worsening of their asthma and an increased medication requirement， another third have no significant change in their asthma， and one third have asthma that is less symptomatic or improved.

If you do smoke， pregnancy is an ideal time to quit， for the health of the developing baby， for your health， and for your child's future well-being. Smoking can precipitate an asth-matic exacerbation in the mother， and smokers' babies tend to be small， with low birth weights. Infants are--connect--【1430】three times more likely to die of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) if their mother smoked during or after pregnancy. There is strong evidence that the chil-dren of women who smoked during pregnancy face increased risk for poor lung health as they grow up. Children raised in homes with smokers experience morechildhood respiratory illnesses， andare at increased risk for the development of asthma. As adults， they even carry an increased risk of certain types of lung cancer—as do the parents who are the“active”smokers. A child raised in a home with smoking parents is much more likely to become a smoker， as compared to chil-dren raised in homes where adults do not smoke.\n【save__datas】\t【1431】\t86\\.

Your asthma diagnosis does， however， place your son or daughter at higher statistical risk of inheriting asthma as compared to a child born to parents with no per-sonal history of asthma. There are no specific measures you can undertake while pregnant to guarantee that your baby will never develop asthma. The most impor-tant steps for you to take while pregnant involve taking excellent care of yourself and making sure that your asthma is well controlled， and， hopefully， completely asymptomatic. Studies have shown a link between a mother's lung function and healthier babies at birth.

Are asthma medications barmful to--connect--【1438】the unborn child?\n【save__datas】\t【1439】\tMany studies have been carried out all over the world to help doctors decide which asthma medicines are “safest”in pregnancy. The single biggest risk to an asthmatic woman's pregnancy is poor asthma control in the mother. Uncontrolled asthma is very harmful to the developing baby and can result in devastating complications for both mother and child. Complications of poor asthma control include pregnancy-induced hypertension， pre-eclampsia and eclampsia in the mother， preterm labor and prema-ture birth， intrauterine growth retardation， and low birth weight babies， along with increased perinatal morbidity and mortality. Inadequate control of the mother's asthma leads to a reduced oxygen supply to the developing baby(\"maternal hypoxia\")， as well as a decreased blood supply to the womb. All pulmonary specialists agree that they should treat their pregnant asthma patients with asthma medicines that are not only highly effective， but also as safe as possible for both mother and baby.\n【save__datas】\t【1440】\tThe FDA classifies all medicines approved since 1980into one of five different categories. The FDA classifi-cation is based on studies of safety in pregnancy. The five categories are referred to as category A， B， C，D， and X (Table 33). Category A is considered the very safest， while category X drugs are absolutely con-traindicated under any circumstances. There are no asthma medicines classified as category A.

All short-acting B2 agonist“rescue\"inhaled bronchodilator med-ications， for example， are classified as category C， even though they have been in use for over two decades， and are widely viewed as very safe by the medical pro-fession. They have not been shown to have adverse effects on the course of the pregnancy， and have not been shown to be harmful to the human fetus. All long acting B2 agonist inhaled bronchodilators are also cate-gory C medicines. The “C”classification for the p agonist group of inhalers reflects the absence of studies in pregnant women. One inhaled corticosteroid prepa-ration， Pulmicort@ (budesonide)， is category B； all other inhaled steroids are， as of this writing， labeled category C. The long-term inhaled “controller”medi-cines Intal@(cromolyn) and Tilade@ (nedocromil) are category B， as are the leukotriene modifier tablets Sin-gulair (montelukast sodium) and Acolade@ (zafir-lukast). The new IgE blocker Xolair@ (omalizumab) carries a category B rating. The theophylline medi-cines are all category C drugs.\n【save__datas】\t【1452】\tBecause both uncontrolled asthma andpoorly con-trolled asthma in the mother have such serious conse-quences for her and her unborn child， the guiding principle for the treatment of asthma in pregnancy is to achieve optimal asthma control even if daily med-ication is required. It is crucial to normalize maternal lung function and ensure that the mother is not expe-riencing any symptoms of asthma. Pulmonologists take the point of view that any medicine that is required for optimal asthma treatment should be administered to a pregnant woman.For example， steroid bursts are used in the setting of pregnancy just as they are when a woman is not pregnant. As a rule of thumb， we would use category B medicines first，--connect--【1453】adding any required medicines that may fall into the C category (or even D)， if needed to achieve good asthma control. If you are pregnant and have any ques-tions or any concerns about the safety of the medicines you have been prescribed， you should consult with your treating physicians. Both your obstetrician and your asthma doctor have the expertise to counsel you and give advice that is best for you. Under no circum-stances should you stop your prescribed asthma regi-men or not follow the treatment plans recommended by your doctor.\n【save__datas】\t【1454】\t88\\. Will Ibe able to breast-feed my baby--connect--【1455】ifIm taking medicine for my asthma?\n【save__datas】\t【1456】\tYes， you will certainly be able to breast-feed if you so wish. Asthma medicine， especially that administered in inhaled form， is not a contraindication to nursing your infant. Breast-feeding has many widely known advan-tages for both mother and child， and may even have beneficial effects in delaying or altogether avoiding the development of asthma in young children. In fact， a recent study in Australia involving over 2，000 children found that infants who were “exclusively breast-fed，”that is， who received only mother’s milk for at least the first 4 months of life， had a significantly reduced risk of developing asthma by the age of 6. Breast-feeding also appears to delay the development of allergy in children. Studies indicate that breast-fed children known to be at increased risk for the development of allergy (because of a family history) develop allergies at an older age as compared to children with similar risk factors who are not exclusively breast-fed. Of course， you should seek guidance from your baby's pediatrician if you are taking any over-the-counter or prescription medicines while you are breast-feeding.\n【save__datas】\t【1458】\tSpecial Topic：Astboma aand\n【len<10_filter】\t【1459】\tChilaren\n【save__datas】\t【1460】\tWill my child outgrow his or her asthma?\n【save__datas】\t【1461】\tShould I take my young child to a physician who specializes in asthma?\n【save__datas】\t【1462】\tHow can I make sure that my child's school staff can deal with his or her asthma?

Can I catch asthma from my child?\n【save__datas】\t【1466】\tAsthma is not an infectious condition. It cannot be transmitted from person to person， nor can it spread between people. That said， it has been noted for many years that the tendency to develop asthma tends to run in families. There is an inherited com-ponent to the development of asthma and allergy. If one parent has asthma or certain allergies， a child has a greater chance of developing asthma and/or allergies than does a child of unaffected parents. The chance of a child developing asthma increases fur-ther when both parents have asthma. The inheri-tance of asthma is poorly understood and is far from“the whole story.\" Current thinking also attributes a large role to environmental factors in the develop-ment of asthma.\n【save__datas】\t【1467】\t90\\. Do more boys than girls baue asthma?\n【save__datas】\t【1468】\tYes， but only as children. In young children， boys are almost twice as likely as girls to develop asthma. Inter-estingly， the pattern is reversed when looking at asthma in older age groups. An article published in the medical iournal Cbest in October 2003 found that 62% of chil-dren with asthma (asthma patients younger than 18years of age) were male， while 68% of the adult patients with asthma were female. In studies of severe asthma. the preponderance of boys is notable as well： 2 of 3 chil-dren with severe asthma are boys. But， among adults with severe asthma， women account for two thirds of those affected. The gender-based differences are not understood. Theories suggest the influence of female hormones， as well as the difference in size between male and female lungs as they grow into adulthood.\n【save__datas】\t【1469】\t91\\.

Repeated bouts of cough and wheezing in school-age children—boys as well as girls-are almost always due to asthma. Chil-dren may catch many colds each year， especially when school is in session. Asthma is often underdiagnosed， especially in children， so it is important to distinguish between repeated infections such as bronchitis or pneumonia， and asthma. Don’t assume that your child is experiencing a \"bad winter\" if she seems to suffer from multiple chest colds. It may be that she has asthma. If so， make sure you get appropriate medical care， establish the correct diagnosis， and allow your daughter to receive asthma treatment if required.\n【save__datas】\t【1472】\t92\\. Do milk products cause increased--connect--【1473】mucus in asthmatics， especially in children?\n【save__datas】\t【1474】\tMilk is not a cause of increased mucus production， nor is it considered to be an asthma trigger (Table 34). Consumption of milk has no effect on lung capacity， either deleterious or beneficial. It is a myth that milk is somehow harmful to children with asthma. Milk can， however， be an allergen in sensitized children. Cow's milk allergy is a true food allergy and is due to an allergy to the protein constituents of the milk. Like many food allergies， milk allergy usually manifests as gastrointestinal symptoms， or as a skin reaction such as hives or eczema， but not as increased mucus. If you suspect that milk does not agree with your child， bring it to your physician's attention. Do not automatically eliminate milk and milk products from the child’s diet out medical consultation andadvice.

Luckily， rather than blindly eliminate milk and dairy products from the toddler's diet， the parents sought a professional opinion. The child saw a pediatric allergist and repeated her story. The doctor casually asked if chocolate milk tasted good. The child insisted that chocolate milk was“good”but that the white milk made her“sick.”Need-less to say， allergy testing was performed. The results showed that the child was not allergic to milk， nor was she allergic to chocolate. She was， in her own special way， trying to convince her mother to substitute chocolate milk for “the usual.\" Lacking the sophistica-tion to explain herself， she instead tried to convince her parents in her own way that milk was \"no good!”\n【save__datas】\t【1485】\tGrowing children need calcium in their diets to pro-mote bone health and proper development. In addition--connect--【1486】to calcium， dairy products are asignificant dietary source of protein， riboflavin， and Vitamins A and B12. You should consider having your child evaluated for possible milk allergy if you have any concerns about milk and dairy products affecting their asthma.

Your physician will assist you in modifying your child’s diet without compromising his or her nutritional status.\n【save__datas】\t【1487】\t93\\.

Some pediatricians will not even use the term “asthma”until a child is 2 years of age or older. Wheezing in infancy is never normal. It can， however， be divided into two general patterns： non-allergic wheezing and allergic wheezing (Table 35). In the first instance， wheezing occurs when the infant\n【save__datas】\t【1491】\tTable 35 Patterns of Wheezing in Infants\n【save__datas】\t【1492】\tNon-Allergic Wheezing\n【save__datas】\t【1493】\t·Wheezing when sick with viral upper respiratory tract infection\n【save__datas】\t【1494】\t· Allergies not present\n【save__datas】\t【1495】\t·Wheezing disappears as the baby grows in the pre-school years\n【save__datas】\t【1496】\t·The wheezing seen in infancy is not a harbinger of asthma\n【save__datas】\t【1497】\tAllergic Wheezing\n【save__datas】\t【1498】\t·Wheezing when sick with viral upper respiratory tract infection\n【save__datas】\t【1499】\t· Allergies such as eczema， food allergy， or rhinitis are also present\n【save__datas】\t【1500】\t春Wheezing with viral upper respiratory infections persists as the child grows\n【save__datas】\t【1501】\t·The wheezing in infancy is a form of asthmatic response--connect--【1502】becomes ill with an acute upper respiratory viral infec-tion. The infant’s airways grow larger in the preschool years， and the wheezing disappears as the toddler grows. In non-allergic wheezing， symptoms seen in infancy do not recur with subsequent upper respiratory viral infections. The “wheezy chest”is not an early manifestation of asthma.\n【save__datas】\t【1503】\tInfants who exhibit the second， allergic， pattern also wheeze when infected with an acute upper respiratory virus. But because they fall into the allergic wheezing category， they are more likely to have “real” asthma that continues throughout childhood. They are also more likely to have diagnosed allergies such as rhinitis， eczema， or food allergies. Their airways will also grow larger as they become toddlers， but the wheezing per-sists. They have asthma， not a narrowed，“immature\"airway as a cause of wheezing in infancy during upper respiratory viral infections.\n【save__datas】\t【1504】\t94\\. Should I take my young child to a--connect--【1505】physician who specializes in asthma?\n【save__datas】\t【1506】\tGemmas comment：\n【save__datas】\t【1507】\tYes! The focused attention of both physician and patient is--connect--【1508】all-important. During ber early years， my daughter's aller-gies and asthma symptoms were repeatedly overlooked by--connect--【1509】the busy pediatricians who saw ber only for a few over-booked minutes in a crowded office full ofcrying babies and--connect--【1510】frazzled moms.\n【save__datas】\t【1511】\tYou should take your child to an asthma specialist if your child’s asthma is active for most days， if there are frequent night-time asthma symptoms that interfere--connect--【1512】with sleep and rest， if your child is absent from school because of asthma symptoms， or if your child requires hospital emergency room visits for asthma. You should also consider seeking a consultation with an asthma expert if you or your child believe that asthma symp-toms are not controllable， or if you do not understand how to take care of those symptoms. You might seek consultation from a pediatric pulmonologist or from a pediatric allergist. After your child has undergone the appropriate evaluation， you and the specialist can decide whether the child requires continuing ongoing care from an asthma specialist or if your pediatrician can resume caring for your child’s asthma.\n【save__datas】\t【1513】\tThe most recent 2002 update of the NAEPP's Expert Panel Report addresses the question of when infants and children 5 years of age or younger should be referred to an asthma specialist. Consultation with an asthma specialist is recommended for all young children with moderate or severe persistent asthma. Similarly， referral to an asthma specialist should be considered for infants and young children with mild persistent asthma.\n【save__datas】\t【1514】\t95\\. Will my child outgrow bis or ber--connect--【1515】astbma?\n【save__datas】\t【1516】\tYes， and no. Yes-because symptoms and the require-ment for medication seem to disappear during adoles-cencein some children who have mild asthma. No—because research indicates that asthma is lifelong and is never truly outgrown. A child with physician-diagnosed asthma is viewed as having a lifelong condi-tion. The state of baseline hyperreactivity (discussed in Question 12) that defines asthma never disappears.\n【save__datas】\t【1517】\tThat said， it has long been observed that many chil-dren appear to “grow out”of their asthma. Contempo-rary medical thinking views the phenomenon of SLI“disappearing”asthma as a state of prolonged asthma remission. Typically， adults in their late 20s or 30s who develops asthmatic symptoms will recall having had mild asthma as a child and are surprised that they con-tinue to have asthma in adulthood.\n【save__datas】\t【1518】\t96\\. Should my child be excused from--connect--【1519】pbysical education classes since bes been--connect--【1520】diagnosed with asthma?\n【save__datas】\t【1521】\tNo， absolutely not. Your child’s asthma should be brought under good control， and then he should be encouraged to participate fully in all aspects of school life， includingfitness andsports. A diagnosis of asthma should never automatically lead to curtailed physical activity. Participation in physical education and in team sports is an important component of the healthy lifestyle advocated for all persons with asthma. Having your child excused from physical education class not only robs him of the benefits associated with exercise， but also stigmatizes him， and sends the mes-sage that asthma is a physical impairment rather than a lung disease.\n【save__datas】\t【1522】\t97\\. Should my child use a peak-flow--connect--【1523】meter?\n【save__datas】\t【1524】\tA peak-flow meter is a tool that you and your child can use to help assess the degree of asthma control at any given time. Even though some might erroneously view self-monitoring as a“bother\"or a “nuisance，\" it should be neither. Regular home peak-flow monitoring has--connect--【1525】been shown to improve a child's asthma control， reduce exacerbations， and decrease school absences. Using a peak-flow monitor may also increase your child's confi-dence as it will help him or her learn how to optimize asthma control and achieve greater mastery over his or her asthma. Most children can accurately measure their peak flow under adult guidance starting at about 6 years of age. Measurement of peak flow is an assessment of lung function， more precisely， of airflow through larger airways (discussed in Question 28). Peak-flow monitor-ing also allows for objective decisions about modifying your child’s asthma regimen if appropriate， based on information contained in the written asthma action plan your physician has provided.\n【save__datas】\t【1526】\tWhen your child is given a prescription for home peak-flow monitoring， you will be asked to determine his or her “personal best\" value based onmeasurements obtained when your child feels well and is symptom-free. An asthma action plan provides instructions on what asthma medication to take as the peak-flow value falls into one of three zones labeled “green，\"“yellow，”or“red.\" The green zone includes peak-flow measure-ments in the range of 80% to 100% of a child's personal best. Yellow corresponds to peak-flow measurements in the range of 60% to 80% of the personal best value. The red zone includes all peak flow values below 60% of a child's personal best. Peak-flow measurements in the red zone indicate that the child's asthma is poorly con-trolled， and that you will need to either contact your physician， proceed to the emergency room， or both. So， if your 10-year-old child with asthma is scheduled to play in a soccer match on Saturday morning and he wakes up feeling apprehensive about the important game， how will a peak-flow measurement be of help?\n【save__datas】\t【1527】\tSuppose you obtain three peak-flow measurements and see that all three values are well into the green zone. These， in fact， approximate the “personal best.” You know that your child’s asthma continues to be well-controlled， and that your young athlete can continue his or her asthma regimen without modification. Pre-game jitters are one thing， and loss of asthma control is another. The reassuring peak-flow valueslet you address the former without raising your concern about asthma.\n【save__datas】\t【1528】\t98\\.

If your child is allergic to the family pet， and especially if the pet allergy is a trigger for your child's asthma， it is in your child's medical best interest for you to relocate the animal. A fundamental princi-ple of allergy control is known as allergen avoidance. After an individual has been diagnosed with a clinical allergy to a specific allergen， the goal of allergen avoid-ance is the elimination of any and all exposures to that specific allergen. Allergen avoidance， if successful， is a--connect--【1539】highly effective measure in allergy treatment. Some allergens， such as dust mites or molds， are so ubiqui-tous that it can be nearly impossible to completely remove them from the home environment. Others， such as pet dander， are far easier to address. If you remove the family pet from your home， and you are then able to rid your home of any pet allergen left behind， your child will likely have a significant lessen-ing in allergy and asthmasymptoms，aswellas decreased medication requirements.\n【save__datas】\t【1540】\tIf you are not willing to relocate your pet for the health benefits it will provide your child， then you should at minimum reduce the child’s exposure to pet allergen. You should make sure that the allergic child’s bedroom remains off limits to the pet and that the bedroom is kept as allergen-free as possible. An allergist can provide you with specific recommendations depending on what type of pet you have and the layout of your home.\n【save__datas】\t【1541】\t99\\. How can I make sure that my childs--connect--【1542】school staffcan cope with bis or ber--connect--【1543】asthma? What about summer camp staff?\n【save__datas】\t【1544】\tThe best way to make sure that your child’s school or camp is in a position to cope with your child's asthma is to teach your child about asthma and to establish good communication with the school：and camp administration. Even though asthma is a very common condition throughout childhood and adolescence， it is still a good idea to make sure that school and camp staff know that your child carries aa diagnosis of asthma. Several measures are helpful to ensure that vour child's asthma remains well-controlled at school or camp. Familiarize yourself with the school or camp--connect--【1545】policy (if any) regarding asthma in general， and inhaler use in particular. For example， some schools allow a student to carry a “rescue\"inhaler at all times； others require that it be left in the school nurse's office. Dis-cuss any concerns you may have with your child’s doc-tor in advance of the start of camp or school. A good time might be when the physician fills out the required pre-enrollment health forms. Make sure your child knows how to measure peak flow and is aware of his or her asthma action plan. The school and camp should be given a written copy of the plan， as well as a copy of your child's medication list. Make sure that your child learns when to use the “rescue\"inhaler and how to use the MDI with a spacer. Finally， there are a number of useful， patient-centered asthma Web sites that you can review for additional pointers.\n【save__datas】\t【1546】\t100\\. Will my smoking cigarettes affect--connect--【1547】my child who bas just been diagnosed--connect--【1548】with astbma?\n【save__datas】\t【1549】\tYes， your smoking will affect your child with newly diagnosed asthma. Your child will be affected in many different ways. Every child today knows that “smoking is bad for you.\"Some are aware of the links between cig-arette smoking and lung diseases such as emphysema. Others know about smoking and lung cancer， as well as the fact that cigarette smoking causes heart disease and stroke. Your smoking adversely affects your health and decreases your life expectancy； both factors certainly impact your children. Children of parents who smoke are more likely to become smokers in adolescence and beyond. Your smoking provides a bad model for your child who is much more likely to do as you do rather--connect--【1550】than do as you say. Children raised in a home with smokers have an increased risk of developing asthma.\n【save__datas】\t【1551】\tYour child has just been diagnosed with asthma. Look at it from your son or daughter’s perspective. Until the diagnosis was made and medicine prescribed， he or she was experiencing asthma symptoms. To get an idea of what that might be like， try a simple experiment. Get a very narrow straw or plastic coffee stirrer and place it in your mouth. Breathe through the narrow straw (or plas-tic coffee stirrer) by pinching your nostrils together. Then， march briskly in place. You will become aware of a very uncomfortable sensation of breathing， and it will take a great deal of effort to keep marching in place. The breathing experiment you have just performed approxi-mates how it might feel to breathe through constricted breathing passages. Your child has been feeling poorly， has undergone a medical evaluation， and now has to take medicine and adapt to his or her new diagnosis. Depending on the child and his or her age， as well as the severity of the asthma， the entire family is entering a period of change and adaptation. As a parent， you may be experiencing increased stress. If you are a smoker， you may crave cigarettes more intensely than usual. Ciga-rette smoking is a universal asthma trigger. Your contin-ued smoking will contribute to increased symptoms in your child， along with an increased medication require-ment. My advice： Seriously consider smoking cessation， both for your health and that of your children.\n【save__datas】\t【1553】\tHere is a selective listing of publications， resources， and references for further information about asthma.\n【save__datas】\t【1555】\tAsthma resources include books， pamphlets， and educational materials as well as web sites and， of course， your physician.

The body’s arteries carry (O) oxygen-rich and carbon dioxide(CO)-poor blood to our organs and tissues. An ABG tests a sample of blood taken directly from an artery. The measured values of O2 and COz in the ABG sample let a doctor know how well the lungs are functioning in getting the O， into the body， and the CO， out. The ABG assesses how much O， and CO， are in the arterial system， a reflection of the efficiency and function of the respiratory system.\n【save__datas】\t【1664】\tAcute：Short-lived， brief， sudden， not drawn out. Chronic is the oppo-site ofacute. Avirussuchas influenza will cause an acute illness that may last a few weeks. Asthma is an example of a non-acute or chronic condition. Although its symptoms may recede， asthma lasts indefinitely.\n【save__datas】\t【1665】\tAgonist： A medicine or drug that exerts its actions by combining with specific sites (called receptors) in the--connect--【1666】body. Albuterol， for example， attaches to the lungs’Breceptors. By attaching to the Breceptors， albuterol exerts its bronchodilatory effects， anddccauses narrowed bronchial passages to dilate or “open up.\" Stimulation of the lung B receptors leads to rapid relief of wheezing， tightness， and bronchocon-striction. Medicines such as albuterol are called p (beta) agonists since they“fit”the B2 receptor， and exert their effects through activation of the recep-tor sites.\n【save__datas】\t【1667】\tAllergen： An agent that is able to produce--connect--【1668】an--connect--【1669】abnormal(allergic) response in a susceptible individual when that person becomes exposed to the agent. An allergen is usually a protein， and can be of various origins. Foods， drugsS，，and chemicals， for example， can act as allergens in cer-tain persons. So can substances of plant or animal origin. Examples of allergens include peanut， penicillin， ragweed， and cat dander. The key--connect--【1670】concept is that allergens are not uni-versal. In other words， an allergen leads to an allergic response only in susceptible persons. Allergens--connect--【1671】are--connect--【1672】also asthma triggers for persons with asthma and allergy.\n【save__datas】\t【1673】\tAllergenic： Capable of causing--connect--【1674】an--connect--【1675】abnormal (allergic) response in a sus-ceptible (“allergic\") individual. Some substances are considered to be more allergenic than others， meaning that those substances are know to more frequently lead to allergy symptoms in general. Pediatricians， for example， know which foods are more inherently allergenic that others， and so generally advise introducing them later in a child’s diet， and only very gradually at first.Tree nuts， fish， and eggs are more allergenic in very young children than other foods such as rice， banana， beef， or green beans， and are added to the “menu\"only as a child grows older.\n【save__datas】\t【1676】\tAllergic rhinitis： A manifestation of allergy expressed as nasal symptoms with itching， runny nose and conges-tion. When due to seasonal airborne allergens， allergic rhinitisisSsome-times referred to as “hay fever”or“rose fever.” See also the glossary entry for“Rhinitis.”\n【save__datas】\t【1677】\tAllergist： A physician specialized in the diagnosis and treatment of per-sons with allergies. Many practicing allergists in the U.S. have special training first in pediatrics， followed by additional qualifications in allergy. Although they treat patients in all age groups， pediatric allergists have a--connect--【1678】particular interest and expertise in allergies in children. Since many (if not most) allergies are first diagnosed in childhood， it makes sense to have the “extra” dual medical background.\n【save__datas】\t【1679】\tAllergy： The body’s physical reaction to certain external substances known as allergens. Allergens are harmless to other non-allergic persons. Allergy involves the body’s production of a specific antibody in direct response to a specific allergen. The result of the allergy-antibody interaction includes inflammatory and immune changes. Those changes， in turn， lead to symp-toms that may affect the eyes (“aller-gic conjunctivitis\")， nose (“allergic rhinitis\")， sinuses (“allergic sinusitis\")， skin (“eczema， hives， atopic dermati-tis\")， and lungs (“asthma triggers”or“allergic asthma\").\n【save__datas】\t【1680】\tAllopath：TThe term， asused cur-rently， refers to a physician graduate of an allopathic medical school. The majority of medical schools in the U.S. are allopathic， and confer the M.D. degree. The original meaning of allopath is that of a physician trained in (or who practices) allopa-thy. Allopathy historically involved treating diseases with remedies that produced effects different from those produced by the disease itself.\n【save__datas】\t【1681】\tAlveolar-capillary membrane：：The alveolar-capillary membrane11sSthe interface between the alveolar wall and the blood circulation. It permitsrapid， nearly instanta14neous exchange of oxygen， carbon dioxide， and other--connect--【1682】gases between the air-filled alveoli. and the body's blood circulation run-ning through the capillary blood vessels. The alveolar-capillary mem-brane is destroyed in diseases such as emphysema， but iisunaffectedby well-controlled asthma.\n【save__datas】\t【1683】\tAlveolus (pl. alveoli)： An alveolus is a lung’s air sac. Oxygen is exchanged for carbon dioxide in the lung alveoli. A dense network of capillary vessels urrounds each alveolus.The close arrangement allows for very rapid exchange (or“diffusion\") of oxygen from alveolus to capillary， and of car-bon dioxide from capillary to alveolus. A healthy adult human lung contains approximately 300 million alveoli. The average diameter of a human alveolus is one quarter of a millimeter. The total alveolar surface available for gasexchange in ahealthy adult approximates 100 meters， which is about the size of a tennis court.\n【save__datas】\t【1684】\tAnaphylaxis： The most severe form of an allergic reaction or response. If untreated， anaphylaxis can be fatal. The term “anaphylactic shock”is sometimes used to describe the most dramatic and serious form of anaphy-laxis. Anaphylaxis usually involves sev-eral organ ssystems， includirg the cardiovascular system， the skin， the respiratory system， and the gastroin-testinal tract. Symptoms includeea dangerous drop in bblood pressu(hypotension)， hives (urticaria) with itching and rash， respiratory distress and wheezing， throat tightness， nau---connect--【1685】sea， vomiting， and abdominal pain. Immediate emergency treatment1s imperative. Persons at risk for the development of anaphylaxis， such as persons known to have had a prior sig-nificant allergic reaction to peanut or bee stings for example， should always have injectable epinephrine on hand. If an1anaphylactic reaction were to occur， prompt injection of epinephrine under the skin is literally life saving.\n【save__datas】\t【1686】\tAntibody： A protein molecule pro-duced in blood or in tissues in direct response to a foreign substance or antigen. A specific antigen leadsStO the production of a corresponding specific antibody. The production of antibody can be beneficial or deleteri-ous， depending on the circumstances. Antibody made in response to--connect--【1687】an--connect--【1688】infectious agent， measles， for exam-ple， wilIl protect--connect--【1690】against--connect--【1692】aseconc measles infection or--connect--【1694】recurrence. Antibody made in response to com-mon environmental agents such as pollens， grasses， mold， and animal dander may lead to the development of allergy. Only susceptible persons(allergic or atopic individualss)) 卫will actuallyproduce antibodyagainst common allergens. The presence of antibody in response to a particular antigen is referred to asS“sensitiza-tion”to that particular antigen. When such a person goes on to develop an allergy to that allergen， the antibody is usually of the lgE class.\n【save__datas】\t【1695】\tArterial： Related to oneeOrrmore arteries. The body’s arterial circula---connect--【1696】tion leaves the heart via a major artery named the aorta. The arterial circulation provides the body，its organs， and tissues with (O2) oxygen-rich blood. The arterial system com-plements the venous circulation.\n【save__datas】\t【1697】\tAspirin： Originally， Bayer's trademark for acetylsalicylic acid， a medicine with anti-inflammatory properties. Rather than refer to the Bayer brand， aspirin--connect--【1698】now--connect--【1699】refersto any preparation of acetylsalicylic acid. Aspirin has anal-gesic and antipyretic properties； it is prescribed to relieve pain and fever. Because itsanti-inflammatory actions， it is also used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis， as well as in the treatment of many forms of heart dis-ease. Its use is contraindicated in anv person with aspirin-sensitive asthma.\n【save__datas】\t【1700】\tAsthma： Originally derived from the phrase： “difficult breathing.”Asthma1Sa chronic respiratory condition characterized by breathing symptoms of varying intensity and frequency. Asthma has a strong genetic (inher-ited) basis， although environmental influences play an important role as well. Asthma frequently goes hand-in-hand with allergy， especially in younger age groups.\n【save__datas】\t【1701】\tAsymptomatic： Without any mani-festations or symptoms of disease or illness.The major goal of asthma treatment is to achieve an asympto-matic state so that the person with asthma experiences nosymptoms whatsoever， and is able to lead a full and productive life.\n【save__datas】\t【1702】\tAtopy： An inherited predisposition to the development of allergic condi-tions such as hay fever， eczema， aller-gic rhinitis， and even certain forms of asthma. A person with evidence of atopy is said to be “atopic.”\n【save__datas】\t【1703】\tAuscultation： The process of listen-ing to the chest through a stethoscope.\n【save__datas】\t【1704】\tBaseline hyper-reactivity： Baseline hyper-reactivity (BHR) is a key char-acteristic of asthma. BHR refers to asthmatic lungs’ innate tendency to react to certain stimuli with\n【save__datas】\t【1705】\t2an--connect--【1706】inflammatory response， that in turn leads to typical asthma symptoms， including： breathlessness， chest tight-ness， breathing discomfort， cough， and wheezing. Asthma and a state of increased baseline hyper-reactivity go hand-in-hand. BHR can be concep-tualized--connect--【1707】as--connect--【1708】theasthmatic lungs greater “sensitivity” to inhaled sub-stances that would produce no effect in a healthy person without asthma. A person with asthma， for example， might start to experience uncomfort-able breathing when entering a room where people are smoking cigarettes， or when running outdoors to catch a bus in subzero temperatures.Their friends， who are accompanying them to the party， or sprinting alongside to catch the bus， have no respiratory discomfort in the same situations. Physicians can assess BHR， in part， with a special pulmonary function test： the methacholine challenge (or“bronchoprovocation\") test. Scientists andphysicianshope that future research into BHR might yield treat-ments that would modify or lessen--connect--【1709】the increased BHR that is character-istic of asthma.\n【save__datas】\t【1710】\tBMI： An abbreviation for： “bodv mass index.\"The BMI is a mathe-matical formula based on height and weight. BMI is a tool used in population studies ofobesity because of its ease of measurement. The BMI in most individuals corre-lates to measures of body fat. To calculate your BMI， you can use either metric or conventional Amer-ican units. You need to know your weight measured in kilograms or in pounds， and your height measured in meters or inches. Then use one of the formulae below：\n【[*]_filter】\t【1711】\t\\*\\*BMI = weight in kkilograms\n【[*]_filter】\t【1713】\t(height in meters × height in meters)\\*\\*BMI = (weight in pounds + height in inches + height in inches) × 703.\n【save__datas】\t【1714】\tObesity can be defined based on a person's BMI. An adult with a BMI of between 25-30 is considered over-weight， and an adult with a BMI of30 or greater meetsScriteria for a diagnosis of obesity. Note that BMI1sS used differently in children and adolescents.The interpretation of BMI values in children and adoles-cents requires an adjustment for age.\n【save__datas】\t【1715】\tBronchiectasis： A lung disease that causes abnormal， permanent dilata-tion of the small bronchiolar air tubes and passages that lead to the lung alveoli. Bronchiectasis causes a wide spectrum of disease. In its mildest form， bronchiectasis can be inappar-ent， asymptomatic， and silent.

Bronchi-olitis can be secondary to an infection(“infectious bronchiolitis\")， or from a non-infectious cause such as cigarette smoking (“smoker’s bronchiolitis\").\n【save__datas】\t【1719】\tBronchitis： An inflammation of the lining of the larger bronchial tubes. Bronchitis can be acute， afrom infection， or chronic， as in the case of tobacco abuse. Chronic obstruc-tive bronchitis is the correct Ameri-can termfor the cigarette-related type of COPD that demonstrates obstructive dysfunction onPFTs， and that causes symptoms of cough， mucus production， breathlessness， and episodes of wheezing.\n【save__datas】\t【1720】\tBronchoconstriction： An abnormal narrowing of the air passages. Bronchoconstriction is a prominent characteristic of asthma， and is due to an increased inflammatory response in the lung.\n【save__datas】\t【1721】\tBronchodilatation： A widening or“opening up”of the lung air passages； the reverse of bronchoconstriction. Bronchodilator medicinesimprove breathing and relieve asthma symp-toms by “opening\"and restoring the caliber of abnormally narrowed (con-stricted) bronchi.\n【save__datas】\t【1722】\tBroncoprovocation test： A special-ized pulmonary functiontestthat correlates with baseline hyper-reac-tivity (BHR) and that can be helpful in the diagnostic evaluation of sus-pected asthma. Both methacholine challenge testing and cold-air exer-cise challenge are examples of bron-choprovocation tests.\n【save__datas】\t【1723】\tBronchoscopy： A procedurethat allows a lung specialist to visually inspect the lungs’ breathing passages(bronchi)， and to obtain specimens or biopsies of any abnormalities. Bron-choscopy can also be used for thera-peutic purposes， to remove mucus accumulation or inhaled foreign bod-ies， or to place stents in the airways in the case of abnormal narrowing.\n【save__datas】\t【1724】\tBronchus (pl. bronchi)： A breathing passage or tube. The trachea splits at the level of the carina into the right and left mainstem bronchi. The right mainstem bronchus leads air to and from the entire right lung. The left mainstem bronchus leads air to and from the entire left lung. The main-stem bronchi further subdivide into bronchial tubes that lead to the sub-divisionsofeachlung.Those bronchial tubes eventually branch out into smaller and narrower air pas-sages called bronchioles before end-ing in alveoli.\n【save__datas】\t【1725】\tCaffeine：Anaturally occurring compound found in coffee and tea， and added to other beverages such as soda or “energy\" drinks.

The symptoms of “cardiac asthma”are reminiscent of those experienced by persons during an asthma exacer-bation， but the symptoms are not due to asthma. In cardiac asthma， breath-lessness， cough， and wheezing occur because of heart disease combined with a state of fluid retention， not because of a lung condition. As such， the term “cardiac asthma”is a mis-nomer of sorts.\n【save__datas】\t【1736】\tCarina： The “split\" where the lungs’trachea divides into two branches：the right mainstem bronchus and the left mainstembronchus. Each bronchus leads air to the right and left lung respectively.\n【save__datas】\t【1737】\tChlorofluorocarbons： Chlorofluoro-carbons (CFCs) are chemical propel-lants previously used in the manufacture of metered dose inhalers. The manufacture and use of CFCs are now banned. A time-lim-ited exception has been granted for certain inhalers until an equivalent replacement formulation is in pro-duction and available to patients.\n【save__datas】\t【1738】\tChromosome： Cellular microscopic structures that contain groupings of DNA. Chromosomes carry genetic information， or genes， in their DNA. All human cells (except for a female’s mature ova and a male’s sperm cells) contain in their center， or nucleus， a total of 46 chromosomes， divided in23 pairs. An individual's 46 chromo-somes constitute their genome.

During respiration， Oz (a gas) in the alveolus diffuses into cap-illary blood (a liquid) in the lung， while CO， (another gas) diffuses out of the capillary blood into the alveo-lus. Diffusion of O2 and of CO2occurs extremely rapidly across tthe alveolar-capillary\n【save__datas】\t【1753】\tVmembrane--connect--【1754】in healthy lungs. Several disease states caninterfere withthe diffusing capacity of the lung. Emphysema， for example， destroys normal lung. As diffusion becomes more and more impaired， emphysematous lungs can no longer supply enough O， for the body's needs. Supplemental (extra) oxygen is sometimes required in the treatment of advanced emphysema， and is administered continuously via tubing and nasal prongs. Pulmonary function testing (PFT) includes an assessment of the lung’s diffusion capacity in a test called， appropri-ately， “diffusion.”Although diffusion can be impaired during a significant exacerbation of asthma， diffusion measured on PFTs is generally within normal or predicted values in asthma.\n【save__datas】\t【1755】\tDilatation： An opening or widening； the opposite of constriction.

Tragically， the people being hurt the most by these \"diet wars\" are not the experts， but the dieters.\n【save__datas】\t【10】\tLow carbohydrate diets such as Atkins have always been controversial， but with the recent wave of new research and publicity， the controversy is now raging hotter than ever. One headline in the San Francisco Chronicle said that the battle between the low and high carbers had become so heated since mid 2002 that \"Knives had been drawn.\n【save__datas】\t【12】\tAfter its original publication in 1972， The Atkins Diet was regurgitated in 1992 as\"Dr. Atkins New Diet Revolution，\" creating a new surge of interest in low carbohydrate dieting. Then， in July of 2002， the controversy reached an all time high when the New York Times Magazine published an essay by Gary Taubes titled， What if it's all been a big fat lie?\" The article suggested that new research was now proving the late Dr. Atkins had been right all along.\n【save__datas】\t【13】\tMore research in 2003 seemed to corroborate the Taubes story： Two studies in the New England Journal of Medicine in May of 2003， and another in June 2003 in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism， suggested that Atkins was equally， if not more effective for weight loss than conventional diets - at least in the short term.\n【save__datas】\t【14】\tWith the publication of this new information， Atkins supporters boasted， \"See， I told you so，\" while their opponents fired back in defense of their high carb， low fat positions. Meanwhile， low carb foods and supplements became all the rage， bread and pasta sales took a nosedive and the wheat industry cried the blues.\n【save__datas】\t【15】\tWith differences in opinion as opposite as the North and South Poles， it’s become unbearably confusing and frustrating to know which weight loss method is best and safest. At the date of this writing， in late 2003， obesity has reached an all time high-AGAIN! According to the Journal of the American Medical Association， 64% of Americans are overweight and 31% are obese， and it’s still getting worse.\n【save__datas】\t【16】\tObviously， the popular weight loss methods today - including the low carb diet - are still missing something...but what?\n【save__datas】\t【17】\tIf you're confused by the whole high carb， low carb thing and if you're frustrated with your attempts at trying to lose weight and keep it off， then this may be the most important report you will ever read. In the next few minutes， youll discover the real truth about low carb diets and a real solution to the problem of excess body fat that is beautiful in its simplicity， yet powerful in effectiveness. Read on to learn the10 Lies about the Atkins diet and the truth that will set you free...\n【save__datas】\t【18】\tLie #1： The Atkins and other low carb diets don't work\n【save__datas】\t【21】\tTruth is， a growing body of evidence is mounting that carbohydrate restriction can accelerate weight loss in the short term， but it has yet to be proven that it keeps the fat off in the long run.\n【save__datas】\t【19】\tIf your definition of what \"works\" is quick weight loss， then the Atkins Diet DOES work. Recent studies showed that the Atkins Diet causes greater weight loss than the American Heart Association-recommended high carb， low fat diet. In fact， for obese people with disorders of carbohydrate metabolism (hyperinsulinemia， hypoglycemia， and insulin resistance)， Atkins-style diets have been shown to work especially well.\n【save__datas】\t【20】\tHowever， if your definition of what \"works\"is permanent fat loss， then the Atkins diet doesnt fare so well... but then again neither do any other diets. It seems that despite some encouraging initial successes， Atkin’s dieters still face the same difficulties in keeping off the weight as everyone else. Some of the same studies showing rapid weight loss on Atkins in the beginning also showed substantial weight gain as soon as the diets ended.\n【save__datas】\t【22】\tWhich approach towards low carb dieting is best is also up for debate： Not all low carb diets are high fat or ketogenic and not all are \"ultra-low\" in carbs. A low carb diet can be low in carbs and high in fat， it can be low in carbs and high in protein， or it can be somewhere in the middle\n【save__datas】\t【23】\tI predict that continued research will discover that moderate carbohydrate restriction(especially in a cyclical fashion) and careful selection of carbohydrates， will in fact assist with fat loss via hormonal control， metabolic efficiency and appetite regulation. ieve that neither extreme -the severely restricted low carb diet (ketogenic diet) or the very high carb， low fat diet - will emerge the victor.\n【save__datas】\t【24】\tLie #2： There's a ton of new research proving the Atkins diet is effective\n【save__datas】\t【25】\tIf you surf around the Internet for a while searching for \"Atkins Diet，\" you are likely to see a lot of advertisements and news briefs pointing to the new research \"proving\"that Atkins is effective.\n【save__datas】\t【26】\t\"New England Journal of Medicine Vindicates Atkins diet.\"\n【lens_filter】\t【27】\t\"Studies suggest Atkins diet is safe.\"\n【save__datas】\t【28】\t\"New research challenges 30 years of Nutritional Dogma.\"\n【save__datas】\t【29】\tTruth is， these headlines are not giving you the full picture.\n【save__datas】\t【30】\tUntil and unless you have closely examined these studies and the researcher's interpretation of the results， dont be so quick to believe the diet hearsay and gossip.\n【save__datas】\t【31】\tThe general conclusion of nearly all these studies is that Atkins IS equally if not more effective for short term weight loss than conventional diets. However， nearly all the researchers also conclude with remarks such as：\n【lens_filter】\t【32】\t\"The results are very preliminary，”\n【save__datas】\t【33】\t\"The take-home message is that this diet deserves further study.\"\n【lens_filter】\t【34】\t\"More research is needed.\"\n【save__datas】\t【35】\tFurthermore， consider what the Atkin’s diet was being compared to in these studies：The traditional “food pyramid\"diet with 60-65% carbs including plenty of pasta， cereals and bread， right?\n【save__datas】\t【36】\tWhat if the traditional high carb diet is wrong too?\n【save__datas】\t【37】\tDon't write off carb restriction completely， but don't ditch all your carbs yet either...\n【save__datas】\t【38】\tLie #3： The new studies prove that the Atkins diet is healthy and doesn't raise cholesterol as previously believed\n【save__datas】\t【43】\tIn some studies， the subjects did not follow the Atkins Diet to exact specifications and never entered ketosis， so conclusions about saturated fat， dietary cholesterol， ketosis and coronary health cannot be drawn yet. In other studies， cholesterol-lowering drugs were used. And in still others， some subjects actually showed increases in total cholesterol. Those who did show improvements may have previously been on a high refined sugar， high saturated fat diet and dropping the sugar was one step in the right direction. Furthermore， some of the drop in blood cholesterol could be attributed to the decrease in body weight.\n【save__datas】\t【44】\tClearly， you cant lump all dietary fats into the same category. Processed and chemically altered trans fats have been condemned by virtually every health and nutrition expert on the planet. Other fats， like salmon and fatty fish， are among the healthiest and cardio-protective foods you can eat. Much evidence is showing that reasonable amounts of naturally occurring saturated fats such as those found in whole eggs and red meat also need not be feared (especially in the absence of sugars).\n【save__datas】\t【45】\tTruth is， all the information we have available at this time indicates the \"fat phobia\"and \"fat makes you fat\" scare has been unfounded because not all fat is the same. However， claims that diets very high in overall and saturated fat are healthy and safe for long term use are still premature.\n【save__datas】\t【46】\tLie #4： The Atkins diet will help you keep fat off for good\n【save__datas】\t【47】\tDr. Atkins writes that his diet \"Is so perfectly adapted to use as a lifetime diet that， mah unlike most diets， the weight wont come back.\n【save__datas】\t【49】\tIt's a weight loss axiom that the more extreme a diet and the faster the weight loss， the more difficult it usually is to maintain the results. Slow， steady and balanced seems to win the race when it comes to weight control.\n【save__datas】\t【50】\tUnfortunately this isn't what most people want to hear. The four pounds per week and up to 15 pounds in the first two weeks that Atkins promises sounds much more impressive.\n【save__datas】\t【51】\tThere are two things you really need to know about rapid weight loss：\n【save__datas】\t【52】\t(1) What kind of weight was lost? How much of it was body fat and how much was Alaar water， glycogen and lean tissue?\n【save__datas】\t【53】\t(2) Are you going to you keep the weight off for good?\n【save__datas】\t【54】\tMost low carbers wont keep the weight off for more than a year， and many will fall off the wagon long before that.\n【save__datas】\t【55】\tKeith Ayoob， a spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association， said in an official ADA statement about the 2003 NEJM studies： \"Twelve months is an equalizer； you hit a wall. Your lifestyle starts to be affected and you get bored. A high dropout rate is a sign that extreme diets can be difficult to maintain.\n【save__datas】\t【56】\tTruth is， despite Dr. Atkin's claims and the new research apparently supporting them， we still dont know what will happen in the long run. Based on the results of the recent three， six， and twelve month studies，researchers have begun to organize longer trials. One of them will be five years in length.\n【save__datas】\t【57】\tWhat I believe you will see in long term studies is that Atkins and other low carb diets， while effective for weight loss in the short term， will be found no more effective for long term fat loss than any other restrictive diet (and that’s NOT very effective).\n【save__datas】\t【58】\tLie #5： Calories don't count and you can eat as much as you want while on the Atkins diet.\n【save__datas】\t【59】\tDr. Atkins proposed that calories dont count and he advised his clients to eat as much as they want while on his program. Atkins wrote， \"The so called calorie theory has been a millstone around the necks of dieters and a miserable and malign influence on their efforts to lose.\"\n【save__datas】\t【60】\tHere's the truth about calories and low carb diets：\n【save__datas】\t【61】\tWhen you go on a very low carb (ketogenic) diet with more fat， your appetite is diminished and you feel fuller (because fat is more satiating than carbs). Appetite control may be a legitimate benefit of the Atkins diet， especially for individuals who struggle with hypoglycemia， hunger and cravings. As Dr. Atkins points out， \"Our physical urges are hard to combat.\"\n【save__datas】\t【62】\tHowever， this does not mean you can eat as much as you want. It means that your hunger may be blunted on Atkin's plan， causing you to automatically eat less without counting calories or even thinking about calories.\n【save__datas】\t【63】\tPeople on the Atkins diet who lose weight are not eating more than they burn and losing fat in spite of it. Whether you count calories and consciously eat fewer than you burn， or you dont count them and unconsciously eat fewer than you burn， either way， the end result is the same.\n【save__datas】\t【64】\tWhile counting calories in the literal sense is clearly not always necessary， you always have to be aware of calories and portions. No diet or special combination of foods can override the law of calorie balance.\n【save__datas】\t【65】\tAnyone who believes that you can eat as much as you want and still lose weight is living in a dream world.\n【save__datas】\t【66】\tLie #6： A brand new study just proved that the Atkins diet gives you a metabolic advantage so you really can eat as much as you want\n【save__datas】\t【67】\tA 12 week study conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health and presented in October 2003 to the North American Association for the Study of Obesity found that subjects on a low carb regimen lost just as much weight as those on a standard high carb， low fat diet.\n【save__datas】\t【68】\tThe shocking part was that the group on the Atkins diet could eat 300 more calories than the group eating the conventional high carb food pyramid diet. This left researchers scratching their heads saying，\n【save__datas】\t【69】\t\"It doesn't make sense... it defies the laws of thermodynamics.\"\n【save__datas】\t【70】\t\"A lot of our assumptions about a calorie is a calorie are being challenged，\"\n【save__datas】\t【71】\tUnfortunately， some of the Atkins troops were quick to interpret the results as meaning， \"See， I told you calories dont count.\"\n【save__datas】\t【72】\tActually， calories do count and the explanation for these results is quite simple.\n【save__datas】\t【73】\tA calorie is NOT just a calorie. If all calories were created equal then a 2000 calorie diet of Krispy creme doughnuts would have the same effect as a 2000 calorie diet of chicken breast and salad vegetables. Do you think these two diets will have the same effects on your health and body composition?\n【save__datas】\t【74】\tCertain foods and certain diets DO give you a metabolic advantage. One advantage is the effect of a diet’s composition on your hormones； namely insulin and glucagon.\n【save__datas】\t【75】\tA second advantage is called the thermic effect of food. The thermic effect of food means that a certain number of calories are used just to digest and absorb the food，--connect--【76】leaving a net calorie value substantially less than the total amount of caloric energy that was contained in the food.\n【save__datas】\t【77】\tFor example， a lean protein food such as chicken breast has a thermic effect of around 20-30%. This means that for every 100 calories of chicken breast consumed， the NET energy utilized by the body is only 70-80 calories. (Some people call this\"negative calories.\")\n【save__datas】\t【78】\tStated differently， this means you really CAN lose weight on a higher calorie intake if you eat foods with a high thermic effect.\n【save__datas】\t【79】\tWhat's especially interesting -providing confirmation of the metabolic advantage of a high protein diet - is that the foods provided in this study were low carb， but NOT typical Atkins fare. Instead of lots of red meat and saturated fat， the subjects in this particular study ate mostly fish， chicken， salads， vegetables and unsaturated oils.\n【save__datas】\t【80】\tI think study's direcHM：tor， Penelope Green， hit the nail on the head when she said，\"Maybe they (the low carb， high protein group) burned up more calories digesting their food.”\n【save__datas】\t【81】\tTruth is， not one study has ever proven that you can \"eat as much as you want\"on Atkins or any diet. Even when a diet provides a metabolic advantage， AFTER that advantage is factored in and you look at NET calorie utilization， you are still left with the calories in versus calories out equation.\n【save__datas】\t【82】\tLie #7： The Atkins diet causes faster and greater FAT loss than conventional diets\n【save__datas】\t【83】\tMost health， medical and nutrition organizations recommend that you lose weight(body fat) at a rate of no more than 2 pounds per week. In his book， Dr. Atkins says that the average weight loss in the first two weeks on his plan is 8 to 15 pounds.\n【save__datas】\t【84】\tLike many diets， Atkins overstresses total weight loss (and quick weight loss)， while not stressing enough the difference between body weight， body water， body fat and lean body mass.\n【save__datas】\t【85】\tTruth is， low carb diets definitely cause greater weight loss， especially in the initial phases. But this is mostly due to a large drop in water weight and glycogen (stored carbohydrate)， not necessarily increased fat loss.\n【save__datas】\t【86】\tWeight loss is the wrong goal! Your goal should be permanent fat loss and you should be measuring and tracking your body fat percentage and lean body mass on a regular basis.\n【save__datas】\t【87】\tDon't gloat over large， rapid weight losses\"... it might be mostly water and muscle.\n【save__datas】\t【88】\tLie #8： Carbohydrates make you fat\n【save__datas】\t【89】\tDr. Atkins wrote， and I quote， \"Carbohydrates are the very food that makes you fat.\"He also wrote， “Diets high in carbohydrates are precisely what most overweight people don't need and can't become slim on.\"\n【save__datas】\t【90】\tThese are very misleading statements of half-truth.\n【save__datas】\t【91】\tThe \"carbs make you fat\" myth is probably the most pervasive and damaging lie about weight control ever told. It's caused tremendous confusion and frustration to already confused and frustrated dieters.\n【save__datas】\t【92】\tFirst， focusing primarily on any macronutrient (protein， carbs or fat) or macronutrient ratio should be secondary to energy balance. What makes you fat is eating too many calories.\n【save__datas】\t【93】\tTruth is， you can't blame all \"carbohydrates\" as a group for why we are getting fatter. What type of carbohydrates are we talking about? There are good carbs and bad carbs. The \"bad\" carbs are the refined ones； white flour and white sugar products like white bread， white pasta， sugar sweetened cereals， candy and soft drinks.\n【save__datas】\t【94】\tTo avoid confusion， I would suggest never using the word \"carbohydrate\"without putting the adjective \"refined\" or \"natural\" in front of it.\n【save__datas】\t【95】\tIronically， Dr. Atkins does make this distinction in his book， yet he still chose to recommend removal of almost ALL carbs during the induction and weight loss phases of his diet - even the good carbs that are proven healthy. This creates rapid weight loss and the appearance of a hugely successful diet right from the first week.\n【save__datas】\t【96】\tAgain， the real questions are： What kind of weight was lost and can you keep the weight off for good?\n【save__datas】\t【97】\tA healthy， maintainable fat burning diet should be centered on natural foods- and for most people， that includes natural carbs in moderation - not the total removal and demonizing of all carbohydrates.\n【save__datas】\t【98】\tLie #9： Ketosis makes you feel better and doesn't affect your performance\n【save__datas】\t【99】\tYour body is a remarkable machine that is fully capable of adapting to whatever fuel is provided in predominance. You can burn protein， fat， or carbs for energy. However， carbohydrates are your body’s preferred - and most efficient - fuel source for vigorous physical activity.\n【save__datas】\t【100】\tMany low carbers believe that fat is a more efficient energy source than carbohydrates， but this is not true. Fat is not a more efficient energy source， it is only a more concentrated energy source.\n【save__datas】\t【101】\tSince the fuel for muscular contraction is carbs (glycogen) a high fat， low carb diet is not the best approach to fat loss for athletes， bodybuilders or highly active individuals. These diets simply don’t support high intensity training.\n【save__datas】\t【102】\tVery low carb diets might be appropriate for the sedentary， severely overweight， or those with orthopedic conditions that prevent any exercise. It seems that ketogenic diets take off weight even with little or no exercise (although the weight wont be pure fat and you may not keep it off). Some Atkins dieters even report feeling more energetic after adapting to the low carbs and higher fat. It’s likely， however， that most of them were relatively inactive. Low carbs and high activity don't go well together.\n【save__datas】\t【103】\tTruth is， a more balanced diet of natural foods combined with exercise is a much better way to take off pure fat for good.\n【save__datas】\t【104】\tAnyone who CAN exercise SHOULD exercise! Of the two methods for creating a calorie deficit - burning more， or eating less - the former is the superior method with far fewer downsides. Any fat loss program that does not make exercise the centerpiece is ultimately destined for failure.\n【save__datas】\t【105】\tLie #10： Ketogenic diets (very low carb) are the secret to fat loss\n【save__datas】\t【106】\tThe term \"low carb\" is used very broadly. To some， a diet like the Zone， which consists of 40% carbs is \"low carbs.\"To others \"low carb\" is more extreme. A ketogenic diet is a VERY low carb diet， usually between 40-70 grams of carbs per day or less. The induction phase of the Atkins diet is limited to only 20 grams per day.\n【save__datas】\t【107】\tBecause they allow virtually no carbohydrate， Ketogenic diets， by definition， are extremely strict and nutritionally unbalanced. It’s an irrevocable law that the more\"extreme\"a nutrition program is， the greater the side effects will be and the more difficult the diet will be to stay on.\n【save__datas】\t【108】\tDr. Atkins claimed， \"Ketosis is the secret weapon of super effective dieting.\"\n【save__datas】\t【109】\tTruth is， while some recent studies have suggested low carb diets do work， not a single study has proven that it's necessary to restrict carbs so severely that you go into ketosis.\n【save__datas】\t【110】\tThe benefits of reduced carbs and more protein include a higher thermic effect， appetite regulation and hormonal control. What the low carb folks dont want you to know is that a moderate reduction in carbohydrates (and/or removal of processed carbs) is often all it takes to get these benefits， while being much easier to maintain for the long haul.\n【save__datas】\t【111】\tSo if ketogenic and very low carb diets aren't the best way to achieve permanent fat loss， then what is the best way???\n【save__datas】\t【112】\tDr Atkins made many excellent points about weight control in his book. He spoke out on the evils of processed carbohydrates. He identified carbohydrate sensitivity and hyperinsulinemia as contributing factors in obesity. He spoke of the metabolic advantage of high protein. He pointed out that there may not be a direct one to one correlation between saturated fat， dietary cholesterol and heart disease.\n【save__datas】\t【113】\tThe fact is， Dr. Atkins - to his credit -had discovered some important facts about weight control， and had the courage to publish and stand by them long before anyone else did. In the end， unfortunately，he drew some questionable conclusions from this information and， like so many other diet gurus， he left out some large and important pieces to the puzzle.\n【save__datas】\t【114】\tIf permanent fat loss were as simple as removing carbohydrates from your diet， then why has obesity surged to an all-new high in 2003 and why are there so many Atkins failures?\n【save__datas】\t【115】\tCould it be possible that the conventional high carb， low fat food pyramid approach and the Atkins diet approach have BOTH missed the mark， and that the optimum diet for permanent fat loss is somewhere in the middle?\n【save__datas】\t【116】\tCould it be possible that dieting is the absolute worst way to lose body fat and that the proper type of exercise program combined with a more balanced approach to nutrition is the answer?\n【save__datas】\t【117】\tOne of the biggest errors weight loss seekers make today is to accept one philosophy completely or reject it completely， taking a side and taking up arms\" to defend their position without considering the alternatives. Most of the weight loss philosophies being promoted today contain valid points， but as a whole， are a total mish mash of truth， half-truths and lies.\n【save__datas】\t【118】\tThat's why， for over 20 years， I have literally turned myself into a human guinea pig in my search for a sensible and healthy method of permanent fat loss. I studied and then personally tested the ketogenic diet， the high carb diet， low fat diet and nearly every other diet in between. I found good points and hawFbad points in all of them， many of which I have already revealed to you in this report.\n【save__datas】\t【119】\tI then compiled all the positive points of each f山at loss method into a structuredformat， while discarding all the negatives. What emerged was nothing short of remarkable： An all-natural system that has allowed me to peak at a body fat level of3.4% and to maintain my body fat at 9% or less all year round... without drugs， extreme diets， or unnecessary supplements. It’s worked for thousands of other people too.\n【[www.com]_filter】\t【120】\tIf you would like to learn exactly what I discovered about permanent， natural fat loss from two decades of study and experimentation... and if you'd like to learn how it VOIIe can help you escape the diet wars for good， and finally achieve the body you've always wanted， I encourage you to visit my fat loss web page at www.burnthefat.com and take a look for yourself.\n【save__datas】\t【121】\tAbout The Author\n", "attr": {"obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/10 Lies About The Atkins Diet (Tom Venuto) (Z-Library).pdf", "processor": "damo_doc_mind"}, "dataset": "medical_book_test", "version": 0}}, "result_info": {"type1": null, "type2": null, "type3": null, "type4": "栏目混乱#11#10#上下顺序错误\n错误删除#27#27#正文内容被过滤\n错误删除#32#32#正文内容被过滤\n错误删除#34#34#正文内容被过滤\n", "type5": "", "type6": null}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-03-04 18:10:49", "update_time": "2024-03-05 00:34:04"}

During the energy crisis of the 1970s， Congress passed a law that required automobile manufacturers to improve the fuel econo-my of their cars and light trucks. The automakers promptly adopted cheap， ingenious ways to comply with the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards. Thanks largely to more advanced engines and computerized controls， the average gas mileage of--connect--【69】new vehicles doubled over the next decade， reaching a high of26.2 miles per gallon in 1987.\n【save__datas】\t【70】\tSince then， however， the av-erage has slid to 24.5 mpg， even though automotive engineers are still brimming with ideas for en-hancing fuel economy. The prob-lem is that the CAFE standard for cars has been frozen at 27.5 mpg for the past 12 years， and the standard for light trucks is stuck at 20.7 mpg. Moreover， the phe-nomenal growth in the populari---connect--【71】ty of sport utility vehicles-which are classified as light trucks-has changed the mix of new vehicles and thus lowered the overall average.\n【save__datas】\t【72】\tImproving fuel economy is a worthy national goal：it would reduce America’s dependence on imported oil and cut the carbon emissions that contribute to global warming. Indeed， the Bush administration re-cently expressed support for crafting new fuel-econ-omy standards based in part on the recommendations ofa National Academy of Sciences panel. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers opposes higher stan-dards， but some engineers in Detroit privately concede that they could increase the fuel economy of most ve-hicles without raising their cost unduly. Opponents of CAFE say higher standards would encourage manu---connect--【73】facturers to make their vehicles lighter and hence less crashworthy. Trimming weight， however， need not threaten passenger safety， especially if automakers use more aluminum and other light but strong materials\n【save__datas】\t【74】\tGeneral Motors， Ford and DaimlerChrysler have already promised to boost the average gas mileage of their SUVs by 25 percent over the next five years.A re-port from the American Council for an Energy-Effi-cient Economy， a nonprofit organization based in Washington， D.C.， estimates that manufacturers could upgrade the fuel economy of midsize cars by more than50 percent at a cost of about $1，000 per vehicle (which consumers would recoup at the gas pump in about three years). The most talked-about technology is the hybrid vehicle， which employs an electric motor to sup plement a gas engine. But other innovations abound. The integrated starter generator， for example， replaces a conventional generator with a battery system， and SO1the variable displacement engine shuts down some of its cylinders when they aren’t needed.\n【save__datas】\t【75】\tRaising the CAFE standards is the surest way to promote these technologies. Market forces alone can-not do the job， because fuel economy ranks low among most car buyers’ priorities. The beauty of CAFE is its flexibility. The standards apply to all automakers， for-eign and domestic alike， allowing each to choose any approach for improving the average fuel economy of its fleet. In contrast， the recently proposed tax credit for the purchase of hybrid or fuel-cell vehicles would sub sidize one technology that may not prove competitive.\n【save__datas】\t【76】\tThe Sierra Club and other environmental groups support raising the CAFE standard to 40 mpg for all vehicles by 2012， but many automotive experts say this goal is unrealistic. Taking economic and technical con-siderations into account， a reasonable strategy would be to raise the standard for light trucks to 27 mpg by2007 and to 32 mpg by 2012， while lifting the stan-dard for cars to 32 and 37 mpg by the same dates.\n【save__datas】\t【82】\tGretchen G.

The strip cut into a tire on the plane’s main landing gear， throwing debris up against the underside of the Con-corde’s delta wing， right at a fuel tank.\n【save__datas】\t【185】\tThe safety alterations are expected--connect--【186】to add about 400 kilograms \\[about880 pounds\\]to each ofthe dozen serviceable Concordes， although new tires should reduce the overall weight gain somewhat.Othermass savings will be achieved through changes to the planes' interior. British Airways is spending about $43 million to retrofit--connect--【187】its seven-plane Concorde fleet.\n【save__datas】\t【190】\tAlthough the impact did not perforate the skin， it deformed the tank wall enough to send intense pressure waves through the kerosene fuel， which eventually punched a hole the size of a sheet of notebook paper in the tank. Fuel spilled out of the ruptured reservoir as the plane became airborne. Whisked around the landing gear by the tur-bulent airflow， the leaking kerosene quickly became a long， roaring flame trail when it was set alight either by an electrical spark in the undercarriage or by hot gases from the front of the turbine engines. Soon afterward the supersonic airplane’s close-mounted en-gines ingested tire debris or， more likely， leaked fuel or hot combustion gases； the en-gines failed in succession， leading to the sub-sequent crash.\n【save__datas】\t【191】\tWhen the flagship SST is fully retrofitted， it should be able to resist damage from tire blowouts， mishaps that have not been un---connect--【192】common in the past. “The design is such that we can absolutely guarantee that a fire like the one that happened in Paris could never happen again，”states British Airways's chief Concorde pilot， Mike Bannister.\n【save__datas】\t【193】\tAmong the more significant modifica-tions are new Kevlar aramid-rubber fuel tank liners. Manufactured by EADS， the lin-ers， which are similar in appearance to gar-deners’seed trays， cost around $2.1 million each to install. Technicians are laboriously fitting about 150 of the individually molded liner sections， jigsaw-fashion， into the tight spaces of the fuel reservoirs of each jet. In an approach already employed in military heli-copters and Formula 1 racing cars， the card-board-thin liners are designed to contain the flow of escaping fuel by being sucked into the breach should the wing skin be pierced. Dur-ing the accident， kerosene gushed out at a rate of around 100 liters per second， which created a sufficiently rich fuel-air mixture to allow the fuel to burst into flames. “The lin-ers will stem that kind of flow， limiting it to something like a liter per second， which would not ignite，” explains Peter Middleton， a British Airways spokesperson.\n【save__datas】\t【194】\tNew puncture-resistant tires from Miche-lin should go a long way toward reducing the risks as well. The Concorde’s original nylon bias-ply tires-the standard aviation industry design in which woven reinforcing fabric plies are stacked with their weaves set at criss-crossing angles-could be replaced by special--connect--【195】radial tires， which have rim-to-rim reinforce-ment. In tests the new radials not only stand up better to incisions but when severely dam-aged are designed to break apart into pieces--connect--【196】too tiny to rupture a fuel tank， says Jean Couratier， research-and-development director for Michelin Avi-ation Products. The tires are constructed using a proprietary high-strength reinforcement material in the belts and sidewalls that limits the expansion of the tires'diameter under pres-sure.“This reduces the de-gree to which the rubber--connect--【197】tread is elongated， which in turn improves its resistance to cuts and tears，” Couratier ex-plains. The NZG (which stands for “near zero growth\") technology also halves the number of plies in the tire， thereby cutting tire weight by 20 percent， he notes， an attribute that will help offset the additional weight of the other safety modifications.\n【save__datas】\t【198】\tOnce the refitting is complete， the modi-fied Concorde will undergo a series of prov-ing flights. Then civil aviation authorities will have to recertify the craft for airworthiness. If everything goes smoothly， supersonic ser-vice may resume sometime this fall. The Con-corde's main clientele-international bankers and business executives， transatlantic jet-set-ters and celebrities-will be relieved.\n【save__datas】\t【200】\tSafety modifications underway are：\n【save__datas】\t【201】\t■Lining fuel tanks with a Kevlar-rubber compound to limit leaks\n【save__datas】\t【202】\tLphotograph above\\]\n【save__datas】\t【203】\t■Encasing electrical wiring in the undercarriage in steelbraiding\n【save__datas】\t【204】\t■Arranging shutdown of power to the cooling fans for the landing-gear brakes during takeoff\n【save__datas】\t【205】\tInstalling improved fire-detection and wamingsystems\n【save__datas】\t【206】\t■Adopting puncture-resistant， lighter-weight tires\n【save__datas】\t【208】\tRoad Map for the Mind\n【save__datas】\t【210】\tIl those folds and fissures make life dif-Aficult for a neuroscientist： they bury two thirds of the brain’s surface， or cortex， where most of the information pro-cessing takes place. With so much of the brain hidden， researchers have a hard time seeing exactly which parts of the cortex are doing what and how they are related to one anoth-er.“People want to see what’s in the folds，”says Monica K. Hurdal， a computer scientist at Florida State University， who has created a computer program to flat-map the brain. Conventional imaging techniques usually dis-play cross sections of the brain， making it dif-ficult to view the entire surface. Forexample，--connect--【211】an MRI scan might show areas that look to be adjacent but are， if they have a deep fold between them， actually far apart.\n【save__datas】\t【212】\t“Converting a sphere into a plane is not so difficult，” Hurdal explains， “but it does re-quire that certain compromises be made.”The Mercator projection of the earth， for in-stance， preserves shapes and angles at the ex-pense of areas， so that the polar regions look far too large in relation to the equatorial ones. The mathematical basis for the Mercator pro-jection is an 1851 law of geometry known as the Riemann mapping theorem (although the16th-century cartographer himself wasn’t aware of it， of course). It says that a three-di-\n【save__datas】\t【213】\tIn contrast to Mercator projections， a flat-mapping technique called CARET \\[computerized anatomical， reconstruction and editing toolkit\\] preserves the area and length of objects， instead of their angles.--connect--【214】mensional curved surface can be flattened while preserving the angular information， thereby yielding a so-called conformal map.--connect--【218】its nearest neighbors by lines. The result is a triangulated mesh.\n【save__datas】\t【219】\tThe key to flattening this landscape of convoluted triangles lies in a Greek theorem called circle packing. It says that three circles can always be drawn around the corners of a triangle so that each circle just touches the other two. Any two of these circles also be long to a neighboring triangle. Hence thou-sands of triangles in a flat plane can perfect---connect--【220】ly pack that plane with thousands of circles\n【save__datas】\t【221】\tApplying the theorem to the brain may名LI sound easy enough， but there is on1.1.......1.e problem， Hurdal notes： the triangles that represent the surface of a brain are not lying flat， so the touching circles will stick out. To fix this， the program employs a contemporary version of circle packing. It extends the theorem to three dimensions， moving all the cortical points un-til they settle down with the circles into a well-packed plane. Because the resulting maps are not perfect conformal maps， Hurdal calls them quasi-conformal. She has already flat-mapped the cerebellum and var-ious bits of the cortex. To match precise re-gions with brain activity， researchers can take images from subsequent scans， flatten them a IRTnd overlay them on the initial MRI.\n【save__datas】\t【222】\tSurgeons may eventually rely on the maps in brain surgery， particularly in epilepsy op-erations in which cutting out chunks of the cortex is necessary to help stop seizures. Werner K. Doyle， a neurosurgeon who per forms more than 200 such operations every year at New York University-Mount Sinai Comprehensive Epilepsy Center， says，“Which parts are removed is often an educated guess.’\n【save__datas】\t【223】\tThe most commonly used method to lo-cate malfunctioning regions is electroen-cephalography (EEG). It requires placing sev-eral electrodes directly on the surface of the brain and waiting for a seizure. Unfortunate ly， EEG readings don’t always mark the right spot， and so too much cortex or the wrong re-gion is sometimes removed. Flat maps turn the3-D brain into a 2-D image， which， Doyle says“will make it easier and safer for neurologists to navigate the mind.\"Ideally， no one will get lost， because directions aren’t included.\n【save__datas】\t【224】\tDiane Martindale is a science writer based--connect--【225】in New York City.\n【save__datas】\t【226】\tOO仍乏口The Peak of Success--connect--【229】article on cosmology， we get letters complaining that cosmology isn’t a science， just unconstrained speculation. But even if that used to be the case， it is certainly not true anymore. The past several months--connect--【230】alone have seen a remarkable outpouring of high-precision observations of the universe on its largest scales. Not only do they give the big bang theory a new quantitative rigor， they hint at secondary effects-perhaps the long sought signatures of cosmic inflation and cold--connect--【231】dark matter.“Previously， cosmology had been independent strands of thought，”says cosmologist David Tytler of the University of California at San Diego. “It can now go on to address the next level of detail.”\n【save__datas】\t【232】\tAlthough the big bang theory has long been supported by three observational pil-lars-cosmic microwave background radia-tion， abundance of light elements， and out-ward velocity of distant galaxies-these pil-lars uphold different aspects of the theory. Only last year did observations of the first pil-lar reach the precision needed to cross-check the second one. Two balloon-borne tele-scopes， Boomerang and Maxima， measured the microwave background with a resolution of better than one degree， revealing small-scale fluctuations. Unlike the larger-scale fluc-tuations made famous by the COBE satellite a decade ago-which are scale-invariant， Oc-curring with the same relative strength no matter their size-the small ones seem to be strongest on certain scales known as peaks.\n【save__datas】\t【233】\tThe size and strength of these peaks allow cosmologists to get at the geometry of space and the density of matter. The thinking is that as the universe grew， density fluctuations that started off as scale-invariant developed into synchronized oscillations on ever increasing scales. The microwave background reveals how far this process had gotten when the cos-mos was 400，000 years old. After that time， the oscillations started to subside as gravity pulled matter into bodies such as galaxies.\n【save__datas】\t【234】\tBoomerang's and Maxima’s results were a case of good news and bad news. The in-struments saw the largest of the expected peaks， demonstrating that the universe is geo-metrically flat， but they failed to see a second peak. That suggested the universe had much more ordinary matter than the element abun dances could countenance.\n【save__datas】\t【235】\tTo universal relief， the discrepancy has now disappeared. This past April a third tele-scope-the ground-based Degree Angular Scale Interferometer (DASI)， run by John E. Carlstrom and his group at the University of Chicago-detected the second peak. Mean-while the Boomerang team realized that it had overestimated the pointing accuracy of its instrument， which had the effect of smudg-ing the fine details in the images. When the team undid this bias and incorporated new data， the second peak popped out. Maxima’s results for the second peak haven’t changed， but its error bars encompass the other exper-iments’values anyway.\n【save__datas】\t【236】\tBoomerang's revisions have left some cos-mologists wondering what to believe， but ob-servers respond that the agreement of inde-pendent techniques is grounds for confidence. In any case， certainty should soon arrive on the wings of NASA’s Microwave Anisotropy Probe and new ground-based instruments with still higher resolution.\n【save__datas】\t【237】\tAlthough some media accounts described the findings as “confirmation”of cosmic in-flation and cold dark matter， that is not quite true. Geometric flatness and scale invariance were predicted long before inflation， based on very general principles. It is true that most al-ternatives to inflation are ruled out， having failed to foresee multiple peaks， but that is not the same as ruling inflation in. Similarly， it's hard to be sure that dark matter is real stuff rather than a theoretical artifact.\n【save__datas】\t【238】\tDirect evidence may not be far off， though. Already there are hints of a slight“tilt”-a deviation from exact scale invari-ance， as inflationary models predict-in the microwave background and， according to\n【save__datas】\t【239】\t170，000 DOTS，each one a galaxy， spin a dense web through a slice of space.

Croft of the Harvard-Smithson-ian Center for Astrophysics， in the distribu-tion of intergalactic gas clouds. As for dark matter， Arthur Kosowsky of Rutgers Univer-sity says the relative strength of the peaks is the do-or-die test. Cold dark matter con-tributes to gravity but not to pressure， there-by accentuating the odd-numbered peaks(which represent the gravity-dominated part of the primordial oscillation cycle) at the ex-pense of the even-numbered ones (the pres-sure-dominated part). If you squint at the cur-rent data， you might say that the third peak is indeed bigger. Fortunately， with observa-tional precision improving at its present rate， squinting will soon be unnecessary.\n【save__datas】\t【242】\tCosmic microwave background--connect--【243】radiation Its spectrum indicates that hot plasma once filled the universe.

Now biotech companies and their investors are betting that a similar--connect--【259】souped-up，assembly-line approach can be applied to the new science of pro-teomics： an effort to catalogue which proteins our genes encode and to de-cipher how these proteins function to direct the behavior of a cell， an or-gan or a next-door neighbor.\n【save__datas】\t【260】\tThe latest boast comes from re-searchers at Myriad Genetics in Salt Lake City， who in April announced that they plan to map the entire human proteome in less than three years. To do this， Myriad has spawned a subsidiary， called Myriad Proteomics， with Hitachi and Oracle， which will supply the hardware and the database software needed to handle the massive amount of information that will be generated by the project.\n【save__datas】\t【261】\tTheir bold proclamation has raised a few eyebrows in the scientific community.“It’s easy to say that you'll complete a compre-hensive proteome map，\" notes Marc Vidal of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.“But none of us knows what that means.\"There may be only one genome， but when it comes to the proteome， different proteins can be more or less active in different cells at dif-ferent times during development， under dif-ferent physiological conditions or in different disease states. The proteome’s nature “makes it hard to define what we’re doing-not just Myriad， but all of us，” remarks Joshua La-Baer， director of the Institute of Proteomics at Harvard Medical School. “There’s no such thing as a human proteome，”adds Keith L. Williams， CEO of Proteome Systems， head-quartered in Sydney， Australia. Look at the liver， for example， he says： “After a glass of red wine， you'll have a different proteome.”\n【save__datas】\t【262】\t“fProteomics’is a newly invented word， so it means different things to different peo-ple，”notes Sudhir Sahasrabudhe， executive vice president of research at Myriad Genet---connect--【263】ics. For its part， Myriad is narrowing its def-inition： it will zero in on “systematically un-covering all protein-protein interactions，”Sa-hasrabudhe says. With a detailed inventory of which proteins touch one another inside cells， scientists can begin to place proteins within biochemical pathways and predict their intracellular operations.\n【save__datas】\t【264】\tTo accomplish this feat， Myriad has been industrializing techniques that scientists have traditionally used to examine protein inter actions one at a time. One such method is the yeast two-hybrid system. It uses a single bait protein to fish for binding partners in a sea of prey proteins produced artificially inside a yeast cell. The binding of bait to prey acti-vates a reporter gene， allowing researchers to easily detect when an interaction occurs.\n【save__datas】\t【265】\tMyriad will adopt a \"shotgun\"approach， throwing together collections of bait and col-lections of prey to see what falls out. Repeat the analysis again and again， looking at tens of thousands of reactions a day， and the bulk of the interactions will reveal themselves， Sa-hasrabudhe says. If the human proteome con tains 300，000 to 400，000 proteins， each of which interacts on average with an estimated five to 10 protein partners， it should take three years to generate a comprehensive map.\n【save__datas】\t【266】\tAt that point， the problem becomes ascer-taining which of these interactions are bio-logically meaningful. Two proteins may be physically able to interact but may never ac-tually meet up in a cell. To filter out such false positives， Sahasrabudhe envisions follow-up studies to assess whether interactions in the primary map are physiologically relevant.\n【save__datas】\t【268】\tKaren Hopkin is a Boston-based writer who--connect--【269】was relieved to learn that she isn't the only--connect--【270】one who has trouble defining “proteome.”\n【save__datas】\t【272】\tThree levels of computational ability are， from weakest to strongest：\n【save__datas】\t【273】\tClassical， bit-based computing of today's digital machines\n【save__datas】\t【274】\tClassicallight-wave computing， which uses limited aspects of quantum computing-namely， its wave nature\n【save__datas】\t【275】\tQuantum computing， which uses entanglement of quantum states as well astheir wave nature to speed processingexponentially for certain problems\n【save__datas】\t【277】\tS>工Computing with Light--connect--【279】arge quantum computers could in prin---connect--【280】ciple handle some of the toughest com-puting problems， such as factoring numbers to break encrypted messages-an-swering those questions in seconds instead of the centuries that today's computers would require. But quantum computers are extra-ordinarily difficult to build； they rely on ex-quisitely controlled interactions among frag-ile quantum states. Do they have to? Recent-ly Ian A. Walmsley and his co-workers at the University of Rochester demonstrated that ordinary， classical light waves can perform as efficiently as one class of quantum computer.\n【save__datas】\t【281】\tThe Rochester experiment searched a sort-ed 50-element database. An ordinary comput-er doing a binary search of such a database would need to query the database six times(enough to search 64 elements： 26=64). In1997 Lov K. Grover of Bell Laboratories proved that a quantum computer only has to query once， no matter how large the database.\n【save__datas】\t【282】\tWalmsley’s group used a light pulse in an interferometer， a device that gives light waves a choice of two paths to follow. Along one path， a diffraction grating splits the pulse apart into its broad range of frequencies， like white light through a prism. The 50 elements of the database correspond to 50 bands of that spec-trum. The database itself is represented by an acousto-optic modulator through which the light passes. The modulator imprints a phase shift (that is， it moves the positions of the peaks and troughs of the light wave) on just one of the 50 bands. In essence， each band of the light“looks at” a different database entry (a differ-ent part of the modulator)， and only one“finds\" the target. When the pulse is recom-bined with light from the other arm of the in---connect--【283】terferometer， the phase-shifted band alone shines brightly into a spectrometer， which reads off the result. Only the wave nature of light， not its quantum features， is used.\n【save__datas】\t【284】\tThe experiment is similar to established methods of optical signal processing that， for example， pass beams through holograms. What’s new is that it d+1.，asramirectly exemplifies a gen-eral result that Walmsley and his colleagues demonstrated theoretically late last year.“For every machine that uses \\[only\\] quantum inter-ference，” Walmsley explains，“there is an equivalent， equally efficient one that uses clas sical optical interference.\"Reading out a result on a quantum computer necessarily involves detection of particles， and the extra device components and computational steps for that process eliminate the quantum computer’sad-vantage. According to Emanuel H. Knill of Los Alamos National Laboratory， that insight provides a new perspective “on the relation ship between computing with waves and quantum computing.”\n【save__datas】\t【285】\tThe most powerful quantum algorithms， such as fast factoring， however， require an ad-ditional quantum feature： so-called entangle ment of the states of many particles. Classical waves cannot emulate those algorithms effi-ciently， but light turns out to be well suited to such true quantum computation in another way. In theory， a full-power quantum com-puter can be built by sending individual pho tons through simple linear optical elements， such as beam splitters and phase shifters. Such an approach was proposed in 1997， but those early designs needed exponentially more op-tical elements as the number of qubits in creased-utterly impractical for any but the smallest devices.\n【save__datas】\t【286】\tIn January， Knill， his colleague Raymond Laflamme and Gerard J. Milburn of the Uni-versity of Queensland in Australia exhibited a design whose circuit complexity would in-crease in linear proportion， not exponentially. Unlike the Rochester experiment， this scheme relies on quantum effects of individual pho tons navigating paths through the device but avoids the need for nonlinear interactions between photons， something only readily achieved at very high intensities or with extra-ordinary equipment such as resonant cavities or light-slowing Bose-Einstein condensates.\n【save__datas】\t【287】\t-之-正山工口An Environmental Solution--connect--【289】hemistry depends on solutions. Liquids are important because， once substances are dissolved， their molecules can readily come together to react. But many substances prove to be hard， if not impossible， to dissolve. Now a growing number of chemists believe they have discovered the correct solution-ion-ic liquids， peculiar combinations of salts that are liquid at room temperature. These new sol-vents can be tailor-made to dissolve a variety of substances， including coal， crude oil， inks， plastics， DNA and even some rocks.\n【save__datas】\t【290】\tKenneth R. Seddon， chair of inorganic chemistry at Queen’s University Belfast in Northern Ireland， estimates that there are， in theory， more than a trillion different ionic liq-uids， millions of which are extremely stable(they remain liquid over a range ofabout 300degrees Celsius) and nonvolatile (they can be used over and over). They may replace toxic， flammable and polluting volatile organic sol-vents， such as toluene， hexane and dichloro-methane， for which the worldwide annual market is about $6 billion.\n【save__datas】\t【291】\tChemists make ionic liquids by combin-ing large organic positive ions-with un-friendly names such as 1-ethyl-3-methyl imi-dazolium \\[emim\\]+-and smaller inorganic negative ions， like aluminum tetrachloride. This combination of large and small ions is very different from most ionic salts， such as table salt (NaCl).\n【save__datas】\t【292】\tTable salt is a solid at room temperature because positively charged sodium clings to negatively charged chlorine； thus stuck， the ions stack up to form a regular lattice. But in ionic liquids， the positive charge is less fo-cused： because the positive ions are large，the total charge is smeared out across several atoms. In addition， the big， irregular shapes don't form crystal structures at room tem-perature.“It’s like trying to stack bananas in-stead of oranges. Bananas just don’t stack well，\" comments chemist James H. Davis，Jr.， of the University of South Alabama. Unable to crystallize， the substance remains a liquid.--connect--【294】cautions Robin D. Rogers， director of the Center for Green Manufacturing at the Uni-versity of Alabama. Expense is a major hur-dle： right now a pound of ionic liquid costs about $4，000 to $5，000. The amount could drop to about $200 a pound， depending on composition and quantity， Morland says. But it is still pricey compared with organic sol-vents-per pound， acetone sells for about$0.15 and toluene about $0.10. Of course，be-cause ionic liquids can be recycled， a few tons would replace many tons of organic solvent.\n【save__datas】\t【295】\tToxicity and environmental tests also need to be conducted， Seddon says. Initial an-imal test results look good， but the generous bounty of possible ionic liquids creates a catch-22 situation， points out Albert Robert-son， a senior chemist with specialty chemical maker Cytec Canada. Toxicity tests cost hun-dreds of thousands of dollars， so manufac-turers are playing a waiting game， unwilling to start testing until they are certain they have the right ionic liquid. But proponents say the hurdles will just slow down the inevitable. Seddon and Rogers believe that major appli-cations are some seven to 10 years away. A small-scale industrial application could emerge much sooner， in less than three years.\n【save__datas】\t【296】\tRebecca Renner is a geologist turned--connect--【297】science writer based in Williamsport， Pa.\n【save__datas】\t【300】\tSubstances dissolve when their molecules are similarto the molecules of the solvent， a fact embodied in the chemist's rule of thumb that \"like dissolves like.\" In otherwords， covalent molecules， which have no overall electric charge-substances that include fat， oil and many organic compounds-dissolve in covalent volatile organic solvents.

The standard， devel-oped by the Institute of Electrical and Elec tronic Engineers (IEEE)， was embraced first by Apple Computer in 1999， in the form of its AirPort base station. The “b” indicates that this second version of 802.11， originally rati-fied in 1997， is faster than the first： 802.11b transmits data at up to 11 megabits per sec-ond. It is， in other words， wireless broadband， and it operates in a part of the spectrum(roughly， near microwaves) that， unlike third-generation， or 3G， mobile telephony，requires no license.\n【save__datas】\t【308】\tMany compatible products are available. Set up one of those flying-saucer-like AirPort devices and a card in your desktop or laptop， and you have a local-area network without all those wires. Stick the saucer in your window， and you can go work in a nearby cafe. This year’s Computers， Freedom and Privacy con-ference placed an 802.11b access point in its Internet room.“What I love about it，”says Dan O'Brien， editor of the U.K.’s satirical e-zine Need to Know (Now)，“is that it makes the Net into what it should be： something that’s all around you all the time， and you can just tap into it.”\n【save__datas】\t【309】\tSuch enthusiasm is making 802.11b one of the fastest-growing wireless standards.

Critics argue that such systems can’t hand off connections the way mobile networks transfer calls. But that feature is pointless to many Web surfers：unlike talking， clicking on links and scrolling are hard to do while you’re walking.

But research from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has revealed another important aspect of the disease-a protein largely responsible for the cellular stickiness. The protein， called throm-bospondin， binds to red blood cells and provokes them into releasing molecules that increase the cells’ tendency to stick to blood vessel walls. The revelation， which appeared in the June15 Journal of Clinical Investigation， brings up the possibility of treating sickle-cell disease by interfering with thrombospondin and its effects.\n【save__datas】\t【331】\t\\-Steve Mirsky\n【save__datas】\t【332】\tFat Kills\n【save__datas】\t【333】\tCombatingobesity in childhood could prevent up to four million cancer cases a year world-wide， said researchers at the 11th European Congress on Obesity， held in Vienna in May.

Even in the public sector， where unions have maintained their membership in recent times， they have relatively little power. Teachers， for example， are perhaps the best-organized government employees. Only 11states grant them the right to strike； in 15states they have no legal means to compel school boards to bargain. The other 24 states consider teacher strikes illegal but permit lo-cal governments to bargain with the boards.\n【save__datas】\t【377】\tIn terms of labor rights， teachers fall mid-way between powerful industrial unions such as the United Auto Workers and certain groups not protected by federal labor regula-tions at all. Federal law， particularly the La-bor-Management Relations Act of 1947 (also known as the Taft-Hartley Act)， compels em-ployers to bargain with unions in good faith and protects workers from arbitrary firing for union activity. The situation of unprotected groups-which include farm laborers， do-mestics， supervisors， managers and indepen-dent contractors-is documented in detail by Human Rights Watch in its recent report Un-fair Advantage. These employees， who may number up to 20 million， have minimal pro-tection when trying to form a union. Al-though they may have some legal safeguards--connect--【378】by labor laws， is the employer’s right under court decisions to replace them permanently if they strike for higher wages. Sympathy strikes are illegal. Employers have a virtually unlimit-ed right to present their point of view in the workplace but can prevent union organizers from doing the same.\n【save__datas】\t【379】\tThe U.S. has long been out of step with standards established by the International La bor Organization， an arm of the United Na tions. The standards affirm workers’right to organize， to bargain collectively， to have a speedy resolution of grievances and， with cer-tain limitations， to strike and conduct sympa-thy strikes. It disallows practices that would undermine the right to strike， such as the hir ing of permanent replacement workers.

David， then the Central Intelligence Agency’s top science and technology official， came away impressed from a trip to the Massachusetts In-stitute of Technology's Media Lab. On the flight back to Washington， she remarked to her deputy， Joanne Isham， that the agency could benefit from a high-pow-ered， in-house technology incubator.\n【save__datas】\t【389】\tThe CIA was having a tough time tapping into the information technology revolution， yet it had a press-ing need to implement more advanced software tools for tasks such as Internet security to prevent hacker in-cursions. The agency could no longer rely solely on its tra-ditional contractor base and government labs for the cut-ting-edge information technologies that would allow it to keep spying on the world. It had unsuccessfully tried a number ofinternal efforts to take advantage of new tech1--nologies. But it often had trouble reaching out beyond the confines of the agency. Security concerns frequently hindered it from detailing its needs to outside suppliers.\n【save__datas】\t【390】\tGeorge J. Tenet， the agency’s director， convinced of the importance of adopting new information technolo-gy， gave the green light to David and other agency em-ployees who wanted to try a wholly new approach. Us ing outside consultants and legal experts， the team be gan putting together an infrastructure for linking the CIA with the network of investment bankers， venture capi talists and information technology entrepreneurs who turn new ideas into useful products. After much refine ment， the CIA created In-Q-Tel， a private not-for-profit venture-capital firm whose funding comes from taxpay-er dollars.\n【save__datas】\t【391】\tThe CIA has set up companies before， but they have been primarily undisclosed fronts for secret agency op-erations， such as Air America， the airline the CIA ran for many years in Southeast Asia. In-Q-Tel is different：the agency acknowledges and promotes its relationship with In-Q-Tel. Company officials like to call the pub-licly funded CIA creation a “venture catalyst\" because it does more than seed start-ups and new technologies It does， of course， shell out much needed funding.“No one comes to us not looking for our money\" says Christopher Tucker， the company's chief strategist. But In-Q-Tel also acts as a buffer between the agency and the information technology community. It offers the expertise of a group of people who have spent a great deal of time thinking through the particular problems the agency confronts.\n【save__datas】\t【392】\tThe CIA requires a series of target technologies：software for Internet security-threat detection and eradication of hackers who pry into its databases-as well as information management， network security ac-cess， and the searching and indexing of open-source documents， just to name a few. But the agency's insu-lar culture keeps it from acknowledging that existing systems may be deficient. And security is always para-mount. Just getting a list of technology-related needs on paper was difficult. Doing so， Tucker says， “was a real watershed event， and then having it articulated at--connect--【394】a level of abstraction that allowed for making it un-classified was another watershed event， because all of a sudden you can actually talk to industry.\"\n【save__datas】\t【395】\tThe CIA has In-Q-Tel working largely in the pub-lic realm， a strategy that has kept security issues to a minimum； very few of its 36 employees have security clearance. An in-house CIA office called the In-Q-Tel Interface Center provides guidance on agency needs and candidate technologies.“Without the interface center，\" Tucker notes， “it’s hard to imagine that we’d be able to know anything about \\[the CIA’s\\] real needs unless we essentially turned ourselves into an element ot the agency.”\n【save__datas】\t【396】\tTo find new ideas and technologies that might be quickly developed and adapted for agency use， In-Q-Tel， with offices in the Washington，D.C.， area and Silicon Valley， spends a lot of time doing “terrain mapping\"-reviewing open-source information on the Internet or in trade literature.“It’s amazing what you can learn by just doing that，\" Tucker says. “It’s also amazing what you don’t get.\" In-Q-Tel fills the gap by tracking less visible technologies， doing for the CIA what the agency can’t do for itself. It monitors what it calls “deal flow.”“There's an enormous undercurrent of companies that haven’t disclosed themselves to the marketplace either to main-tain their trade secrets or to maintain their competitive edge until they get bigger，\"Tucker explains. “There are huge amounts of ingenuity out there in that section of the economy.”\n【save__datas】\t【397】\tFor this reason， In-Q-Tel keeps close tabs on a net-work of other venture capitalists and investment bankers. It supports an outreach program involving traditional investors as well as universities and commercial labo-ratories. When it comes across a technology that shows promise， it makes sure the company has solid creden-tials before agreeing to invest. Then， once it signs up a new company， it serves as a conduit between the agency and the technology developers， providing di-rection but， in many cases， shielding the agency’s plans. As a result， no one talks much about the applications themselves. Tucker says three In-Q-Tel projects have gone into the agency so far， meaning they have been implemented inside the wall of secrecy.\n【save__datas】\t【398】\tProjects in early stages of development are more aboveboard. A company called Safe Web is adapting its product， PrivacyMatrix， a 128-bit Internet encryption system， for the agency’s use. SafeWeb entered into a licensing and venture arrangement with In-Q-Tel last year. In exchange for financing， Safe Web gives the CIA warrants that it can convert to equity later. In the meantime， In-Q-Tel will evaluate PrivacyMatrix， pro---connect--【400】vide the company with advice， and hope that the sup-port will lead to a system that can benefit the CIA.\n【save__datas】\t【401】\tNo one at Safe Web has security clearance. In fact， says Stephen Hsu， the company’s co-founder and chief executive， the CIA would prefer that SafeWeb know“as little as possible” about how it uses PrivacyMatrix. So far， Tucker says， this kind of arrangement has not caused a problem. Although In-Q-Tel has provided funds to major government contractors， including SAIC， officials have focused from the beginning on tech-nologies and ideas promoted by smaller companies that， like SafeWeb， usually would not do business with a gov-ernment entity such as the CIA.\n【save__datas】\t【402】\tMost small entrepreneurial companies， which are not part of the traditional government contractor base， don’t want security clearance or the headaches associ-at th government accounting and acquisition reg-ulations. With In-Q-Tel， they avoid the red tape that--connect--【403】they would otherwise face if they dealt directly with the agency.“We provide them an opportunity to come and play without having to be a government contractor，”Tucker notes.\n【save__datas】\t【404】\tWhile Congress keeps its eye on In-Q-Tel， receiving periodic progress reports， the few critics of the compa-ny are outnumbered by the many supporters that have emerged. Other government agencies are paying close attention， and some frequently ask for information and advice. NASA， Tucker says， “has been all over us，”prob-ing how a similar arrangement might work for the space agency. The army has gone further than that： in Janu-ary the service asked its Science Board， a group of out-side experts， to look into prospects for a venture-capi-tal firm of its own.\n【save__datas】\t【406】\tDaniel G.

Would you explain briefly why genes are patentable?\n【save__datas】\t【411】\tGenes are complex organic molecules， and when you isolate and purify them from the chromosomes where they reside， they are eligible to be patented as chemical compounds. And that is the extent of the patent protec---connect--【412】tion that is given. We’re not giving patents on whole chro)--mosomes， and we certainly don’t give patents on anything as it exists in nature.\n【save__datas】\t【413】\tHow many genes have been patented in the U.S.， and how many applications for--connect--【414】patents are still outstanding? The only number that I have is a guesstimate： since 1980we have granted more than20，000 patents on genes or other gene-related molecules\\[for humans and other organ-isms\\]. And we also know that--connect--【415】we have more than 25，000 applications outstanding that actually claim genes or related molecules.\n【save__datas】\t【416】\tCan you describe why you recently tightened the rules for gene patent applications?\n【save__datas】\t【417】\tThe four main criteria for getting a patent are that the invention must have a utility； it must have an adequate written description； it must be nonobvious to one ofor-dinary skill in that particular field； and it must not have been done exactly before. The biggest hurdle that ge-nomic inventions face is the utility standard.\n【save__datas】\t【418】\tIn 1995 we issued guidelines， and we very clearly stated that if you had a secreted protein from a gene and you didn’t know what role it played in disease or the di-agnostics of disease， but the protein was secreted in a--connect--【419】diseased cell line \\[breast cancer cells， for instance\\]， you could use that protein as an additive in a shampoo. You could have done that， and we would have allowed you to cross the utility hurdle for getting a patent. So that if anybody else wanted to make， use， sell or import into the United States this protein， your patent rights could be used to stop any of those actions.\n【save__datas】\t【420】\tThat is the major change instituted by the new util-ity guidelines. We've gotten rid of proteins being used as shampoo additives or proteins being used as animal food or nutritional supplements. We’ve gotten rid of transgenic mice being used as snake food. And that is exactly what the utility bar has been raised to do-to exclude throwaway utilities and to make sure that when you have a genomic-type invention that you have a real-world and specific utility that is credible.\n【save__datas】\t【421】\tOne of the major findings of the Human Genome Project was just how common itis for a gene to code for multiple proteins. What ifsomeone applies for a patent for a gene that expresses a particular protein and some-one else applies for a patent for the same gene coding for another protein?

Like no other animals， we tell stories about the patterns we find. Sometimes the pat-terns are real； sometimes they are illusions.\n【save__datas】\t【428】\tA well-known illusion of a meaningful pattern is the alleged ability of mediums to talk to the dead. The hottest medium today is former ballroom-dance instructor John Edward， star of the cable television series CrossS--ing Over and author of the New York Times best-sell---connect--【429】ing book One Last Time. His show is so popular that he is about to be syndicated na-tionally on many broadcast stations.\n【save__datas】\t【430】\tHow does Edward appear to talk to the dead? What he does seems indistinguishable from tricks practiced by magicians. He starts by selecting a section of the studio audience， saying something like “I’m getting a George over here. George could be someone who passed over， he could be someone here， he could be someone you know，\" and so on. Of course， such generalizations lead to a“hit.\"Once he has targeted his subject， the “reading”begins， seemingly using three techniques：\n【save__datas】\t【431】\t1\\. Cold reading， in which he reads someone without initially knowing anything about them. He throws out lots of questions and statements and sees what sticks.“I’m getting a ‘P’name. Who is this， please?\"“He’s showing me something red. What is this， please?\" And so on. Most statements are wrong. If subjects have time， they visibly shake their heads “no.\" But Edward is so fast they usually have time to acknowledge only the hits. And as behaviorist B. F. Skinner showed in his ex-periments on superstitious behavior， subjects need only occasional reinforcement or reward to be convinced. In an exposé I did for WABC-TV in New York City， I counted about one statement a second in the opening minute of Edward's show， as he riffled through names， dates， colors， diseases， conditions， situations， relatives and the like. He goes from one to the next so quickly--connect--【432】you have to stop the tape and go back to catch them all.\n【save__datas】\t【433】\t2\\. Warm reading， which exploits nearly universal principles of psychology. Many grieving people wear a piece of jewelry that has a connection to a loved one. Mediums know this and will say something like“Do you have a ring or a piece of jewelry on you， please?”Edward is also facile at determining the cause of death by focusing on either the chest or the head area and then working rapid-fire through the half a dozen major causes of death. “He’s telling me there was a pain in the chest.” If he gets a positive nod， he continues. “Did he have cancer， please? Because I’m seeing a slow death here.\" If the subject hesitates，Edward will immediately shift to heart attack.\n【save__datas】\t【434】\t3\\. Hot reading， in which the medium obtains infor-mation ahead of time. One man who got a reading on Edward's show reports that“once in the studio， we had to wait around for almost two hours before the show began. Throughout that time everybody was talking about what dead relative of theirs might pop up. Remember that all this occurred under microphones and with cameras already set up.\"\n【save__datas】\t【435】\tWhether or not Edward gathers information in this way， mediums generally needn’t. They are successful because they are dealing with the tragedy and finality of death. Sooner or later we all will confront this inevitability， and when we do， we may be at our most vulnerable.\n【save__datas】\t【436】\tThis is why mediums are unethical and dangerous：they prey on the emotions of the grieving. As grief counselors know， death is best faced head-on as a part of life. Pretending that the dead are gathering in a television studio in New York to talk twaddle with a former ballroom-dance instructor is an insult to the intelligence and humanity of the living.\n【[www.com]_filter】\t【437】\tMichael Shermer is the founding publisher of Skeptic--connect--【438】magazine (www.skeptic.com) and the author ofHow\n【save__datas】\t【439】\tWe Believe and The Borderlands of Science.\n【save__datas】\t【440】\tDissident or Don Ouixote?\n【save__datas】\t【442】\tSENAGO，ITALY-Three centuries ago cardinals seeking refuge from a plague in nearby Milan stayed here at the Villa San Carlo Borromeo， a grand estate surveying the village from its highest hill.

David Baltimore got a Nobel Prize and now presides over the California Institute of Technology.\n【save__datas】\t【451】\t“I could have played the game and basked in the glory\" of early success， Duesberg says， and he is prob-ably right. But instead he broke ranks and bruised egos. And so， 10 days before attending this eccentric sympo sium， Duesberg had to dash off a desperate letter to\n【save__datas】\t【452】\tAbraham Katz， one of the handful of rich philanthropists who have been his sole source of funding since he was cut off from all the normal channels five years ago.\n【save__datas】\t【453】\t“We’re down to our last $45，000，”the 64-year-old Dues-berg confides glumly as we stand in the dark courtyard of the vil-la. Katz， whose wife suffers from leukemia， is his final hope； if this grant doesn’t come through， Duesberg will have to cut loose his two assistants， close his lab at Berkeley and move to Ger-many. That is where he was born to two doctors， where he worked through a Ph.D. in chemistry and where he says he still has an open invitation to teach at the University of Heidelberg.\n【save__datas】\t【454】\tLeaving the U.S.， if it comesto that， would thus close the loop on a roller coaster of a career. Although his ascendance is clear enough， it is hard to say exactly when his fall from grace began. Several weeks later as we talk in his small lab-one fifth the size of the facilities he once had-he hands me a paper he published in 1983. “This is the one that started it all，” he says.--connect--【456】theories do， never fully disproved but convincingly rebutted-in this case by a 40-page treatise from the National Institute for Al-lergic and Immune Disease-and ultimately ignored by nearly everyone working in the field.\n【save__datas】\t【457】\tBut Duesberg didn’t even know AIDS existed in 1983，when he wrote the paper that he says first marked him as a trouble-maker. The title seems innocuous：“Retroviral Transforming Genes in Normal Cells?\" But in Duesberg papers the question mark often signals that he is about to yank on the loose threads of a popular theory. This time the theory concerned cancer.\n【save__datas】\t【458】\tHe and others had shown that when certain retroviruses in-sinuate their genes into the cells of mice， the cells turn malignant. Weinberg， Baltimore and others in the field speculated that per-haps similar genes， which they called “proto-oncogenes，”lie dormant in the human genome， like time bombs that turn on only ifa random mutation flips some sort of genetic switch. This hypothesis spawned a cottage industry to search for oncogenes， so-called tumor suppressor genes and， most recently， cancer公4“predisposition”genes.\n【save__datas】\t【459】\tAs two decades passed， human genes with sequences simi-lar to the viral oncogenes were found， and support for this sto-ry of cancer’s origin solidified. “If you were to poll researchers，--connect--【460】fact of sloppy epidemiology that has lumped to-gether different diseases with disparate causes just because the sufferers have all been exposed to what he calls “a harmless passenger virus.”\n【save__datas】\t【462】\tDuesberg's arguments ultimately converted no more than a tiny minority of scientists to his view that “the various AIDS diseases are brought on by the long-term consumption of recreation-\n【save__datas】\t【463】\tProposes aneuploidy hypothesis of cancer \\[1997\\]--connect--【465】al drugs and anti-HIV drugs， such as the DNA chain termina-tor AZT， which is prescribed to prevent or treat AIDS.”Or， as he puts it more bluntly in Milan， in rich countries it is the toxic-ity ofthe very drugs that are prescribed to save HIV-infected peo-ple that kills them.\n【save__datas】\t【466】\tThe hypothesis has never been tested directly， although Dues-berg claims it could be done ethically by comparing 3，000 HIV-positive army recruits with 3，000 HIV-negative recruits matched for disease and drug use. And so his idea has died as most failed\n【save__datas】\t【467】\tI’d guess 95 percent would say that the accumulation of muta-tions \\[to key genes\\] causes cancer，\"says Cristoph Lengauer， an oncologist at Johns Hopkins University.\n【save__datas】\t【468】\tBut the story also grew steadily more complicated-and，to Duesberg， less convincing. Scientists expected to find some com-bination of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes that are al-ways mutated， at least in certain forms of cancer. They did not. Instead the number of putative cancer genes has leaped into the dozens， experiments have shown that different cells in the same--connect--【469】malignancy often contain different mutations， and no clear pat-tern perfectly matches the supposed cause to actual human dis-ease. Cells taken from patients’tumors typically translate their mutant genes into a mere trickle of protein， in contrast to the flood of mutated protein churning in cells transformed by a virus.\n【save__datas】\t【470】\tBeginning with his 1983 paper， Duesberg has also picked at theoretical weak spots in the orthodox view. Some tumors are caused by asbestos and other carcinogens that are chemically in-capable of mutating specific genes， he points out. Mice geneti-cally engineered to lack tumor suppressor genes and to overex-press oncogenes should all develop cancer in infancy-but they don’t. Given the measured rate of spontaneous mutations and the number of cells in the human body， the average person should harbor 100，000 cancer cells if even one dominant onco-gene existed in the genome， Duesberg calculated in a paper last year. But if simultaneous mutations to three genes were required，\n【save__datas】\t【471】\tANEUPLOIDY，seen in the aberrant chromosomes of this breast tumor cell analyzed by Robert A. Weinberg’s group at the Whitehead Institute， is so common in cancer that it must be a cause， Duesberg argues.A normal female cell has two copies of each chromosome \\[except Y\\]， for a total of 23 pairs. The cancerous cell contained three or more copies，as well as chromosomes with transposed pieces \\[such as 1， 6 and 22 \\] or missing segments \\[1，3 and 13\\].--connect--【472】then only one in 100 billion people would ever acquire cancer.\n【save__datas】\t【473】\tIn 1997 Duesberg published what he thought was a better hypothesis. There is one characteristic common to almost every malignant tumor ever studied： nearly all the cancerous cells in it have abnormal chromosomes. In advanced cancers the cells of-ten have two or three times the normal complement of 46 chro-mosomes. In new tumors the gross number may be normal， but closer examination usually reveals that parts of the chromo-somes are duplicated and misplaced.\n【save__datas】\t【474】\tGerman biologist Theodor Boveri noted this so-called aneu-ploidy of tumor cells almost a century ago and suggested that it could be the cause of cancer. But that idea lost traction when no one could find a particular pattern of aneuploidy that correlat-ed with malignancy， except in chronic myelogenous leukemia， which is not a true cancer because it doesn’t spread from the blood to other parts of the body.\n【save__datas】\t【475】\tRecently， however， Duesberg and a few other scientists ana-lyzed aneuploidy more closely and argued that it can explain--connect--【476】many of the mysteries of cancer better than the current dogma can. Their alternative story begins when a carcinogen interferes with a dividing cell， causing it to produce daughter cells with un-balanced chromosomes. These aneuploid cells usually die of their deformities. If the damage is minor， however， they may survive yet become genetically unstable， so that the chromosomes are al tered further in the next cell division. The cells in tumors thus show a variety of mutations to the genes and the chromosomes.\n【save__datas】\t【477】\tBecause each chromosome hosts thousands of genes， aneu-ploidy creates massive genetic chaos inside the cell. “The cell be-comes essentially a whole new species unto itself，”Duesberg says Any new “species”of cell is extremely unlikely to do better in the body than a native human cell-and that may explain why tu mors take so long to develop even after intense exposure to a car-cinogen， he argues. The aneuploid cells must go through many divisions， evolving at each one， before they hit on a combination that can grow more or less uncontrollably anywhere in the body\n【save__datas】\t【478】\tSo far Duesberg has only a scattering of experimental evi-dence to support his hypothesis. In 1998 he showed that there is a roughly 50-50 chance that a highly aneuploid human can-cer cell will gain or lose a chromosome each time it divides. Last December he reported that aneuploid hamster cells quickly de-veloped resistance to multiple drugs-a hallmark of cancer-whereas normal cells from the same culture did not.\n【save__datas】\t【479】\tBut it isn’t easy to do experiments when every one of his last22 grant proposals to nonprivate funding agencies was reject-ed， he says. Although Duesberg maintained a facade of defiance in Milan， he acknowledged in a moment of fatigue that “it is de-pressing that even private foundations are unwilling to fund re-search that has high risk but high potential payoff.”\n【save__datas】\t【480】\tHis mood had lifted somewhat by May， when I visited his lab. A letter from Abraham Katz tacked to the door stated thai his request was approved： he would be getting $100，000， enough to keep the lab running for another nine months.\n【save__datas】\t【481】\tIt seems unlikely that nine months will be enough to per suade other researchers to take his aneuploidy hypothesis seri-ously. But it is possible. Numerous papers in major journals this year have pointed out the importance of “chromosome insta-bility，”a synonymous phrase， in cancer formation. Lengauer and Bert Vogelstein， also at Johns Hopkins， have been particu-larly active in promoting the idea that aneuploidy—which Lengauer insists must be a consequence of gene mutations-may be a necessary step for any tumor to progress.\n【save__datas】\t【484】\tG0Forth ang Replicate\n【save__datas】\t【485】\tBirds do it， bees do it， but could machines do it?

Today it takes an elaborate manufacturing ap-paratus to build even a simple machine. Could we endow an ar-tificial device with the ability to multiply on its own? Self-repli-cation has long been considered one of the fundamental prop-erties separating the living from the nonliving. Historically our limited understanding of how biological reproduction works has given it an aura of mystery and made it seem unlikely that it would ever be done by a man-made object. It is reported that when Rene Descartes averred to Queen Christina of Sweden that animals were just another form of mechanical automata， Her Majesty pointed to a clock and said， “See to it that it pro-duces offspring.”\n【save__datas】\t【487】\tThe problem of machine self-replication moved from phi-losophy into the realm of science and engineering in the late1940s with the work of eminent mathematician and physicist John von Neumann. Some researchers have actually construct-ed physical replicators. Forty years ago， for example， geneticist Lionel Penrose and his son， Roger (the famous physicist)， built small assemblies of plywood that exhibited a simple form of self-replication \\[see“Self-Reproducing Machines，\"by Lionel\n【save__datas】\t【489】\tImplemented on a computer， cellular automata can simu-late a huge variety of self-replicators in what amount to austere universes with different laws of physics from our own. Such models free researchers from having to worry about logistical issues such as energy and physical construction so that they can focus on the fundamental questions of information flow. How is a living being able to replicate unaided， whereas mechanical objects must be constructed by humans? How does replication at the level of an organism emerge from the numerous interac-tions in tissues， cells and molecules? How did Darwinian evo-lution give rise to self-replicating organisms?\n【save__datas】\t【491】\tBy Moshe Sipper and James A. Reggia Photoillustrations by David Emmite--connect--【492】facturing molecular-scale machines， and proponents of space exploration see a macroscopic version of the process as a way to colonize planets using in situ ma-terials. Recent advances have given cre-dence to these futuristic-sounding ideas. As with other scientific disciplines， includ-ing genetics， nuclear energy and chemistry， those ofus who study self-replication face the twofold challenge of creating replicat-ing machines and avoiding dystopian pre---connect--【493】scription could be used in two distinct ways： first， as the instructions whose in-terpretation leads to the construction of an identical copy of the device； next， as data to be copied， uninterpreted， and attached to the newly created child so that it too possesses the ability to self-replicate. With this two-step process， the self-description need not contain a description of itself. In the architectural analogy， the blueprint would include a plan for building a pho---connect--【494】the cellular-automata world. All decisions and actions take place locally； cells do not know directly what is happening outside their immediate neighborhood.\n【save__datas】\t【495】\tThe apparent simplicity of cellular au-tomata is deceptive； it does not implyease of design or poverty of behavior. The most famous automata， John Horton Conway’s Game of Life， produces amaz-ingly intricate patterns.

Once the new studio and the photocopier were built， the con-struction crew would simply run off a copy of the blueprint and put it into the new studio.\n【save__datas】\t【502】\tLiving cells use their self-description， which biologists call the genotype， in ex-actly these two ways： transcription (DNA is copied mostly uninterpreted to form mRNA) and translation (mRNA is inter-preted to build proteins). Von Neumann made this transcription-translation dis-tinction several years before molecularbi-ologists did， and his work has been crucial in understanding self-replication in nature.\n【save__datas】\t【503】\tTo prove these ideas， von Neumann and mathematician Stanislaw M. Ulam came up with the idea of cellular au-tomata. A cellular-automata simulation involves a chessboardlike grid of squares， or cells， each of which is either empty or occupied by one of several possible com-ponents. At discrete intervals of time. each cell looks at itself and its neighbors and decides whether to metamorphose into a different component. In making this decision， the cell follows relatively simple rules， which are the same for all cells. These rules constitute the basic physics of--connect--【505】can self-organize.

Heisinterested mainly in bio-inspired computa-tional paradigms such as evolutionary computation，self-replicating systems and cellularcom-puting.Reggia is a professor of computer science and neurology， working in the Institute for Ad-vanced Computer Studies at the University of Maryland.In addition to studying self-replication，--connect--【507】he conducts research on computational models ofthe brain and its disorders， such as stroke.\n【save__datas】\t【509】\tCopy Machines\n【save__datas】\t【511】\tGoing to the other extreme， it is easy to find trivial examples of self-replication Forexample， suppose a cellular automata has only one type of component， labeled+， and that each cell follows only a single rule： if exactly one of the four neighboring\n【save__datas】\t【513】\tSuch weedlike proliferation does not shed much light on the principles ofrepli-cation， because there is no significant ma-chine.Ofcourse， that invites the question of how you would tell a “significant”ma-chine from a trivially prolific automata. No one has yet devised a satisfactory an-swer. What is clear， however， is that the replicating structure must in some sense be complex. For example， it must consist of multiple， diverse components whose interactions collectively bring about repli-cation-the proverbial “whole must be greater than the sum of the parts.\" The existence of multiple distinct components permits a self-description to be stored within the replicating structure.\n【save__datas】\t【514】\tIn the years since von Neumann’s sem-inal work， many researchers have probed the domain between the complex and the trivial， developing replicators that require fewer components， less space or simpler rules. A major step forward was taken in1984 when Christopher G. Langton， then at the University of Michigan， observed that looplike storage devices-which had formed modules of earlier self-replicating machines-could be programmed to repli-cate on their own. These devices typically consist of two pieces： the loop itself， which is a string of components that cir-culate around a rectangle， and a con-struction arm， which protrudes from a corner of the rectangle into the surround-ing space. The circulating components constitute a recipe for the loop-for ex-ample， “go three squares ahead， then turn left.”When this recipe reaches the con-struction arm， the automata rules make a copy of it. One copy continues around the loop； the other goes down the arm， where it is interpreted as instructions.\n【save__datas】\t【515】\tBy giving up the requirement of uni-versal construction， which was central to von Neumann’s approach， Langton showed that a replicator could be con-structed from just seven unique compo-nents occupying only 86 cells. Even small-er and simpler self-replicating loops have been devised by one of us (Reggia) and our colleagues \\[see box on next page\\].Be---connect--【516】cause they have multiple interacting com-ponents and include a self-description， they are not trivial. Intriguingly， asym-metry plays an unexpected role： the rules governing replication are often simpler when the components are not rotational-ly symmetric than when they are.\n【save__datas】\t【517】\tEmergent Replication--connect--【519】ticular type of structure， researchers have experimented with various sets of rules， filled the cellular-automata grid with a“primordial soup”of randomly selected components and checked whether self-replicators emerged spontaneously.\n【save__datas】\t【520】\tIn 1997 Hui-Hsien Chou， now at Iowa State University， and Reggia noticed that as long as the initial density of the free-floating components was above a cer-tain threshold， small self-replicating loops reliably appeared. Loops that collided un-derwent annihilation， so there was an on-going process of death as well as birth. Over time， loops proliferated， grew in size and evolved through mutations triggered by debris from past collisions. Although the automata rules were deterministic. these mutations were effectively random，--connect--【521】because the system was complex and the components started in random locations.\n【save__datas】\t【522】\tSuch loops are intended as abstract machines and not as simulacra of any-thing biological， but it is interesting to compare them with biomolecular struc-tures. A loop loosely resembles circular DNA in bacteria， and the construction arm acts as the enzyme that catalyzes DNA replication. More important， repli-cating loops illustrate how complex glob-al behaviors can arise from simple local in---connect--【523】teractions. For example， components move around a loop even though the rules say nothing about movement； what is ac-tually happening is that individual cells are coming alive， dying or metamorphosing in such a way that a pattern is eliminated from one position and reconstructed else-where-a process that we perceive as mo-tion. In short， cellular automata act local-ly but appear to think globally. Much the same is true of molecular biology.\n【save__datas】\t【524】\tIn a recent computational experiment，\n【save__datas】\t【526】\tThe most challenging aspect of this work was the definition of the so-called\n【save__datas】\t【529】\tThe knight and bishop represent the self-description：the knight， whose orientation is significant， determines which direction to grow， while the bishop tags along and determines how long the side of the loop should be. The pawns are fillers that define the rest of the shape of the loop， and the rook is a transient signal to guide the growth of a new construction arm.\n【save__datas】\t【530】\tAs time progresses， the knight and bishop circulate counterclockwise around the loop.Wheneverthey encounter the arm， one copy goes out the arm while the original continues around the loop.\n【save__datas】\t【532】\tThe direction in which a knight faces is significant. In the drawings here， we use standard chess conventions to indicate the orientation of the knight： the horse’s muzzle points forward. If no rule explicitly applies， the contents of the square stay the same. Squares on the edge should be treated as if they have adjacent empty squares off the board.\n【save__datas】\t【534】\tINITIALLY， the self-description， or“genome”-a knight followed by a bishop-is poised at the start of the construction arm.\n【save__datas】\t【535】\t1 The knight and bishop move counter-clockwise around the loop.Aclone of the knight heads out the arm.\n【save__datas】\t【536】\t2 The original knight-bishop pair continues to circulate.The bishop is cloned and follows the new knight out the arm.\n【save__datas】\t【537】\t3 The knighttriggers the formation of two corners of the child loop. The bishop tags along，completing the gene transfer.\n【save__datas】\t【538】\t4The knight forges--connect--【539】the remaining corner of--connect--【540】the child loop. The loops--connect--【541】are connected by the--connect--【542】construction arm and a--connect--【543】knight-errant.--connect--【544】fitness function-the criteria by which sets of rules were judged， thus separating good solutions from bad ones and driving the evolutionary process toward rule sets that facilitated replication. You cannot simply assign high fitness to those sets of rules that cause a structure to replicate， because none of the initial rule sets is like-ly to allow for replication. The solution was to devise a fitness function composed of a weighted sum of three measures： a growth measure (the extent to which--connect--【545】each component type generates an in-creasing supply of that component)，a rel-ative position measure (the extent to which neighboring components stay to\n【save__datas】\t【547】\t\\---connect--【549】gether) and a replicant measure (a func-tion of the number of actual replicators present). With the right fitness function， evolution can turn rule sets that are ster-ile into ones that are fecund； the process usually takes 150 or so generations.\n【save__datas】\t【550】\tSelf-replicating structures discovered in this fashion work in a fundamentally--connect--【551】different way than self-replicating loops do. For example， they move and deposit copies along the way-unlike replicating loops， which are essentially static. And al-though these newly discovered replicators consist of multiple， locally interacting com-ponents， they do not have an identifiable self-description-there is no obvious ge nome. The ability to replicate without a self-description may be relevant to ques tions about how the earliest biological--connect--【554】to the left of the knight， replace the--connect--【555】knight with another bishop.\n【save__datas】\t【556】\tOTHERWISE， if at least one of the--connect--【557】neighboring squares is occupied，--connect--【558】remove the knight and leave the--connect--【559】square empty.--connect--【562】knight with a certain orientation， as follows：--connect--【564】away from the pawn， the new knight--connect--【565】faces the opposite way.\n【save__datas】\t【566】\tOTHERWISE， if there is exactly one neighboring pawn， the new knight faces that pawn.\n【save__datas】\t【567】\tOTHERWISE the new knight faces in the same direction as the neighboring knight.--connect--【571】and either faces the empty square， fill--connect--【573】the square with a rook.--connect--【575】and it faces the square， fill the square--connect--【576】with a knight rotated 90 degrees--connect--【577】counterclockwise.--connect--【579】left side faces the square， and the--connect--【580】other neighbors are empty， fill the square--connect--【581】with a pawn.\n【save__datas】\t【583】\t盒 other neighbors are empty， fill the square--connect--【584】with a pawn.--connect--【586】fill the square with a knight facing--connect--【587】the fourth， empty neighbor.\n【save__datas】\t【588】\t5 The knight-errant moves up to endow the parent witha new arm. A similar process，one step delayed，begins for the child loop.\n【save__datas】\t【589】\t6The knight-errant， togetherwiththe original knight-bishop pair，conjures up a rook.Meanwhilethe old arm is erased.\n【save__datas】\t【596】\tThe rook kills the knight and generates the new， upward arm. Another rook prepares to do the same for the child.\n【save__datas】\t【597】\t8At last the two loops are separate and whole.The sef-descriptions continue to circulate， but otherwise all is calm.\n【save__datas】\t【598】\t9The parent prepares to give birth again. In the following step， the child too will begin to replicate.\n【save__datas】\t【599】\tThe problem with these systems， though， is that they rely on centralized control. What if that control unit goes bad?\n【save__datas】\t【600】\tNature has solved that problem through radicaldecentral-ization. Cells in the body are all basically identical；each takes on a specialized task， performs it autonomously and， in the event of infection or failure，commits hara-kiri so that its tasks can be taken up by new cells.These arethe attributes that Mange， a professor at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology here， and others have sought since 1993to emulate in circuitry， as part of the \"Embryonics\" \\[embryonic electronics\\] project.\n【save__datas】\t【601】\tOne of theirearlierinventions， the MICTREE \\[microinstruction tree\\] artificial cell， consisted of a simple processor and four bits of data storage. The cell is contained in a plastic box roughly the size of a pack of Post-its. Electrical contacts run along the sides so that cells can be snapped together like Legos. As in cellular automata， the models used to study the theory of self-replication， the MICTREE cells are connected only to their immediate neighbors.The communication burden on each cell is thus independent of the total number of cells. The system， in otherwords， is easily scalable-unlike many parallel-computing architectures.\n【save__datas】\t【602】\tCells follow the instructions in their\"genome，\"a program written in a subset of the Pascal computerlanguage. Like their biologicalantecedents， the cells all contain the exact same genome and execute part of it based on their position within the array， which each cell calculates relative to its neighbors.Waste---connect--【603】ful though it may seem， this redundancy allows the array to withstand the loss of any cell.Whenever someone presses the KILL button on a cell，that cellshuts down， and its left and right neigh-bors become directly connected. The right neighbor recalculates its position and starts executing the deceased's program.Its tasks， in turn， are taken up by the next cell to the right， and so on， until a cell designated as a spare is pressedinto service.\n【save__datas】\t【604】\tWriting programs for any parallel processor is tricky， but the MICTREE array requires an especially unconventional approach. Instead of giving explicit instructions， the programmer must devise simple rules out of which the desired function will emerge. Being Swiss，Mange demonstrates by building a superreliable stopwatch. Displaying minutes and seconds requires four cells in a row， one for each digit. The genome allows for two cell types： a counter from zero to nine and a counter from zero to five. An oscillatorfeeds one pulse persecond into the rightmost cell. After 10 pulses， this cell cycles back to zero and sends a pulse to the cell on its left， and so on down the line. The watch takes up part of an array of 12 cells； when you kill one， the clocktransplants itself one cell over and carries on. Obviously，though， there is a limit to its resilience：the whole thing will failafter， at most，eight kills.--connect--【606】known as MUXTREE \\[multiplexer tree\\]， that is optimized for artificial cells. In the biological metaphor， the components ofthis array are the \"molecules\"that constitute a cell. Each consists of a logic gate， a data bit and a string of configuration bits that determines the function of this gate.\n【save__datas】\t【607】\tBuilding a cell out of such molecules offers not only flexibility but also extra endurance.Each molecule contains two copies of the gate and three of the storage bit. Ifthe two gates ever give different results， the molecule kills itself for the greater good of the cell. As a last gasp， the molecule sends its data bit \\[preserved by the triplicate storage\\] and configuration to its right neighbor， which does the same，and the process continues until the right-most molecule transfers its data to a spare. This second level of fault tolerance prevents a single error from wiping out an entire cell.\n【save__datas】\t【608】\tAtotal of 2，000 molecules， divided into four 20-by-25 cells， make up the BioWall-the giant digital clock that Mange's team has just put on display. Each molecule is enclosed in a small box and includes a KILL button and an LED display. Some molecules are configured to perform computations； others serve as pixels in the clock display. Making liberal use of the KILL buttons， I did my utmost to crash the system，something I’m usually quite good at. But the plucky clock just wouldn’t submit. The clock display did start to look funny-numerals bent over as their pixels shifted to the right-but at least it was still legible， unlike most faulty electronic signs.\n【save__datas】\t【609】\tThat said， the system did suffer from display glitches，which Mange attributed mainly to timing problems. Although the pro-cessing power is decentralized， the cells still rely on a central oscillatorto coordinate their communications； sometimes they fall out of sync. AnotherEmbryonics team， led by Andy Tyrrell ofthe University of York in England， has been studying making the cells asynchronous， like their biological counterparts. Cells would generate handshaking signals to orchestrate data transfers. The present system is also unable to catch certain types of error including damaged configuration strings.Tyrrell's team has proposed adding watchdog molecules-animmune system-that would monitorthe configurations \\[and one another\\] for defects.\n【save__datas】\t【610】\tAlthough these systems demand an awful lot of overhead， so do other fault-tolerance technologies.\"While Embryonics appears to be heavy on redundancy， it actually is not that bad when compared to other systems，\"Tyrrell argues.Moreover， MUXTREE should be easier to scale down to the nano level； the\"molecules” are simple enough to really be molecules. Says Mange， \"We are preparing for the situation where electronics will be at the same scale as biology.\"\n【save__datas】\t【611】\tOn a philosophical level， Embryonics comes very close to the dream of building a self-replicating machine. It may not be quite as dramatic as a robot that can go down to Radio Shack， pull parts off the racks， and take them home to resolder a connection or build a loving mate. But the effect is much the same. Letting machines determine their own destiny-whether reconfiguring themselves on a silicon chip or reprogramming themselves using a neural network or genetic algorithm-sounds scary， but perhaps we should be gratified that machines are becoming more like us：imperfect， fallible but stubbornly resourceful.\n【save__datas】\t【612】\t\\-George Musser， imperfect but resourceful staffeditor and writer--connect--【613】replicators originated.

A major ad-vance has been the development of simple yet useful replicators. In 1995 Gianluca Tempesti of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne simplified the loop self-description so it could be inter-laced with a small program-in this case， one that would spell the acronym of his lab，“LSL.” His insight was to create au-tomata rules that allow loops to replicate in two stages. First the loop， like Langton’s loop， makes a copy of itself. Once finished， the daughter loop sends a signal back to its parent， at which point the parent sends the instructions for writing out the letters.\n【save__datas】\t【624】\tDrawing letters was just a demonstra-tion. The following year Jean-Yves Perri-er， Jacques Zahnd and one of us (Sipper) designed a self-replicating loop with uni-versal computational capabilities-that is， with the computational power of a uni-versal Turing machine， a highly simplified but fully capable computer. This loop has two “tapes，” or long strings of compo---connect--【625】pression can be assigned values such that the entire expression evaluates to “true.”This problem is NP-complete-in other words， it belongs to the family of nasty puzzles， including the famous traveling-salesman problem， for which there is no known efficient solution.

During replication， the solutions mu-tated， and replicators with promising so-lutions were allowed to proliferate while those with failed solutions died out.\n【save__datas】\t【626】\tAlthough various teams have created cellular automata in electronic hardware. such systems are probably too wasteful for practical applications； automata were nev-er really intended to be implemented di-rectly.

But an exotic form of space ice can actually promote the creation of organic molecules-and may have seeded life on Earth\n【save__datas】\t【645】\tAnd yet there is a cruel dichotomy about water’s nature. Liquid wa-ter cradles life， but water in its solid crystalline form destroys it. Organ-isms can roost in geysers， wallow in brine and gulp down acid， but they recoil from ice. The rigid ordering of water molecules in ice crystals expels11impurities and tears organic tissue beyond repair. Such is the nature of ice on Earth. Yet recent discoveries about an unusual kind of frozen wa-ter that is absent from Earth but ubiquitous in interstellar space have in-spired scientists to revise their assumptions about ice. In its interstellar form， water ice (as distinct from icy forms of carbon dioxide or other com-pounds) can harbor the kind of simple organic compounds from which life arose-and may even encourage their formation. As a result， this in-terstellar ice may actually have played an intrinsic role in the origins of life.\n【save__datas】\t【647】\tMany planetary scientists have gone further， arguing that the ice-bound organics could have hitched a ride to Earth. When a cold molec-ular cloud collapsed to form our solar system 4.5 billion years ago， as the theory goes， some of the cloud’s ice would have coalesced into comets. These balls of ice and rock could then have carried the organic com-pounds on a collision course with the young Earth. After reaching this planet， the organics could have participated in the chemical reactions from which the first living organisms arose.\n【save__datas】\t【649】\tThis scenario has offered a compelling explanation for how organic compounds could have been delivered to Earth， but until recently no one--connect--【651】knew how they first formed in interstellar space. Now scruti-ny of water’s behavior at temperatures near absolute zero(where all molecular motion ceases) has revealed that subtle changes in the structure of the ice sparked the first association of carbon， nitrogen and other biologically crucial elements.\n【save__datas】\t【652】\tSpaced Out\n【save__datas】\t【654】\tMost solids exist naturally in crystalline form， with their molecules arrayed in a well-ordered structure.

This process is best known from the manufac-turing of glass， which is an amorphous form of silica. Al-though rapid cooling works for making amorphous silica， it does not work for liquid water. Water droplets tend to crys-tallize even when cooled rapidly. As a result， amorphous ice was discovered only when， in 1935， scientists investigated the behavior of water vapor deposited slowly in a vacuum.\n【save__datas】\t【660】\tThis discovery was of special interest to astronomers， be-cause they knew that water behaves differently in the vacuum of space than it does on Earth. Most people know that a wa-ter molecule consists of one oxygen atom chemically bonded to two atoms of hydrogen. But what makes water such a mu-table substance is that the oxygen atom has two negatively charged， paired electrons that can form weak bonds with the positively charged hydrogen atoms of a nearby water mole cule. At temperatures below freezing， the water molecules move into their most stable configurations， thus strengthen-ing the so-called hydrogen bonds， and the resulting ice be-comes neatly organized over many hundreds of molecules.\n【save__datas】\t【661】\tThe particular stacking pattern that develops as water freezes depends on pressure. The pattern forms one of 12known phases of crystalline water ice， but only one-hexag-onal ice-occurs naturally on Earth. The oxygen atoms form a sixfold pattern， which we see in the shape of snowflakes. At temperatures well below freezing， the oxygen atoms can stack in a cubic pattern or， as in the case of amorphous ice， can even be prevented from forming any noticeable order at all.\n【save__datas】\t【662】\tMuch of the bonding network that is characteristic of crystalline ice also binds molecules of liquid water. The es-sential difference-and the one that is critical for life-is that the hydrogen bonds in liquid water redistribute rapidly and constantly. Liquid water is thus capable of adjusting its struc-ture to accommodate the physical and chemical requirements of living things. Just as an air bubble can rise through water but not through solid ice， organic molecules must be able to travel between water molecules if they are going to recombine into more complex compounds.\n【save__datas】\t【663】\tPerhaps the most exciting property of interstellar amor-phous ice is that when exposed to radiation such as that found in deep space， it too can flow-even though its temperature is a scant few degrees above absolute zero (which is equiva-lent to -273 degrees Celsius). Indeed， the similarity of this ice to liquid water allows it to participate in the creation of or-ganic compounds. Researchers first began to suspect this sim-ilarity in the early 1970s， as they investigated the chemistry of ice in the heart of cold molecular clouds in interstellar space. Early experiments of that era by the pioneering laboratory sci-entists J. Mayo Greenberg of Leiden University in the Nether-lands and Louis J. Allamandola of the Ames research center demonstrated that as much as 10 percent ofthe volume of in-terstellar ice grains is composed of simple molecules such as carbon dioxide， carbon monoxide， methanol and ammonia.\n【save__datas】\t【664】\tSince then， specialized telescopes that observe infrared and submillimeter radiation-which can penetrate larger amounts--connect--【666】of dust and gas than visible light can-have enabled as-tronomers to detect more than 100 different organic com-pounds in cold molecular clouds. By comparing the infrared spectra of clouds in space with similar measurements of in-terstellar ice made in the laboratory， scientists came to suspect that many of the organic compounds originated in interstel-lar ice grains frozen on cores of silicate or carbon. In dense molecular clouds， these dust cores are no larger than one ten-thousandth of a millimeter.\n【save__datas】\t【667】\tDespite these painstaking observations， researchers still had no explanation for how the organic molecules could en-dure and react within the ice. The importance ofice’s anom-alous material properties to organic synthesis became appar-ent only in 1993 when we began studying its low-pressure forms at the Space Science Microscopy Laboratory at Ames. We made films of ice just a few hundred molecules thick by freezing water vapor inside a specially modified cryogenic transmission electron microscope \\[see photograph above\\]. To monitor changes in the ice’s shape and structure， we record---connect--【669】ed high-magnification images and electron-diffraction pat terns as the ice warmed or cooled.\n【save__datas】\t【670】\tWhen the temperature in our cryogenic microscope was low enough (below 30 kelvins) and when the water molecules were deposited slowly enough (fewer than 100 microns an hour)， we created an amorphous solid very similar to the structures of interstellar ice that are interpreted from infrared spectra. Our experiments showed that this ice was in a special high-density form， known until then only from one uncon-firmed x-ray-diffraction experiment conducted in 1976. We confirmed that water vapor deposited at about 14 degrees above absolute zero had a different amorphous structure than a similar deposit formed at a warmer temperature of 77 K. In-deed， we could follow the transition from the low-tempera ture form into the higher-temperature form as we gradually warmed the ice. We could best explain the diffraction patterns of the low-temperature form if we assumed that some water molecules were frozen inside the partially formed cages of neighboring molecules. This overpacking of oxygen atoms yields high-density amorphous ice， which at 1.1 grams per cu-bic centimeter is about 15 percent denser than ordinary ice.\n【save__datas】\t【671】\tWe also confirmed the 1984 findings of H. G. Heide， then at the Fritz Haber Institute of the Max Planck Society in Berlin， who bombarded high-density amorphous ice with high-energy electrons. When he conducted this experiment at temperatures below 30 K， the ice restructured rapidly； in fact， it flowed. The discovery that amorphous ice is more like liq-uid water than it is like crystalline ice came as a huge surprise. Most scientists had previously assumed that all forms of wa-terice， when cooled below a few tens of kelvins， would remain unchanged nearly indefinitely. Heide had found that， irre-spective of its initial structure， the ice would transform into the high-density amorphous form once it was irradiated. Oth-er researchers have since discovered that ultraviolet photons， which frequently irradiate cold molecular clouds， can also change the ice’s structure in this manner.\n【save__datas】\t【672】\tDrawing on our experiments at Ames， we reasoned that this radiation converts most interstellar ice into the high-den sity amorphous form. We now understand that overpacked water molecules in this ice， and the defects that exist within the molecular stacking pattern， facilitate molecular mobility within the structure. As a result， it is within interstellar ice that the biologically important elements carbon， oxygen and ni-trogen joined together for the first time to form organic com-pounds. Studies show that exposing high-density amorphous ice to energetic particles or photons breaks impurities such as carbon monoxide and ammonia into radicals that can migrate within the ice until they combine with other reactive species.\n【save__datas】\t【673】\tOnce we had established a reasonable mechanism for the origin of organic compounds within interstellar ice， we won-dered how such materials could have been preserved over the times and distances necessary to reach Earth. The best can-didates for this duty are comets-relicts of the icy planetesi-mals that coalesced during the gravitational collapse of acold--connect--【675】molecular cloud during the formation of our solar system. During that process， temperatures near the protosun were high enough to convert all but the most heat-resistant ele一-一ments and compounds into gas. In the cooler regions of the solar nebula outside the orbit of Jupiter， however， amor-phous ice and the organic compounds that were generated within it could have been preserved as the dust coalesced into comets and other planetesimals.\n【save__datas】\t【676】\tEarthbound\n【save__datas】\t【678】\tBelow this critical temperature range， called the glass transi-tion， the material resists deformation and behaves like a sol-id； above this range， it can be molded and shaped. The vis-cosity of the liquid just above the glass transition tempera-ture， though， is more like cold molasses than ordinary liquid water. A motion that would take one second in liquid water would require 100，000 years in the viscous variety. Still， that is not a long time in the life of a comet.\n【save__datas】\t【679】\tUntil our discovery， this unusual form of liquid water was thought to be rare in space. Most researchers had assumed that water at this temperature would crystallize rapidly into cubic ice， but we found that between 150 and 200 K the vis-cous liquid can coexist indefinitely with the cubic ice. This liq-uid is therefore a potentially important component of the sur-faces of comets and the icy moons of neighboring planets， all of which lie within this temperature range.

The gases must instead have been trapped within the structure of the ice， but how?\n【save__datas】\t【682】\tDuring comet formation， the ice warms and is therefore not likely to retain its high-density amorphous structure. Rather the slight warming will transform the structure into the low-density amorphous form. In our cryogenic experi-ments we learned that the transition occurs gradually between35 and 65 K. Hydrogen bonds break and re-form during this process， allowing for the movement and chemical recombi\n【len<10_filter】\t【684】\t\\-\n【save__datas】\t【685】\t\\---connect--【686】nation of molecular fragments within the ice. Not until the ice warms enough to crystallize are volatile molecules excluded from the water structure and expelled into space.\n【save__datas】\t【687】\tWhen studying how crystallization depends on time and temperature， we found that the first stage of true crystalliza-tion begins at about 135 K and forces water molecules to be-come stacked in a cubic pattern \\[see box on page 51\\]. Organic molecules would not survive in this cubic ice， but we also dis-covered that a distinct amorphous component remains even when the ice warms. Only about one third of the total volume of ice ever crystallizes； the balance remains in a disordered structure that differs very little from the high- and low-densi-ty amorphous varieties.\n【save__datas】\t【688】\tBefore we conducted our experiments， researchers were aware that amorphous ice turns into a viscous liquid between125 and 136K. Within this range the warming rate of the ice changes abruptly-a phenomenon well known from the study of other amorphous materials such as window glass.--connect--【689】pounds over time-perhaps even until the comet reached Earth's orbit.\n【save__datas】\t【690】\tAnd that brings us back to the more familiar form of wa-ter ice on Earth. Further warming of the mixture of cubic ice and viscous liquid water to about 200 K (still a bone-chilling-73 degrees C) will lead to a complete restructuring of the ice into its earthly hexagonal form. During this recrystallization， all remaining impurities-including organic compounds are excluded from the solid. From this point on， ice is much as we know it： the ice of snowflakes， glaciers and ice cubes. But fortunately， the organics now have a new place to find shelter： in the liquid water found nearly everywhere on Earth.\n【save__datas】\t【692】\tSolar System Ices. B. Schmitt， C. DeBergh and M.

Dissecting life into ever smaller pieces-organisms to organs， tissues to cells， chromosomes to DNA to genes-scientists at last hit the limit. They identified each molecular rung on the chemical ladders of the majority of the human genome.

It is clear that computer models--connect--【716】will be the main tools with which all the biochemical pieces will be placed into a complete theory. But if the variety of“virtual cells” under development is any indication， there is no consensus yet on how best to use those tools.\n【save__datas】\t【717】\t“People are imagining that this is the final step，\" observes Drew Endy of the Molecular Sciences Institute at the Uni-versity of California at Berkeley.“We have the complete parts list for a human being.

In fact， he says，“Nothing could be further from the truth.\"\n【save__datas】\t【718】\tEndy speaks as one who learned the hard way. In 1994 he and John Yin ofthe University of Wisconsin-Madison began programming a computer model that would incorporate virtually everything known about the way that a certain virus， T7 bacteriophage， infects Escherichia coli bacteria that live in the human gut. The virus looks like a lunar lander. It uses clawlike appendages to grasp the outer wall of a bacterium as the phage injects its DNA into the cell. The genetic material hijacks the cell’s own reproductive appa-ratus， forcing it to churn out bacterio-phage clones until it bursts.\n【save__datas】\t【719】\tEndy and Yin’s model simulated\n【save__datas】\t【720】\tOverview/Virtual Cells\n【save__datas】\t【721】\t■Biologists have sequenced the genomes of many simple microorganisms-including germs that sicken humans.

This one didn’t.\n【save__datas】\t【725】\tMany early attempts to re-create life in silico suffered the same problem. And so most biologists still use computers as little more than receptacles for the surge of data gushing from their robotic sequencers and gene chip analyzers. The “models\" they publish in their journal articles are sketchy caricatures based on the best theory they have： the central dogma that a gene in DNA is converted to an RNA that is trans-lated to a protein that performs a particu lar biochemical function.\n【save__datas】\t【726】\tBut the past few years have seen a growing movement among mathemati-cally minded biologists to challenge the central dogma as simplistic and to use computer simulation to search for a more--connect--【727】powerful theory. “We’re witnessing a grand-scale Kuhnian revolution in biolo-gy，\" avers Bernhard 0.

One reason those technologies haven’t paid off as hoped， he says， is that they are “based on the naive idea that you can redirect the cell in a way that you want it to go by sending in a drug that in-hibits only one protein.\"The central dog-ma says that that should usually work. But nine times out of 10 it doesn’t.\n【save__datas】\t【729】\tConsider， too， Bailey urges， that ge-neticists have engineered hundreds of“knockout”strains of bacteria and mice to disable a particular gene.

It is the stuff of headlines and horror films， draw-ing people in and mesmerizing them de-spite their aversion. Cannibalism repre-sents the ultimate taboo for many in Western societies-something to relegate to other cultures， other times， other places. Yet the understanding of cannibalism de-rived from the past few centuries of an-thropological investigation has been too unclear and incomplete to allow either a categorical rejection of the practice or a fuller appreciation of when， where and why it might have taken place.\n【save__datas】\t【787】\tNew scientific evidence is now bring-ing to light the truth about cannibalism. It has become obvious that long before the invention of metals， before Egypt's pyramids were built， before the origins of agriculture， before the explosion of Up-per Paleolithic cave art， cannibalism could be found among many different peoples-as well as among many of our ancestors. Broken and scattered human bones， in some cases thousands of them， have been discovered from the prehis-toric pueblos of the American Southwest to the islands of the Pacific. The osteolo-gists and archaeologists studying these ancient occurrences are using increasing ly sophisticated analytical tools and methods. In the past several years， the re---connect--【788】sults of their studies have finally provid-ed convincing evidence of prehistoric cannibalism.\n【save__datas】\t【789】\tHuman cannibalism has long in-trigued anthropologists， and they have worked for decades to classify the phe-nomenon. Some divide the behavior ac-cording to the affiliation of the con-sumed. Thus， endocannibalism refers to the consumption of individuals within a group，exocannibalism indicates the con-sumption of outsiders， and autocanni-balism covers everything from nail biting to torture-induced self-consumption. In addition， anthropologists have come up with classifications to describe perceived or known motivations. Survival canni-balism is driven by starvation. Histori-cally documented cases include the Don-ner Party-whose members were trapped during the harsh winter of 1846-47 in the Sierra Nevada-and people marooned in the Andes or the Arctic with no other food. In contrast， ritual cannibalism oc-curs when members of a family or com-munity consume their dead during funer-ary rites in order to inherit their qualities or honor their memory. And pathological--connect--【790】cannibalism is generally reserved for criminals who consume their victims or. more often， for fictional characters such as Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the\n【len<10_filter】\t【791】\tLambs.\n【save__datas】\t【792】\tDespite these distinctions， however， most anthropologists simply equate the term“cannibalism”with the regular， cul-turally encouraged consumption of hu-man flesh. This dietary， customary， gour met， gustatory or gastronomic cannibal-ism， as it is variously called， is the phe-nomenon on which ethnographers have focused much of their attention. In the age of ethnographic exploration-which lasted from the time of Greek historian Herodotus in about 400 B.C. to the early20th century-the non-Western world and its inhabitants were scrutinized by travelers， missionaries， military person-nel and anthropologists. These observers told tales of gastronomic human canni-balism in different places， from Meso-america to the Pacific islands to central Africa.\n【save__datas】\t【793】\tControversy has often accompanied these claims. Professional anthropologists participated in only the last few waves of\n【save__datas】\t【798】\tMany different types of damage can be seen on bones left by human cannibals. When this damage is identical to that seen on animal bones at the same sites， archaeologists infer that the human remains were processed in the same manner and for the same reason： for consumption.In these metatarsal \\[foot\\] bones from Mancos Canyon in Colorado， the spongy tissues at the ends were crushed so that fat could be removed.\\[All subsequent photographs of bones are from the same Anasazi site in Mancos.--connect--【799】these cultural contacts-those that began in the late 1800s. As a result， many of the historical accounts of cannibalism have come to be viewed skeptically. In 1937anthropologist Ashley Montagu stated that cannibalism was “pure traveler’s myth.”\n【save__datas】\t【800】\tIn 1979 anthropologist William Arens of the State University of New York at Stony Brook extended this argument by reviewing the ethnographic record of can-nibalism in his book The Man-Eating Myth. Arens concluded that accounts of cannibalism among people from the Aztec to the Maori to the Zulu were ei-ther false or inadequately documented. His skeptical assertion has subsequently been seriously questioned， yet he nonethe-less succeeded in identifying a significant gulf between these stories and evidence of cannibalism： “Anthropology has not maintained the usual standards of docu-mentation and intellectual rigor expected when other topics are being considered. Instead， it has chosen uncritically to lend its support to the collective representa-tions and thinly disguised prejudices of western culture about others.”\n【save__datas】\t【801】\tThe anthropologists whom Arens and Montagu were criticizing had not limit-ed themselves to commenting solely on contemporary peoples. Some had pro-\n【save__datas】\t【804】\tIn the century after Twain’s remarks. archaeologists and physical anthropolo-gists described the hominids Australo---connect--【806】neanderthalensis as cannibalistic.Accord-ing to some views， human prehistory from about three million years ago until very recently was rife with cannibalism.\n【save__datas】\t【807】\tIn the early 1980s， however， an im-portant critical assessment of these con clusions appeared. Archaeologist Lewis\n【save__datas】\t【808】\tBinford's book Bones： Ancient Men and\n【save__datas】\t【809】\tModern Myths argued that claims for ear-ly hominid cannibalism were unsound He built on the work of other prehistori-ans concerned with the composition，con text and modifications of Paleolithic bone assemblages. Binford emphasized the need to draw accurate inferences about past behaviors by grounding knowledge of the past on experiment and observation in the present. His influential work cou-pled skepticism with a plea for meth-odological rigor in studies of prehistoric cannibalism.\n【save__datas】\t【810】\tHigher Standards of Evidence\n【save__datas】\t【812】\tOne of the challenges facing archae-ologists， however， is the amazing variety of ways in which people dispose of their dead. Bodies may be buried， burned， placed on scaffolding， set adrift， put in tree trunks or fed to scavengers. Bones may be disinterred， washed， painted， buried in bundles or scattered on stones In parts of Tibet， future archaeologists will have difficulty recognizing any mor-tuary practice at all. There most corpses are dismembered and fed to vultures and other carnivores. The bones are then col-lected， ground into powder， mixed with barley and flour and again fed to vul-tures. Given the various fates of bones and bodies， distinguishing cannibalism from other mortuary practices can be quite tricky.\n【save__datas】\t【813】\tConsequently， scientists have set the standard for recognizing ancient canni-balism very high. They confirm the activ-ity when the processing patterns seen on human remains match those seen on the bones of other animals consumed for food. Archaeologists have long argued for such a comparison between human and faunal remains at a site. They reason that damage to animal bones and their ar-rangement can clearly show that the ani-mals had been slaughtered and eaten for food. And when human remains are un-earthed in similar cultural contexts， with similar patterns of damage， discard and preservation， they may reasonably be in-terpreted as evidence of cannibalism.\n【save__datas】\t【814】\tWhen one mammal eats another， it usually leaves a record of its activities in the form of modifications to the con-sumed animal’s skeleton. During life， varying amounts of soft tissue， much of it with nutritive value， cover mammalian bones. When the tissue is removed and prepared， the bones often retain a record of this processing in the form of gnawing marks and fractures. When humans eat--connect--【815】ence ofcannibalism is strengthened. Judg-ing which patterns are consistent with di-1etary butchery can be based on the asso-ciated archaeological record-particular-ly the nonhuman food-animal remains discovered in sites formed by the same culture-and checked against predictions embedded in ethnohistorical accounts.\n【save__datas】\t【816】\tThis comparative system of deter-mining cannibalism emphasizes multiple lines of osteological damage and contex-tual evidence. And， as noted earlier， it sets the standard for recognizing canni-balism very high. With this approach， for instance， the presence of cut marks on bones would not by themselves be con-sidered evidence of cannibalism. For ex-ample， an American Civil War cemetery would contain skeletal remains with cut marks made by bayonets and swords， but this would not constitute evidence of cannibalism. Medical school cadavers are dissected， their bones cut-marked， but cannibalism is not part of this ritual.\n【save__datas】\t【817】\tWith the threshold set so conserva-tively， most instances of past cannibalism will necessarily go unrecognized. A prac---connect--【818】tice from Papua New Guinea， where can nibalism was recorded ethnographically， illustrates this point. There skulls of the deceased were carefully cleaned and the brains removed. The dry， mostly intact skulls were then handled extensively， of-ten creating a polish on their projecting parts. They were sometimes painted and even mounted on poles for display and worship. Soft tissue， including brain mat-ter， was eaten at the beginning of this process； thus， the practice would be iden-tified as ritual cannibalism. If such skulls were encountered in an archaeological context without modern informants de scribing the cannibalism， they would not constitute direct evidence for cannibalism under the stringent criteria that my col- leagues aadVOnd I advocate.\n【save__datas】\t【819】\tNevertheless， adoption of these stan-dards of evidence has led us to some clear determinations in other， older situations. The best indication of prehistoric canni-balism now comes from the archaeolog ical record of the American Southwest. where archaeologists have interpreted dozens of assemblages of human remains\n【save__datas】\t【820】\tOne of the challenges facing archaeologists is the amazing variety of ways in which people dispose of their dead.--connect--【821】other animals， however， they mark bones with more than just their teeth. They process carcasses with tools of stone or metal. In so doing， they leave imprints of their presence and actions in the form of scars on the bones. These same imprints can be seen on butchered human skeletal remains.\n【save__datas】\t【822】\tThe key to recognizing human canni-balism is to identify the patterns of pro-cessing-that is， the cut marks， hammer-ing damage， fractures or burns seen on the remains-as well as the survival of dif-ferent bones and parts of bones. Nutri-tionally valuable tissues， such as brains and marrow， reside within the bones and can be removed only with forceful ham-mering-and such forced entry leaves re-vealing patterns of bone damage. When human bones from archaeological sites show patterns of damage uniquely linked to butchery by other humans， the infer-\n【save__datas】\t【824】\tHack marks visible onthe left side of this fragment of a human tibia are testament to the removal of muscle andtendon.Tools were also used to make finer slices， to remove tissue orto severheads from bodies.\n【save__datas】\t【825】\tArchaeologists have to be careful in their interpretations， however， because humans process their dead in many ways； not all slice or hack marks indicate cannibalism.--connect--【826】as providing evidence of cannibalism. Compelling evidence has also been found in Neolithic and Bronze Age Europe. Even Europe’s earliest hominid site has yielded convincing evidence of cannibalism.\n【save__datas】\t【827】\tEarly European Cannibals\n【save__datas】\t【829】\tCannibalism among Europe’s much younger Neandertals-who lived be-tween 35，000 and 150，000 years ago-has been debated since the late 1800s. when the great Croatian paleoanthropol-ogist Dragutin Gorjanovic-Kramberger found the broken， cut-marked and scat-tered remains of more than 20 Neander-tals entombed in the sands of the Krapina rockshelter. Unfortunately， these soft fos-sil bones were roughly extracted by to-day's standards and then covered with thick layers of preservative， which ob-scured evidence of processing by stone tools and made interpretation of the re-mains exceedingly difficult. Some work-ers believe the Krapina Neandertal bones show clear signs of cannibalism； others have attributed the patterns of bone dam-age to falling rocks from the cave’s ceil-ing， to carnivore chewing or to some form of Neandertal burial. But recent analysis of the Krapina bones as well as those--connect--【830】from another Croatian cave， Vindija一which has younger Neandertal and ani-mal remains-indicates that cannibalism was practiced at both sites.\n【save__datas】\t【831】\tIn the past few years， yet another Ne-andertal site has offered support for the idea that some of these hominids prac-ticed cannibalism. On the banks of the Rhone River in southeastern France， Al-ban Defleur of the University of the Med-iterranean at Marseilles has been exca-vating the cave of Moula-Guercy for the past nine years. Neandertals occupied this small cave approximately 100，000ag0years ago. In one layer the team un-earthed the remains of at least six Nean-dertals， ranging in age from six years to adult. Defleur’s meticulous excavation and recovery standards have yielded data every bit the equivalent of a modern forensic crime scene investigation. Each fragment of fauna and Neandertal bone， each macrobotanical clue， each stone tool has been precisely plotted three-di-mensionally. This care has allowed an understanding of how the bones were spread around a hearth that has been cold for 1，000 centuries.\n【save__datas】\t【832】\tMicroscopic analysis of the Nean-dertal bone fragments and the faunal re-mains has led to the same conclusion that Spanish workers at the older Gran Dolina site have drawn： cannibalism was prac-ticed by some Paleolithic Europeans. But determining how often it was practiced and under what conditions represents a far more difficult challenge. Nevertheless， the frequency of cannibalism is striking. We know of just one very early European site with hominid remains， and those were cannibalized. The two Croatian Ne-andertal sites are separated by hundreds of generations， yet analyses suggest that cannibalism was practiced at both. And now a Neandertal site in France has sup-ported the same interpretation. These findings are built on exacting standards of evidence. Because of this， most paleo-anthropologists these days are asking“Why cannibalism?\"rather than“Was this cannibalism?”\n【save__datas】\t【833】\tSimilarly， recent discoveries at much younger sites in the American Southwest have altered the way anthropologists think of Anasazi culture in this area.--connect--【835】of cannibalism have been recorded for centuries in many corners of the globe. Although some involve well documented accounts by eyewitnesses-such as the Donner Party expedition-otheraccounts bu explorers，missionaries， travelers and soldiers often lack credibility. For example， these two artists portraits depict cannibalism catalyzed by starvation in China in the late 1800s and a European view of cannibalism in the New World \\[based on a woodcut from 14971.Such ethnohistorical accounts do not carry the weight of archaeological and forensic evidence.\n【save__datas】\t【836】\tThey may， however，serve as rich sources oftestable hypotheses， guiding future archaeologicalexcavations.\n【save__datas】\t【837】\tCorn agriculturists have inhabited the Four Corners region of the American Southwest for centuries， building their pueblos and spectacular cliff dwellings and leaving one of the richest and most fine-grained archaeological records any-where on earth. Christy G. Turner II of Arizona State University conducted pio neering work on unusual sets of broken and burned human skeletal remains from Anasazi sites in Arizona， New Mexico and Colorado in the 1960s and 1970s He saw a pattern suggestive of cannibal-ism： site after site containing human remains with the telltale signs. Yet little in the history of the area’s more recent Puebloan peoples suggested that canni-balism was a widespread practice， and some modern tribes who claim descent from the Anasazi have found claims of cannibalism among their ancestors disturbing.\n【save__datas】\t【838】\tThe vast majority of Anasazi burials involve whole， articulated skeletons fre-quently accompanied by decorated ce ramic vessels that have become a favorite target of pot hunters in this area. But， as Turner recorded， several dozen sites had fragmented， often burned human re-mains， and a larger pattern began to emerge. Over the past three decades the total number of human bone specimens from these sites has grown to tens of thousands， representing dozens of indi-viduals spread across 800 years of pre-history and tens of thousands of square kilometers of the American Southwest. The assemblage that I analyzed 10 years ago from an Anasazi site in the Mancos Canyon of southwestern Colorado， for instance， contained 2，106 pieces of bone from at least 29 Native American men.--connect--【839】women and children.\n【save__datas】\t【840】\tThese assemblages have been found in settlements ranging from small pueblos to large towns and were often contempora-neous with the abandonment of the dwellings. The bones frequently show ev-idence of roasting before the flesh was re-moved. They invariably indicate that peo-ple extracted the brain and cracked the limb bones for marrow after removing the muscle tissue. And some of the long bone splinters even show end-polishing， a phenomenon associated with cooking in--connect--【841】ceramic vessels. The bone fragments from Mancos revealed modifications that matched the marks left by Anasazi pro-cessing of game animals such as deer and bighorn sheep. The osteological evidence clearly demonstrated that humans were skinned and roasted， their muscles cut away， their joints severed， their long bones broken on anvils with hammer-stones， their spongy bones crushed and the fragments circulated in ceramic ves-sels. But articles outlining the results have proved controversial. Opposition to in-terpretations of cannibalism has some times seemed motivated more by politics than by science. Many practicing an-thropologists believe that scientific find-ings should defer to social sensitivities. For such anthropologists， cannibalism is so culturally delicate， so politically in-correct， that they find any evidence for it impossible to swallow.\n【save__datas】\t【842】\tThe most compelling evidence in sup-\n【save__datas】\t【844】\tIt is clear from the archaeological record that meat-fat or muscle orothertissue-on the bone was not the onlu part of the body that was consumed. Braincases were broken open，and marrow was often removed from long bones. In these two examples， stone hammers split the upper arm bones lengthwise，exposing the marrow.\n【save__datas】\t【845】\tIt remains much more difficult to establish why cannibalism took place than to establish that it did.--connect--【846】port of human cannibalism at Anasazi sites in the American Southwest was pub-lished last fall by Richard A. Marlar of the University of Colorado School of Medicine and his colleagues. The work-ers excavated three Anasazi pit dwellings dating to approximately A.D. 1150 at a site called Cowboy Wash near Mesa Verde in southwestern Colorado. The same pattern that had been documented at other sites such as Mancos was pres-ent： disarticulated， broken， scattered hu-man bones in nonburial contexts.Excel-lent preservation， careful excavation and thoughtful sampling provided a chemical dimension to the analysis and， finally，di-rect evidence of human cannibalism.\n【save__datas】\t【847】\tMarlar and his colleagues discovered residues of human myoglobin-a protein present in heart and skeletal muscle-on a ceramic vessel， suggesting that human flesh had been cooked in the pot. An un-burned human coprolite， or ancient feces， found in the fireplace of one of the aban-doned dwellings also tested positive for human myoglobin. Thus， osteological，ar---connect--【848】chaeological and biochemical data indi-cate that prehistoric cannibalism occurred at Cowboy Wash.

He and his colleagues at Bolling Air Force Base’s History Support Office planned to write a history of air combat operations during the Vietnam War.

In Champassak， a quiet province in southern Laos， Inthavongsy shines a flashlight into the tail section of what she recognizes to be a U.S.MK-81 aerial bomb sitting broadside in a bed of dead leaves. She peruses the bomb， then declares it safe to transport. Of course， not all unexploded bombs are so easy to handle.Some bombs have sensitive mechanical fuses and must be destroyed where they are found. Such diagnoses are easy for the 22-year-old，who leads a team of four technicians that frequently find the 250-pound bombs nosed into the ground or sitting in full view on the jungle floor.U.S. bombing data and reports from villagers help to guide teams such as Inthavongsy's--connect--【916】that are taking part in UXO \\[for \"unexploded ordnance\"\\] Lao， a countrywide program.\n【save__datas】\t【918】\tInthavongsy's colleagues hoist the rusted bomb into the back of a GPS-equipped Toyota pickup truck and head for a demolition site a few miles away. At the site， a remote jungle grove with a nearby protective log bunker， the crew follows a routine procedure to destroy the battered MK-81 bomb.

The baldrick， a small aluminum tube crammed with 80 grams of plastic explosive and capped with a thin sheet of copper， pierces the outer casing of a bomb and ignites the plasterlike mixture of TNT and other explosive material inside. This action splits the bomb’s casing and burns away its contents almost instantaneously， doing relatively little harm to the surrounding area.\"The munition is usually attacked explosively from the outside using a charge sufficiently violent to cause a chemical reaction but not hard enough to cause\\[ahigh-order\\]detonation，says Sidney Alford， a British explosives engineer who develops bomb disposal techniques used in Laos.\n【save__datas】\t【922】\tA member ofInthavongsy's team places the baldrick 80millimeters from the bomb and inserts a blasting cap wired to an electrical switchbox in a faraway bunker.

Most conventional supercomputers employ parallel processing： they contain arrays of ultrafast microprocessors that work in tandem to solve complex prob-lems such as forecasting the weather or simulating a nuclear explosion. Made by IBM， Cray and other computer vendors， the machines typically cost tens ofmillions of dollars-far too much for a research team with a modest budget. So over the past few years， scientists at national labo-ratories and universities have learned how to construct their own supercomputers by linking inexpensive PCs and writing soft-ware that allows these ordinary comput-ers to tackle extraordinary problems.\n【save__datas】\t【980】\tIn 1996 two of us (Hargrove and Hoffman) encountered such a problem in our work at Oak Ridge National Labora-tory (ORNL) in Tennessee. We were try-ing to draw a national map ofecoregions， which are defined by environmental con-ditions： all areas with the same climate. landforms and soil characteristics fall into the same ecoregion. To create a high-res-olution map of the continental U.S.， we divided the country into 7.8 million square cells，each with an area of one square kilo-meter. For each cell we had to consider as many as 25 variables， ranging from aver-age monthly precipitation to the nitrogen content of the soil. A single PC or work-station could not accomplish the task. We needed a parallel-processing supercom-puter-and one that we could afford!\n【save__datas】\t【981】\tOur solution was to construct a com---connect--【982】puting cluster using obsolete PCs that ORNL would have otherwise discarded. Dubbed the Stone SouperComputer be-cause it was built essentially at no cost， our cluster of PCs was powerful enough to produce ecoregion maps of unprece-dented detail. Other research groups have devised even more capable clusters that rival the performance of the world's best supercomputers at a mere fraction of their cost. This advantageous price-to-performance ratio has already attracted the attention of some corporations， which plan to use the clusters for such complex tasks as deciphering the human genome. In fact， the cluster concept\n【save__datas】\t【983】\tpromises to revolutionize the computing field by offering tremendous processing power to any research group， school or business that wants it.\n【save__datas】\t【984】\tBeowulf and Grendel--connect--【986】less powerful than minicomputers but faster than PCs-soon became common at research institutions. By the early1990s scientists began to consider build-ing clusters of PCs， partly because their mass-produced microprocessors had be-come so inexpensive. What made the idea even more appealing was the falling cost of Ethernet， the dominant technol-ogy for connecting computers in local-area networks.\n【save__datas】\t【987】\tAdvances in software also paved the way for PC clusters. In the 1980s Unix emerged as the dominant operating sys-tem for scientific and technical computing. Unfortunately， the operating systems for PCs lacked the power and flexibility of Unix. But in 1991 Finnish college student Linus Torvalds created Linux， a Unix-like operating system that ran on a PC. Tor-valds made Linux available free of charge on the Internet， and soon hundreds of pro-grammers began contributing improve-ments. Now wildly popular as an operat-ing system for stand-alone computers， Linux is also ideal for clustered PCs.--connect--【989】point operations per second. (A floating-point operation is equivalent to a simple calculation such as addition or multipli-cation.) At the time， however，commer-cial supercomputers with that level of per-formance cost about $1 million， which was too expensive to be dedicated to a single group of researchers.\n【save__datas】\t【990】\tOne of us (Sterling) decided to pursue the then radical concept of building a com-puting cluster from PCs. Sterling and his Goddard colleague Donald J. Becker con-nected 16 PCs， each containing an Intel486 microprocessor， using Linux and a standard Ethernet network. For scientific applications， the PC cluster delivered sus-tained performance of 70 megaflops-that is， 70 million floating-point operations per second. Though modest by today’s stan-dards， this speed was not much lower than that of some smaller commercial super-computers available at the time. And the cluster was built for only $40，000， or about one tenth the price of a comparable commercial machine in 1994.\n【save__datas】\t【991】\tNASA researchers named their cluster Beowulf， after the lean， mean hero of me-dieval legend who defeated the giant mon-ster Grendel by ripping off one of the crea-ture's arms. Since then， the name has been widely adopted to refer to any low-cost cluster constructed from commerciall available PCs. In 1996 two successors to the original Beowulf cluster appeared：Hyglac (built by researchers at the Cali-fornia Institute of Technology and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory) and Loki (con-structed at Los Alamos National Labora-tory). Eachcluster integrated 16 Intel Pen-tium Pro microprocessors and showed sustained performance of over one giga-flops at a cost of less than $50，000，thus satisfying NASA’s original goal.\n【save__datas】\t【992】\tThe Beowulf approach seemed to be the perfect computational solution to our problem of mapping the ecoregions of the U.S. A single workstation could handle the data for only a few states at most，and we couldn’t assign different regions of the country to separate workstations-the en---connect--【996】vironmental data for every section of the country had to be compared and pro-cessed simultaneously. In other words， we needed a parallel-processing system. So in1996 we wrote a proposalto buy 64 new PCs containing Pentium II microproces-sors and construct a Beowulf-class super-computer. Alas， this idea sounded im-plausible to the reviewers at ORNL，who turned down our proposal.\n【save__datas】\t【997】\tUndeterred， we devised an alternative plan. We knew that obsolete PCs at the U.S. Department of Energy complex at Oak Ridge were frequently replaced with newer models. The old PCs were adver-tised on an 门11产\\_internal Web site and auc-tioned off as surplus equipment. A quick check revealed hundreds of outdated com-puters waiting to be discarded this way.--connect--【998】cation among the nodes and therefore can be solved very quickly by parallel-pro-cessing systems.\n【save__datas】\t【999】\tAnyone building a Beowulf cluster must make several decisions in designing the system. To connect the PCs， re-searchers can use either standard Ether-net networks or faster， specialized net-works， such as Myrinet. Our lack of a budget dictated that we use Ethernet， which is free. We chose one PC to be the front-end node of the cluster and in-stalled two Ethernet cards into the ma-chine.One card was for communicating with outside users， and the other was for talking with the rest of the nodes， which would be linked in their own private net-work. The PCs coordinate their tasks by sending messages to one another. The two--connect--【1000】disk， lots of memory or (best ofall) anup-graded motherboard donated to us by ac-cident? Often all we found was a tired olc veteran with a fan choked with dust.\n【save__datas】\t【1001】\tOur room at Oak Ridge turned into a morgue filled with the picked-over car-casses of dead PCs. Once we opened a machine， we recorded its contents on a“toe tag”to facilitate the extraction of its parts later on. We developed favorite anc least favorite brands， models and cases and became adept at thwarting pass-words left by previous owners. On aver-age， we had to collect and process about five PCs to make one good node.\n【save__datas】\t【1002】\tAs each new node joined the cluster， we loaded the Linux operating system onto the machine. We soon figured out how to eliminate the need to install a key-\n【save__datas】\t【1004】\tPerhaps we could build our Beowulf clus-ter from machines that we could collect and recycle free of charge. We comman-deered a room at ORNL that had previ-ously housed an ancient mainframecom-puter. Then we began collecting surplus PCs to create the Stone SouperComputer.--connect--【1006】most popular message-passing libraries are message-passing interface (MPI) and parallel virtual machine (PVM)， which are both available at no cost on the In-ternet. We use both systems in the Stone SouperComputer.\n【save__datas】\t【1007】\tMany Beowulf clusters are homoge-neous， with all the PCs containing iden-tical components and microprocessors. This uniformity simplifies the manage-ment and use of the cluster but is not an absolute requirement. Our Stone Souper-Computer would have a mix of proces-sor types and speeds because we intend-ed to use whatever surplus equipment we could find. We began with PCs contain-ing Intel 486 processors but later added only Pentium-based machines with at least 32 megabytes of RAM and 200megabytes of hard-disk storage.\n【save__datas】\t【1008】\tIt was rare that machines met our min-imum criteria on arrival； usually we had to combine the best components from sev-eral PCs. We set up the digital equivalent of an automobile thief’s chop shop for converting surplus computers into nodes for our cluster. Whenever we opened a machine， we felt the same anticipation that a child feels when opening a birthday present： Would the computer have a big--connect--【1009】board or monitor for each node. We cre-ated mobile “crash carts\"that could be wheeled over and plugged into an ailing node to determine what was wrong with it. Eventually someone who wanted space in our room bought us shelves to consoli-date our collection of hardware. The Stone SouperComputer ran its first code in early 1997， and by May 2001 it con tained 133 nodes， including 75 PCs with Intel 486 microprocessors， 53 faster Pen tium-based machines and five still faster Alpha workstations， made by Compaq.\n【save__datas】\t【1010】\tUpgrades to the Stone SouperCom puter are straightforward： we replace the slowest nodes first. Each node runs a sim-ple speed test every hour as part of the cluster’s routine housekeeping tasks. The ranking of the nodes by speed helps us to fine-tune our cluster. Unlike commercial machines， the performance of the Stone SouperComputer continually improves because we have an endless supply of free upgrades.\n【save__datas】\t【1011】\tParallel Problem Solving--connect--【1013】model for programming Beowulf clusters is a master-slave arrangement. In this model， one node acts as the master， di-recting the computations performed by one or more tiers of slave nodes. We run the same software on all the machines in the Stone SouperComputer， with separate sections of code devoted to the master and slave nodes. Each microprocessor in the cluster executes only the appropriate section. Programming errors can have dramatic effects， resulting in a digital train wreck as the crash of one node derails the others. Sorting through the wreckage to find the error can be difficult.\n【save__datas】\t【1014】\tAnother challenge is balancing the processing workload among the cluster’s PCs. Because the Stone SouperComputer contains a variety of microprocessors with very different speeds， we cannot di-vide the workload evenly among the nodes： if we did so， the faster machines would sit idle for long periods as they waited for the slower machines to finish processing. Instead we developed a pro-gramming algorithm that allows the mas-ter node to send more data to the faster slave nodes as they complete their tasks. In this load-balancing arrangement， the faster PCs do most of the work， but the slower machines still contribute to the system's performance.\n【save__datas】\t【1015】\tOur first step in solving the ecoregion mapping problem was to organize the--connect--【1017】enormous amount of data-the 25 envi-ronmental characteristics of the 7.8 mil-lion cells of the continental U.S. We cre-ated a 25-dimensional data space in which each dimension represented one of the variables (average temperature， precipi-tation， soil characteristics and so on). Then we identified each cell with the ap-propriate point in the data space \\[see il---connect--【1018】lustration A on page 76\\]. Two points close--connect--【1019】to each other in this data space have， by definition， similar characteristics and thus are classified in the same ecoregion. Geo-graphic proximity is not a factor in this kind of classification； for example， if two mountaintops have very similar environ-ments， their points in the data space are very close to each other， even if the moun-taintops are actually thousands of miles apart.\n【save__datas】\t【1020】\tOnce we organized the data， we had to specify the number of ecoregions that would be shown on the national map. The cluster of PCs gives each ecoregion an initial “seed position\"in the data space. For each of the 7.8 million data points， the system determines the closest seed po-sition and assigns the point to the corre-sponding ecoregion. Then the cluster finds the centroid for each ecoregion-the aver-age position of all the points assigned to--connect--【1021】the region. This centroid replaces the seed position as the defining point for the eco-region. The cluster then repeats the proce-dure， reassigning the data points to eco-regions depending on their distances from the centroids. At the end of each iteration. new centroid positions are calculated for each ecoregion. The process continues un-til fewer than a specified number of data points change their ecoregion assign-ments. Then the classification is complete.\n【save__datas】\t【1022】\tThe mapping task is well suited for parallel processing because different nodes in the cluster can work independently on subsets of the 7.8 million data points. Af ter each iteration the slave nodes send the results of their calculations to the master node， which averages the numbers from all the subsets to determine the new cen-troid positions for each ecoregion. The master node then sends this information back to the slave nodes for the next round of calculations. Parallel processing is also useful for selecting the best seed positions for the ecoregions at the very beginning of the procedure. We devised an algorithm that allows the nodes in the Stone Souper-Computer to determine collectively the most widely dispersed data points， which are then chosen as the seed positions. If the cluster starts with well-dispersed seed--connect--【1023】positions， fewer iterations are needed to map the ecoregions.\n【save__datas】\t【1024】\tThe result of all our work was a series of maps of the continental U.S. showing each ecoregion in a different color \\[see il---connect--【1025】lustrations B and C on page 76\\]. We pro-\n【save__datas】\t【1026】\tduced maps showing the country divid-ed into as few as four ecoregions and as many as 5，000. The maps with fewer ecoregions divided the country into rec-ognizable zones-for example， the Rocky Mountain states and the desert South-west. In contrast， the maps with thou-sands of ecoregions are far more complex than any previous classification of the country's environments. Because many plants and animals live in only one or two ecoregions， our maps may be useful to ecologists who study endangered species.\n【save__datas】\t【1027】\tIn our first maps the colors of the eco-regions were randomly assigned， but we later produced maps in which the colors of the ecoregions reflect the similarity of their respective environments. We statis-tically combined nine of the environmen-tal variables into three composite charac-teristics， which we represented on the map with varying levels of red， green and blue. When the map is drawn this way， it shows gradations of color instead of sharp borders： the lush Southeast is most-ly green， the cold Northeast is mainly blue， and the arid West is primarily red\n【save__datas】\t【1028】\t\\[see illustration D on page 76\\].\n【save__datas】\t【1030】\tCluster Computing： Linux Taken to the\n【save__datas】\t【1031】\tExtreme.

According to these projections， by the end of this century the environment in Pittsburgh will be more like that of present-day Atlanta， and conditions in Minneapolis will resemble those in pres-ent-day St. Louis.\n【save__datas】\t【1049】\tThe Beowulf trend has accelerated since we built the Stone SouperComputer. New clusters with exotic names-Gren-del， Naegling， Megalon， Brahma， Avalon， Medusa and theHive， to mention just a few-have steadily raised the performance curve by delivering higher speeds at low-er costs. As of last November， 28 clusters of PCs， workstations or servers were on the list of the world’s 500 fastest com-puters. The LosLobos cluster at the Uni-versity of New Mexico has 512 Intel Pen---connect--【1050】tium III processors and is the 80th-fastest system in the world， with a performance of 237 gigaflops. The Cplant cluster at Sandia National Laboratories has 580Compaq Alpha processors and is ranked84th. The National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy are planning to build even more advancec clusters that could operate in the teraflops range (one trillion floating-point opera-tions per second)， rivaling the speed of the fastest supercomputers on the planet.\n【save__datas】\t【1051】\tBeowulf systems are also muscling their way into the corporate world. Ma jor computer vendors are now selling clusters to businesses with large compu-tational needs. IBM， for instance， is build-ing a cluster of 1，250 servers for NuTec Sciences， a biotechnology firm that plans to use the system to identify disease-caus-ing genes. An equally important trend is the development of networks of PCs that contribute their processing power to a collective task. An example is SETI@home， a project launched by researchers at the University of California at Berkeley who are analyzing deep-space radio signals for signs of intelligent life. SETI@home sends chunks of data over the Internet to more than three million PCs， which process the radio-signal data in their idle time. Some experts in the computer industry predict that researchers will eventually be able to tap into a “computational grid\" that will work like a power grid： users will be able to obtain processing power just as easily as they now get electricity.--connect--【1054】rouble\n【save__datas】\t【1058】\tDespite heroic efforts to protect the nesting beaches of green turtles. fewer and fewer of these endangered creatures reappear every year.

Even so， the num-ber of mature females returning to the green's primary nesting beach has plum-meted from 1，280 in 1990 to 145 in2000. Why are the turtles missing?\n【save__datas】\t【1061】\tResearchers have known for decades that people in fishing communities oc-casionally eat the green turtle， but new research has only now revealed that this tradition is colluding with egg poaching to bring about the animal's devastating decline. Scientists at the Autonomous University of Baja California estimate that poachers kill as many as 30，000green turtles every year in Baja. The study indicates that most of the demand for the turtles comes from the govern-ment sector—politicians， teachers and the military-those with cash to pay for the delicacy and positions of power to escape legal repercussions.\n【save__datas】\t【1062】\tFor some experts， the recent findings call into question the decades-old as-sumption that protection of turtle eggs and hatchlings is the best way to assure the animals' survival.

AladdinPower in Tampa markets a Step charger that works like a foot pump to recharge cell-phone， laptop-computer and video-camera batteries.\n【save__datas】\t【1090】\tDesigning practical devices requires “very small， very strong， very efficient components that can pro-duce power when an elderly woman turns the crank and yet can handle a tough guy cranking the thing like crazy，\" says Freeplay technical director John Hutch-inson. Minimizing mechanical wear is also paramount. A number of start-up companies have jumped on the bandwagon， but some products simply don’t work well. Ultimately， success depends on maximizing a user’s reward. “If someone is stranded at sea， he’ll crank all day”to keep his two-way radio working so he can be rescued， Hutchinson says. “But for the av-erage guy in his garage， 60 seconds of effort is all he’s willing to give.”\n【save__datas】\t【1091】\t\\-Mark Fischetti--connect--【1093】on Freeplay's Bravo AM/FM radio spins gears in a tiny transmission that drives an alternator.

That’s the sen-sory-deprived state of personal comput-ing today. PCs communicate with their1u1sSeerrs almost exclusively via images and sounds， ignoring all the other cues that humans rely on to perceive the world. Ad-mittedly， interacting with your computer through the senses of smell and taste may not be absolutely essential. But now PC users can try the iFeel mouse， a device from peripherals manufacturer Logitech that adds the all-important sense of touch to desktop computing.\n【save__datas】\t【1120】\tThe human brain is exquisitely hard-wired for touch. Anatomy textbooks of-ten include a grotesque-looking diagram known as the homunculus， which dis-torts the human figure to show how much of the brain’s sensory processing is devoted to each body part. Because large areas of the cortex interpret signals from the palms and fingers， the hands of the homunculus are enormous. This gener-ous neural capacity allows us to sense minute variations in pressure and to de-tect barely perceptible vibrations， con-tributing to our remarkable dexterity.\n【save__datas】\t【1121】\tOver the past two decades， computer scientists have struggled to build electro-mechanical contraptions that could pro-vide the same kind of tactile feedback. The task has proved difficult： a touch-feedback peripheral must be small enough to fit in a hand， yet it must also offer substantial re-sistance to the hand's motion. In fact， ac-curately synthesizing tactile sensations in real time became possible only after recent advances in miniaturization and the intro-duction of faster microprocessors.\n【save__datas】\t【1123】\tThe first tactile devices to hit the mar-ket were designed for medical training. Doctors-to-be use the instruments to vir-tually feel the right way to perform a catheterization or a spinal injection. En-gineers and architects employ similar de-vices for computer-assisted design， allow-ing them to “touch” the contours of their three-dimensional models. And for a few years now， computer gamers have been playing with force-feedback joysticks that can simulate a machine gun’s recoil or the stresses on an airplane’s controls. But no touch-feedback device for general-pur-pose computing was available until the in-troduction of the iFeel mouse last year.\n【save__datas】\t【1124】\tThe iFeel looks like an ordinary mouse(albeit one attractively finished in irides cent teal blue). And its retail price is mod-est-only $10 more than a comparable mouse without touch feedback. There are two models available： a simple symmetri-cal design that sells for $39 and a $59pre-mium version that has a contoured shape intended to fit the hand more comfortably. Both are optical devices that detect move-ment with reflected light rather than with a less precise trackball.\n【save__datas】\t【1125】\tAt the pulsating heart of the new mouse is technology licensed from Im mersion Corporation， which pioneered the development of touch-feedback sys---connect--【1126】tems in the 1990s. Louis Rosenberg， the company's chairman， says the key hard-ware component is a 25-gram motor that can move up and down， imparting about150 grams of force against the user’s hand. The mouse can also vibrate up to 300times a second， enabling the device to re-produce a wide range of sensations. For example， Immersion's special-effects soft-ware library allows Web site developers to enhance pages with simulated textures such as corduroy or sandpaper. When the iFeel user drags the cursor across such a page， the mouse rapidly jiggles up and down， as if it were traveling over a rough surface.\n【save__datas】\t【1127】\tTrying out the iFeel mouse for the first time can be disconcerting. The installa-tion is straightforward： just plug this USB device into an appropriate computer port and load the driver software from a CD-ROM. (Mac users are out of luck； so far the mouse works only with Windows.) Once connected， the iFeel fundamental-ly alters one's perception of Windows’fa-miliar screens. If you slide the cursor across one of the desktop program icons， the mouse shakes like dice in a cup. If you glide the mouse over the selections in a menu bar， it feels like a set of chattering false teeth. Push the iFeel back and forth over the options in a pull-down menu， and it hums like an electric shaver. The mouse also shakes up Web pages (iFeel works with either Explorer or Netscape， but Explorer must be installed on the computer even if you use only Netscape). The most noticeable sensation is the bump that occurs when the cursor cross-es a hot link or menu choice.\n【save__datas】\t【1128】\tFor anyone accustomed to an inert mouse， such physical cues may be dis-tracting. Because people have different thresholds for sensing force， Immersion’s software developers have provided access to an onscreen control for adjusting the strength of the feedback. Another control allows you to choose a different set of sen-sations. In addition to the default setting(which simulates the feeling of tapping a wooden surface)， the iFeel offers six oth---connect--【1129】er options： crisp， metallic， spongy，rubbery， steel drum and sonic vibe.\n【save__datas】\t【1130】\tWith continued use， something unex-pected happens： the iFeel’s twitching be-comes an organic part of the computing experience. The mouse’s motions provide--connect--【1131】gentle reinforcement when one is steering the cursor to a desired point on the screen. In poorly designed Web pages crowded with text， the iFeel can make it easier to find and click on links to other sites. And when a program crashes， the mouse’s pal-\n【save__datas】\t【1132】\tFelt but--connect--【1133】not seen.\n【save__datas】\t【1135】\tBecause our miracle is on the inside...\n【save__datas】\t【1136】\tOur sleep technology is recognized by NASA， raved about by the media， extolled worldwide by over 25.000 sleep clinics and health professionals.

With the help of Immersion’s special-effects library， the developers of computer games can sim-ulate the jolt of an explosion， the recoil of a gun， the zing of a crossbow and even the hum of a light saber. A handful of Web pages have been modified to take advantage of the iFeel’s abilities， offering exotic effects such as lions roaring and auto engines starting. But these sites scarcely demonstrate the full potential of this technology.\n【[www.com]_filter】\t【1144】\tThe iFeel mouse can do much more than simply entertain. With touch feed-back， for instance， it would be possible for a student to sense the forces at play while folding a molecule in an online bio-chemistry lesson. The iFeel could also--connect--【1147】turn Web shopping into a hands-on ex-perience by letting a customer feel， say， the texture of a tweed jacket offered for sale on an e-commerce site.

The subject of this book is so highly abstract， and so far re-moved from ordinary experience， that an illusion of understanding is perhaps the best we can hope for.\n【save__datas】\t【1164】\tOnly a few hundred people in the world may understand the intricacies of loop quantum gravity， Smolin’s particu-lar line of research， and I will confess that I am not one of them. Nevertheless，I am grateful that he has taken the time from his science to write this engaging popu-larization， for， as he rightly supposes， there are many of us who want to think we know what’s going on. It would be hard to imagine a better guide to this dif-ficult subject.\n【save__datas】\t【1165】\tThe first half of the 20th century saw the invention of two highly successful the---connect--【1166】ories for describing the world： quantum mechanics and general relativity (gravity). Each theory reigns supreme in its domain of application： quantum theory on the scale of elementary particles， relativity on the cosmic scale. Only occasionally， as in discussions of black holes， do the two theories rub against each other.\n【save__datas】\t【1167】\tThe rubbing can be abrasive. Quan-tum theory radicalizes our assumptions about the relationship between observer and observed but pretty much buys into Newton’s ideas of space and time. Gen eral relativity changes our notions of space and time but accepts Newton’s view of observer and observed. This sit-uation is deemed unacceptable by most physicists， and the race is on to find a uni-fying theory of quantum gravity， some-times called a Theory of Everything.\n【save__datas】\t【1168】\tSmolin describes the three most prom-ising approaches to such a theory， all of--connect--【1170】which operate on the so-called Planck scale of reality， 20 orders of magnitude smaller than the atomic nucleus.\n【save__datas】\t【1171】\tOne approach applies thermodynam-ics and information theory to black holes. Another is string theory， which proposes that the ultimate elements of reality are vibrating linear mathematical entities ex-isting (in one version of the theory) in nine spatial dimensions that give rise in their various states of excitation to the el-ementary particles. Smolin pushes hard for a third approach， which involves something called quantum loops-quan-tized elements of spacetime that in their shimmerings evoke everything else， per---connect--【1173】haps even strings.\n【save__datas】\t【1174】\tQuantum loop theory proposes that spacetime is a kind of \"spin foam，\"a pure geometry of Planck-scale loops and nodes， that in its “knots， links and kinks” spins--connect--【1175】out a universe. A note in the book led me--connect--【1176】to a Web site \\[see illustration on preced---connect--【1177】ing page\\] where one can view a quantum universe of one space and one time di-mension doing its foamy thing. The prospect is exhilarating that behind the world of our senses this ceaseless Planck-scale fandango is going on.\n【save__datas】\t【1178】\tAll roads to quantum gravity， when they have battered their way to a com-mon vision， will probably suggest that space and time， like matter and energy， come in quantized， indivisible units and that relationships， rather than things， are the fundamental elements of reality. Alas， it is difficult to conceive how any such theory of quantum gravity can be tested with present technology， although Smolin is confident it will happen.\n【save__datas】\t【1179】\tReaders will perhaps best enjoy the first chapters of the book， where the au---connect--【1180】thor neatly lays out the philosophical principles that guide the search， and the penultimate chapter， where he explores how quantum gravity relates to our un-derstanding of ourselves and God.\n【save__datas】\t【1182】\tChet Raymo teaches at Stonehill College--connect--【1183】in Massachusetts and writes a science--connect--【1184】column for the Boston Globe.--connect--【1187】by Daniel L.

This form of steel remains stainless， or does not rust， because of the interac-tion between its alloying elements and the environment. Stainless steel contains iron， chromium， manganese， silicon， carbon and， in many cases， significant amounts of nickel and molybdenum. These elements react with oxygen from wa-ter and air to produce a very thin， stable film that consists of such corrosion products as metal oxides and hydroxides. Chromium plays a dominant role in reacting with oxygen to form this film. In fact， all stainless steels by definition con-tain at least 10 percent chromium.\n【save__datas】\t【1240】\tThis stable film prevents additional corrosion by acting as a barrier that limits the access of oxygen and water to the underlying metal surface. Because the film forms so readily and tightly， even just a few atomic layers of the material re-duce the rate of corrosion to very low levels. The film is much thinner than the wavelength of visible light， and so it is diffi-cult to see without the aid of modern instruments. Thus， al-though the steel is in fact corroded at the atomic level， it ap-pears stainless to the unaided eye. Common inexpensive steel， in contrast， reacts with oxygen from water to form a rela-tively unstable iron oxide/hydroxide film that continues to grow with time and exposure to water and air. As such， this film， otherwise known as rust， achieves sufficient thickness to be easily observable soon after exposure to water and air.\n【save__datas】\t【1241】\tIn summary， because it is sufficiently reactive to protect itself from further attack by forming a passive corrosion product layer， stainless steel does not rust.

Although the rule stipulates that organizations can treat women suffering from postabortion complications， many providers may become too scared to do even this， Biel says. “The result we have seen most is that groups tend to overrespond and distance themselves from anything that has to do with abortion，\" he observes. Therefore， clinics may not keep manual vacuum aspira-tion (MVA) equipment on the premises， even though it is needed to treat postabortion dis-tress (often caused by back-alley operations).

Even absent the Mexico City Policy一which applies only to the $425-million fam ily-planning budget of U.S. AID-the United Nations reports that there is a worldwide shortfall of $3.6 billion in meeting demands for family-planning services.

Two and a half years ago physicists demonstrated how a specially prepared gas could slow light by a factor of 20 million， to the pace of a speeding bicycle.

Lukin of the Harvard-Smithsonian Cen-ter for Astrophysics， also in Cam-bridge， achieves much the same re-sults in a four-centimeter-long cell of rubidium vapor almost as hot as boiling water. Both use the same two-step process to freeze the light. First a laser sends a carefully--connect--【301】tuned pulse of light into the gas. Usually the gas would be as opaque as a brick wall to this “sig-nal\" light and would completely absorb it. In these slow-light ex-periments， however， a second“control”laser beam is irradiat-ing the gas， making it transparent to the signal pulse. This effect， called electromagnetically induced transparency， was pioneered in the early 1990s by Stephen E. Harris of Stanford University and others. The control light interacts with the atoms and by a process of quantum interference elimi-nates their ability to absorb pho---connect--【303】tons of the signal pulse. The changes to the gas's optical properties also greatly slow down the speed of the signal pulse. Such slow light was demonstrated a couple of years ago by Hau and Harris and their colleagues.\n【save__datas】\t【304】\tTraveling through the gas in unison with the slow pulse is a pattern in the alignment of the atoms’ tiny magnetic fields， which exactly mimics the form of the light pulse. The com-bination of atomic polarizations and light is called a polariton. Stopping this polariton-the second step of the process-is achieved by turning off the control beam while the polari-ton is still traversing the gas. As the control beam’s intensity ebbs， the remaining signal light is absorbed， and the increasingly atomic polariton slows even more. At zero intensity. the last glimmer of the light vanishes into the atoms， and the polariton comes to a dead stop.--connect--【305】the more degraded the output pulse becomes. The atoms that carry the polarizations are not， after all， frozen in place. Diffusion and collisions steadily disperse and destroy the po lariton-more rapidly in the hot gas.\n【save__datas】\t【306】\tThe process achieves a key function need-ed for large-scale quantum-information pro-cessing， as would occur in quantum comput-ers： reliable interconversion of fast-moving quantum states (light pulses) and robust sta-tionary ones (polaritons). Quantum-com-puting expert David P.

Over the past several years， however， astronomers have built up a case for holes with a mass of 100 to 10，000suns.“They might be a bridge between the ones we know about-the stellar-mass ob iects-and the ones we think we know about.\n【save__datas】\t【355】\tIf middleweightblack holes are the corpses of the very first generation of stars， the Milky Way may originally have contained5，000 ofthem.

Ward of the University of Leicester in England.\n【save__datas】\t【361】\tIn the mid-1980s orbiting observatories began noticing mysterious dots gleaming in x-rays. These dots were brighter than known stellar-mass holes and dimmer than active supermassive holes. Taken at face value， their luminosity implied a mass of 100 or so suns. Any less and gravity would be unable to hold back the outward pressure of light； the objects， whatever they were， would blow themselves apart. Today astronomers know of more than200 of these intermediate-luminosity x-ray objects (IXOs)， according to Edward J.M. Colbert of Johns Hopkins University. Halfthe spiral galaxies examined have at least one.\n【save__datas】\t【362】\tLast fall three groups-led by Richard E. Griffiths of Carnegie Mellon University， by Philip Kaaret of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and by Hironori Matsumoto of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-announced Chandra observa-tions of the brightest IXO， located in the gal axy M82. If anyone thought that higher res-olution would make the problem go away， that the IXO would prove to be a tight clump of ordinary bodies， they were wrong. Al-though Chandra did make out a clump， at least one member of the clump still qualifies as an IXO. It is clearly offset from the center of the galaxy-ruling out a dormant super-massive hole (which would quickly sink to the middle)-and from radio and infrared sources， arguing against supernova debris(which would glow at multiple wavelengths).\n【save__datas】\t【363】\tKaaret’s team also thought it had found10-minute flickering， which， by implying a size of less than 10 light-minutes， would have been--connect--【364】proof of a mesohole. NASA called a triumphal press conference. Two weeks later the flick-ering proved to be an instrumental artifact. NASA did not call a second press conference.\n【save__datas】\t【365】\tOther groups have taken x-ray spectra of various IXOs and caught them flip-flopping between two modes： bright and cool， dim and hot. Known holes do just that. Until recently， however， there was a problem with the hole hypothesis. A bigger hole has a wider maw， so the disk of material around it should stay farther away and hence be cooler. Yet IXOs are actually hotter than stellar-mass holes. Ken-ya Watarai of the University of Kyoto in Japan and his colleagues have proposed a so-lution： material falls into the hole at such a high rate that the disk， in effect， pushes inward. A fluctuating rate neatly explains changes in the luminosity and temperature of three IXOs.\n【save__datas】\t【366】\tFor theorists， intermediate masses are a no-hole’s-land. Dying stars might leave behind a hole of 15 solar-masses， tops； heavier stars don’t necessarily make heavier holes， because they tend to shed weight during their flamboyant lives. On the other end， gas clouds in the early universe collapse to holes of a million solar-masses and up. Perhaps the midsize holes involve the merger of stars or stellar-mass holes in a star cluster， for which there is some evi-dence in M82. Or maybe they resulted from the collapse of the first generation of stars， which， having formed in simpler times， were a race of Titans. But none of these and other explanations is problem-free.“I apologize for the confusion，” says theorist Roeland van der Marel of the Space Telescope Science Institute.“This is not a field where a paradigm has formed.

(The value g isn’t exactly 2 because， thanks to the uncertainty principle， par-ticles and forces briefly pop into existence and affect the muons.) But using measurements5.6 times more precise than ever before， researchers calculated that g-2 exceeds the value predicted by the Standard Model by about four parts per million. A 1 percent chance re-mains that the finding is merely a statistical fluke， but many researchers think it is evidence of long-sought new physics beyond the Standard Model， such as supersymmetry.

In a study published in the Feb ruary 8 Nature， Seth Bordenstein and his col-leagues at the University of Rochester wrote that a parasitic bacterium， Wolbachia pipi-entis， prevented two closely related species of wasps (genus Nasonia) from producing hy-brid offspring-it rendered the sperm of one species incompatible with the eggs of the oth-er. Wasps treated with bacteria-killing an-tibiotics could interbreed freely， and none of the offspring exhibited the genetic defects that indirectly cause speciation， such as those that produce sterility or death. Infection with Wolbachia therefore probably preceded other barriers to reproduction between these closee-ly related wasp species.\n【save__datas】\t【424】\t\\-Alison McCook\n【save__datas】\t【427】\tHeavenly Seeds\n【save__datas】\t【428】\tDid life on the earth originate from molecules deposited by meteorites or comets?

More disappointing is the rise in obesity. The substantial declines in preva-lence of high serum cholesterol and high blood pressure of recent decades may be dif ficult to maintain， as those most concerned about their health have already mended their destructive ways， whereas those practicing a less prudent lifestyle will be less inclined to change.

Bell Labs， which oversaw parallel efforts in five separate lithography technologies during the early 1990s， was enticed by the idea of short-wavelength radiation that did not require a synchrotron，the gi-ant x-ray generators found in high-ener-gy physics laboratories. The technical dif-ficulties that beset x-ray lithography at the time led the Bell Labs researchers to change the name from soft x-rays to ex-treme ultraviolet lithography.

With a wavelength of 13 nanometers-almost one twentieth the wavelength being read-ied for use in commercial chipmaking five years ago-EUV could be extended until the physical challenges of making atomic-scale chips rendered existing semiconduc-tor technologies unworkable. And the technology used a machine tool that bears some resemblance to those deployed in ex-isting fabrication facilities. Insiders at In-tel were suspicious， though. “People start---connect--【474】ed asking， ‘Can it do this， can it do that?’and it was Gordon Moore who said we re-ally don’t have an alternative，\" recalls John Carruthers， who headed advanced technology research at Intel at the time.\n【save__datas】\t【475】\tIntel entered into a three-year con-tract (later extended to five) with an en-tity called the Virtual National Labora-tory (VNL)， which combined researchers and facilities from Lawrence Livermore. Sandia and Lawrence Berkeley national laboratories. Having one contract with three labs cut some of the red tape that usually discourages companies from seeking such collaborations. Later Intel brought in other chip manufacturers， in-cluding competitors AMD， Motorola， Micron and Infineon-and lithography equipment suppliers ASML and SVG.\n【save__datas】\t【476】\tIn 1997， at the beginning of Intel's stepped-up involvement， looming techni-cal difficulties caused EUVto be rated last out of four lithography technologies in a straw vote taken at an industry conference.

The mask reflects the circuit pattern onto a se-ries of curved mirrors that reduce the size of the image and focus it onto the wafer. The 80 alternating layers of silicon and molybdenum that make up the mirrors and the mask have to be smoothed to sin-gle-atom tolerances. The entire circuit-printing process， moreover， has to be done in a vacuum because air itself ab-sorbs radiation at this wavelength. And the mask will distort the image if it con-tains more than a handful of defects mea-suring even 50 nanometers， about 2，000times narrower than the width of a hu-man hair.

Although AMD， Motorola， Infi-neon and Micron are partners， Intel nego-tiated contract terms that let it get the first machines produced and， because it is the largest investor in the $250-million pro-gram， the greatest number of tools.\n【save__datas】\t【491】\tSuppliers have to implement fully two crushingly difficult generations of technology before they finish making an investment of perhaps $750 million to start producing EUV machines. Getting them to buy into the breakneck schedule set by Intel may be a bigger challenge than creating angstrom-smooth mirrors. Even ASML， which dropped its involve-ment with EPL， is cautious， saying exist-ing optical technologies may last longer than the industry expects.“It’s too early to decide whether EUV will happen in the time frame Intel is pushing，”says Jos\n【save__datas】\t【492】\tBenschop， research manager at ASML.\n【save__datas】\t【493】\tIntel would also like to bring Nikon， its other main supplier， into the fold. But the industry's largest equipment manu-facturer， which is researching EUV out-side of the U.S. consortium， is not ready to commit to a single technology-and it continues work on EPL with IBM.Oth-er chipmakers， such as Motorola and Texas Instruments， have voiced support for the EUV competitor.“It’s still a horse race between EPL and EUV，” says Gil-bert L.

Later， professional philosophers and historians took over and， in a paroxysm of post-modern deconstruction， proffered a view of science as a relativistic game played by European white males who， in a reductionistic frenzy of hermeneutical hege-mony， were hell-bent on suppressing the masses be-neath the thumb of dialectical scientism and technoc-racy.

A prescient forecast for 1964， although Jastak probably imagined Davis drawing pictures of atomic airplanes.\n【save__datas】\t【535】\tDavis himself had altogether different ideas about commingling science and art， ideas that have often made both profes-sions uncomfortable. He championed a space shuttle experiment that would have pumped 100，000 watts from an electron gun into the upper atmosphere to create the first artificial aurora (the project was accepted， but the Challenger accident in-tervened). He led a quasicovert operation that translated vaginal contractions， the impetus of human conception， into text， music， phonetic speech and ultimately in-to radio signals beamed from M.I.T.s Millstone radar to several nearby star sys-tems (the air force shut down transmis-sions after 20 minutes). He drew up plans for channeling a lightning bolt into a laser powerful enough to create visible spots on the moon (an idea still awaiting a sponsor).\n【save__datas】\t【536】\tAnd then， about 15 years ago， Davis realized that genetic engineering offered a地1：rich new medium for art-life itself. He convinced molecular biologists at Har-vard University and the University of Cal-ifornia at Berkeley to teach him how to synthesize DNA and insert it into the ge-nomes of living microorganisms， then set about creating what he calls “an infogene， a gene to be translated by the machinery of human beings into meaning and not by the machinery of cells into protein.\" His idea was to create a message in a bottle for extraterrestrials： to encode a sign of human intelligence into the genome of bacteria， which could then be grown by the ton and flung out across the heavens.\n【save__datas】\t【537】\tFor his bottle， Davis chose E. coli，a bacterium of the human gut that might well carry DNA intact for aeons in deep space.

As the parents share their joy and begin to count 10 perfect little fingers and 10 adorable tiny toes， they scarcely pay atten-tion to birth's Act Two： the delivery of the placenta， or afterbirth.\n【save__datas】\t【565】\tAfter the ordeal of labor， most new mothers are happy they need to push on-ly once more for their physician to scoop up the roughly one-pound， pancakelike organ that nourished their baby through the umbilical cord for nine months. After cutting the cord and checking the after-birth for gaps and tears that might indi-cate that a piece still remains inside the mother's uterus-where it could cause a potentially fatal infection-the doctor usually tosses it into a stainless-steel bucket with the rest of the medical waste bound for incineration.\n【save__datas】\t【566】\tBut more and more physicians and parents are realizing the value of what they used to regard as merely birth’s by-product. Since 1988 hundreds of lives have been saved by the three ounces of blood contained in a typical placenta and umbilical cord. That blood is now known to be a rich source of so-called hemato-poietic stem cells， the precursors ofevery-thing in the blood from infection-fighting white blood cells to the red blood cells that carry oxygen to the platelets that fa-cilitate blood clotting after an injury.\n【save__datas】\t【567】\tThe stem cells from a single placenta are sufficient to rebuild the blood and im-mune system of a child with leukemia， whose own white blood cells are abnor-mally dividing and must be killed by chemotherapy. In the past， physicians had to seek a living donor to provide such children with transplants of bone marrow， which also contains stem cells that pro-duce blood and immune cells. Unfortu---connect--【568】nately， many people have died during the long search for a donor with a matching tissue type or from complications if the do-nated marrow did not match well. Cord blood， which can be stored， is more likely to provide a suitable match and less likely to cause complications， because its stem cells are immunologically different from and more tolerant than those in adult bone marrow.\n【save__datas】\t【569】\tThe benefits of umbilical cord blood transplantation have been demonstrated most conclusively in leukemia， but the process has other uses. The stem cells in cord blood can help to restore normal red blood cells in people with sickle cell anemia and to reconstitute the immune system of infants born with severe com-bined immunodeficiency. Cord blood can also be used to treat fatal inherited enzyme deficiencies， such as Hurler’s syn-drome， which results in progressive neu-rological degeneration and death. In such cases， the stem cells in cord blood can give rise not only to normal red and white blood cells but also to supporting cells in the brain called microglia that can pro-vide the crucial missing enzyme there.\n【save__datas】\t【570】\tRecognizing the apparent advantages ofumbilical cord blood transplantation， a number of medical centers have estab-lished banks so that a mother can donate her baby’s cord blood for use by a stranger in need. The New York Blood Center's Placental Blood Program， pioneered by Pablo Rubinstein， now has 13，000 banked donations and is the nation’s largest pub---connect--【571】liccord blood bank. The University of Cal-ifornia at Los Angeles and Duke Universi-ty also have umbilical cord blood storage programs， which are federally funded.\n【save__datas】\t【572】\tBut like many new scientific discov-eries， umbilical cord blood transplanta-tion brings with it a set of ethical ques--connect--【573】tions \\[see box on next page\\]. Who owns--connect--【574】umbilical cord blood： both parents， the mother or the infant? What happens if a mother donates her baby’s cord blood to a bank but the child later develops leukemia and needs it? The ethical ques-tions are compounded by the advent of for-profit companies that collect and pre-serve a newborn’s cord blood for possi-ble use by the family later. Is it right for such companies to aggressively market their services-which can cost $1，500 for collection and $95 per year for storage when the chance a child will ever need his or her cord blood ranges from 1 in 10，000(according to the New York Blood Cen-ter) to 1 in 200，000 (according to the Na-tional Institutes of Health)?\n【save__datas】\t【575】\tFounts of Stem Cels\n【save__datas】\t【577】\tBut Is lt Ethical?\n【save__datas】\t【578】\tMarketing tactics and privacy issues raise eyebrows\n【save__datas】\t【580】\tWas this ethically appropriate? A panel of bioethicists decided that it was， because donating cord blood would have no effect on Adam's health.\n【save__datas】\t【581】\tSelectively conceiving a potential donoris only one of the myriad ethicalissues surrounding umbilical cord blood transplantation.One of the most significant has to do not with how the blood is used but with the marketing campaigns aimed at prospective parents by for-profit companies that offerto collect and store a baby's cord blood-for a hefty fee-in case he orshe might need it later.\n【save__datas】\t【582】\tSuch companies market cord blood collection as \"biologicalinsurance\" to expectant parents. But \"the odds are so extraordinarily against their child’s ever needing it，”says Paul Root Wolpe， a fellow at the University of Pennsylvania Health System Center for Bioethics. He fears that parents who can scarcely afford the service might feel impelled to buy it even though their families have no history of blood disorders.\n【save__datas】\t【583】\tViacord， a cord blood-preserving company based in Boston， says that just five of their 6，500 clients have so farneeded infusions of their stored cord blood. Moreover， only 20 percent have a family history of a blood disorder or are now in treatment.\n【save__datas】\t【584】\tThe American Academy of Pediatrics issued a policy statement on umbilical cord blood banking in July 1999 cautioning that \"it is difficult to recommend that parents store their children's cord blood for future use\"unless a family memberhas had a blood disorder. Instead it encouraged parents to donate their baby's cord blood to public banks.\n【save__datas】\t【585】\tQuestions have been raised inthe past concerning the ownership of cord blood. But bioethicist Jeremy Sugarman of Duke University states that it is now fairly clear that although an infant owns his or herown cord blood， parents have legal guardianship over it-just as they do overthe child-until he or she reaches age 18. Sugarman and Wolpe contributed to a 1997 consensus statement on the ethics of umbilical cord blood--connect--【586】banking in the Journal of the Americon Medicol Association.\n【save__datas】\t【587】\tSugarman adds that it is perfectly appropriate for a parent to use one sibling's cord blood to treat another. Ifthe first child develops a need for a transplantation later on，the fact that the parents already used his or her stored blood is unfortun ate but not unethical.\n【save__datas】\t【588】\tOf more concern is how to ensure the safety of cord blood donated to cord banks. What happens if parents donate a newborn’s cord blood to a public bank and the child develops leukemia years later? Ifthe donated blood has no identifying information to link it to the donor， there would be no way to prevent it from being used in another child. Stem cells in the umbilical cord blood of a child who latergets leukemia could also cause leukemia in a recipient. But keeping permanent records of donors carries privacy risks： What if the blood is transplanted into a recipient but doesn't take， and the sick child's parents want to track down the donorchild for bone marrow cells?\n【save__datas】\t【589】\tMost public cord blood banks labelsamples so they can be linked to a particular donor for several years， at which time they destroy the identifying information. Wolpe says that this is a good trade-off but that risks will always be associated with donor cord blood， just as they are with donor adu lt blood. \"You try to keep it as safe as you can，\" he says， \"but people take a chance.”\n【save__datas】\t【590】\t-CarofEzzell， stoffwriter--connect--【591】ing sprung from the donor’s stem cells.\n【save__datas】\t【592】\tBut it took years for other physicians to recognize the potential of umbilical cord blood transplantation. In 1989 Hal E. Broxmeyer of the Indiana University School of Medicine， Edward A. Boyse of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City and their colleagues re-vived interest in the technique by showing that human cord blood contains as many stem cells as bone marrow does. That same year Broxmeyer， Eliane Gluckman of Saint-Louis Hospital in Paris and their co-workers reported curing Fanconi ane mia-a potentially fatal genetic disorder-in a five-year-old boy using blood from his baby sister’s umbilical cord. Since then， approximately 75 percent of umbil-ical cord blood transplants have used cord blood from a nonrelative obtained from cord blood storage programs.\n【save__datas】\t【593】\tWhat’s Bred in the Bone\n【save__datas】\t【595】\tThere are six major HLA genes. Every person hastwo copies， or alleles， ofeach-one from each parent. (Each allele can come in more than 30 different types.)For bone marrow transplants， physicians aim to match the six alleles (of the total 12) that are most clinically relevant in transplanta-tion. But because cord blood cells are im-munologically different from bone mar-row cells， doctors can use donor cord blood samples that match five-or even three-HLA alleles.\n【save__datas】\t【596】\tThe genetic blueprints for making HLA proteins are found on chromosome6. The rules of genetics dictate that the probability that two siblings will inherit the same maternal and paternal chromo some 6-and will therefore be good tis sue-type matches-is only 25 percent.\n【save__datas】\t【597】\tReceiving a bone marrow transplant from someone who is not a good tissue-type match is potentially fatal. On one hand， the graft can fail if even a tiny amount of the recipient’s own immune cells survive to generate an immune re-sponse that deems the transplanted cells foreign and kills them. This graft failure essentially leaves the patient without a--connect--【598】many unknown minor HLA proteins. Al-though these proteins are not actively matched in sibling transplants either，the close genetic relationship of siblings en-sures that many of them will be matched simply by chance. A good sibling pairing， however， still carries a 20 percent risk of graft-versus-host disease.--connect--【599】be to attempt to match all known HLA proteins， but that would drastically reduce the chances of finding any potential donor for a recipient. Umbilical cord blood trans-plantation offers a better alternative. Be-cause of differences in the newborn's im-mune system， immune cells in umbilical cord blood are much less likely than those in an older child's or an adult's bone mar-\n【save__datas】\t【600】\tFor-profit companies will preserve a newborn's cord blood for--connect--【601】possible use by the family later. Is that right when the chance a child will ever need his or her cord blood ranges from 1 in 10，000 to 1 in 200，000?--connect--【602】functioning immune system and ex-tremely vulnerable to infection. Con-versely， the transplanted cells can attack the recipient’s body as foreign in a dire phenomenon called graft-versus-host dis-ease. Graft-versus-host disease can man-ifest itself as a blistering and ulcerating skin rash， liver damage that progresses to liver failure or severe gastrointestinal bleeding； it can quickly lead to death.\n【save__datas】\t【603】\tTo minimize such serious complica-tions in people who cannot obtain a bone marrow transplant from a well-matched sibling， in 1987 a coalition of national blood bank organizations persuaded the U.S. federal government to establish the National Marrow Donor Program to find the best matches for patients among a pool of registered potential bone mar-row donors. The program-together with other， similar， international registries-lists 6.5 million names. But because there is only a 1 in 400 chance that an individ-ual will be a match for someone who is not a relative， those in need typically have just a 60 percent chance of finding a po-tentially lifesaving donor. The odds are even worse for patients who are members of a minority group， because matches are more likely to occur between people of the same race and the registries do not have enough minority volunteers.\n【save__datas】\t【604】\tEven those who do find a suitable donor from one of the registries still face an alarming 80 percent risk of moderate to severe (grade II to IV) graft-versus-host disease. Scientists think this is because the matching process does not consider the--connect--【607】row to attack a recipient’s tissues as for---connect--【608】eign and cause graft-versus-host disease. In 1997 Gluckman and her colleagues found evidence that umbilical cord blood transplantation-even between an unre-lated donor and recipient-is safer than bone marrow transplantation. Her group studied 143 patients who had received--connect--【609】bone marrow donor is a time-consuming process that takes an average of four months. During this period， potential donors are asked to go to donor centers to have blood drawn for tissue typing and testing for viruses such as the ones that cause AIDS and hepatitis. After donor is selected，that individual must re-turn， pass a physical examination， give his or her informed consent and then sched-ule a time for the bone marrow to be har-vested from the hipbone using a needle.\n【save__datas】\t【610】\tIn contrast， cord blood is readily avail-able from a bank’s freezer and has already undergone viral testing and tissue typing. An umbilical cord blood match can be\n【save__datas】\t【611】\tOne dau an infant born with agenetic defect of the bone marrow--connect--【612】or blood may be able to have his orher umbilical cord blood--connect--【613】harvested at birth， repaired by genetic engineering and then reinfused.--connect--【614】umbilical cord blood transplants either from relatives or from a donor program. Although the transplants ranged from fully matched to two-thirds mismatched， the incidence of life-threatening (grade ⅢI or IV) graft-versus-host disease was just5 percent in the related group and 20 per-cent in the unrelated group. It caused the death of only 1 percent of the related group and 6 percent of the unrelated group. In comparison， large studies using fully matched， unrelated bone marrow donors have shown a 47 percent inci-dence of life-threatening graft-versus-host disease， with 70 percent of those pa-tients (33 percent of the total) eventually dying from the disease.\n【save__datas】\t【615】\tUmbilical cord blood transplantation has many other potential advantages over standard bone marrow transplants. The size of the potential donor pool is much larger for cord blood than for bone mar-row， for example. The National Marrow Donor Program has required more than a decade to accumulate a pool of four million individuals who have been typed for potential bone marrow donation (the other 2.5 million donors are registered in other countries). But there are four mil-lion births in the U.S. annually， each of which is a potential opportunity to col---connect--【617】made in as few as three or four days， which can spell life or death for someone who is already immunodeficient and at high risk for a fatal infection. The collec-tion of umbilical cord blood from as many donors as possible would also in-crease the likelihood that people from minority groups would be able to find a match. According to the National Mar-row Donor Program， African-Americans have only a 57 percent chance of finding a bone marrow donor. Pacific Islanders and Asians have a higher match rate of74 percent； Hispanics have a 78 percent chance； and American Indians and Alas-ka Natives have an 84 percent likelihood of finding a donor. Caucasians have odds of 87 percent.\n【save__datas】\t【618】\tCord blood will also be virtually free of a virus that in the past has been re-sponsible for 10 percent of deaths fol-lowing bone marrow transplants： cyto-megalovirus (CMV). More than half of the adult U.S. population carries CMV， which continues to live in the white blood cells of the host after initial infec-tion. Although CMV generally causes an innocuous viral syndrome in a healthy person， it can kill someone who is im-munosuppressed after a bone marrow transplant. Bone marrow donors are test-ed for CMV， but patients often receive CMV-positive marrow if it is the best match. Because fewer than 1 percent of infants contract CMV in the womb，um-bilical cord blood could be much safer than bone marrow.\n【save__datas】\t【619】\tThe Downside\n【save__datas】\t【621】\tUmbilical cord blood banks could largely avoid this risk by quarantining the blood for six to 12 months and by contacting the family at that time to en-sure that the donor is healthy. A long---connect--【622】term identification link between a donor and his or her unit of cord blood would be necessary， a prospect that has aroused privacy concerns among medical ethicists.\n【save__datas】\t【623】\tCurrently the New York Blood Cen-ter asks potential donor parents to com-plete detailed questionnaires that em-phasize their family histories of disease as well as their sexual histories. If respons-es to the questionnaire generate medical reservations， the center does not collect or store the cord blood. The center main-tains only a short-term link with the donor until viral testing is complete， when the cord blood becomes anonymous.\n【save__datas】\t【624】\tAnother limitation of umbilical cord blood is the relatively small number of stem cells contained within a single sam-ple. Although cord blood can be used for transplantation in adults， studies by Pablo Rubinstein have demonstrated that because of the limited number of stem cells in cord blood， larger (that is， older) patients benefit less than smaller(younger) patients. Researchers are now working to devise ways to increase the--connect--【625】number of stem cells in cord blood sam-ples using nutrients and growth factors. They are also genetically engineering stem cells to correct genetic disorders such as severe combined immunodeficiency. Ir such a case， physicians would collect a pa-tient’s own cord blood， insert normal genes into the stem cells of the cord blood and reinfuse the cells into the child’s body.\n【save__datas】\t【628】\tEthical Issues in Umbilical Cord Blood Banking.

And in San Diego， protesters smashed sorghum and sprayed paint over greenhouse walls.\n【save__datas】\t【657】\tThis far-flung outrage took aim at genetically modified crops. But the protests backfired： all the destroyed plants were conventionally bred. In each case， activists mistook ordinary plants for GM varieties.\n【save__datas】\t【658】\tIt's easy to understand why. In a way， GM crops-now on some 109 million acres of farmland worldwide-are invisible. You can’t see， taste or touch a gene inserted into a plant or sense its effects on the environment. You can’t tell， just by looking， whether pollen containing a foreign gene can poison butterflies or fertilize plants miles away. That invisibility is precisely what worries people. How， exactly， will GM crops affect the environment-and when will we notice?\n【save__datas】\t【659】\tAdvocates of GM， or transgenic， crops say the plants will benefit the environment by requiring fewer toxic pesticides than conventional crops. But critics fear the potential risks and won-der how big the benefits really are.“We have so many questions about these plants，\"remarks Guenther Stotzky， a soil micro-biologist at New York University.“There’s a lot we don’t know and need to find out.\"\n【save__datas】\t【660】\tAs GM crops multiply in the landscape， unprecedented numbers of researchers have started fanning into the fields to get the missing information. Some of their recent findings are reassuring； others suggest a need for vigilance.\n【save__datas】\t【661】\tFewer Poisons in the Soil?\n【save__datas】\t【663】\tIn the mid-1990s agribusinesses began advertising GM seeds that promised to reduce a farmer’s use of toxic pesticides. Today most GM crops-mainly soybean， corn， cotton and--connect--【664】canola-contain genes enabling them to either resist insect pests or tolerate weed-killing herbicides \\[see box on page 56\\]. The insect-resistant varieties make their own insecticide， a property meant to reduce the need for chemical sprays. The herbicide tolerant types survive when exposed to broad-spectrum weec killers， potentially allowing farmers to forgo more poisonous chemicals that target specific weed species. Farmers like to limit the use of more hazardous pesticides when they can， but GM crops also hold appeal because they simplify operations(reducing the frequency and complexity of pesticide applications) and， in some cases， increase yields.\n【save__datas】\t【665】\tBut confirming environmental benefit is tricky. Virtually no peer-reviewed papers have addressed such advantages， which would be expected to vary from plant to plant and place to place. Some information is available， however. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture， farmers who plant herbicide-tolerant crops do not necessarily use fewer sprays， but they do apply a more benign mix of chemicals. For instance，those who grow herbicide-tolerant soybeans typically avoid the most noxious weed killer， turning instead to glyphosate herbicides， which are less toxic and degrade more quickly.\n【save__datas】\t【666】\tInsect-resistant crops also bring mixed benefits. To date， insect resistance has been provided by a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). This gene directs cells to manufacture a crystalline protein that is toxic to certain insects-especially caterpillars and beetles that gnaw on crops but does not harm other organisms. The toxin gene in different strains of B. thuringiensis can affect different mixes of insects， so seed makers can select the version that seems best suited to a particular crop.\n【save__datas】\t【667】\tOf all the crops carrying Bt genes， cotton has brought the biggest drop in pesticide use. According to the Environmental Protection Agency， in 1999 growers in states using high amounts of Bt cotton sprayed 21 percent less insecticide than usual on the crop. That’sa“dramatic and impressive”reduction， says Stephen Johnson， an administrator in the EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs. Typically， Johnson says， a farmer might spray\n【save__datas】\t【668】\tMonarch butterflies have become a focus of worru.--connect--【669】insecticides on a cotton field seven to 14 times during a single growing season. “If you choose a Bt cotton product， you may have little or no use for these pretty harsh chemicals，” he notes. Growers of Bt corn and potatoes report less of a pesticide reduction， partly because those plants normally require fewer pesticides and face fluctuating numbers of pests.\n【save__datas】\t【670】\tDefining the environmental risks of GM crops seems even harder than calculating their benefits. At the moment， public attention is most trained on Bt crops， thanks to several negative--connect--【671】studies. Regulators， too， are surveying the risks intensely. This spring or summer the EPA is expected to issue major new guidelines for Bt crops， ordering seed producers to show more thoroughly that the crops can be planted safely and monitored in farm fields.\n【save__datas】\t【672】\tIn the face of mounting consumer concern， scientists are stepping up research into the consequences of Bt and other GM crops. Among their questions： How do Bt crops affect“non-target”organisms-the innocent bugs， birds， worms and other--connect--【673】creatures that happen to pass by the modified plants? Will GM crops pollinate nearby plants， casting their genes into the wild to create superweeds that grow unchecked? What are the odds that the genetically engineered traits will lose their ability to protect against insects and invasive weeds， leaving GM plants suddenly vulnerable?\n【save__datas】\t【674】\tAt What Cost to Wildlife?\n【save__datas】\t【676】\t“That was the straw that broke the camel’s back，\" says David--connect--【677】from plots of GM corn， estimating how much of it drifts onto plants such as milkweed and， finally， determining the exposure of butterfly and moth larvae to the protein.

What is toxic? The EPA estimates that the insects face no observable harm when consuming milkweed leaves laden with up to 150 corn pollen grains per square centimeter of leaf surface. Recent studies of milkweed plants in and around the cornfields of Maryland， Nebraska and Ontario report far lower levels of Bt pollen， ranging from just six to 78 grains of Bt corn pollen per square centimeter of milkweed leaf surface.“The weight of the evidence suggests Bt corn pollen in the field does not pose a hazard to monarch larvae，\" concludes EPA scientist\n【save__datas】\t【679】\tThe weight of evidence suggests that pollen from insect-resistant corn plants in the field does not pose a hazard to the larvae of monarch butterflies.

Such studies “require more time than has been available since the registration of Bt crops，” Vaituzis remarked. The EPA，--connect--【685】built into many GM crops.--connect--【686】he added， continues to collect Bt crop data-but so far without evidence of“unreasonable adverse effects\"on insects in the field.\n【save__datas】\t【687】\tSeeding Superweeds?\n【save__datas】\t【689】\tSo far no scientific studies have found evidence of GM crops causing superweeds，and a 10-year study reported in Nature in February found no weedlike behavior by GM potatoes， beets， corn or canola planted in England. But worrisome anecdotes have appeared. Canadian farmers， in particular， have described GM canola escaping from farm fields and invading wheat crops like a weed. This canola also resisted pesticide sprays.\n【save__datas】\t【690】\tPower’s studies of gene flow from virus-resistant GM plants give further reason for precaution. For now， virus-resistant crops stake a small share of the GM landscape， but they are likely to become more prevalent， particularly in the developing world. Power investigates gene flow in cultivated grain crops—wheat， barley and oats-engineered to contain genes that make the plants resistant to the barley yellow dwarf virus (which--connect--【691】damages some 100 grass species).

If that happened in the field， she says， wild oats might run amok in the western U.S.， outcompeting native grasses with kudzu-like intensity. Every GM crop， Power cautions， brings its owr environmental personality and its own risks.\n【save__datas】\t【693】\tIn the U.S.， at least， landscape logistics make it rather unlikely that herbicide-tolerant or Bt crops will spread their biotech genes to weeds. That’s because the GM crops sown in this country have no close relatives in the regions where they grow； most plants can pollinate others only if the recipients and the donors have certain features in common， such as the same chromosome number， life cycle or preferred habitat. A known exception tc the “no relatives” rule in the U.S. is wild cotton growing in Hawaii and southern Florida， which， by virtue of its unusual similarity to GM cotton， can accept the GM pollen. To separate the wild and biotech plants from each other， the EPA has ordered companies not to sell GM cotton south of Florida’s Interstate 60 or in Hawaii.\n【save__datas】\t【694】\tBut it may prove harder to avoid creating superweeds outside North America， where weedy relatives of cultivated crops are common.

The company contends that roughly 90 percent of Bt corn and cotton growers comply with refuge requirements.\n【save__datas】\t【714】\tBut some environmentalists question that rosy scenario anc also argue that non-Bt refuges are either too small or too poorly designed to keep insect resistance at bay for long.“At the EPA meeting last fall， scientists seemed to agree that bigger， better refuges were the way to go but that cotton farmers would never agree to big refuges，” says Rebecca Goldburg， a senior scientist at Environmental Defense， a nonprofit organization based in New York City. More broadly， Goldburg questions how much GM crops really do for the environment.“In however many years，\" she says， “we'll lose Bt as an effective control against insects， and then we’ll be on to another chemical control. Many of us view this current generation of biotech crops as a kind of diversion， rather than a substantive gain for agriculture.\"She favors sustainable agriculture alternatives， including careful crop rotation and organic farming methods， over pesticides sprayed on or engineered into plants.\n【save__datas】\t【715】\tU.S. landscape logistics make it unlikely that herbicide-tolerant or Bt crops will spread their biotechgenes.\n【save__datas】\t【716】\tIt may be harder to avoid creating superweeds elsewhere.\n【save__datas】\t【717】\tTo keep weeds vulnerable to herbicides， Monsanto and other companies urge growers to use the sprays responsibly， only when necessary. To slow insect resistance to the Bt toxin， the EPA requires Bt crop growers to set aside some part of their farmland for crops that have not been genetically modified.

But opponents of genetically modified foods worry that splicing foreign genes (often from bacteria) into food plants through recombinant-DNA technology could lead to even nas-tier health surprises. The stakes are high： GM foods are sold in many countries. In the U.S.， an estimated 60 percent of processed foods in supermarkets-from breakfast cereals to soft drinks-contain a GM ingredient， especially soy， corn or canola； some fresh vegetables are genetically altered as well.\n【save__datas】\t【737】\tDetractors cite several reasons for concern. Perhaps proteins made from the foreign genes will be directly toxic to humans. Maybe the genes will alter the functioning of a plant in ways that make its food component less nutritious or more prone to carrying elevated levels of the natural poisons that many plants contain in small amounts. Or perhaps the modified plant will synthesize proteins able to elicit allergic reactions.--connect--【739】genetically modified to produce an insecticidal protein from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)-turned up in taco shells， corn chips and other foods. Before the corn was ever planted commercially， U.S. regulators saw signs that its particular ver sion of the Bt protein could be allergenic； they therefore ap proved StarLink for use only in animal feed， not in grocery products. They are examining claims of allergic reactions to foods harboring that corn， but a scientific advisory committee has determined that the amounts in consumer products were quite low and thus unlikely to provoke allergic reactions.\n【save__datas】\t【740】\tProponents offer a number of defenses for genetically en-gineered foods. Inserting carefully selected genes into a plant is safer than introducing thousands of genes at once， as com-monly occurs when plants are crossbred in the standard way. GM crops designed to limit the need for toxic pesticides can potentially benefit health indirectly， by reducing human ex-posure to those chemicals. More directly， foods under study are being designed to be more nutritious than their standard counterparts. Further， GM crops that produced extra nutrients or that grew well in poor conditions could provide critical help--connect--【741】to people in developing nations who suffer from malnutrition.\n【save__datas】\t【742】\tAdvocates note， too， that every genetically engineered food crop has been thoroughly tested for possible health effects. Rel-atively few independent studies have been published， but man---connect--【744】ufacturers have conducted extensive analyses， because they are legally required to ensure that the foods they sell meet federal safety standards. In the past， the companies have submitted test results to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration voluntarily in advance of sale. But an FDA rule proposed in January should make such review mandatory.\n【save__datas】\t【745】\tThe manufacturers’studies typically begin by comparing the GM version under consideration with conventionally bred plants of the same variety， to see whether the addition of a for---connect--【747】eign gene significantly alters the GM plant’s chemical makeup and nutritional value. If the proteins made from the inserted genes are the only discernible differences， those proteins are checked for toxicity by feeding them to animals in quantities thousands of times higher than humans would ever consume. If the genetic modification leads to more extensive changes， tox-icity testers may feed the complete GM food to lab animals.\n【save__datas】\t【748】\tTo assess the allergy-inducing potential， scientists check the--connect--【749】to be abandoned before they had a chance to hit grocery shelves.“I don’t know of any evidence that any product on the market is unsafe，” says Peter Day， director of the Institute of Biomolecular Research at Rutgers University.\n【save__datas】\t【750】\tThe safety tests are not necessarily foolproof， though. For example， GM plants often cannot make enough of the foreign protein for use in feeding studies. So researchers have bacteria churn out the proteins. But a protein made by plants， the form people would consume， might be slightly different from the one made by microbes-a difference that might theoretically affect the safety assessment of that protein. And studies using whole GM foods are limited by the amount of any food that can be introduced into an animal’s diet without generating nutritional imbalances that can confound the test results. This effect is one reason that scientists have criticized a controversial 1999 study claiming that the foreign DNA in GM potatoes led to abnor-malities in the intestinal lining in rats.\n【save__datas】\t【751】\tBeyond the acute safety considerations， some critics fear that GM foods will do harm more insidiously， by hastening the spread of antibiotic resistance in disease-causing bacteria. When food designers genetically alter a plant， they couple the--connect--【752】chemical makeup of each novel protein produced by the ge-s netically altered plant against those of 500 or so known aller---connect--【754】gens； having a similar chemistry would raise a red flag. Proteins are also treated with acid to mimic the environment they will encounter in the stomach； most known allergens are quite sta-ble and survive such treatment unscathed.

HORSCH.--connect--【779】vice president of product and technology cooperation at Monsanto Company， received the 1998 National MedalofTechnology for his pioneeringexperiments in the genetic modification of plant cells. Hetalks about the promise of GM crops.\n【save__datas】\t【780】\tHow did you become interested in the genetic modification of plants?\n【save__datas】\t【781】\tI started in this field with a strong interest in plants but with what you might call an academ-ic interest in agriculture. I had this vague， naive notion that if we could genetically improve plants with the new tools of molecular biology， we would find a way to make biotechnology rel-evant to agriculture.\n【save__datas】\t【782】\tThat has now happened. Biotechnology is a great tool that will allow us to produce more food on less land and with less depletion or dam--age to water resources and biodiversity. I am convinced that biotechnology is not just relevant but imperative for helping us meet the rapidly--connect--【783】growing demand for food and other agricultur-al products. The combination of more people and rising incomes will increase the demand for food by at least 50 percent in the next 25 years.\n【save__datas】\t【784】\tBut critics of genetically modified foods point out that companies are not going to start giving products away.Can a corporation like Monsanto make biotechnology affordable for farmers in the developing world?\n【save__datas】\t【785】\tCultivating commercial markets and applying technology to help the developing world are not mutually exclusive at all. One approach that works very well is to segment the market into three different areas. One is the pure commer-cial market. It makes economic sense， as a for-profit company， for us to invest in products and market developments in places where we can sell our products and where we think we can make a profit.\n【save__datas】\t【786】\tThe other end of the spectrum is noncom-mercial technology transfer， which is largely fo-cused on public-sector collaboration. Take， for example， our collaboration to put virus-resis tance genes in the sweet potato. We will never have a commercial business in the sweet potato because it’s just not a market economy crop. But by sharing our intellectual property and our technical knowledge with scientists from Kenya， we have helped them develop sweet potatoes that show resistance to the most serious sweet potato disease in Africa， which can cause the loss of 20 to 80 percent of the crop.\n【save__datas】\t【787】\tThen there's a third area， what I call a tran-sitional market， where we have less experience related to biotechnology but that in the long run I think may be more powerful and beneficial for development efforts. We have used this ap-proach with our older， nonbiotech products，--connect--【788】such as high-yielding corn hybrids， and I think we can use it in the future with biotech products. Small farmers can see results in a demonstration plot and， if they want， try it themselves on a portion of their farm. If it works for them， they can expand or repeat it the next year. We have programs like this in Mexico， India and parts of Africa. By the third or fourth year， if it’s work-ing， the farmers will have made enough money from the exper-imentation phase to be able to run essentially on their own.\n【save__datas】\t【789】\tAnd what about profits for Monsanto?\n【save__datas】\t【790】\tWe sell the seeds and the herbicide at market prices， and we subsidize the learning， the testing and the development of dis-tribution channels so that we don’t actually make a profit in the first several years. Only if the project is successful enough to be-come self-sustaining will we start making a profit. At this point， we haven’t gotten that far with any of these programs.\n【save__datas】\t【791】\tLet's turn to the environmental effects of GM crops. What do you--connect--【792】considerthe most important benefits of the technology? Lower use of pesticides is the environmental benefit that people relate to immediately， and it’s huge for a product like Bt cotton.\n【save__datas】\t【793】\t\\[Editors'note： Bt crops have been genetically modified to pro-duce a bacterial protein that kills certain insect pests.\\] According\n【save__datas】\t【795】\tBeyond that there are also yield benefits. The Bt corn we have today doesn’t displace a whole lot of insecticides， but what it does do is boost the yields by a noticeable margin. It depends on the year and on the region， but the increase in yield can range from 5 to 15 percent. If you think about it， that leverages land use， water use， fertilizer use and all the pesticides that go into growing corn. You get a 10 percent greater corn harvest with the same resources that you were going to use anyway. You’re getting more out of your resources.\n【save__datas】\t【796】\tGetting more from really good farmland， then setting aside land that is of marginal quality and returning it to habitat for wildlife is very beneficial to the environment. We can’t con-tinue to indefinitely expand our old practices-of chemical use， of water diversion， of plowing wild lands and converting them to farms， of nonagricultural sprawl and of the production of industrial waste.\n【save__datas】\t【797】\tOne of the benefits of biotech that we first heard about was nutritionally enhanced foods. But despite promises of healthier broccoli， we have Bt com. The famous\"golden rice”is not available to consumers yet and is still in very early stages of testing. Will we ever have nutritionally enhanced foods? We’re seeing progress across industry， academia and the non-profit community. For example， we are collaborating with a non-profit group， TERI \\[Tata Energy Research Institute\\] in India， on development of a product related to golden rice-golden mus-tard oil-that， like golden rice， is high in beta-carotene， a pre---connect--【798】cursor of vitamin A. This may help alleviate vitamin A defi ciencies in places where mustard oil is a staple in the local diet.\n【save__datas】\t【799】\tWhile making improvements to food for the industrial world is not a priority for Monsanto， other companies and uni-v4-ersity researchers are working hard in this area. For example， Du Pont has developed a modified oil with an increased amount of the fatty acid oleic acid. This product has reduced levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids and is more stable upon storage. Efforts are under way to modify other fatty acids to make oils more healthy for consumers. Also， there is research ongoing elsewhere to increase the amount of vitamin D in soybean oil.\n【save__datas】\t【800】\tMonsanto and other scientists have also been involved in re-search that may help reduce the likelihood of allergic responses to foods. We have been able to take a protein that is currently an allergen and modify specific amino acids in the protein to dra matically reduce the allergenic nature of the protein. Other sci-entists are using this and other methods to reduce the allergenic nature of some foods， such as peanuts and soybeans， which cause allergic reactions in a significant number of people.\n【save__datas】\t【801】\tMonsanto has been one of the most criticized， even despised， corporations because of its role in the development of genetically modified foods. Has it everbeen hard to tell people you're an employee of Monsanto?\n【save__datas】\t【802】\tI've had a few people react negatively， but my experience is that when people meet you as a person， their reactions are very dif-ferent than when they are commenting on the big nameless， faceless company.\n【save__datas】\t【803】\tI think the company is making an effort to address people’s concerns about GM foods more openly. We've recognized that some genetic modifications are particularly bothersome. Among vegetarians， for instance， the idea of eating a vegetable that has an animal gene in it might raise questions. For certain cultures or religious groups， there could be similar concerns. So we de-cided it was better to avoid using animal genes in food crops.\n【save__datas】\t【804】\tI don’t think it serves anybody's interest-including Mon-santo's-to discount the potential risks of biotechnology. But for where we are today， and for what I see in the pipeline for the next few years， I really don’t see a measurable risk from the GM products we are selling or developing. There have been nu-merous national and international scientific organizations that have reached this same conclusion， including the American Medical Association， the National Academy of Sciences， the World Health Organization and many others.\n【save__datas】\t【805】\tWe at Monsanto have recently pledged to listen better to and engage in dialogue with concerned groups， to be more transparent in the methods we use and the data we have about safety， to respect the cultural and ethical concerns of others， to share our technology with developing countries， and to make sure we deliver real benefits to our customers and to the envi-ronment.Ithink this new attitude and new set of commitments will help improve both our company's image and the accep-tance of this new technology.--connect--【809】think its use in drug manufacture， for example， makes a lot of sense. The therapeutic benefits of the new drugs outweigh the risks， and often there aren't any alternatives. But in agriculture， it’s different. So far， at least， there are only mod-est benefits associated with biotechnology prod-ucts， and it has yet to be shown that the benefits outweigh the risks. And there are exciting alter-natives to solving agricultural problems that we are simply ignoring.\n【save__datas】\t【810】\tAgriculture isn’t like medicine. We in the U.S. produce far more food than we need. And we are so wealthy that whatever we can’t pro-duce we can buy from somebody else. As a re-sult， there are about 300，000 food products on our grocery shelves and 10，000 new ones added every year. The notion that consumers in the U.S. fundamentally need new biotechnology foods isn't persuasive.\n【save__datas】\t【811】\tBut， of course，many scientists and policy ex-perts argue that we do need biotechnology to feed the world， especially the developing world. That is an important question to ask because so many people-about 800 million-are under nourished or hungry. But is genetic engineering the best or only solution? We have sufficient food now， but it doesn't get to those who need it. Most hungry people simply can’t afford to buy what's already out there even though com-modity prices are at all-time lows. How does ge-netic engineering address the problems of in-come disparity?\n【save__datas】\t【812】\tThe real tragedy is that the debate about biotechnology is diverting attention from solv-ing the problem of world hunger. I’d like to see people seriously asking the question，“ What can we do to help the world’s hungry feed them-selves?”and then make a list of answers. Better--connect--【813】technology， including genetic engineering， would be some-where on the list， but it would not be at the top. Trade policy， infrastructure and land reform are much more important， yet they are barely mentioned.\n【save__datas】\t【814】\tGenetic engineering has a place and should not be taken off the table， but I don't believe it is a panacea for world hunger. Treating it as if it is distorts this important debate. It is also amazing to me how quickly some have dismissed the virtues of traditional breeding-the technology that， after all， made us into an agricultural powerhouse.\n【save__datas】\t【815】\tCan we turn to anotherpotential benefit that people claim for\n【save__datas】\t【816】\tGM foods： agriculture that is more environmentally friendly? Let’s ask a question： What is a green agriculture? Is it one that doesn’t depend on pesticides? I think it’s a lot more than that， actually. But if we just consider avoiding pesticide use， we now have some data on the impacts of engineered crops. Surveys of American farmers by the Department of Agriculture show that the use of Bt \\[pest-resistant\\] corn aimed at the corn borer. for example， hasn’t done much to reduce the application of pesti-cides to corn， because the vast majority of corn acreage isn't treated with pesticide to control that pest.\n【save__datas】\t【817】\tThe introduction of Bt cotton， however， has resulted in a measurable drop in pesticide use. That’s good for the environ-ment and good for the farmers who cut their input costs. But this benefit will last only as long as the Bt trait keeps working. I think most scientists expect that the way Bt crops are being deployed will lead-sooner rather than later-to the evolution of resistance in the target pests， which means that the Bt cotton won't work anymore. We are likely to run through Bt cotton just like we ran through all the pesticides before it. So it isn’t a durable path to a greener agriculture.\n【save__datas】\t【818】\tAnd there are environmental risks out there. Most scientists agree now that gene flow will occur-genes will go from engi-neered crops to nearby relatives. That means pollen will carry novel genes from the agricultural settings into neighbors'fields or into the wild. Gene flow from herbicide-resistant GM crops into the wild is already leading to the creation of herbicide-resistant weeds in Canada.\n【save__datas】\t【819】\tWhat about the health risks of GM foods? Do you see any looming problems?\n【save__datas】\t【820】\tI know of no reason to say the foods currently on the market are not safe to consume. But I don’t have as much confidence as I should in that statement. There was a letter published in the journal Science last June from someone who had searched the literature for peer-reviewed studies comparing GM food to non-GM food. The researcher found something like five stud-ies. That’s not enough of a basis on which to claim， from a sci-entific standpoint， that we know enough to assure ourselves that these foods are going to be safe.\n【save__datas】\t【821】\tWith the little we know about the food safety issue， I would say the biggest concern is allergenicity. Introducing new tox---connect--【822】ins into food is also a risk. Of course， breeders are going to try to avoid doing that， but plants have lots of toxins in them； as scientists manipulate systems that they don’t completely un-derstand， one of the unexpected effects could be turning on genes for toxins. There are rules that govern how genes come together and come apart in traditional breeding. We're not obeying those rules.\n【save__datas】\t【823】\tSo you don't see genetic engineering of crops to be an extension oftraditional breeding?\n【save__datas】\t【824】\tNo， not at all. You just can't get an elephant to mate with a corn plant. Scientists are making combinations of genes that are not found in nature.\n【save__datas】\t【825】\tFrom a scientific standpoint， there is no dispute that this is fundamentally different from what has been done before. And that it is unnatural. Now， because it’s new and unnatural doesn’t necessarily mean that it will prove to be more risky. But it is cer-tainly a big enough break with what we have done before to de-mand an extra measure of caution.\n【save__datas】\t【826】\tAnd caution is particularly appropriate where the technol-ogy involves our food supply. Lots and lots of people—virtu-ally the whole population-could be exposed to genetically en-gineered foods， and yet we have only a handful of studies in the peer-reviewed literature addressing their safety. The question is， do we assume the technology is safe based on an argument that it's just a minor extension of traditional breeding， or do we prove it? The scientist in me wants to prove it’s safe. Why rest on assumptions when you can go into the lab?\n【save__datas】\t【827】\tScience can never prove that any technology is 100 percent--connect--【828】safe. Will you everbe satisfied that we've tested GM foods enough? And how much risk is acceptable?\n【save__datas】\t【829】\tSure， I could be satisfied that GM foods have been adequately tested. But it’s premature to address that question now. No-body is saying，“Look， we’ve got this large body of peer-re-viewed experimental data comparing GM with non-GM foods on a number of criteria that demonstrate the food is safe.”\n【save__datas】\t【830】\tWhen we have generated such a body of evidence， then there will be an issue of whether what we have is enough. And eventually， if things go well， we'll get to a point where we say， we’ve been cautious， but now we’re going to move ahead-we need to fish or cut bait. But we’re nowhere near that point now.\n【save__datas】\t【831】\tObviously， we take risks all the time. But why are we tak-ing these risks? If we didn’t have an abundant food supply， if we didn’t have something like 300，000 food products on our shelves already， then we would have an argument for taking this society-wide risk.

Human interaction has both verbal and nonverbal--connect--【844】elements， and videoconferencing seems precisely configured to--connect--【845】confound the nonverbal ones. It is impossible to make eye contact--connect--【846】properly， for instance， in today's video-conferencing systems， because the cam-era and the display screen cannot be in the same spot. This usually leads to a deadened and formal affect in interac-tions， eye contact being a nearly ubiqui-tous subconscious method of affirming trust. Furthermore， participants aren’t able to establish a sense of position rela-tive to one another and therefore have no clear way to direct attention， ap proval or disapproval.\n【save__datas】\t【847】\tTele-immersion， a new medium for human interaction enabled by digital technologies， approximates the illusion that a user is in the same physical space as other people， even though the other participants might in fact be hundreds or thousands of miles away. It combines the display and interaction techniques of vir-tual reality with new vision technologies that transcend the traditional limitations of a camera. Rather than merely obsery-ing people and their immediate environ-ment from one vantage point， tele-im-mersion stations convey them as “moving sculptures，” without favoring a single--connect--【848】point of view. The result is that all the par-ticipants， however distant， can share and explore a life-size space.\n【save__datas】\t【849】\tBeyond improving on videoconfer-encing， tele-immersion was conceived as an ideal application for driving network-engineering research， specifically for In-ternet2， the primary research consortium for advanced network studies in the U.S. If a computer network can support tele-immersion， it can probably support any other application. This is because tele-im1--mersion demands as little delay as possi-ble from flows of information (and as lit-tle inconsistency in delay)， in addition to the more common demands for very large and reliable flows.\n【save__datas】\t【850】\tVirtual Reality and Networks\n【save__datas】\t【852】\tIn 1965 Ivan Sutherland， who is widely regarded as the father of computer graph1--\n【save__datas】\t【853】\tOverview /Tele-immersion\n【save__datas】\t【854】\t■This new telecommunications medium， which combines aspects of virtual reality with videoconferencing， aims to allow people separated by great distances to interact naturally， as though they were in the same room.\n【save__datas】\t【855】\t■Tele-immersion is being developed as a prototype application for the newInternet2research consortium.

Sutherland termed such a space a“Virtu-al World，\" invoking a term from the phi-losophy of aesthetics， particularly the writings of Suzanne K. Langer. In 1968Sutherland realized a virtual world for the first time by means of a device called a head-mounted display. This was a helmet with a pair of display screens positioned in front of the eyes to give the wearer a sense of immersion in a stereoscopic， three-dimensional space. When the user moved his or her head， a computer would quickly recompute the images in front of each eye to maintain the illusion that the computer-rendered world remained sta-tionary as the user explored it.\n【save__datas】\t【858】\tIn the course of the 1980s I uninten-tionally ended up at the helm of the first company to sell general-purpose tools for making and experiencing virtual worlds-in large part because of this magazine.\n【save__datas】\t【859】\tScientific American devoted its Septem---connect--【860】ber 1984 issue to emerging digital tech-nologies and chose to use one of my vi-sual-programming experiments as an illustration for the cover.\n【save__datas】\t【861】\tAt one point I received a somewhat panicked phone call from an editor who noticed that there was no affiliation list-ed for me.

After the issue's pub-lication， investors came calling， and a company came to exist in reality. In the mid-1980s VPL began selling virtual-world tools and was well known for its introduction of glove devices， which were featured on another Scientific American cover， in October 1987.\n【save__datas】\t【865】\tVPL performed the first experiments in what I decided to call “virtual reality”in the mid- to late 1980s. Virtual reality combines the idea of virtual worlds with networking， placing multiple participants in a virtual space using head-mounted displays. In 1989 VPL introduced a prod-uct called RB2， for “Reality Built for Two，”\" that allowed two participants to share a virtual world.

The original network， the Arpanet， was conceived in the late 1960s. Other networks were inspired by it， and in the 1980s all of them merged into the Internet. As the Internet grew， various“backbones”were built. A backbone is a network within a network that lets in-formation travel over exceptionally pow-erful， widely shared connections to go long distances more quickly. Some no-table backbones designed to support re-search were the NSFnet in the late 1980s and the vBNS in the mid-1990s. Each of these played a part in inspiring new ap plications for the Internet， such as the\n【save__datas】\t【878】\tWorld Wide Web. Another backbone-research project， called Abilene， began in1998， and it was to serve a university consortium called Internet2.\n【save__datas】\t【879】\tAbilene now reaches more than 170American research universities. If the on-ly goal of Internet2 were to offer a high level of bandwidth (that is， a large num-ber of bits per second)， then the mere ex-istence of Abilene and related resources would be sufficient.

He used the term“tele-immersion”to conjure an ideal “driver”application and asked me to take the assignment as lead scientist for a National Tele-Immersion Initiative to create it. I was delighted， as this was the logical extension of my previous work in shared virtual worlds.\n【save__datas】\t【881】\tAlthough many components， such--connect--【883】ased toward any particular viewpoint (a camera， in contrast， is locked into por-traying a scene from its own position). Each place， and the people and things in it， has to be sensed from all directions at once and conveyed as if it were an ani-mated three-dimensional sculpture. Each remote site receives information describ-ing the whole moving sculpture and ren-ders viewpoints as needed locally. The scanning process has to be accomplished fast enough to take place in real time一at most within a small fraction of a sec-ond. The sculpture representing a person can then be updated quickly enough to achieve the illusion of continuous mo-tion. This illusion starts to appear at about 12.5 frames per second (fps) but becomes robust at about 25 fps and bet-ter still at faster rates.\n【save__datas】\t【884】\tMeasuring the moving three-dimen-sional contours of the inhabitants of a room and its other contents can be ac-complished in a variety of ways.

Computer science has traditionally been driven by an educated guess that there will always be good uses for faster and more capa-cious digital tools， even if we don’t always know in advance what those uses will be. In the case of advanced networking re-search， however， this faith wasn’t enough. The new ideas would have to be tested on something.\n【save__datas】\t【891】\tAllan H.

It might not be immediately ap-parent why this problem is different from videoconferencing.\n【save__datas】\t【894】\tTele-immersion demands that each scene be sensed in a manner that is not bi---connect--【895】ly as 1993， Henry Fuchs of the Universi-ty of North Carolina at Chapel Hill had proposed one method， known as the“sea of cameras\" approach， in which the view-points of many cameras are compared. In typical scenes in a human environment， there will tend to be visual features， such as a fold in a sweater， that are visible to more than one camera. By comparing the angle at which these features are seen by different cameras， algorithms can piece together a three-dimensional model of the scene.\n【save__datas】\t【896】\tThis technique had been explored in non-real-time configurations， notably in Takeo Kanade's work， which later cul-minated in the “Virtualized Reality’demonstration at Carnegie Mellon Uni-versity， reported in 1995. That setup con sisted of 51 inward-looking cameras mounted on a geodesic dome. Because it--connect--【897】was not a real-time device， it could not be used for tele-immersion. Instead video-tape recorders captured events in the dome for later processing.\n【save__datas】\t【898】\tRuzena Bajcsy， head of the GRASP(General Robotics， Automation， Sensing and Perception) Laboratory at the Uni-versity of Pennsylvania， was intrigued by the idea of real-time seas of cameras. Starting in 1994， she worked with col-leagues at Chapel Hill and Carnegie Mel-lon on small-scale “puddles” of two or three cameras to gather real-world data for virtual-reality applications.\n【save__datas】\t【899】\tBajcsy and her colleague Kostas Dani-ilidis took on the assignment of creating the first real-time sea of cameras—one that was， moreover， scalable and modu-lar so that it could be adapted to a vari-ety of rooms and uses. They worked closely with the Chapel Hill team， which was responsible for taking the “animat-ed sculpture” data and using computer graphics techniques to turn it into a re-alistic scene for each user.\n【save__datas】\t【900】\tBut a sea of cameras in itself isn't a complete solution. Suppose a sea of cam-eras is looking at a clean white wall. Be-cause there are no surface features， the cameras have no information with which to build a sculptural model. A person can look at a white wall without being con-fused. Humans don’t worry that a wall might actually be a passage to an infinite-ly deep white chasm， because we don’t re-ly on geometric cues alone-we also have a model of a room in our minds that can rein in errant mental interpretations. Un-fortunately， to today's digital cameras， a person’s forehead or T-shirt can present the same challenge as a white wall， and today’s software isn’t smart enough to undo the confusion that results.\n【save__datas】\t【901】\tResearchers at Chapel Hill came up with a novel method that has shown promise for overcoming this obstacle， called “imperceptible structured light，”or ISL. Conventional lightbulbs flicker 50 or60 times a second， fast enough for the flickering to be generally invisible to the human eye. Similarly， ISL appears to the human eye as a continuous source of white light， like an ordinary lightbulb， but in fact it is filled with quickly changing patterns visible only to specialized， care---connect--【902】fully synchronized cameras. These pat-terns fill in voids such as white walls with imposed features that allow a sea of cam-eras to complete the measurements.\n【save__datas】\t【903】\tThe Eureka Moment\n【save__datas】\t【905】\tUnlike the cartoonish virtual worlds I had worked with for many years， the re-mote people and places I was seeing were clearly derived from reality. They were not perfect by any means. There was “noise” in the system that looked something like confetti be-ing dropped in the other people’s cubicles. The frame rate was low(2 to 3 fps)， there was as much as one second of delay， and only one side of the conversation had ac-cess to a tele-immersive display. Nevertheless， here was a virtual world that was not a simplistic artistic representation of the real world but rather an authentic mea-surement-based rendition of it.\n【save__datas】\t【906】\tIn a later demo (in October2000) most of the confetti was--connect--【907】gone and the overall quality and speed of the system had increased， but the most important improvement came from re-searchers at Brown University led by An-dries van Dam. They arrived in a tele-im-mersive session bearing virtual objects not derived from the physical scene. I sat across the table from Robert C. Zeleznik of Brown， who was physically at my lab in Armonk. He presented a simulatec miniature office interior (about two fee wide) resting on the desk between us，and we used simulated laser pointers and oth-er devices to modify walls and furniture in it collaboratively while we talked. This was a remarkable blending of the expe rience of using simulations associated with virtual reality and simply being with another person.\n【save__datas】\t【908】\tWhen CanlUse t?\n【save__datas】\t【911】\tIn this highly simplified scheme for how a future tele-im mersion--connect--【912】scheme might work， two partners separated by 1，000 miles\n【save__datas】\t【913】\tTele-immersion depends on intense data processing at each end of a connection， mediated by a high-performance network.\n【save__datas】\t【917】\tIt looks like standard white--connect--【918】illumination to the naked eye，--connect--【919】but it projects unnoticeably brief flickerings of patterns that help the computers make sense of otherwise featureless visual expanses.\n【save__datas】\t【922】\t1An array of cameras views people and their surroundings from different angles. Each camera generates an image from its point of view many times in a second.\n【save__datas】\t【923】\tEach set of the images taken at a given instant is sorted into subsets of overlapping trios of images.\n【save__datas】\t【925】\tCurrent prototypes use two overlapping projections of polarized images and require users to wear polarized glasses so that each image is seen by only one eye. This technique will be replaced in the future by“autostereoscopic\" displaus that channel images to each eye differentially without the need for glasses.\n【save__datas】\t【926】\tFrom each trio of images， a3“disparity map\" is calculated， reflecting the degree of variation among the images at all points in the visual field. The disparities are then analyzed to yield depths that would account for the differences between what each camera sees.These depth values are combined into a “bas relief\"depth map of the scene.\n【save__datas】\t【927】\tAll the depth maps\n【save__datas】\t【929】\tSpecific renderings of remote people and places are synthesized from the model as it is received to match the points of view of each eye of a user.

Literally dozens of such processors are currently needed at each site to keep up with the demands of tele-immersion. These accumulate either as personal com-puters in plastic cases lined up on shelves or as circuit boards in refrigerator-size racks. I sometimes joke about the num-ber of“refrigerators\" required to achieve a given level of quality in tele-immersion.\n【save__datas】\t【936】\tMost of the processors are assigned to scene acquisition. A sea of cameras con-sists of overlapping trios of cameras. At the moment we typically use an array of--connect--【937】seven cameras for one person seated at a desk， which in practice act as five trios. Roughly speaking， a cluster of eight two-gigahertz Pentium processors with shared memory should be able to process a trio within a sea of cameras in approximately real time. Such processor clusters should be available later this year. Although we expect computer prices to continue to fall as they have for the past few decades， it will still be a bit of a wait before tele-im-mersion becomes inexpensive enough for widespread use. The cost of an eight-processor cluster is anticipated to be in the$30，000 to $50，000 range at introduction， and a number of those would be required for each site (one for each trio of cam-eras)-and this does not even account for\n【[www.com]_filter】\t【939】\tNational Tele-immersionInitiative Web site：Www.advanced.org/teleimmersion.html\n【[www.com]_filter】\t【940】\tTele-immersion at Brown University： www.cs.brown.edu/~lsh/telei.html\n【[www.com]_filter】\t【941】\tTele-immersion at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill：www.cs.unc.edu/Research/stc/teleimmersion/Tele-immersion at the University of Pennsylvania：www.cis.upenn.edu/~sequence/teleim1.html\n【[www.com]_filter】\t【942】\tTele-immersion site at Internet2：www.intemet2.edu/html/tele-immersion.html\n【[www.com]_filter】\t【943】\tInformation about an autostereoscopic display：www.mrl.nyu.edu/projects/autostereo--connect--【944】the processing needed for other tasks. We don’t yet know how many cameras will be required for a given use oftele-immersion， but currently a good guess is that seven is the minimum adequate for casual conver-sation， whereas 60 cameras might be needed for the most demanding applica-tions， such as long-distance surgical dem-onstration， consultation and training.\n【save__datas】\t【945】\tOur computational needs go beyond processing the image streams from the sea of cameras. Still more processors are required to resynthesize and render the SCescene from shifting perspectives as a par-ticipant’s head moves during a session. Initially we used a large custom graphics computer， but more recently we have been able instead to draft commodity processors with low-cost graphics cards， using one processor per eye. Additional processors are required for other tasks， such as combining the results from each of the camera trios， running the imper-ceptible structured light， measuring the head motion of the user， maintaining the user interface， and running virtual-object simulations.\n【save__datas】\t【946】\tFurthermore， because minimizingap-parent latency is at the heart of tele-im-mersion engineering， significant process-ing resources will eventually need to be applied to predictive algorithms. Infor-mation traveling through an optical fiber reaches a destination at about two thirds the speed of light in free space because it is traveling through the fiber medium in-stead of a vacuum and because it does not travel a straight path but rather bounces around in the fiber channel. It therefore takes anywhere from 25 to 50milliseconds for fiber-bound bits of in-formation to cross the continental U.S.. without any allowances for other in-escapable delays， such as the activities of various network signal routers.\n【save__datas】\t【947】\tBy cruel coincidence， some critical as-pects of a virtual world's responsiveness should not be subject to more than 30 to50 milliseconds of delay. Longer delays result in user fatigue and disorientation， a degradation of the illusion and， in the worst case， nausea. Even if we had infi-nitely fast computers at each end， we’d still need to use prediction to compensate for lag when conducting conversations--connect--【948】across the country. This is one reason the current set of test sites are all located on the East Coast.\n【save__datas】\t【949】\tOne promising avenue of exploration in the next few years will be routing tele-immersion processing through remote supercomputer centers in real time to gain access to superior computing pow-er. In this case， a supercomputer will have to be fast enough to compensate for the extra delay caused by the travel time to and from its location.\n【save__datas】\t【950】\tBandwidth is a crucial concern. Our demand for bandwidth varies with the scene and application； a more complex scene requires more bandwidth. We can assume that much of the scene， particu-larly the background walls and such， is unchanging and does not need to be re-sent with each frame. Conveying a single person at a desk， without the surround-ing room， at a slow frame rate of about two frames per second has proved to require around 20 megabits per second but with up to 80-megabit-per-second peaks. With time， however， that number will fall as better compression techniques become established. Each site must re-ceive the streams from all the others， so in a three-way conversation the band-width requirement must be multiplied accordingly. The “last mile”of network connection that runs into computer sci-ence departments currently tends to be an OC3 line， which can carry 155megabits per second-just about right for sustaining a three-way conversation at a slow frame rate. But an OC3 line is approximately 100 times more capa-cious than what is usually considered a broadband connection now， and it is correspondingly more expensive.\n【save__datas】\t【951】\tI am hopeful that in the coming years we will see a version of tele-immersion that does not require users to wear spe-cial glasses or any other devices. Ken Per-lin of New York University has devel-oped a prototype of an autostereoscopic display that might make this possible.\n【save__datas】\t【952】\tRoughly speaking， tele-immersion is about 100 times too expensive to com-pete with other communications tech-nologies right now and needs more pol-ishing besides. My best guess is that it will be good enough and cheap enough--connect--【953】for limited introduction in approximate-ly five years and for widespread use in around 10 years.\n【save__datas】\t【954】\tProspects\n【save__datas】\t【956】\tIn fact， tele-immersion might come to be seen as real competition for air trav-el—unlike videoconferencing. Although few would claim that tele-immersion will be absolutely as good as “being there”in the near term， it might be good enough for business meetings， professional con-sultations， training sessions， trade show exhibits and the like.

For instance， those who worry about how artists， musicians and authors will make a living as copyrights become harder and harder to enforce (as a result of widespread file copying on the Inter-net) have often suggested that paid per sonal appearances are a solution， because personal interaction has more value ir the moment than could be reproduced af terward from a file or recording. Tele-im mersion could make aesthetic interac-tions practical and cheap enough to provide a different basis for commerce ir the arts. It is worth remembering that be-fore the 20th century， all the arts were in-teractive. Musicians interacted directl with audience members， as did actors on a stage and poets in a garden.

Once the earth formed 4.5 billion years ago， asteroid impacts periodically shattered and sterilized the planet’s surface for another half a billion years. And yet， within a few hundred million years of that hellish age， microscopic life appeared in abundance. Sometime in the interim， the first living entity must have been crafted from air， water and rock.\n【save__datas】\t【981】\tOf those three raw materials， the atmosphere and oceans have long enjoyed the starring roles in origins-of-life sce-narios. But rocks， and the minerals of which they are made， have been called on only as bit players or simply as props. Scientists are now realizing that such limited casting is a mis-take. Indeed， a recent flurry of fascinating experiments is re-vealing that minerals play a crucial part in the basic chemi-cal reactions from which life must have arisen.\n【save__datas】\t【982】\tThe first act of life’s origin story must have introduced collections of carbon-based molecules that could make cop-ies of themselves. Achieving even this nascent step in evolu-tion entailed a sequence of chemical transformations， each of which added a level of structure and complexity to a group of organic molecules. The most abundant carbon-based compounds available on the ancient earth were gases with only one atom of carbon per molecule， namely， carbon diox-ide，carbon monoxide and methane. But the essential build-ing blocks of living organisms-energy-rich sugars， mem-brane-forming lipids and complex amino acids-may include more than a dozen carbon atoms per molecule. Many of these molecules， in turn， must bond together to form chain-like polymers and other molecular arrays in order to ac-complish life’s chemical tasks.

It turns out that minerals could have served at least five significant functions， from passive props to active players， in life-inducing chemical reactions. Tiny compartments in mineral structures can shelter sim-ple molecules， while mineral surfaces can provide the scaf-folding on which those molecules assemble and grow. Be-yond these sheltering and supportive functions， crystal faces of certain minerals can actively select particular molecules resembling those that were destined to become biological-ly important. The metallic ions in other minerals can jump-start meaningful reactions like those that must have con-verted simple molecules into self-replicating entities. Most surprising， perhaps， are the recent indications that elements of dissolved minerals can be incorporated into biological molecules. In other words， minerals may not have merely helped biological molecules come together， they might have become part of life itself.\n【save__datas】\t【987】\tProtection from the Elements\n【save__datas】\t【989】\tOne of the most famous experiments took place at the University of Chicago in 1953.

With this sim---connect--【1018】ple yet elegant procedure， Miller trans-formed origins-of-life research from a speculative philosophical game to an ex-acting experimental science. The popular press sensationalized the findings by sug-gesting that synthetic bugs might soon be crawling out of test tubes. The scientific community was more restrained， but many workers sensed that the major ob-stacle to creating life in the laboratory had been solved.\n【save__datas】\t【1019】\tIt did not take long to disabuse re-searchers of that notion. Miller may have discovered a way to make many of life’s--connect--【1020】building blocks out of the earth’s early supply of water and gas， but he had not discovered how or where these simple units would have linked into the complex molecular structures-such as proteins and DNA-that are intrinsic to life.\n【save__datas】\t【1021】\tTo answer that riddle， Miller and other origins scientists began proposing rocks as props. They speculated that or-ganic molecules， floating in seawater， might have splashed into tidal pools along rocky coastlines. These molecules woulc have become increasingly concentratec through repeated cycles of evaporation. like soup thickening in a heated pot.\n【save__datas】\t【1022】\tIn recent years， however， researchers have envisioned that life’s ingredients might have accumulated in much small-er containers. Some rocks， like gray vol canic pumice， are laced with air pockets created when gases expanded inside the rock while it was still molten. Many com mon minerals， such as feldspar， develop microscopic pits during weathering. Each tiny chamber in each rock on the early earth could have housed a separate ex-periment in molecular self-organization. Given enough time and enough cham-bers， serendipity might have produced a combination of molecules that would eventually deserve to be called “living.”\n【save__datas】\t【1023】\tUnderlying much of this speculation was the sense that life was so fragile that it depended on rocks for survival. But in1977 a startling discovery challenged con-ventional wisdom about life’s fragility and， perhaps， its origins. Until then， most scientists had assumed that life spawned at or near the benign ocean surface as a result of chemistry powered by sunlight. That view began to change when deep-ocean explorers first encountered diverse ecosystems thriving at the superheated mouths of volcanic vents on the seafloor. These extreme environments manage to support elaborate communities of living creatures in isolation from the sun. In these dark realms， much of the energy that organisms need comes not from light but from the earth’s internal heat. With this knowledge in mind， a few investigators began to wonder whether organic reac-tions relevant to the origins of life mighi occur in the intense heat and pressure of these so-called hydrothermal vents.\n【save__datas】\t【1026】\t\\-have assisted the emergence of life? The answer is chemistry. Minerals grow from simple molecules into an ordered structure because ofchemical reactions. By the sametoken， all living organisms-from bacteria to bats-owe their ability to grow and function to the hundreds ofchemical reactions that take place inside cells.\n【save__datas】\t【1027】\tFour billion years ago the earth had no life： chemistry， not biology， altered the planet's surface. Inthat ancient time minerals-together withthe oceans and atmosphere-werethe only materials from which the first livingentity could have arisen. Chemical reactions，then， must have been the first steps in the origins of life. A sequence of chemicaltransformations could have reconfigured the simplest components of air， water and rockinto primitive collections of carbon-based molecules that could make copies of themselves.\n【save__datas】\t【1028】\tNew experiments are revealing that the critical transformations might not have been possible without the help of minerals acting as containers， scaffolds， templates， catalysts and reactants.\n【save__datas】\t【1029】\tCONTAINERS-Micros copic pits appear in abundance on the weathered surfaces of feldspar and other common minerals.

This objection， it turns out， may be applicable only when key minerals are left out of the equation. The idea that minerals might have sheltered the ingredients of life re-ceived a boost from recent experiments conducted at my home base， the Carnegie Institution of Washington’s Geophysical Laboratory. As a postdoctoral researcher at Carnegie， my colleague Jay A. Brandes(now at the University of Texas Marine Sciences Institute in Port Aransas) pro-posed that minerals help delicate amino acids remain intact. In 1998 we conduct-ed an experiment in which the amino acid leucine broke down within a matter of minutes in pressurized water at 200degrees Celsius-just as Miller and his colleagues predicted. But when Brandes added to the mix an iron sulfide mineral of the type commonly found in and around hydrothermal vents， the amino acid stayed intact for days-plenty of time to react with other critical molecules.--connect--【1042】suspended in water. These stray mole-cules needed a support structure-some kind of scaffolding-where they could cling and react with one another.\n【save__datas】\t【1043】\tOne easy way to assemble molecules from a dilute solution is to concentrate them on a flat surface. Errant molecules might have been drawn to the calm sur-face of a tidal pool or perhaps to a prim---connect--【1044】itive “oil slick”of compounds trapped at the water's surface. But such environ-ments would have posed a potentially fa-tal hazard to delicate molecules. Harsh lightning storms and ultraviolet radiation accosted the young earth in doses many times greater than they do today. Such conditions would have quickly broken the bonds of complex chains of molecules.\n【save__datas】\t【1045】\tOrigins scientists with a penchant for geology have long recognized that min-erals might provide attractive alternative surfaces where important molecules could assemble. Like the container idea， this notion was born half a century ago. At that time， a few scientists had begun to suspect that clays have special abilities to attract organic molecules \\[see box on--connect--【1046】page 801. These ubiquitous minerals feel slick when wet because their atoms form flat， smooth layers. The surfaces of these layers frequently carry an electric charge， which might be able to attract organic molecules and hold them in place. Ex-periments later confirmed these specula-tions. In the late 1970s an Israeli research group demonstrated that amino acids can concentrate on clay surfaces and then link up into short chains that resemble bi-ological proteins. These chemical reac-一tions occurred when the investigators evaporated a water-based solution con-taining amino acids from a vessel con-一taining clays-a situation not unlike the evaporation of a shallow pond or tidal pool with a muddy bottom.\n【save__datas】\t【1047】\tMore recently， separate research teams led by James P. Ferris of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and by Gustaf Ar-rhenius of the Scripps Institution of Ocean-ography demonstrated that clays and other layered minerals can attract and as-semble a variety of organic molecules. In a tour de force series of experiments dur-ing the past decade， the team at Rensse--laer found that clays can act as scaffolds for the building blocks of RNA， the mol-ecule in living organisms that translates genetic instructions into proteins.\n【save__datas】\t【1048】\tOnce organic molecules had attached--connect--【1049】cules that would become biologically im---connect--【1051】portant. Recent experiments show， once again， that minerals may have played a central role in this task.\n【save__datas】\t【1052】\tPreferential Treatment--connect--【1055】cules， amino acids come in two forms. Each version comprises the same types of atoms， but the two molecules are con-一structed as mirror images of each other. The phenomenon is called chirality， but for simplicity’s sake scientists refer to the two versions as“left-handed”(or“L”) and“right-handed”(or“D”). Organic synthesis experiments like Miller’s in-variably produce 50-50 mixtures of L and D molecules， but the excess of left-handed amino acids in living organisms is nearly 100 percent.\n【save__datas】\t【1056】\tResearchers have proposed a dozen theories-from the mundane to the exot-ic-to account for this bizarre occur-rence. Some astrophysicists have argued that the earth might have formed with an excess of L amino acids-a consequence of processes that took place in the cloud of dust and gas that became the solar sys-tem. The main problem with this theory--connect--【1057】feature of the physical environment se-lected one version over the other. To me. the most obvious candidates for this spe-cialized physical environment are crystal faces whose surface structures are mirror images of each other \\[see box on page80\\]. Last spring I narrowed in on calcite， the common mineral that forms lime-stone and marble， in part because it often displays magnificent pairs of mirror-im-age faces. The chemical structure of cal-cite in many mollusk shells bonds strong-ly to amino acids. Knowing this， I began to suspect that calcite surfaces may fea ture chemical bonding sites that are ide-ally suited to only one type of amino acid or the other. With the help of my Carne-gie colleague Timothy Filley (now at Pur-due University) and Glenn Goodfriend of George Washington University， I ran more than 100 tests of this hypothesis.\n【save__datas】\t【1058】\tOur experiments were simple in con-cept， although they required meticulous clean-room procedures to avoid contam-ination by the amino acids that exist everywhere in the environment. We im-mersed a well-formed， fist-size crystal of calcite into a 50-50 solution of aspartic acid， a common amino acid. After 24hours we removed the crystal from this solution， washed it in water and careful-ly collected all the molecules that had ad---connect--【1059】themselves to a mineral scaffold，various types of complex molecules could have been forged.

In one ex-periment after another we observed that calcite’s“left-handed\"faces selected L-amino acids， and vice versa， with excess-es approaching 40 percent in some cases.--connect--【1069】amino acids， others entirely of D. If pro-tein formation can indeed occur， this re-sult becomes even more exciting， because recent experiments by other investigators indicate that some proteins can self-repli-cate. In the earth’s early history，perhaps a self-replicating protein formed on the face of a calcite crystal.\n【save__datas】\t【1070】\tLeft- and right-handed crystal faces occur in roughly equal numbers， so chiral selection of L amino acids probably did not happen everywhere in the world at--connect--【1071】once. Our results and predictions instead suggest that the first successful set of self-replicating molecules-the precursor to all the varied life-forms on the earth today一arose at a specific time and place. It was purely chance that the successful molecule developed on a crystal face that preferen-tially selected left-handed amino acids over their right-handed counterparts.\n【save__datas】\t【1072】\tMinerals undoubtedly could have acted as containers， scaffolds and tem-plates that helped to select and organize the molecular menagerie of the primitive earth. But many of us in origins research suspect that minerals played much more--connect--【1073】active roles， catalyzing key synthesis steps that boosted the earth's early inventory of complex biological molecules.\n【save__datas】\t【1074】\tGetting a Jump on the Action\n【save__datas】\t【1076】\tThe idea that minerals may have trig-gered life's first crucial steps has emerged most forcefully from the landmark theo-ry of chemist Ginter Wachtershauser， German patent lawyer with a deepinterest in life’s origins. In 1988 Wachtershauser advanced a sweeping theory of organic evolution in which minerals-mostly iron and nickel sulfides that abound at deep-seahydrothermal vents-could have served as the template， the catalyst and the energy source that drove the forma tion of biological molecules. Indeed， he has argued that primitive living entities were molecular coatings that adhered to the positively charged surfaces of pyrite， a mineral composed of iron and sulfur These entities， he further suggests， ob-tained energy from the chemical reactions that produce pyrite. This hypothesis makes sense in part because some meta bolic enzymes-the molecules that help living cells process energy-have at their core a cluster of metal and sulfur atoms.\n【save__datas】\t【1077】\tFor much of the past three years， Wachtershauser’s provocative theory has influenced our experiments at Carnegie. Our team， including geochemist George Cody and petrologist Hatten S. Yoder， has focused on the possibility that me-tabolism can proceed without enzymes in the presence of mineralsespecially ox ides and sulfides. Our simple strategy，\n【save__datas】\t【1079】\tOrigins of Life：The Central Concepts. David W. Deamer and Gail R. Fleischaker. Jones and Bartlett，1994. Emergence： From Chaos to Order.John H.Holland.

In our case， we try to replicate the bone-crush-ing pressures and scalding temperatures typical of a deep-sea hydrothermal vent. Most of our experiments test the inter-actions among ingredients enclosed in welded gold capsules， which are roughly the size of a daily vitamin pill. We place as many as six capsules into Yoder’s“bomb\"-a massive steel pressure cham-ber that squeezes the tiny capsules to pressures approaching 2，000 atmospheres and heats them to about 250 degrees C.\n【save__datas】\t【1082】\tOne of our primary goals in these or-ganic-synthesis experiments-and one of life's fundamental chemical reactions-is--connect--【1083】ers have harnessed this reaction to man-ufacture molecules with virtually any de-sired number of carbon atoms. Our first organic-synthesis experiments in 1996， and much more extensive research by Thomas McCollom of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution， demonstrate that F-T reactions can build molecules with 30 or more carbon atoms under some hydrothermal-vent conditions in less than a day. If this process manufac---connect--【1085】tures large organic molecules from sim-ple inorganic chemicals throughout the earth's hydrothermal zones today， then it very likely did so in the planet’s prebio-logical past.\n【save__datas】\t【1086】\tWhen we conduct experiments using nickel or cobalt sulfides， we see that car-bon addition occurs primarily by car-bonylation-the insertion of a carbon and--connect--【1087】rich variety of complex organic molecules.\n【save__datas】\t【1088】\tOur 1，500 hydrothermal organic syn-thesis experiments at Carnegie have done more than supplement the catalogue of interesting molecules that must have been produced on the early earth. These efforts reveal another， more complex behavior of minerals that may have significant consequences for the chemistry of life Most previous origins-of-life studies have treated minerals as solid and unchang-ing-stable platforms where organic mol-ecules could assemble. But we are finding that in the presence of hot water at high pressure， minerals start to dissolve. In the process， the liberated atoms and mole-cules from the minerals can become cru-cial reactants in the primordial soup.\n【save__datas】\t【1089】\tThe Heart of the Matter--connect--【1092】carbon fixation， the process of producing molecules with an increasing number of carbon atoms in their chemical structure. Such reactions follow two different paths depending on the mineral we use. We find that many common minerals， including most oxides and sulfides of iron， copper and zinc， promote carbon addition by a routine industrial process known as Fis-cher-Tropsch (F-T) synthesis.\n【save__datas】\t【1093】\tThis process can build chainlike or-ganic molecules from carbon monoxide and hydrogen. First， carbon monoxide and hydrogen react to form methane， which has one carbon atom. Adding more carbon monoxide and hydrogen to the methane produces ethane， a two-car-bon molecule， and then the reaction re-peats itself， adding a carbon atom each time. In the chemical industry， research---connect--【1094】oxygen molecule， or carbonyl group. Car-bonyl groups readily attach themselves to nickel or cobalt atoms， but not so strong-ly that they cannot link to other molecules and jump ship to form larger molecules. In one series ofexperiments， we observed the lengthening of the nine-carbon molecule nonyl thiol to form 10-carbon decanoic acid， a compound similar to the acids that drive metabolic reactions in living cells. What is more， all the reactants in this experiment-a thiol， carbon monox-ide and water-are readily available near sulfide-rich hydrothermal vents. By re-peating these simple kinds of reactions adding a carbonyl group here or a hy-droxide group there-we can synthesize a\n【save__datas】\t【1096】\tquantities of elemental sulfur， organic sulfides， methyl thiol and other sulfur compounds appeared as well. The sulfur in all these products must have been lib-erated from the iron sulfide mineral.\n【save__datas】\t【1097】\tEven more striking was the liberation of iron， which brilliantly colored the wa-ter-based solutions inside the capsules. As the mineral dissolved， the iron formed bright red and orange organometallic complexes in which iron atoms are sur-rounded by various organic molecules. We are now investigating the extent to which these potentially reactive com-plexes might act as enzymes that promote the synthesis of molecular structures.\n【save__datas】\t【1098】\tThe role of minerals as essential chemical ingredients of life is not entire-ly unexpected. Hydrothermal fluids are well known to dissolve and concentrate mineral matter. At deep-sea vents， spec-tacular pillars of sulfide grow dozens of feet tall as plumes of hot， mineral-laden water rise from below the seafloor，con-tact the frigid water of the deep ocean and deposit new layers of minerals on the growing pillar. But the role of these dis-solved minerals has not yet figured sig-nificantly in origins scenarios. Whatever their behavior， dissolved minerals seem to make the story of life’s emergence much more interesting.\n【save__datas】\t【1100】\tWhen we look beyond the specifics of prebiological chemistry， it is clear that the origin of life was far too complex to imag ine as a single event. Rather we must work from the assumption that it was a gradual sequence of more modest events， each of which added a degree of order and complexity to the world of prebio logical molecules. The first step must have been the synthesis of the basic building blocks. Half a century of research reveals that the molecules of life were manufac tured in abundance-in the nebula that formed our solar system， at the ocean’s surface， and near hydrothermal vents. The ancient earth suffered an embarrassment of riches-a far greater diversity of mole-cules than life could possibly employ.\n【save__datas】\t【1101】\tMinerals helped to impose order on this chaos. First by confining and con-centrating molecules， then by selecting and arranging those molecules， minerals may have jump-started the first self-repli-cating molecular systems. Such a system would not have constituted life as we know it， but it could have， for the first time， displayed a key property of life. In this scenario， a self-replicating molecular t0system began to use up the resources of its environment. Asmutations led to slightly different variants， competition for limited resources initiated and drove the process of molecular natural selec tion. Self-replicating molecular systems began to evolve， inevitably becoming more efficient and more complex.\n【save__datas】\t【1108】\tThe flare， which reached its maximum intensity at 10：24 UT， was also sighted by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)， a spacecraft stationed between the sun and the earth， about 1.5 million--connect--【1111】kilometers from our planet. Half an hour later， as the flare was waning， SOHO observed an even more ominous phenomenon：a bright， expanding cloud that surrounded the sun like a halo. It was a coronal mass ejection (CME)， an eruption in the coro-na-the sun’s outer atmosphere-throwing billions of tons of electrically charged particles into interplanetary space. The halo signature meant that the particles were heading directly toward the earth， at an estimated speed of 1，700 kilometers per second.\n【save__datas】\t【1112】\tAs the CME plowed into the solar wind-the flow of ion-ized gas continuously streaming from the sun-it created a shock wave that accelerated some charged particles to even higher velocities. In less than an hour a deluge of high-energy protons struck SOHO， temporarily blinding its instruments. The bombardment also damaged the spacecraft’s solar arrays， causing a year’s worth of degradation in 24 hours. But this tor-rent of particles was only the leading edge of the squall. The CME-driven shock wave arrived the next day， slamming into the earth’s magnetic field at 14：37 UT. The impact marked the start of a severe geomagnetic storm， whose full fury was un-leashed by the arrival， a few hours later， of the CME itself. Ac-cording to the index of geomagnetic activity used by the Space Environment Center， the Bastille Day storm was the largest such event in nearly a decade.\n【save__datas】\t【1113】\tMost people on the ground were completely unaware of the celestial fireworks， but researchers were following the tempest\n【save__datas】\t【1117】\tSATELUTES.When particles strike a satellite， the craft's surface becomes charged.

By pro-viding an overall picture of the activity in the magnetosphere， IMAGE does for space what the first weather satellites did for the earth’s atmosphere.\n【save__datas】\t【1120】\tIn 1996 I had been selected by NASA to lead a team of en gineers and scientists in developing the IMAGE spacecraft and analyzing the data that it transmits. As the Bastille Day storm progressed， we received astounding images of ions circling the earth and pictures of the brilliant aurora borealis-the North ern Lights-that occurred when the charged particles struck the upper atmosphere. The results will help scientists answer long-standing questions about how CMEs and the solar wind inter-act with the earth’s magnetosphere. The findings may also have practical applications. Space storms can disable satellites， threaten the safety of astronauts and even knock out power grids on the ground \\[see box at left\\]. Indeed， the Bastille Day storm caused the loss of the Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics， an x-ray observatory launched in 1993 by the Japanese space research agency. In hopes of mitigating such effects in the future， scientists are keenly interested in improv-ing the accuracy of space weather forecasts.\n【save__datas】\t【1121】\tIt's Not the Heat or the Humiditu\n【save__datas】\t【1123】\tSpace weather， however， arises from physical processes that are profoundly different from those responsible for terrestrial weather. The medium for terrestrial weather is the dense， elec-trically neutral gas in the earth’s lower atmosphere， whose be havior is governed by the laws of fluid dynamics and thermo-dynamics. The medium for space weather， in contrast， is plasma-very sparse gases consisting of equal numbers of pos-itively charged ions and negatively charged electrons. Unlike the atoms and molecules of the atmosphere， these plasma par-ticles are subject to the influence of electric and magnetic fields， which guide and accelerate the particles as they travel through the space surrounding the earth.\n【save__datas】\t【1124】\tTerrestrial weather is driven by the sun’s radiation as it heats the earth's atmosphere， oceans and landmasses. But in the--connect--【1126】magnetosphere， weather results from the interaction between the earth's magnetic field and the solar wind. The solar wind has its own magnetic field， which travels with the outflowing plasma into interplanetary space. As the wind carries this in-terplanetary magnetic field (IMF) away from the sun， the field lines typically stretch out so that they are directed radially(pointing toward or away from the sun). Under certain condi-tions， however， the IMF’s field lines can tilt out of the equato-rial plane of the sun， taking on a northward or southward com-ponent. A strong and sustained southward IMF direction is a key factor in triggering geomagnetic storms. The IMF was ori-ented southward for many hours during the Bastille Day storm.\n【save__datas】\t【1127】\tProtons are the dominant constituents of the solar wind， ac-counting for about 80 percent of its total mass. Helium nuclei make up about 18 percent， and trace quantities of heavier ions are also present. The average density of the solar wind at the earth’s orbit is nine protons per cubic centimeter. The wind's average velocity is 470 kilometers per second， and the average strength of the IMF is six nanoteslas (about one five-thousandth the strength of the earth’s magnetic field at the planet’s surface). These properties， along with the orientation of the IMF， are--connect--【1128】highly variable， and it is this variability that ultimately explains the changing weather in space.\n【save__datas】\t【1129】\tAll the bodies in the solar system are immersed in the solar wind， which continues flowing outward until it encounters the ionized and neutral gases of interstellar space. The solar wind does not impinge directly on the earth and its atmosphere， how-ever. The earth is shielded by its magnetic field， which forms a kind of bubble within the stream of charged particles emanat-ing from the sun. The shape of this cavity-the magneto-sphere-is determined by the pressure of the solar wind and by the IMF \\[see illustration above\\]. The wind compresses the earth’s magnetic field on the dayside ofthe planet-the side fac-ing the sun-and stretches the field on the nightside to form a long tail resembling that of a comet. This magnetotail extends more than one million kilometers past the earth， well beyond the orbit of the moon.\n【save__datas】\t【1130】\tBetween the solar wind and the magnetosphere is a thin boundary called the magnetopause， where the pressure of the geomagnetic field balances that of the solar wind. On the earth’s dayside， this boundary is usually located about 64，000kilometers from the planet’s center， although the distance varies--connect--【1131】with changes in the solar-wind pressure. When the pressure in-creases， as occurred during the Bastille Day storm， the dayside magnetopause is pushed closer to the earth， sometimes by as much as 26，000 kilometers.\n【save__datas】\t【1132】\tJust as the passage of a supersonic jet through the atmo-sphere produces a shock wave， the encounter of the solar wind with the magnetosphere forms a shock wave-known as the bow shock—some 13，000 kilometers upstream (that is， closer to the sun) from the dayside magnetopause. The region of so-lar-wind plasma between the bow shock and the magnetopausei Dass：s known as the magnetosheath. Because of its passage through the shock， the magnetosheath plasma is slower， hotter and more turbulent than the plasma farther upstream.\n【save__datas】\t【1133】\tSatellite detectors have indicated that the charged particles--connect--【1134】surrounding the earth are a mix of plasma from the magne-tosheath (mostly protons) and plasma that flows out of the up-per atmosphere above the North and South poles (mostly pro-tons and oxygen ions). The proportions of this mix vary according to whether the magnetosphere is in a quiet or a dis-\n【save__datas】\t【1137】\tAt the heart of the study of space weather is a question：--connect--【1143】surface \\[opposite page， middle\\].\n【save__datas】\t【1153】\tHow do changes in the solar wind affect conditions in the space surrounding the earth? In other words， how can the wind over-come the barrier of the geomagnetic field and drive the motions of the plasma inside the magnetosphere?\n【save__datas】\t【1154】\tBlowing in the Solar Wind--connect--【1156】wind over water. Waves are in fact observed along the magne-topause. But they do not seem capable of driving the large-scale circulation of the magnetosphere or the great disturbances that often occur there. Such waves also would not allow the efficient entry of accelerated solar-wind plasma into the magnetosphere.\n【save__datas】\t【1157】\tFor these reasons， magnetopause waves are not considered the primary means by which the solar wind affects the magneto-sphere. An alternative mechanism called magnetic reconnec-tion-first proposed in 1961 by British physicist James W. Dungey-is generally thought to be a better explanation. In this process， the field lines of the IMF become temporarily inter-connected with the geomagnetic field lines on the dayside of the magnetopause \\[see illustration on page 89\\]. This tangling of the field lines allows large amounts of plasma and magnetic ener--connect--【1162】gy to be transferred from the solar wind to the magnetosphere. Reconnection is most efficient when the IMF has a compo-nent that is directed southward-that is， opposite to the north-ward direction of the earth’s magnetic field at the dayside of the magnetosphere. Under these circumstances， reconnection takes place along a wide equatorial belt， opening up nearly the entire outer boundary of the magnetosphere to the solar wind. For other orientations of the IMF， reconnection still happens， but it may be more localized in the higher latitudes， where the re-leased energy mainly flows around the magnetosphere rather than into it.\n【save__datas】\t【1163】\tThe transfer of magnetic energy from the solar wind radi-cally alters the shape of the magnetosphere. When reconnec-tion is initiated on the dayside magnetopause， the intercon-nected IMF and geomagnetic field lines are swept back by the solar wind over the earth’s poles， pouring energy into the north-ern and southern lobes of the long magnetotail on the nightside. As the lobes swell with the added magnetic energy， the plasma sheet that lies between them begins to thin. The process con-tinues until the field lines of the northern and southern lobes. which have opposite directions， are pressed together and them-selves reconnect.\n【save__datas】\t【1164】\tThis second reconnection releases the solar wind’s magnet-ic field， enabling it to continue its flow through the solar sys-tem. At the same time， it allows the earth’s magnetic field lines， which have been stretched tailward during the loading of the lobes， to snap back into their normal configuration. The abrupt movement of the field lines heats and accelerates the ions and electrons in the plasma sheet， injecting them into the inner part of the magnetosphere. Some of these particles， traveling along geomagnetic field lines， dive into the upper atmosphere above the earth's poles， stimulating auroral emissions at x-ray， ultra-violet， visible and radio wavelengths as they collide with oxy-gen atoms and nitrogen molecules. The entire sequence of events-from dayside reconnection to nightside reconnection to auroras-is known as a magnetospheric substorm.\n【save__datas】\t【1165】\tIn addition to transferring magnetic energy to the tail lobes， dayside reconnection also intensifies the electric field across the magnetotail. The stronger field， in turn， increases the flow ofions and electrons from the plasma sheet to the inner magnetosphere. This flow feeds into the earth’s ring current， which is carried by charged particles circling the planet above its equator at altitudes between 6，400 and 38，000 kilometers.During longer periods of dayside reconnection-which occur when the IMF’s orientation remains consistently southward-the sustained enhancement--connect--【1166】of the earthward plasma flow greatly increases the number and energies of the charged particles in the ring current. An extend-ed period of southward IMF can also lead to a rapid succession of substorms， each of which injects more particles toward the earth. The resulting growth in strength of the ring current is the classic hallmark of a full-fledged geomagnetic storm.\n【save__datas】\t【1168】\tUntil the early 1990s， it was widely believed that solar flares triggered geomagnetic storms. Space and solar physicists，how-ever， had been assembling evidence that pointed strongly to an-other culprit， and in 1993 John T. Gosling of Los Alamos Na-tional Laboratory wove the various threads of evidence together--connect--【1169】in an article in the Journal of Geophysical Research that chal---connect--【1170】lenged the “solar flare myth.\" Gosling set forth a compelling argument for the central role of coronal mass ejections in set-ting off large geomagnetic storms. Scientists still do not know what causes these violent eruptions in the sun’s corona， but the phenomenon most likely involves a reconfiguration of the mag-netic field lines there. CMEs are often， but not always， associ-ated with solar flares.\n【save__datas】\t【1171】\tNot all CMEs cause geomagnetic storms. Most of the erup tions are not directed at the earth， and of those that are， only about one in six is “geoeffective”-strong enough to trigger a storm. The primary factor is the CME’s speed relative to that of the solar wind. Only fast CMEs are geoeffective. Why? When fast CMEs plow through the slower solar wind， they pro-duce interplanetary shock waves， which are responsible for the high-energy particle showers and the severe deformations of the earth's magnetic field. Even more important， a fast-moving CME compresses the solar wind ahead of it， thereby increasing the strength of the magnetic field in the compressed region and in the front part of the CME itself. Moreover， this draping of the field around the CME tends to tilt the IMF more along the north-south direction， which causes a stronger reconnection when the IMF encounters the earth's magnetic field.\n【save__datas】\t【1172】\tA weaker kind of geomagnetic storm occurs during the de-clining phase of the solar cycle and near the solar minimum pe-riod. These disturbances， which tend to recur in phase with the sun's 27-day rotational period， are set off by the interaction be-tween fast solar winds emanating from holes in the corona and slower winds arising from the sun’s equatorial streamer belt. Although CMEs are not the primary cause of recurrent storms， they may contribute to their intensity.\n【save__datas】\t【1173】\tWith the launch of IMAGE last year， researchers finally had the means to obtain global views of the minute-by-minute progress of a large geomagnetic storm. The satellite travels in--connect--【1174】an elliptical polar orbit， with its altitude varying from 1，000to 46，000 kilometers. This orbit allows the craft to observe a large part of the magnetosphere， including the dayside magne-topause， the inner reaches of the magnetotail and the polar cusp regions， which are the main entryways for the particles from the solar wind.\n【save__datas】\t【1175】\tThe Perfect Space Storm\n【save__datas】\t【1177】\tThe satellite also carries several instruments that monitor emissions in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. The Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) imager measures the density of singly ionized--connect--【1178】helium atoms in the plasmasphere-a doughnut-shaped region of the inner magnetosphere containing low-energy plasma-by detecting the solar ultraviolet light that they absorb and then reradiate. The Far Ultraviolet (FUV) imaging system has twa instruments for viewing aurorasthe Wideband Imaging Cam era and the Spectrographic Imager-as well as the Geocorona Photometers for detecting emissions from neutral hydrogen atoms. Last， the Radio Plasma Imager sends out pulses of ra-dio waves that bounce off clouds of charged particles. It works like a state trooper’s radar gun： the returning radio signals con-vey information about the direction， speed and density of the plasma clouds.\n【save__datas】\t【1179】\tDuring the Bastille Day event， IMAGE began recording the storm's effects less than two minutes after the CME-driven shock wave hit the earth’s magnetic field on July 15. The Wide band Imaging Camera sent back stunning photographs of the aurora borealis triggered by the compression of the field \\[see--connect--【1180】bottom illustrations on pages 90 and 91\\]. A movie created from--connect--【1181】the images shows a sudden dramatic brightening of a ring above the Arctic region-the auroral oval-with brilliant emis-sions racing like brushfires toward the North Pole. The aurora quieted less than an hour after the storm began but flared up again when a second shock hit at about 17：00 UT. Powerful substorms followed， as energy stored in the magnetotail was--connect--【1183】explosively released into the upper atmosphere. Substorms and the attendant auroral displays continued through the rest of July 15 and into the morning of July 16.\n【save__datas】\t【1184】\tDuring the storm’s main phase， which began four hours af-ter its start， the magnetic field strength on the earth’s surface fell precipitously， dropping 300 nanoteslas below its normal value. This phenomenon， the defining feature of geomagnetic storms， resulted from the rapid growth of the ring current. IMAGE’s Energetic Neutral Atom imagers produced vivid pictures of this flow of ions and electrons around the earth as it reached its peak on July 16 and then began to diminish \\[see top illustrations on page 91\\]. Once the transfer of energy from the solar wind abates， the flow of plasma into the inner magnetosphere slows， and ions are lost from the ring current more rapidly than new ones arrive. As the current weakens， the magnetic field on the earth’s surface rebounds. The return to pre-storm levels usual-ly takes one to a few days but may require more than a month in the case of major tempests.\n【save__datas】\t【1185】\tGeomagnetic storms also change the shape of the plasma-sphere. The enhanced flow of plasma from the magnetotail to-ward the earth erodes the plasmasphere by sweeping its charged particles toward the dayside magnetopause. When a storm sub-sides， the plasmasphere is refilled by ion outflow from the up-per atmosphere. Scientists had hypothesized from modeling--connect--【1186】studies that the eroded material from the plasmasphere would form a long tail extending to the dayside magnetopause and that from there it would become lost in the solar wind. Global images of the plasmasphere from IMAGE’s EUV instrument have now confirmed this 30-year-old hypothesis \\[see illustra-tion at left\\]. At the same time， the images have revealed struc-tures in the plasmasphere that raise new questions about its dy namic response to magnetospheric disturbances.\n【save__datas】\t【1187】\tOn the Horizon\n【save__datas】\t【1189】\tThe next step for space weather observation will involve clusters of satellites acting like hurricane-hunter planes-they will go where the action is. The European Space Agency is con-ducting the first such mission， called Cluster II， which was launched in the summer of 2000. (A predecessor mission， Clus-ter I， was destroyed in a rocket explosion just after liftoff in1996.) Cluster II consists of four closely grouped identical space-craft designed to probe turbulent plasma phenomena in the magnetosphere and nearby solar wind. NASA is also planning a cluster mission for launch in 2006. The Magnetospheric Mul-tiscale mission will study reconnection， charged particle accel-eration， and turbulence at the dayside magnetopause and at spe-cific locations in the magnetotail where substorms are triggered.\n【save__datas】\t【1190】\tThe space agencies are considering even more ambitious missions involving constellations of satellites： dozens of tiny spacecraft that will monitor large regions of space， just as the global weather networks now monitor conditions on the earth The first constellations will most likely observe the inner mag netosphere and the dayside magnetopause， with each cake-size craft recording the basic characteristics of the plasmas and mag netic fields.\n【save__datas】\t【1193】\tFrom the Sun：Auroras， Magnetic Storms， Solar Flares， Cosmic Rays.\n【[http:]_filter】\t【1196】\tMore pictures and data from the IMAGE mission are available at http：//pluto.space.swri.edu/lMAGE/ and http：//image.gsfc.nasa.gov/General information on space weather can be found at www.spaceweather.com/\n【save__datas】\t【1199】\tDo people turn violent because of self-hate， orself-love?--connect--【1200】by royyff.baumeister photographs by tina west\n【save__datas】\t【1201】\tSeveral years ago a youth counselor told me about the dilemma he faced when dealing with violent young men. His direct impressions simply didn’t match what he had been taught. He saw his violent clients as egotists with a grandiose sense of personal superiority and entitlement， but his textbooks told him that these young toughs actually suffered from low self-esteem. He and his staff decided they couldn’t go against decades of research， regardless of what they had observed， and so they tried their best to boost the young men’s opinions of themselves， even though this produced no discernible reduction in their antisocial tendencies.\n【save__datas】\t【1202】\tThe view that aggression stems from low self-esteem has long been common knowledge. Counselors， social workers and teachers all over the country have been persuaded that im-proving the self-esteem of young people is the key to curbing violent behavior and to encouraging social and academic suc-cess. Many schools have students make lists of reasons why they are wonderful people or sing songs of self-celebration. Many parents and teachers are afraid to criticize kids， lest it cause serious psychological damage and turn some promising youngster into a dangerous thug or pathetic loser. In some sports leagues， everyone gets a trophy.\n【save__datas】\t【1203】\tA number of people have questioned whether these feel-good exercises are really the best way to build self-esteem. But what about the underlying assumption? When my colleagues and I began looking into the matter in the early 1990s， we found article after article citing the “well-known fact” that low self-esteem causes violence. Yet we were unable to find any book or paper that offered a formal statement of that theory，--connect--【1204】let alone empirical evidence to support it. Everybody knew it， but nobody had ever proved it.\n【save__datas】\t【1205】\tUnfortunately for the low self-esteem theory，re-searchers have gradually built up a composite im-age of what it is like to have low self-esteem， and that image does not mesh well with what we know about aggressive perpetrators. People who have a negative view of themselves are typically muddling through life， trying to avoid embar-rassment， giving no sign of a desperate need to prove their superiority. Aggressive attack is risky； people with low self-esteem tend to avoid risks. When people with low self-esteem fail， they usually blame themselves， not others.\n【save__datas】\t【1206】\tFaced with these incongruities， we cast about for an alternative theory. A crucial influence on our think-ing was the seemingly lofty self-regard of prominent violent people. Saddam Hussein is not known as a mod-est， cautious， self-doubting individual. Adolf Hitler’s ex-altation of the“master race” was hardly a slogan of low self-esteem. These examples suggest that self-esteem is indeed an important cause of aggression-high， that is， not low self-esteem.\n【save__datas】\t【1207】\tWe eventually formulated our hypothesis in terms of threat ened egotism. Not all people who think highly of themselves are prone to violence. That favorable opinion must be combined with some external threat to the opinion. Somebody must ques-tion it， dispute it， undermine it. People like to think well of them-selves， and so they are loath to make downward revisions in their self-esteem. When someone suggests such a revision， many individuals-those with inflated， tenuous and unstable forms of high self-esteem-prefer to shoot the messenger.\n【save__datas】\t【1208】\tPride Comes before a Fall\n【save__datas】\t【1210】\tSo how does a social psychologist establish whether low or high self-esteem leads to violence? Because there is no perfect， general method for understanding complex questions about hu-man beings， social scientists typically operate by conducting multiple studies with different methods. A single study can be challenged， especially if competing views exist. But when a con-sistent pattern emerges， the conclusions become hard to ignore.\n【save__datas】\t【1211】\tResearchers measure self-esteem by asking a standardized series of questions， such as “How well do you get along with other people?\"and“Are you generally successful in your work or studies?\" The individual chooses from a range of responses，--connect--【1212】and the overall score falls somewhere on the continuum from negative to positive. Strictly speaking， it is misleading to talk of“people high in self-esteem” as if they were a distinct type， but the need for efficient communication pushes researchers into us-ing such terms. By“people high in self-esteem，” I refer broadly to those who scored above the median on the self-esteem scale. Statistical analyses respect the full continuum.\n【save__datas】\t【1213】\tMany laypeople have the impression that self-esteem fluc-tuates widely， but in fact these scores are quite stable. Day-to-day changes tend to be small， and even after a serious blow or boost， a person’s self-esteem score returns to its previous level within a relatively short time. Large changes most often occur after major life transitions， such as when a high school athlete moves on to college to find the competition much tougher.\n【save__datas】\t【1214】\tQuantifying aggression is trickier， but one approach is sim-ply to ask people whether they are prone to angry outbursts and conflicts. These self-reported hostile tendencies can then be compared to the self-esteem scores.Most research has found a weak or negligible correlation， although an important excep-tion is the work done in the late 1980s by Michael H. Kernis of the University of Georgia and his colleagues. They distinguished between stable and unstable self-esteem by measuring each per---connect--【1215】gories of violent people. Street-gang members have been reported to hold favorable opinions of themselves and to turn violent when these views are disputed. Playground bullies regard themselves as superior to other children； low self-esteem is found among the victims of bullies but not among bullies themselves. Violent groups generally have overt belief systems that emphasize their superior ity over others. War is most common among proud nations that feel they are not getting the respect they deserve， as Daniel Chi-rot discusses in his fascinating book Modern Tyrants.\n【save__datas】\t【1216】\tDrunk people are another such category. It is well known that alcohol plays a role in either a majority or a very large mi-nority of violent crimes； booze makes people respond to provo-cations more vehemently. Far less research has examined the\n【save__datas】\t【1217】\tViolent criminals describe themselves as special， elite persons who deserve preferentialtreatment.--connect--【1218】son’s self-esteem on several occasions and looking for fluctua-tions. The greatest hostility was reported by people with high but unstable self-esteem. Individuals with high， stable self-es-teem were the least hostile， and those with low self-esteem (ei-ther stable or unstable) were in between.\n【save__datas】\t【1219】\tTake aaSwig， Take a Swing\n【save__datas】\t【1221】\tEvidence about the self-images of specific murderers， rapists and other criminals tends to be more anecdotal than systemat-ic， but the pattern is clear. Violent criminals often describe themselves as superior to others-as special， elite persons who deserve preferential treatment. Many murders and assaults are committed in response to blows to self-esteem such as insults，“dissing”and humiliation. (To be sure， some perpetrators live in settings where insults threaten more than their opinions of themselves. Esteem and respect are linked to status in the social hierarchy， and to put someone down can have tangible and even life-threatening consequences.)\n【save__datas】\t【1222】\tThe same conclusion has emerged from studies of other cate---connect--【1223】link with self-esteem， but the findings do fit the egotism pattern：consuming alcohol tends to boost people’s favorable opinions of themselves. Of course， alcohol has myriad effects， such as impairing self-control， and it is hard to know which is the biggest factor in drunken rampages.\n【save__datas】\t【1224】\tAggression toward the self exists， too. A form of threatened egotism seems to be a factor in many suicides. The rich， suc-cessful person who commits suicide when faced with bank-ruptcy， disgrace or scandal is an example. The old， glamorous self-concept is no longer tenable， and the person cannot accept the new， less appealing identity.\n【save__datas】\t【1225】\tVanity Unfair\n【save__datas】\t【1227】\tThe first challenge was to obtain reliable data on the self-concepts of participants. We used two different measures of self-esteem， so that if we failed to find anything， we could have some confidence that the null result was not simply an artifact--connect--【1228】of having a peculiar scale. Yet we were also skeptical of study-ing self-esteem alone. The hypothesis of threatened egotism sug-gested that aggressive behavior would tend to occur among on-ly a subset of people with high self-esteem. In the hope of identifying this subset， we tested for narcissism.\n【save__datas】\t【1229】\tAs defined by clinical psychologists， narcissism is a mental illness characterized by inflated or grandiose views of self， the\n【save__datas】\t【1230】\t...........1...--connect--【1231】quest for excessive admiration， an unreasonable or exaggerat-ed sense of entitlement， a lack of empathy (that is， being unable to identify with the feelings of others)， an exploitative attitude toward others， a proneness to envy or wish to be envied， fre-quent fantasies of greatness， and arrogance. The construct has been extended beyond the realm of mental illness by Robert Raskin of the Tulsa Institute of Behavioral Sciences in Okla homa and several of his colleagues， who have constructed a scale for measuring narcissistic tendencies.\n【save__datas】\t【1232】\tWe included that measure alongside the self-esteem scales， be-cause the two traits are not the same， although they are correlat-ed. Individuals with high self-esteem need not be narcissistic. They can be good at things and recognize that fact without being con-ceited or regarding themselves as superior beings. The converse-high narcissism but low self-esteem-is quite rare， however.\n【save__datas】\t【1234】\tThe noise was presented as part of a competition. Each par-\n【save__datas】\t【1236】\tIn reality， the essays that people graded were fakes. We took Ly，LIe the real essays aside and randomly marked them good or bad. The good evaluation included very positive ratings on all counts and the handwritten comment， “No suggestions， great essay!\"The bad evaluation contained low marks and the additional comment，“This is one of the worst essays I have read!\" After handing back the essays and evaluations， we gave out instruc-tions for the reaction-time test and the subjects began to com-pete. The measure of aggression was the level of noise with which they blasted each other.\n【save__datas】\t【1237】\tThe results supported the threatened-egotism theory rather than the low self-esteem theory. Aggression was highest among narcissists who had received the insulting criticism. Nonnar-cissists (with either high or low self-esteem) were significantly less aggressive， as were narcissists who had been praised.\n【save__datas】\t【1238】\tIn a second study， we replicated these findings and added a new twist. Some participants were told that they would be play-ing the reaction-time game against a new person-someone dif ferent from the person who had praised or insulted them. We were curious about displaced aggression： Would people an-gered by their evaluation lash out at just anybody? As it hap pened， no. Narcissists blasted people who had insulted them but did not attack an innocent third party. This result agrees with a large body of evidence that violence against innocent by-standers is， despite conventional wisdom， quite rare.\n【save__datas】\t【1239】\tA revealing incident illuminates the attitudes of the narcissists. When a television news program did a feature on this experiment， we administered the test to several additional participants forthe benefit ofthe cameras. One ofthem scored in the 98th percentile--connect--【1240】ticipant vied with somebody else in a test of reaction time. Who-ever responded more slowly received a blast of noise， with the volume and duration of the noise set by his or her opponent. This procedure differed from that of earlier studies， in which the sub-ject played the role of a “teacher” who administered noise or shock to a “learner”whenever the learner made a mistake. Crit-ics had suggested that such a method would yield ambiguous re-sults， because a teacher might deliver strong shocks or loud noise out of a sincere belief that it was an effective way to teach.\n【save__datas】\t【1241】\t“One of the Worst”--connect--【1243】on narcissism and was quite aggressive during the study. After-ward he was shown the film and given the opportunity to refuse to let it be aired. He said to put it on-he thought he looked great. Bushman then took him aside and explained that he might not want to be seen by a national audience as a highly aggressive nar-cissist. After all， the footage showed him using severe profanity when receiving his evaluation， then laughing while administer-ing the highest permitted levels of aggression. The man shrugged this off with a smile and said he wanted to be on television. When Bushman proposed that the television station at least digitize his face to disguise his identity， the man responded with an in-credulous no. In fact， he said， he wished the program could in-clude his name and phone number.\n【save__datas】\t【1244】\tWould our laboratory findings correspond to the outside world?

Mightn’t they really have low self-esteem on the inside， even if they won’t admit it?\" This argument has a logical flaw， however. We know from ample research that people with overt low self-esteem are not aggressive. Why should low self-esteem cause aggression only when it is hidden and not when it is overt? The only difference between hidden and overt low self-esteem is the fact of its being hidden， and if that is the crucial difference， then the cause of violence is not the low self-esteem itself but the concealment of it. And what is concealing it is the veneer of egotism-which brings us back to the threatened egotism theory.\n【save__datas】\t【1248】\tVarious researchers have tried and failed to find any sign of a soft inner core among violent people. Martin Sanchez-Jankowski， who spent 10 years living with various gangs and wrote one of the most thorough studies of youth gang life， had this to say： “There have been some studies of gangs that sug-gest that many gang members have tough exteriors but are in-secure on the inside. This is a mistaken observation.” Dan Ol-weus of the University of Bergen in Norway has devoted his career to studying childhood bullies， and he agrees：“In contrast to a fairly common assumption among psychologists and psy-chiatrists， we have found no indicators that the aggressive bul-lies (boys) are anxious and insecure under a tough surface.”\n【save__datas】\t【1249】\tThe case should not be overstated.

Narcissists are no more ag gressive than anyone else， as long as no one insults or criticizes them. But when they receive an insult-which could be a seem-ingly minor remark or act that would not bother other people-the response tends to be much more aggressive than normal. Thus， the formula of threatened egotism combines something about the person with something about the situation. What-ever the details of cause and effect， this appears to be the most accurate formula for predicting violence and aggression.\n【save__datas】\t【1262】\tThese patterns raise misgivings about how schools and oth-er groups seek to boost self-esteem with feel-good exercises. A fa-vorable opinion of self can put a person on a hair trigger， espe cially when this favorable opinion is unwarranted. In my view， there is nothing wrong with helping students and others to take pride in accomplishments and good deeds. But there is plenty of reason to worry about encouraging people to think highly of themselves when they haven’t earned it. Praise should be tied to performance (including improvement) rather than dispensed freely as if everyone had a right to it simply for being oneself.\n【save__datas】\t【1266】\tAt Your Fingertips\n【save__datas】\t【1267】\tWe use touch screens everywhere： tourist kiosks， au tomatic teller machines， point-of-sale terminals， in-dustrial controls. Half a dozen vendors，plus in-house departments at major manufacturers， produced $800million worth in 2000. The market is growing because the interfaces are easy-to-use， durable and inexpensive.\n【save__datas】\t【1268】\tTouch screens employ one of three physics princi-ples for detecting the point of touch. Pressing a “resis-tive” design with a finger or other stylus raises a volt-age. In“capacitive” models， a finger draws a minute current (this method is often used for cursor pads on notebook computers). In other designs， a finger or sty-lus interrupts a standing pattern of acoustic waves or infrared lights that blanket the surface.\n【save__datas】\t【1269】\tResistive screens are the oldest， most widely used and least expensive， and they work with any stylus(finger， pen). Capacitive screens must be touched by a finger or an electrically grounded stylus to conduct LLLIL current. Wave screens are the newest and most expen-sive. Surface acoustic wave screens must be touched by a finger or a soft stylus such as a pencil eraser to ab-sorb energy； infrared screens work with any stylus. The different technologies may be used in the same applications， although pros and cons lead to prevalent combinations： resistive screens for industrial controls and Palm Pilots； capacitive screens for slot machines； wave screens for ATMs and indoor kiosks.\n【save__datas】\t【1271】\tMost people are unaware of the type of screen they are using. But tricks can help you tell， according to Frank Shen of Elo TouchSystems in Fremont， Calif.， the largest U.S. maker. Push the screen lightly with your fingernail (not your skin). If it responds， it could be resistive or infrared. In this case， place two separat-ed fingers against the screen at the same time. Ifthe cur-sor moves beneath one finger， the unit is infrared (soft-ware registers the first touch)； if the cursor moves between the fingers， it is resistive (the points are aver-aged). If the unit does not respond to your fingernail， again place two separated fingers against it.

But as primatologist Frans de Waal ex---connect--【1296】plains in The Ape and the Sushi Master，\n【save__datas】\t【1297】\tscience， like all human endeavors， is warped by cultural ideology. Nowhere is this more in evidence than in the field of animal behavior and particularly in dis-cussions of whether animals have cul-ture.“We cannot discuss animal culture without seriously reflecting on our own culture and the possible blind spots it cre-ates，” de Waal writes.\n【save__datas】\t【1298】\tHe approaches this conundrum by taking us with him on a journey around the world， to watch primates and to talk with other scientists， engaging the reader in a conversation about where our bias-es come from and how they have influ-enced the history of animal behavior.\n【save__datas】\t【1299】\tDe Waal is the director of the Living Links Center for the study of ape and hu-man behavior at Emory University； he has written extensively about his findings in both scientific journals and the popu-lar press. But unlike his previous popular books on chimpanzee politics and recon-ciliation in primates， this time de Waal is not so much presenting a theory and pro-viding data as stepping back from the en-tire field of animal behavior to take a broader look.\n【save__datas】\t【1302】\tThe Ape and the Sushi Master is a--connect--【1303】philosopher’s tale-and one that could have a major impact on the future study of animal behavior. It questions the very way behaviorists go about their work and in the process undermines some com-fortably held theories. In the West， for ex-ample， behaviorists embrace the idea that individuals act exclusively in self-serving ways in order to pass on their genes. But de Waal， a Dutch-born zoologist who has lived in the U.S. for two decades and has traveled extensively， has enough cultural distance to see that this view is intimate-ly connected to the Western， especially American， ideology of individualism. Natural selection， he points out， can also produce cooperative behaviors， acts of kindness， and gentle creatures. And de Waal has the experience-27years of observing apes in captiv-ity-to question the accepted notion that only humans learn. The book’s title refers to the way sushi-making skills are passed down from master to apprentice： like the apprentice， young apes also watch their elders and imitate their behavior.\n【save__datas】\t【1304】\tDe Waal begins by laying out the reasons that we Westerners have such an uncomfortable relationship with animals， especially primates. By historical and religious tradition， Europeans and Americans embrace the idea that humans are different from-better than-all other ani-mals， establishing a dualism between\n【save__datas】\t【1305】\tHAND-CLASP grooming posture spread--connect--【1306】slowly through a chimpanzee community.--connect--【1307】us and them.“Whenever their abilities are said to approach ours， the reaction is often furious，” de Waal points out.\n【save__datas】\t【1308】\tThis kind of dualism also means that Western scientists fear anthropomor-phism and revere a disconnection from their subjects； we assume one must main-tain separation to gather valid data. But de Waal feels that similarities， especially those among closely related species such as apes and humans， are profound and useful. Therefore， he finds that anthro-pomorphism is “not only inevitable， it is a powerful tool.”\n【save__datas】\t【1309】\tEastern cultures fare better in their ob-servations of animals because they don’t buy the Western dualism of humans ver-sus animals.“It can hardly be coinciden---connect--【1310】tal，\" de Waal reasons， “that the push for cultural studies on animals initially came... from primatologists untrained in the sharp dualisms of the West.\" Long ago the Japanese， for example， were not afraid of topics that Western scientists are just now taking seriously： “Thus， the Japanese did not hesitate to give each an-imal a name or to assume that each had a different identity and personality. Nei-ther did they feel a need to avoid topics such as animal mental life and culture.?\n【save__datas】\t【1311】\tThe issue of culture， in particular， as de Waal explains， has had a much more rocky history in the West. For decades， anthropologists and others have come up with various traits that separate humans from chimpanzees in an effort to define what is uniquely human. But chimpanzees keep nudging into our territory： tool use， complex social relationships， empathy vmnai and sympathy， sophisticated communi-cation-they seem to have bits of it all. And now it seems they have culture， the last bastion of separation.\n【save__datas】\t【1312】\tIn a recent analysis of seven long-term chimpanzee sites， researchers were able to identify 39 behaviors that were learned from others. If culture can be definedas behavior that is socially transmitted， chimpanzees， and other animals， are cul-tural beings， de Waal argues.“What is the least common denominator of all things called cultural?\" he asks.“In my view， this can only be the nongenetic spreading of habits and information. The rest is nothing else than embellishment.” Cul-tural anthropologists might not like it， but the chimps are playing on our side now.\n【save__datas】\t【1313】\tDe Waal ends with a section on how we see ourselves. And we emerge as an unpleasantly self-important species. We pretend that a struggle for social power， which is a common behavior pattern among other primates， is“self-esteem”and therefore that it is found only in hu-mans. We assume that humans are the only ones whose behavior is influenced by learning and experience and that we are the only ones who are altruistic， car-ing beings-such kindness exhibited by--connect--【1315】by Lowrence M.

It was about the size of a shoe box， with a short antenna hanging from it like a loose shoestring. The streets of midtown Manhattan are full of strange things， but for some reason this one caught my eye. I soon learned that the gray box is one of 3，000 transceivers that Metricom， a company based in San Jose， Calif.， had recently installed on street-lights and utility poles across New York City. The transceivers， which relay low-power radio waves above the heads ofun-suspecting pedestrians， are part of a high-speed wireless network called Ricochet.\n【save__datas】\t【1339】\tWireless networks allow users to con-nect to the Internet while they're away from the office or home—in a coffee shop， say， or barreling down the street in a taxi. Unfortunately， most of the wire-less gadgets now being sold have serious drawbacks. Have you ever tried typing a Web address on the keypad of a cellular phone? Your fingers cramp from repeat-edly pushing the buttons， and your eyes get rheumy from staring at the tiny screen. Web-connected handheld computers such as the Palm VII have bigger screens and better interfaces， but their transmis-sion rates are glacial compared with those of desktop computers.\n【save__datas】\t【1340】\tThe Ricochet network raises the wireless speed limit with the help of a technology known as frequency hopping. The network divides each digital signal into packets of data and transmits them at many different radio frequencies in-stead of a single channel. When you con-nect to the Internet using a Ricochet mo---connect--【1341】dem， the device sends a barrage of data packets to the nearest transceiver， which then directs the packets to another trans-ceiver connected to a high-speed landline. The first Ricochet networks， launched in1995， delivered data to users at 28.8 kilo-bits per second (kbps). The newest net-works-operating in New York City， the\n【[www.com]_filter】\t【1342】\tVelcro strips on the device allow you to attach it to the back of your laptop’s screen. You can buy the modem for as lit-tle as $99， but the wireless service costs about $75 a month. Is it worth the mon-ey? To find out， I decided to try the device myself. The first step was to go to Rico-chet’s Web site (www.metricom.com/\n【save__datas】\t【1343】\tSan Francisco Bay Area and about a dozen other U.S. cities-promise a trans-mission rate of 128 kbps， or more than twice the rate of atypical desktop modem(56 kbps)， at least 80 percent of the time.

The site also lists the au-thorized service providers (although Met-ricom built the networks， other compa nies sell the modems and service). I chose Wireless WebConnect!， a company based--connect--【1346】in Clearwater， Fla.， which lent me a Ric-ochet modem for a month.\n【save__datas】\t【1347】\tBefore going any further， I must con-fess that I'm a schlemiel when it comes to technology. Nothing ever works for me， at least not on the first try. So I wasn’t too surprised when I had difficulty connect-ing the modem to my laptop. This com-puter (which actually belongs to Scientif-ic American， not me) is a Macintosh PowerBook G3—not a state-of-the-art machine， perhaps， but not an antique ei-ther. The problem was that the laptop’s operating system was OS 8-point-some-thing， whereas the Ricochet modem re-quires OS 9.0 (and to get optimal perfor-mance with Windows machines， you’ll need Windows 98， version 2， or better). I had to ask Vincent Salzillo， our maga-zine’s invaluable Macintosh expert， to upgrade the operating system.\n【save__datas】\t【1348】\tBut my troubles were only beginning. The Ricochet modem can connect to lap-tops through either a serial port (the tra-ditional interface for an external modem) or a Universal Serial Bus (a newer， faster type of interface). My PowerBook had only a serial port， and the serial cable in-cluded with the Ricochet modem didn't fit it. Although the technical support peo-ple at Wireless WebConnect! assured me that I could find an adapter at a comput-er store， I had no luck at the first few places I tried. I finally jury-rigged a con-nection using two different cables and an adapter between them. Turning on the modem， I muttered under my breath，“If this works， I am Houdini.”\n【save__datas】\t【1349】\tIt didn’t work， of course. But after a few more calls to the technical support folks (I needed a newer version of the in-stallation software)， the modem beeped to life， and my Internet Explorer home page appeared on the laptop’s screen.

This twisting is called torque and is equal to the object’s weight multiplied by its distance from the fulcrum (the angle of the lever also comes in， but that does not concern us here). If the object is to the left of the fulcrum， the direction of the torque is counterclockwise； if the object is to the right， the direction is clockwise. To compute the torque around a support， simply sum all the torques of the individual objects on the lever.\n【save__datas】\t【1380】\tThe challenge is to keep the lever balanced while adjusting the objects on it.

Paul， freelance scientist， artist， and editor of the\n【save__datas】\t【1404】\tScientific American BookofDinosaurs， offers this explanation：\n【save__datas】\t【1405】\tGigantism has been a common feature of land animals since the beginning of the Jurassic period， more than 200 million years ago. The first true giants of the land were small-head-ed， long-necked， sauropod dinosaurs. Toward the end of the Jurassic many sauropods reached 10 to 20 metric tons， some weighed as much as 50 metric tons， and a few may have ex-ceeded 100 metric tons and 150 feet in length， rivaling the largest modern whales.\n【save__datas】\t【1406】\tWhy do animals become gigantic? Some reasons are sim-ple. The bigger an animal is， the safer it is from predators and the better it is able to kill prey. Antelope are easy prey for li-ons， hyenas and hunting dogs， but adult elephants and rhinos are nearly immune-and their young benefit from the protec-tion of their huge parents. For herbivores， being gigantic means being taller and therefore able to access higher foliage. Giraffes and elephants can reach over 18 feet high， and ele-phants can use their great bulk to push over even taller trees.\n【save__datas】\t【1407】\tOther reasons for being gargantuan， though important， are less obvious. The cost of locomotion decreases with in-creasing size； thus， it is much cheaper for a five-metric-ton elephant to walk a mile than it is for a five-metric-ton herd of gazelle to move the same distance. Metabolic rate also de--connect--【1408】creases with increasing size. A shrew must therefore franti-cally eat more than its own weight each day. The elephant， on the other hand， needs to take in only 5 percent of its own weight. Also， as size increases， great bulk acts as a form of--connect--【1409】mass insulation， and so large--connect--【1410】animals are less affected by temperature extremes.\n【save__datas】\t【1411】\tBut there are disadvantages to being big.
