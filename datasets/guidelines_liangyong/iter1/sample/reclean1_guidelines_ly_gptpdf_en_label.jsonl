Locoregional staging with preoperative EUS provides the most accuracy for cT staging and is the only method capable of delineating the layers of the esophageal wall. In a meta-analysis of 49 studies, EUS provided good sensitivity and specificity for accurately cT staging advanced-stage disease. However, EUS has shown poor accuracy for distinguishing between early-stage tumors limited to the mucosa (cT1a) from those extending into the submucosa (cT1b). Therefore, endoscopic resection (ER), which is essential for the accurate staging of early-stage cancers, should be performed for early-stage tumors (cT1a and cT1b ≤2 cm) as it provides more accurate information on the depth of tumor invasion than EUS. Ultimately, a cancer that is completely removed by ER should be assigned pathologic staging.\n\n【2】CT of the chest and abdomen with oral and IV contrast or FDG-PET/CT from skull base to mid-thigh can be used to determine the location of the primary tumor and its proximity to other structures. Although FDG-PET/CT has higher sensitivity for detecting esophageal cancer than CT alone, it has a limited role in cT staging other than for determining invasion of the mediastinum. The diagnostic benefit of FDG-PET/CT is particularly limited in early-stage (cT1) tumors because of the low prevalence of distant metastases and the high rate of false-positive FDG-PET/CT findings. FDG-PET/CT also has limited ability to differentiate between cT1, cT2, and cT3 tumors. Although the intensity of FDG uptake and cT category are positively related, this association is weak. Therefore, chest/abdominal CT scan should be performed with oral and IV contrast in all patients as part of the initial workup (as well as pelvic CT scan with contrast if clinically indicated) while FDG-PET/CT should be reserved for patients with no evidence of M1 disease.\n\n【3】While CT and FDG-PET/CT may be used to describe the locoregional lymph nodes (cN), these techniques are suboptimal for detecting locoregional nodal metastasis because of their low sensitivity. CT has a pooled sensitivity of 30% to 60% for detecting enlarged nodes greater than 1 cm. FDG-PET/CT also has a low pooled sensitivity (~51%) in locoregional nodal assessment since these nodes are often obscured by the metabolic activity in the primary tumor. In contrast, EUS has high sensitivity (~85%) for assessing the degree of nodal involvement. Furthermore, the addition of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) to EUS (EUS-FNA) has shown greater sensitivity and accuracy than either EUS alone or CT scan in the evaluation of cN staging, especially in assessing locoregional and celiac lymph nodes. In a study that compared the performance characteristics of EUS and EUS-FNA for preoperative cN staging in 74 patients with esophageal cancer, EUS-FNA was more sensitive (93% vs. 63%; $P = .01$) and accurate (93% vs. 70%; $P = .02$) when compared to EUS alone. In another study that compared the performance characteristics of CT, EUS, and EUS-FNA for preoperative cN staging in 125 patients with esophageal cancer, EUS-FNA was more sensitive than CT (83% vs. 29%; $P < .001$) and more accurate than CT (87% vs. 51%; $P < .001$) or EUS alone (87% vs. 74%; $P = .012$). Additionally, a retrospective review of 148 patients with esophageal cancer who underwent nodal staging with EUS-FNA and FDG-PET found that the addition of FDG-PET did not alter nodal staging in any patient with complete EUS-FNA, suggesting a limited role for FDG-PET alone in detecting locoregional metastatic nodes.\n\n【4】While contrast-enhanced CT is the most widely used modality for detecting distant metastases in esophageal cancer, FDG-PET/CT is more sensitive than CT alone for staging cM disease. The addition of FDG-PET improves the detection of distant metastases that may remain occult on CT scan of the chest and abdomen, thereby allowing proper patient selection for surgical resection. In a prospective multicenter trial of 129 patients with esophageal cancer without definite distant metastases, PET identified metastatic sites in", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 88, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/（2023.V2）NCCN临床实践指南：食管和食管胃交界部癌.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

FDG PET/CT may also be helpful in identifying unsuspected regional nodal disease and/or distant metastases when used in addition to standard staging studies. The routine use of FDG PET/CT scanning is not recommended in the staging of clinical stage I, II, or operable III (T3,N1) breast cancer, due to its high false-negative rate for the detection of lesions that are small (<1 cm) and/or low-grade disease, the high rate of false-positive scans in patients without locally advanced disease, the low sensitivity for detection of axillary nodal metastases, and the low probability of these patients having detectable metastatic disease.\n\n【3】## Locoregional Treatment of cT1–3, cN0 or cN+, M0 Disease\n\n【4】### Surgery\n\n【5】Patients with early-stage operable breast cancer initially undergo upfront definitive surgery (BCS or mastectomy), and adjuvant systemic therapy, if indicated, based on primary tumor characteristics, such as tumor size, grade, lymph node involvement, ER/PR status, expression of HER2 receptor, and tumor genomics. Some patients with early-stage operable HER2-positive or triple-negative disease may be treated with preoperative systemic therapy first, followed by surgery删除1:<u>. For NCCN Panel recommendations and consideration for preoperative systemic therapy, refer to [www.NCCN.org]. Radiation is typically sequenced after definitive surgery and after systemic chemotherapy (if delivered).</u>\n\n【6】Several randomized trials document that mastectomy is equivalent to BCT, which includes BCS with WBRT with respect to OS as primary treatment for the majority of patients with stage I and stage II breast cancers (category 1). The optimal choice of surgery is based on a shared decision made by the patient and clinician after discussing benefits and risks of mastectomy versus BCT in regards to long-term survival, risk of local recurrence, and the impact on cosmetic outcome and overall QOL.\n\n【7】### Breast Conserving Surgery\n\n【8】BCS allows patients to preserve their breast without sacrificing oncologic outcome. BCS is contraindicated for patients who are pregnant and would require radiation during pregnancy; have diffuse suspicious or malignant-appearing microcalcifications on mammography; have widespread disease that cannot be incorporated by local excision of a single region or segment of the breast tissue with a satisfactory cosmetic result; have diffusely positive pathologic margins; or have homozygous (biallelic) inactivation for ATM mutation (category 2B). Relative contraindications to lumpectomy include previous RT to the breast or chest wall; active connective tissue disease involving the skin (especially scleroderma and lupus); persistently positive pathologic margin; or in those with a known or suspected genetic predisposition to breast cancer who may have an increased risk of ipsilateral breast recurrence or contralateral breast cancer with BCT or who may be considered for prophylactic bilateral mastectomy for risk reduction as per the criteria in the [NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic]. Relative contraindications may also include patients with known or suspected Li-Fraumeni syndrome (category 2B).\n\n【9】Several studies of patients with early-stage breast cancer treated with BCS have identified young age as a significant predictor of an increased likelihood of IBTRs after BCT. Risk factors, such as a family history of breast cancer or a genetic predisposition for breast cancer (i.e., BRCA1/2 or other cancer predisposing mutation), are more likely to exist in the population of young patients with breast cancer, thereby confounding the independent contributions of age and treatment to clinical outcome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 130, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/（2024.V1）NCCN临床实践指南：乳腺癌.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

In 2022, an estimated 44,850 new cases of rectal cancer will occur in the United States (26,650 cases in males; 18,200 cases in females). During the same year, it is estimated that 52,580 people will die from rectal and colon cancer combined. Despite these high numbers, the incidence of colon and rectal cancers per 100,000 people decreased from 60.5 in 1976 to 46.4 in 2005 and, more recently, 38.7 in 2016. In addition, mortality from CRC has been decreasing for decades 删除19:<u>(since 1947 in females and since 1980 in males)</u> and is currently down by more than 50% from peak mortality rates. These improvements in incidence of and mortality from CRC are thought to be a result of cancer prevention and earlier diagnoses through screening and or better treatment modalities. Recent data show continued rapid declines in incidence among those aged ≥65 years, with a decrease of 3.3% annually between 2011 and 2016. CRC incidence and mortality rates vary by race and ethnicity with the highest rates in non-Hispanic Black individuals and lowest in Asian Americans/Pacific Islanders. The magnitude of disparity in mortality rates is double that of incidence rates. Reasons for these racial disparities include differences in risk factor prevalence, access to health care and other social determinants of health, comorbidities, and tumor characteristics.\n\n【3】Conversely, incidence has increased among those younger than 65 years, with a 1% annual increase in those aged 50 to 64 years and a 2% annual increase in those younger than 50 years. CRC death rates also showed age-dependent trends, declining by 3% annually for those ≥65 years of age, compared to a 0.6% annual decline for individuals aged 50 to 64 years and a 1.3% annual increase for individuals younger than 50 years. A retrospective cohort study of the SEER CRC registry also found that the incidence of CRC in patients younger than 50 years has been increasing. The authors estimate that the incidence rates for colon and rectal cancers will increase by 90.0% and 124.2%, respectively, for patients 20 to 34 years by 2030. The cause of this trend is currently unknown. One review suggests that CRC that occurs in young adult patients may be clinicopathologically and genetically different from CRC in older adults, although this has not been confirmed broadly. If cancer in this population is different, there would be a need to develop specific treatment strategies for this population.\n\n【4】This Discussion summarizes the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines删除5:<u>®</u>) Rectal Cancer. These guidelines begin with the clinical presentation of the patient to the primary care physician or gastroenterologist and address diagnosis, pathologic staging, surgical management, perioperative treatment, management of recurrent and metastatic disease, patient surveillance, and survivorship. These guidelines overlap considerably with the NCCN Guidelines删除5:<u>®</u> for Colon Cancer, especially in the treatment of metastatic disease. The recommendations in these guidelines are classified as category 2A except where noted.

The company stated that advice from clinical experts suggests fewer than 10% of people having regorafenib or trifluridine–tipiracil would have post-progression treatment. But 26% of people who had regorafenib in CORRECT, and 31% in CONCUR, had post-progression treatment. The committee recalled that around 30% of people would be offered post-progression treatment after regorafenib or trifluridine–tipiracil has failed 删除9:<u>(see section 3.4)</u>. The company did a scenario analysis in which the post-progression treatment cost reported in NICE's technology appraisal on trifluridine–tipiracil was inflated to 2021 values (£1,633.18) and applied as a single cost to people having either regorafenib or trifluridine–tipiracil. The committee heard that the scenario analysis showed post-progression treatment was not a key driver of the cost-effectiveness estimates. But the committee concluded that subsequent treatment should be included in the economic model. It recalled that both trifluridine–tipiracil and regorafenib could be used in sequence (that is, trifluridine–tipiracil after regorafenib has been used, and vice versa). But it heard from the clinical experts that no difference in efficacy would be expected if either trifluridine–tipiracil or regorafenib were used at fourth line. This is because of the different mechanisms of action of the 2 technologies, and that those well enough to benefit from subsequent therapy are similar to the populations in the indirect treatment comparison. Clinical experts noted that maintained efficacy at later lines is also supported by observational data. The committee concluded that subsequent treatments should be included in the cost-effectiveness modelling, to reflect the clinical trials and clinical expert opinion. In the absence of additional evidence, it concluded that there is likely to be no difference in cost effectiveness if trifluridine–tipiracil is", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 16, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/2023 NICE 技术鉴定指导意见：瑞戈非尼用于既往治疗过的转移性结直肠癌[TA866].pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

The threshold for distinguishing preeclampsia is, however, higher in those with CKD, with the clinical manifestation of preeclampsia hypothesized to occur at lower levels of placental dysfunction when the endothelium is primed by CKD.\n\n【4】Severely impaired uteroplacental Doppler flows also indicate placental involvement, commonly associated with intrauterine growth restriction, whereas worsening of kidney disease is usually associated, in the absence of hypertension, with preserved fetal growth.\n\n【5】The simplest and perhaps most simplistic way to make a differential diagnosis between preeclampsia and GD after delivery is based on the persistence of proteinuria and hypertension beyond 3 months postpartum. The absence of proteinuria, however, does not fully rule it out.\n\n【6】#### Diagnostic issues in patients with de novo GD, with particular emphasis on kidney biopsy\n\n【7】Three distinct situations may be encountered during pregnancy in women with no history of GD who present with renal function abnormalities suggestive of GD: (i) detection of proteinuria and/or hematuria with preserved kidney function, (ii) diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome, and (iii) occurrence of subacute or acute kidney injury with proteinuria or nephrotic syndrome.\n\n【8】The diagnostic approach to these 3 situations is summarized in Figure 2.\n\n【9】No clear definition of nephrotic syndrome in pregnancy, particularly the degree of hypoalbuminemia, exists. As serum albumin gradually decreases from the beginning of pregnancy (mainly due to hemodilution), we suggest the use of a modified definition of nephrotic syndrome, whereby serum albumin below the lower limit of normal for gestational age (Supplemental Table S2) and proteinuria >3 g/d are suggestive of nephrotic syndrome. Severe nephrotic syndrome would be defined by a serum albumin <50% of the lower limit of normal.\n\n【10】The workup of a patient with nephrotic syndrome and/or subacute/acute kidney injury aims to predict the underlying kidney disease and, thus, start probabilistic treatment, based on patient history, clinical status (presence of extrarenal manifestations suggestive of systemic disorders), and biological tests (mainly autoantibodies and complement assays; Supplemental Tables S4 and S5). Kidney biopsy may be considered if the diagnosis remains questionable .\n\n【11】#### When should a kidney biopsy be performed in pregnancy?\n\n【12】A kidney biopsy is generally considered in pregnancy when progressive kidney function impairment and/or severe proteinuria could interfere with pregnancy outcomes, and when establishing a diagnosis is needed to determine treatment 删除8:<u>删除9:<u>(Table 15 and Figure 2)</u></u>.\n\n【13】Although an increased bleeding risk is reported in older series, recent data suggest that the procedure may be safe in experienced hands.

From 2014, GINA asthma management has focused not only on asthma symptom control, but also on personalized management of the patient's modifiable risk factors for exacerbations, other adverse outcomes and multimorbidity, and also taking into account the patient's preferences and goals.\n\n【1】For many patients in primary care, achieving good symptom control is a good guide to a reduced risk of exacerbations. When inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) were introduced into asthma management, large improvements were observed in symptom control and lung function, and exacerbations and asthma-related mortality also decreased.\n\n【2】However, patients with apparently mild asthma and few or intermittent symptoms may be still at risk of severe exacerbations . In addition, some patients continue to have exacerbations despite well-controlled symptoms, and for patients with ongoing symptoms, side-effects may be an issue if ICS doses continue to be stepped up. Therefore, in control-based management, both domains of asthma control (symptom control and future risk – see Box 2-2, p.38) should be taken into account when choosing asthma treatment and reviewing the response.\n\n【3】### Choosing between asthma treatment options\nAt each treatment step in asthma management, different medication options are available that, although not of identical efficacy, may be alternatives for controlling asthma. Different considerations apply to recommendations or choices made for broad populations compared with those for individual patients , as follows:\n\n【4】- **Population-level medication choices**: Population-level medication choices are often applied by bodies such as national formularies or managed care organizations. Population-level recommendations aim to represent the best option for most patients in the particular population. At each treatment step, ‘preferred’ controller and reliever regimens are recommended that provide the best benefit-to-risk ratio for both symptom control and risk reduction. Choice of the preferred controller and/or preferred reliever is based on evidence from efficacy studies (highly controlled studies in well-characterized populations) and effectiveness studies (from pragmatically controlled studies, or studies in broader populations, or strong observational data), with a particular focus on symptoms and exacerbation risk. Safety and relative cost are also considered. In Step 5, there are different population-level recommendations depending on the inflammatory phenotype, Type 2 or non-Type 2.\n  In the treatment figure for adults and adolescents , the options are shown in two 'tracks'. Track 1, with as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol as the reliever, is the preferred approach for most patients, based on evidence of overall lower exacerbation risk and similar symptom control, and a simpler regimen for stepping treatment up and down as needed, compared with treatments in Track 2 in which the reliever is short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) or, in some cases, combination ICS-SABA (for more details, see Chapter 3.2, p.53).\n- **Patient-level medication choices**: Treatment choices for individual patients also take into account any patient characteristics or phenotype that may predict their risk of exacerbations or other adverse outcomes, or a clinically important difference in their response compared with other patients, together with assessment of multimorbidity, the patient's goals and preferences, and practical issues such as cost, ability to use the medication and adherence 删除9:<u>(see Box 3-2, p.50)</u>. For factors relating to the choice of inhaler, see Chapter 3.3 .\n\n【5】The extent to which asthma treatment can be individualized according to patient characteristics or phenotypes depends on the health system, the clinical context, the potential magnitude of difference in outcomes, cost and available resources.

Moreover, by increasing the sensitivity of MRI for detecting active lesions, it may be helpful in improving the discrimination of true relapses and pseudorelapses when relapses cannot be adjudicated based on clinical presentation or T2 imaging alone.

However, treatment for unhealthy alcohol use may improve HIV treatment outcomes. Behavioral treatments for unhealthy alcohol use among people with HIV demonstrate a small but significant reduction in alcohol use删除21:<u>^44</u>^ 删除9:<u>(see additional resources for alcohol management from the [National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism]</u> and the [Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration] [SAMHSA]). Pharmacotherapy can also reduce alcohol use among people with HIV. There are three Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved pharmacotherapies for AUD: naltrexone, disulfiram, and acamprosate 删除9:<u>(see Table 16 below)</u>.\n\n【3】Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of naltrexone in reducing the number of heavy drinking days among those with HIV and among the general population. Naltrexone appears to be safe to use in people with HIV,删除21:<u>^45,46</u>^ and it is not associated with significant drug-drug interactions or irreversible hepatotoxicity. However, it is not recommended for individuals with decompensated liver disease and should be used with caution in individuals with elevated transaminase levels. Use of naltrexone in people with HIV and AUD can improve HIV treatment outcomes. In a randomized placebo-controlled trial of 100 prisoners with HIV who met the criteria for AUD, individuals who were provided depot naltrexone upon release from prison were more likely to achieve viral suppression at 6 months than the placebo group (56.7% vs. 30.3%).删除21:<u>^46</u>^\n\n【4】Data on the use of disulfiram and acamprosate among people with HIV are lacking. Notably, integrating treatment for AUD with treatment for HIV has been shown to increase the number of patients who receive alcohol treatment medication, counselling, and formal outpatient alcohol treatment services. Integrating these treatments may also improve the likelihood that a patient will achieve viral suppression on ART. A randomized controlled trial of 128 individuals with HIV and AUD compared an integrated stepped-care model of alcohol treatment in Veterans Administration HIV clinics to treatment as usual. At the end of treatment (24 weeks), integrated stepped care resulted in more participants receiving pharmacotherapy for AUD and participating in counseling. Though differences in alcohol use and viral suppression were not seen at 24 weeks, at 52 weeks, integrated stepped care was significantly associated with an increased number of alcohol abstinent days, a decrease in the number of drinks per drinking day, and a decreased number of heavy drinking episodes. In addition, the patients in the stepped care group had increased odds of achieving viral suppression (odds ratio [OR] 5.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11–27.99).删除21:<u>^47</u>^\n\n【5】Liver cirrhosis, whether related to chronic heavy alcohol use, viral hepatitis, or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, can result in altered metabolism of ARV drugs.

However, due to a high prevalence of concomitant and subsequent myeloid neoplasms in patients with LCH, bone marrow biopsy should be considered in the context of otherwise unexplained cytopenias or cytosis. | B |\n| 16.              | All patients with LCH should undergo BRAF-V600E mutational testing to aid in diagnosis and treatment. | A |\n| 17.              | IHC for VE1 may not be a sensitive or specific marker for BRAF-V600E mutational analysis and should be confirmed with another molecular assay if feasible. | B |\n| 18.              | For BRAF-V600-WT LCH cases, next-generation sequencing should be undertaken to assess for MAPK-ERK pathway mutations, especially in situations where the diagnosis is questionable or second-line treatment is needed. | A |\n| 19.              | In the absence of sufficient tumor tissue, cell-free DNA analysis from peripheral blood can be used for the assessment of BRAF-mutational status.

Kidney manifestations AL and ATTR amyloidosis\n\n【2】In AL amyloidosis, the kidney is one of the most common sites of amyloid deposition, with involvement in approximately 70% of patients. Kidney involvement in AL amyloidosis is usually characterized by nephrotic syndrome and progressive loss of kidney function. Nephrotic syndrome can be severe, with high-grade proteinuria, marked hypoalbuminemia, and anasarca. In a small proportion of patients, amyloid deposition is limited to the kidney interstitial compartment and/or vasculature. These individuals typically have reduced kidney function but minimal proteinuria.\n\n【3】Although direct kidney involvement in ATTR amyloidosis has been demonstrated with several TTR mutations, including Val30Met, Val30Ala, Phe33Cys, Gly47Glu, and Val42Ile as well as with ATTRwt, the involvement is usually subclinical. In the vast majority of patients with ATTR amyloidosis, the associated kidney disease is due to cardiorenal syndrome, which also frequently occurs in AL-CM. Autonomic nervous system involvement, which can occur in both AL and ATTR disease, can also contribute to hemodynamically-mediated kidney impairment .\n\n【4】#### 7.5.2. Challenges in assessment of kidney function in cardiac amyloidosis\n\n【5】Because patients with systemic amyloidosis often have muscle wasting, using the serum creatinine concentration to estimate kidney function, as is usually done in clinical practice, can result in overestimation of the GFR. Serum concentrations of cystatin C, a marker of kidney function that is independent of muscle mass, cystatin C-based GFR estimating equations, and determination of creatinine clearance with 24-hour urine collection can provide better indications of kidney function when muscle mass is reduced.\n\n【6】#### 7.5.3. Management of kidney manifestations of amyloidosis\n\n【7】##### 7.5.3.1. Impact of treatment of AL and ATTR amyloidosis\n\n【8】In AL amyloidosis, eradication of the amyloidogenic light chain with anti-plasma-cell therapy often leads to improvement in the kidney manifestations of the disease. In distinction to the cardiac manifestations of AL amyloidosis where abnormalities frequently persist, proteinuria typically decreases progressively over many months to several years after a hematologic complete response or very good partial response and can resolve fully if the hematologic response is sustained. Although GFR usually does not improve, kidney function often stabilizes after amyloidogenic light chain production is halted.\n\n【9】If kidney function declines despite laboratory studies indicating eradication of the amyloidogenic light chain, it may be difficult to determine whether the deterioration in kidney function reflects ongoing amyloid deposition that is not evident by clinically-available studies, is the result", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 33, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/2023年心脏淀粉样变性患者多学科综合护理的ACC专家共识决策路径.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Based on the clinical experience of members, the Committee concluded that for faster analgesia for severe cancer pain, starting opioids with continuous intravenous or subcutaneous infusion is recommended.\n\n【2】## Opioids for breakthrough cancer pain\n\n【3】There were 23 RCTs on opioids for breakthrough pain. Transmucosal fentanyl had a stronger analgesic effect on breakthrough pain than placebo. The analgesic effect of transmucosal fentanyl within 30 minutes was stronger than oral morphine immediate-release preparation, but the analgesic effect after 30 minutes was similar. The analgesic effect of morphine injection (intravenous injection, subcutaneous injection) within 30 minutes was stronger than transmucosal fentanyl, but it was similar at 30 minutes. Adverse effects were higher with transmucosal fentanyl compared with placebo.\n\n【4】Considering the time to effect, ease of administration, and cost (transmucosal fentanyl is more expensive than rescue drug), the Committee concluded that rescue medicines (oral morphine/oxycodone/hydromorphone immediate release, bolus of opioid injection, or opioid suppository) for breakthrough pain are strongly recommended [1B], with transmucosal fentanyl conditionally recommended when analgesia is delayed or insufficient despite oral rescue medication [2D].\n\n【5】## Switching opioids or rotating opioids\n\n【6】There were 13 studies on opioid switching or opioid rotation, which relieved pain. However, these studies did not compare the same switching and nonswitching groups, and the findings did not directly address the clinical questions. Other guidelines recommend switching opioids when increasing the dose of opioids does not relieve pain as expected, or when adverse effects do not improve sufficiently. Other guidelines conclude that no clear recommendations can be made for opioid switching and that opioid switching should be tailored to the individual patient's condition. Based on the recommendations of other guidelines and the clinical experience of each member, the Committee concluded that switching or rotating opioid medicines is conditionally recommended [2C].\n\n【7】## Patient-controlled analgesia\n\n【8】There were six RCTs on patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) devices for breakthrough cancer pain. In all six studies, there was no difference in analgesic effect based on the type of opioid and administration method. However, the PCA device was used in both the intervention and control groups, and the study results did not directly address the clinical questions. Considering that PCA devices are commonly used in clinical practice, the Committee concluded that PCA is conditionally recommended when the patient, family, and caregiver had a good understanding of it [2D].\n\n【9】## Discussion\n\n【10】This revision is the first major revision since the last edition, published in 2010. The guideline was based on the previously announced guidelines of the European Association for Palliative Care (EAPC), European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), and World Health Organization (WHO).\n\n【11】In the previous revision, we recommended the selection of analgesics according to the WHO pain relief ladder. In this revision, cancer pain was classified into three categories using NRS, similar to the guidelines of ESMO and NCCN, and the drugs varied according to the pain intensity, to help general practitioners evaluate cancer pain and select drugs. There was insufficient evidence to discuss the choice of opioids. Most of the evidence is derived from studies during the product development phase, where many have a noninferiority study design. Therefore, similar to WHO guidelines, the Committee did not recommend specific opioids due to a lack of evidence for the superiority of specific opioids and the slight cost difference between opioids in Japan.\n\n【12】Methadone was conditionally recommended for cancer pain that could not be removed with other strong opioids due to a lack of experience in administration. The EAPC, ESMO, and NCCN guidelines state that experts should prescribe methadone. In Japan, methadone was approved in 2013, and it can only be administered by doctors who have completed e-learning. Transmucosal fentanyl for breakthrough pain was selected as a second-line drug because of its high cost (the lowest dose of fentanyl sublingual tablet is five times the price of the lowest dose of immediate-release morphine).\n\n【13】For OIC, general laxatives were recommended as prophylactic and therapeutic agents, similar to the guidelines of EAPC, ESMO, and NCCN. Due to insufficient experience with the laxative effect was inadequate, similar to the ESMO and NCCN guidelines. For opioid-induced vomiting, the previous revision of the guideline recommended prophylactic administration. Due to a lack of evidence and the Committee's agreement, this revision did not recommend prophylactic administration similar to the guidelines of EAPC and ESMO. For opioid overdoses, EAPC, ESMO, and NCCN guidelines recommend methylphenidate, but methylphenidate is a restricted prescription drug in Japan, and other psychostimulants lack evidence. As such, these drugs were not recommended in this guideline revision.\n\n【14】Opioid switching is not recommended in the WHO guidelines. However, like other guidelines, the Committee conditionally recommended opioid switching due to common clinical practice in Japan. Although the ESMO and WHO guidelines mention the recommendation of bisphosphonates, the Committee agreed not to administer this drug for the primary purpose of analgesia and excluded it from the guidelines.\n\n【15】The most critical limitation in the guideline development process is a general lack of evidence that directly addresses the clinical questions. Several of the recommendations in this guideline are strong recommendations based on the low level of evidence. Many of the studies adopted in systematic reviews had little directness to the actual clinical practice, and many treatments could not be recommended based on the evidence alone. It was necessary to coordinate with the empirical treatment that is customarily widely practiced in Japan, collected through the guideline committee and the external committee members, with the rigorous methodology for handling evidence, such as GRADE. To ensure that even general practitioners who do not specialize in palliative medicine can make better treatment choices, we discussed the...", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 9, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/JSPM：癌痛药物治疗的临床指南（2022）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Several trials 删除12:<u>[141–144]</u> have addressed the role of CRT in patients with HF and QRS duration <120 ms, given that some degree of dyssynchrony may still be present. Most were parallel controlled trials comparing CRT pacing programmed on or off. One trial 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[141]</u></u> was terminated after 85 patients with symptomatic LV dysfunction and QRS duration <120 ms were randomized and no significant differences in LV reverse remodeling, a significant reduction in exercise capacity, and an increase in QRS duration were noted with CRT pacing programmed on versus off. In another trial 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[143]</u></u> of 809 patients with QRS duration <130 ms, after a median of 19 months, a nonsignificant trend toward higher all-cause death or HFH in the CRT group was demonstrated; there were significantly more deaths in the CRT group. However, a subsequent study 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[123]</u></u> suggested that the risk was concentrated among patients with larger LV dimensions, and that patients with a longer QRS duration and smaller LV size intended to height appeared to benefit from CRT. In a trial 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[142]</u></u> of 120 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy with QRS duration <120 ms, randomized to CRT-D or dual-chamber ICD groups, there was a significant reduction in HF clinical composite response after 1 year in the CRT group, with a significantly lower combined endpoint of HFH, HF death, and spontaneous ventricular fibrillation after 16 months.\n3.

In REVERSE, investigators randomized 610 patients to CRT with BiV pacing on versus off, with echocardiographic assessment of LV size and function after 12 months. Patients with non-LBBB did not experience beneficial remodeling. Among patients with LBBB, benefit was significantly related to degree of QRS prolongation. CSP has been inadequately studied among patients with non-LBBB, QRS duration <150 ms, and NYHA class I and II to warrant recommendations at this time.\n\n【3】### 3.2.3.

If there is evidence of a high antibody titer, or if drug levels are high and antibody titers are absent or low, then a switch to a different biologic agent may be indicated.\n\n【1】Measurement of anti-TNFα trough levels should be performed in patients with a primary nonresponse or who have lost response over time, taking into consideration factors including dosage, concurrent immunosuppressant use, and the interval between dosing.

These same measures for distant metastasis free survival was 93.8% for 1 year, 97.8% for 3 years, and 96.6% for 5 years. Together, current data from the IWWD suggests that disease recurrence occurs most frequently in the first 2 to 3 years following complete response and a more intense surveillance schedule is recommended for that time period.\n\n【2】The OPRA trial is a randomized, phase II trial of the watch-and-wait approach. OPRA assessed the outcomes of 324 patients with stage II or III rectal cancer treated with TNT using either an induction chemotherapy followed by chemoRT approach or an approach using chemoRT followed by consolidation chemotherapy. Following neoadjuvant treatment, patients received either TME or observation (watch-and-wait) based on tumor response. Organ preservation was achievable in about half of patients treated with TNT on OPRA with 3-year TME-free survival of 41% in the induction chemotherapy group and 53% in the consolidation chemotherapy group. The primary endpoint of DFS was 76% for both groups, which is in line with the 75% 3-year DFS rate observed historically. No differences were observed between the groups for RFS, distant metastasis-free survival, or OS.\n\n【3】Despite the impressive results of prospective trials, many still believe that longer follow-up, larger sample sizes, and additional careful observational studies are needed before patients with a clinical complete response are routinely managed by a watch-and-wait approach. Furthermore, recent studies have found that neither FDG-PET, nor MRI, nor CT can accurately determine a pathologic complete response, complicating the selection of appropriate patients for a nonoperative approach. In addition, lymph node metastases are still seen in a subset of patients with pathologic complete response. Keeping these caveats in mind, the panel believes that a nonoperative management approach may be considered in centers with experienced multidisciplinary teams after a careful discussion with the patient about their risk tolerance.\n\n【4】Careful surveillance is essential for those considering a watch-and-wait approach in order to treat tumor regrowth in a timely manner. The OPRA trial included the following surveillance protocol for watch-and-wait: DRE, flexible sigmoidoscopy, and CEA every 4 months for the first 2 years, then every 6 months for years 3 to 5; MRI every 6 months for the first 2 years, then every 12 months for years 3 to 5; CT chest/abdomen/pelvis once a year for 5 years; and colonoscopy once at year 1 and again at year 5. Watch-and-wait surveillance protocols are an area of active investigation and other protocols have been suggested. The watch-and-wait surveillance schedule recommended by the NCCN Panel based on clinical and institutional experiences is similar to the OPRA protocol and includes DRE and proctoscopy every 3 to 4 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for the next 3 years, and MRI of the rectum every 6 months for at least 3 years.\n\n【5】The use of nonoperative management of rectal cancer has been increasing in the United States, likely representing some early adoption of the approach described herein as well as disparities in the receipt of appropriate rectal cancer resection.\n\n【6】### Adjuvant Chemotherapy\nAdjuvant chemotherapy is recommended for patients with stage II/III rectal cancer following neoadjuvant chemoRT and surgery if they did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy regardless of the surgical pathology results; however, few studies have evaluated the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with rectal cancer, and its role is not well-defined. The addition of 5-FU adjuvant chemotherapy to preoperative chemoRT provided no benefit to the rate of local recurrence in the EORTC", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 96, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/（2023.V3）NCCN临床实践指南：直肠癌.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

This delivery takes place through an endovascular microcatheter that has been brought closer to the pathological target by means of larger coaxial catheters.\n\n【3】In particular situations, the approach to the nidus can be analogously obtained in a retrograde way using a venous catheterization technique.\n\n【4】These endovascular procedures can be used as the only therapeutic method (stand-alone therapy), but most of the time it is performed in combination with other treatments such as surgery, percutaneous occlusion, laser etc.\n\n【5】The wide variability of clinical situations and the increasingly broad spectrum of embolizing material available require not only an effective but also a continuously updated technique.\n\n【6】Endovascular embolization is considered the first-choice therapeutic method for extensive or surgically inaccessible AVMs. Even with the same reservations expressed regarding surgery and the worsening effects in the event of partial closure of the nidus, embolization is also allowed as palliative therapy in order to stabilize or slow down the progression of symptoms. The best chances of success with endovascular treatment are in AVM type I and II (arteriovenous and arteriolo-venous) and minor with type III (arteriolo-venular) forms of the Cho classification.\n\n【7】The risk of iatrogenic damage during embolization increases exponentially in the treatment of pathologies located in acral regions (hands, feet, forearms, nose, auricles, etc.). In particular, at the level of the nidus, embolization involves the risk of complications (such as necrosis and nerve damage) and can be used by expert hands by careful embolizing material handling.\n\n【8】Embolizing materials can be roughly divided into two categories:\n1. **Solids**, among which the main ones are:\n    - coils (spirals);\n    - PVA particles;\n    - plug;\n2. **Liquids**, the main ones being:\n    - adhesives (type NBCA);\n    - non-adhesive (EVOH, at the base of various commercial preparations such as Onyx, Squid and Phil);\n    - pure ethanol.\n\n【9】Some materials such as alcohol-polyvinyl chloride (PVA) particles are rarely used due to the temporariness of the closure (the microspheres are removed by the monocyte-macrophage immune system), relegating their use to other pathological conditions. They also not infrequently pass-through fistulous shunts and reach the pulmonary bed. Furthermore, the use of very small diameters not rarely causes ischemic lesions of the perinervous regions (for example the skin).\n\n【10】Even the spirals (coils) are rarely implanted as they determine a proximal occlusion of the afferent vessel without excluding the \"nest,\" thus determining an important stimulus to reactive neoangiogenesis and hindering any subsequent therapeutic attempts.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 67, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/SISAV：血管异常指南（2022）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

The possibility of adjuvant therapy as part of the care plan should be mentioned prior to surgery. Postoperatively, patients deemed at an elevated risk of recurrence, as defined by the Keynote-564 clinical trial 删除9:<u>(Table 2)</u>, should be offered a referral to a medical oncologist to further discuss the risks and benefits of adjuvant systemic therapy. It should be noted that Keynote-564 required patients to have a clear-cell component on pathology. Therefore, data may not be applicable to non-clear-cell RCC histologies. Furthermore, the magnitude of benefit may vary based on the risk of cancer recurrence and each patient's medical history and competing risks.\n\n【2】## STATEMENT 4\nPatients should have staging, including cross-sectional imaging of the chest/abdomen/pelvis, prior to starting adjuvant therapy (consensus achieved: 95%).\n\n【3】Patients should have staging imaging, including cross-sectional imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis at a reasonable time course before initiating adjuvant therapy. While a specific timeline may vary by clinical or patient context, the panel felt a window of 6–12 weeks prior to start of adjuvant therapy is usually appropriate. Some patients may benefit from additional imaging, including brain imaging and bone scan, particularly with the presence of symptoms suggesting possible metastasis.\n\n【4】## STATEMENT 5\nIf adjuvant therapy is provided, it should be initiated within 12–16 weeks of surgery (consensus achieved: 100%).\n\n【5】Keynote-564 required patients to initiate adjuvant therapy within 12 weeks of surgery. The panel discussed this timeline on a patient and upstream level within the Canadian healthcare system. The panel believes that initiating adjuvant therapy within 12–16 weeks of surgery is reasonable in the real-world setting; however, at this time, drug access in Canada necessitates commencement within 12 weeks of surgery.\n\n【6】## STATEMENT 6\nIf adjuvant therapy is provided, pembrolizumab is currently the only treatment that should be considered (consensus achieved: 100%).\n\n【7】The only ICI-based therapy that has demonstrated improvement in DFS as a primary endpoint is pembrolizumab in Keynote-564. The panel believes pembrolizumab should be the only agent considered in the adjuvant setting at the time of this writing.\n\n【8】While in other clinical treatment settings, PD-1/PD-L1 agents may be considered to have similar therapeutic activity, the panel did not feel that single-agent ICIs could be considered interchangeable in the adjuvant RCC setting unless other randomized data provides support to do so. Further, while combination ICIs have been approved in the advanced RCC setting, in light of the negative CheckMate 914 study (which evaluated combination nivolumab and ipilimumab as adjuvant therapy), the panel felt combination ICIs should not be offered as an adjuvant option at this time, outside of clinical trials.\n\n【9】## STATEMENTS 7-9\nPatients should be considered for adjuvant therapy based on the group definitions of Keynote-564.\n\n【10】The panel recommends that risk group definitions from the Keynote-564 trial be used for patient selection and counselling when considering adjuvant therapy 删除9:<u>(see statements 7–9 for definitions)</u>. Subgroup-specific information is important to consider because the risk of side effects (harm) from adjuvant therapy may be similar for all groups, while the benefit may not be equivalent. Subgroup-specific HRs from Keynote-564 have been provided below to help estimate the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one cancer recurrence or death.

Cabotegravir (CAB) is a new INSTI that is approved to be used with rilpivirine (RPV) as part of a long-acting injectable complete antiretroviral (ARV) regimen to replace a stable oral regimen in patients with viral suppression. The role of this combination is discussed in the Optimizing Antiretroviral Therapy in the Setting of Virologic Suppression section.\n\n【2】The Panel recommends one of the following INSTI-based regimens for most people with HIV:\n\n【3】- BIC/tenofovir alafenamide (TAF)/emtricitabine (FTC) (AI)\n- DTG/abacavir (ABC)/lamivudine (3TC) 删除19:<u>(if HLA-B *5701 negative and without chronic hepatitis B [HBV] virus coinfection)</u> (AI)*\n- DTG plus (TAF or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [TDF]) with (FTC or 3TC) (AI)\n- DTG/3TC (AI), except for those with HIV RNA >500,000 copies/mL, with HBV coinfection, or in whom ART is to be started before the results of HIV genotypic resistance testing for reverse transcriptase or HBV testing are available.\n\n【4】### Rating of Recommendations: A = Strong; B = Moderate; C = Optional\n\n【5】**Rating of Evidence:** I = One or more randomized trials with clinical outcomes and/or validated laboratory endpoints; II = One or more well-designed, nonrandomized trials or observational cohort studies with long-term clinical outcomes; III = Expert opinion\n\n【6】EVG and RAL have a lower barrier to resistance than BIC and DTG. Because of their higher barrier to resistance, DTG plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) or BIC/TAF/FTC may be considered for patients who must start ART before resistance test results are available. RAL is not available in a single-tablet regimen (STR) formulation and RAL-containing regimens have a higher pill burden than BIC- and DTG-containing regimens. EVG-based regimens require pharmacokinetic boosting with cobicistat (COBI), which results in a greater potential for interaction with concomitant medications. Both EVG- and RAL-based regimens are considered Recommended Initial Regimens in Certain Clinical Situations.\n\n【7】All INSTIs are generally well tolerated, although there are reports of insomnia in some patients. Depression and suicidal ideation, primarily in patients with a history of psychiatric illnesses, have been reported rarely in patients receiving INSTI-based regimens.\n\n【8】Among ARV-naive individuals, initiation of INSTI-containing regimens has been associated with greater weight gain than non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)- or boosted protease inhibitor (PI)-regimens. In randomized trials of ARV-naive individuals, the mean increase in weight from baseline associated with BIC and DTG was similar and greater than with elvitegravir/cobicistat (EVG/c) or with efavirenz (EFV). Greater weight gain also has been observed after initiation of TAF, or with a switch from TDF to TAF, especially in conjunction with INSTIs. Although ARV-associated weight gain appears to disproportionately affect women and Black and Hispanic people, predictors and mechanisms for the weight gain are still unclear. Further questions that need to be clarified include regional distribution of the weight gain, whether it is associated with significant cardio-metabolic risk, and whether it is reversible upon discontinuation of the offending agent.\n\n【9】### INSTIs in Persons of Childbearing Potential\n\n【10】- Preliminary data from a birth outcomes surveillance study in Botswana raised concern of an increased risk of neural tube defects (NTDs) (0.9%) in infants born to women who were receiving DTG at the time of conception. Updated results from the same study have shown that the prevalence of NTDs in infants who were exposed to DTG at the time of conception is substantially lower than initial estimates.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 97, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/HHS：HIV感染的成人及青少年应用抗逆转录病毒药物治疗指南（2022）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Front. Endocrinol. 13:908727. doi: 10.3389/fendo.2022.908727\n\n【8】Glucocorticoids are effective immunomodulatory drugs used for many inflammatory disorders as well as in transplant recipients. However, both iatrogenic and endogenous glucocorticoid excess are also associated with several side effects including an increased risk of osteoporosis and fractures. Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) is a common secondary cause of osteoporosis in adults. Despite the availability of clear evidence and international guidelines for the prevention of GIOP, a large treatment gap remains. In this narrative review, the Belgian Bone Club (BBC) updates its 2006 consensus recommendations for the prevention and treatment of GIOP in adults. The pathophysiology of GIOP is multifactorial. The BBC strongly advises non-pharmacological measures including physical exercise, smoking cessation and avoidance of alcohol abuse in all adults at risk for osteoporosis. Glucocorticoids are associated with impaired intestinal vitamin D absorption; the BBC therefore strongly recommend sufficient calcium intake and avoidance of vitamin D deficiency. We recommend assessment of fracture risk, taking age, sex, menopausal status, prior fractures, glucocorticoid dose, other clinical risk factors and bone mineral density into account. Placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of alendronate, risedronate, zoledronate, denosumab and teriparatide in GIOP. We suggest monitoring by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and vertebral fracture identification one year after glucocorticoid initiation. The trabecular bone score might be considered during DXA monitoring. Extended femur scans might be considered at the time of DXA imaging.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 1, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/BBC：糖皮质激素诱发的成人骨质疏松症的预防和治疗的共识建议（2022）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

A diagnosis of XIAP deficiency was made in one patient, 30 years after IBD onset (at age 12 years) who had undergone numerous operations, and spent more than 1000 days in hospital.\n- A diagnosis of X-linked chronic granulomatous disorder (CGD) was made in a patient aged 16 years, after he presented with a liver abscess. He had difficult-to-treat Crohn's disease since age 3 years and had previously developed neck abscesses and pneumonia. He underwent an allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) after the CGD diagnosis was established.\n- A diagnosis of XIAP deficiency was detected for a patient aged 17 years, who was experiencing recurrent infections (particularly skin infections) and severe Crohn's disease since age 9 years.\n- In a patient with congenital neutropenia, severe infection susceptibility, ileocolic inflammation, and a Crohn's disease diagnosis, a diagnosis of G6PC3 defect was established by genome sequencing at age 18 years. A subsequent allogeneic HSCT completely resolved intestinal symptoms of Crohn's disease.\n- In a patient aged 15 years with a history of infantile enterocolitis and relapse of B-cell lymphoma after two rounds of chemotherapy, an IL-10 receptor defect was established, which changed therapy from planning an autologous HSCT to allogeneic HSCT. Non-Epstein-Barr virus related diffuse large B-cell lymphoma as well as Epstein-Barr virus associated lymphoma have been reported in patients with IL-10 receptor signalling defects between age 3-5 years and 16-5 years.\n- Identification of novel genes allows testing of patient with years of ongoing intestinal inflammation. Gain-of-function SYK variants were identified in adult patients after the molecular defect was functionally characterised.\n- An essential loss-of-function variant in the LRBA gene was identified by exome sequencing in a patient aged 37 years with a history of diarrhoea, duodenitis with villous atrophy, colonic abnormalities, arthritis, hepatitis, and a relevant family history.\n\n【3】Some monogenic conditions, in particular XIAP deficiency or CGD, can present with severe Crohn's disease including severe therapy-refractory perianal disease, collections, and exceptional wound healing problems after surgery. Poorly controlled disease can lead to multiple intestinal resections, or complications after surgery such as collections, septic episodes, and short bowel syndrome. However, patients with adolescent-onset or adult-onset therapy-refractory ulcerative colitis or perianal Crohn's disease are not uncommon (eg, about 60% of patients with perianal Crohn's disease relapse during 1 year of anti-TNF therapy). This means that the number of patients needed to test is probably very high; hundreds of patients might need to be screened to identify one patient with XIAP or CGD. Since XIAP deficiency and CGD can be investigated by reliable functional tests with high sensitivity and specificity, functional tests are a fast and cost-effective way to investigate these disorders in clinical practice. A neutrophil function test and XIAP expression assay might be diagnostic 删除9:<u>(table 2)</u>.\n\n【4】Future studies are required to establish the best initial diagnostic strategy that allows cost-effective and reliable testing in patient cohorts with expected low diagnostic yield (limited functional tests vs small targeted genetic panels or more comprehensive genomic testing as default option).\n\n【5】### Which genes should be investigated?\nThe list of genes investigated as part of the analysis panel depends on cumulative evidence of published genotype–phenotype associations (number of patients described with each gene defect and the strength of the association, supported by functional data and model systems), and availability of treatment options.\n\n【6】In an European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) position statement, 75 genes were listed based on expert consensus. Since then, additional genes have been described and quantitative parameters for IBD associations were proposed. Defects in 102 genes show strong or moderate expressivity of intestinal inflammation. For some monogenic conditions, the evidence is restricted to small case series or individual case reports, suggesting that further data are required to confirm genotype–phenotype associations. A regular panel review will allow for adoption of increasing numbers of genes over time and the collective evidence (panel 3). Genomic testing using such an adaptable gene panel approach provides an updated analysis when new evidence becomes available 删除9:<u>(table 1b)</u>.\n\n【7】### Interpreting genetic results\nInterpreting the clinical significance of genetic variants is a complex process that requires plausible correlation of the patient history, the clinical presentation, and laboratory results. Variant classification can be established as recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics and the Association for Clinical Genomic Science. This variant classification framework includes assessing the previous evidence in variant or mutation databases, conducting literature searches, quantifying the variant frequency in disease cohorts and population datasets (eg, gnomAD), and the use of in silico tools to predict variant pathogenicity.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 10, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/2023 BSG／BSPGHAN共识指南：儿童和成人单基因炎性肠病的基因组诊断和护理协调.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

However, many of these prospective studies are limited by their small sample size, with the exception of the MUNICON II trial, which included 110 patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the EGJ. In this study, metabolic responders were defined as those with a decrease of greater than or equal to 35% in SUV following preoperative therapy. After a median follow-up of 2.3 years, median OS was not reached in metabolic responders, whereas the median OS was 25.8 months in non-responders ($P$ = .015). Median event-free survival (EFS) was 29.7 months and 14 months, respectively, for metabolic responders and non-responders ($P$ = .002). Major histologic remissions (<10% of residual cancer) were noted in 58% of metabolic responders but in 0% of non-responders. This study prospectively demonstrated that metabolic response as measured by FDG-PET is predictive of pathologic response and survival in patients with gastroesophageal carcinoma following preoperative therapy. Additional studies have reported similar outcomes.\n\n【2】Although adding induction chemotherapy to chemoradiation and surgery has not been shown to improve survival over chemoradiation and surgery alone, response on FDG-PET scan to induction chemotherapy was shown in the MUNICON-1 trial to be a biomarker of benefit from chemotherapy. FDG-PET non-responders in this trial had chemotherapy terminated and were referred for earlier surgery as they do not clearly benefit from therapy continuation. MUNICON-2 indicated that FDG-PET non-responders to induction chemotherapy did not benefit from the subsequent addition of RT to chemotherapy prior to surgery. The CALGB 80803 trial used FDG-PET scan response to induction chemotherapy to direct either continuation of the same chemotherapy regimen during chemoradiation (infusional fluorouracil/oxaliplatin or carboplatin/paclitaxel) in FDG-PET responders, or to cross over to an alternative regimen during chemoradiation in FDG-PET non-responders. The primary endpoint, to enhance pCR rate at surgery in FDG-PET non-responders who changed chemotherapy during radiation, was met, indicating the potential for FDG-PET scan to direct selection of chemotherapy during chemoradiation after induction chemotherapy. The most promising results of this trial were in patients who were FDG-PET responders receiving mFOLFOX followed by infusional fluorouracil/oxaliplatin/radiation and surgery, providing additional support for the use of fluorouracil/oxaliplatin combined with RT as preoperative treatment. This strategy needs to be further developed before adoption into clinical practice.\n\n【3】In contrast, other studies have reported that FDG-PET has a limited utility for assessing response to preoperative therapy in patients with esophageal cancer, except for the detection of distant metastases. However, FDG-PET was performed either during preoperative therapy or soon after the completion of preoperative therapy in many of these studies, which may reflect an inflammatory effect of radiation that obscures tumor-specific metabolic changes. RT and chemoradiation often cause local inflammatory reactions in the esophagus. Uptake of FDG in these inflammatory lesions occurs commonly, resulting in false-positive results on PET scan. Therefore, increased FDG uptake due to radiation-induced inflammation limits the use of FDG-PET for early response assessment of esophageal carcinomas. To reduce the incidence of false-positive results due to inflammation, the guidelines recommend that FDG-PET/CT (preferred) or FDG-PET should be performed at least 5 to 8 weeks after the completion of preoperative therapy. However, the guidelines caution that post-treatment FDG-PET results should not be used to select patients for surgery since FDG-PET cannot distinguish microscopic residual disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 100, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/_（2023.V4）NCCN临床实践指南：食管和食管胃交界部癌.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Information could be delivered in person or over the phone. Telehealth (ie, real-time two-way videoconference) is also increasingly utilized as a feasible alternative for in-person genetic counseling. Remote options (eg, telephone, telehealth) have the potential to help improve genetic testing rates in areas with inadequate access.\n\n【2】Pre- and post-test genetic counseling with involvement of an expert in cancer genetics is recommended. However, the panel acknowledges that most genetic testing is conducted by providers with limited expertise in genetics and often without pre-test genetic counseling. Shortages in genetics health providers, expansion of testing indications, aggressive marketing, and increased accessibility of testing due to plummeting costs inclusive of DTC models for testing provide the impetus for the panel to identify scenarios in which referral to a genetics health provider should be considered. These scenarios are as follows: identification of a P/LP variant; negative results despite tumor profiling, personal history, or family history suggestive of inherited condition; VUS result that warrants further evaluation or for which a patient or provider considers using to guide management; mosaic/possibly mosaic result or clonal hematopoiesis (CH); discrepant interpretation of variants (eg, discordant results across laboratories); interpretation of PRS; and detection of P/LP variants from DTC testing.\n\n【3】Post-test counseling includes disclosure of results, a discussion of the associated medical risks, an assessment of the impact of the results on the emotional state of the individual, a discussion of the impact of the results on the comprehensive care of the individual (including discussion of therapeutic implications by a qualified health care professional), and how and where the patient will be screened for cancer risk. Counseling should include making the individual aware of any available resources, such as disease-specific support groups, high-risk clinics, advocacy groups, and research studies. The counselor should discuss the importance of genetic counseling and testing for relatives who also may be at increased risk.\n\n【4】Since some P/LP variants are associated with rare autosomal recessive conditions (eg, Fanconi anemia is associated with BRCA2, BRIP1, and PALB2 variants), the proband should be advised regarding possible inherited cancer risk to relatives and their own options for risk assessment and management. Testing of a partner of a carrier of a P/LP variant may also be considered to inform reproductive decision-making. See Autosomal Recessive Risk in Cancer Genes – Multi-Gene Panel Testing in the algorithm for a full list of the P/LP variants covered in these Guidelines that are associated with autosomal recessive conditions.\n\n【5】Many patients who have been diagnosed with cancer and have a P/LP variant are at increased risk for additional primary cancers in the future. Management of those risks may be appropriate after treatment of the current cancer or may be combined with treatment for a current cancer. For example, a patient with breast cancer and a pathogenic variant in BRCA1 or BRCA2 may consider bilateral mastectomies to treat their current cancer and also to reduce the risk of a future primary breast cancer. These patients may also consider oophorectomy for treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer and also for reducing ovarian cancer risk.\n\n【6】Best practices for communicating an individual's personal risk relative to published estimated lifetime risks of cancer include the following: 1) presenting risk estimates as a range rather than a single estimate (eg, 30% to 40%); 2) presenting absolute risk versus relative risk terminology.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 86, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/（2024.V3）NCCN临床实践指南：遗传／家族高风险评估-乳腺癌，卵巢癌和胰腺癌.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

The percentage of people receiving DSMES, however, is low. Although hospitalization is often considered a suboptimal environment for patient education, it is considered 1 of the 4 critical times that DSMES should be provided. Hospitalization represents an opportunity to begin DSMES for patients who have not received it in the past or to reinforce previously provided DSMES.\n\n【3】#### Recommendation 4.1\nIn adult patients with diabetes who are hospitalized for noncritical illness, we suggest providing inpatient diabetes education as part of a comprehensive diabetes discharge-planning process, rather than not providing inpatient diabetes education.\n\n【4】#### Remarks\nInpatient diabetes education is best provided by diabetes care and education specialists (DCESs). Where availability of DCESs is limited, DCESs can serve as a resource to healthcare providers specifically tasked to provide inpatient diabetes education (e.g., staff nurses, pharmacists, dietitians, etc.) by providing training and support.\n- Ideally, the DCESs should be Certified Diabetes Care and Education Specialists and/or hold the Board Certified-Advanced Diabetes Management credentials or be working toward 1 of these certifications.\n- A comprehensive diabetes discharge-planning process includes education and validation of diabetes survival skills, referral for outpatient DSMES, scheduling diabetes care follow-up appointments, and ensuring access to the medications and supplies required for diabetes self-management following discharge.\n- In the case of limited personnel, healthcare providers providing diabetes education could prioritize education for patients at high risk for hospital readmission, those admitted for diabetes-related issues, and those newly diagnosed with diabetes or newly starting insulin.\n\n【5】#### Summary of evidence\nThe EtD framework with a detailed summary of the evidence can be found online.\n\n【6】#### Benefits and harms\nThe systematic review identified 4 RCTs and 6 non-RCTs to address this question. Evidence from RCTs shows that providing inpatient diabetes education as part of a comprehensive diabetes discharge-planning program likely reduces hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at 3 months by 1.25% and at 6 months by 0.8% following discharge. In addition, evidence from 3 non-RCTs suggests a moderate benefit in readmission rates with an estimated 43 fewer hospital readmissions per 1000 patients with inpatient diabetes education as part of a comprehensive diabetes discharge-planning process. Inpatient diabetes education may increase patient satisfaction without increasing hospital LOS. The studies did not identify any negative effects of inpatient diabetes education.\n\n【7】#### Other evidence to decision criteria and considerations\nPanel members placed high value on the moderate benefits of improved HbA1c and reduced readmissions with inpatient diabetes education provided as part of a comprehensive diabetes discharge-planning process. Providing diabetes education during a hospital stay may help socioeconomically challenged patients who do not have access to this resource as outpatients and who typically have higher hospital readmission rates. The panel acknowledged that although it may not be feasible for all patients with diabetes in the hospital to receive diabetes education from a qualified diabetes education professional, providing diabetes education should optimally have a DCES as a readily available resource. It has been shown that having a dedicated diabetes care team or certified diabetes educator in the hospital can decrease hospital readmission rates. Additionally, in the setting of limited availability of DCESs, alternative approaches may be considered, including the use of tablets or other technologies to deliver standardized education to select patients, with the understanding that many patients may have difficulty navigating these devices independently due to physical limitations, lack of technology experience, or lack of interest in using technology.\n\n【8】#### Justification for the recommendation\nThe panel agreed that inpatient diabetes education likely lowers HbA1c postdischarge, may reduce hospital readmissions, may enhance patient satisfaction, and may improve health inequities for those who may not have access to outpatient education. Although inpatient diabetes education is associated with costs related to the employment and training of personnel, the panel agreed that, overall, the benefits may outweigh these costs.\n\n【9】#### Comments\n- Diabetes survival skill education in the hospital includes an assessment of patient-specific needs and identification of barriers to learning such as disabilities, health literacy, and numeracy limitations. The training is then individualized to the patient, their family and/or caregivers. DSMES focuses on the Association of Diabetes Care & Education Specialists self-management model known as the ADCES7 Self-Care Behaviors. Although these behaviors/provide the framework for optimal diabetes self-management in the outpatient setting, inpatient education focuses on...", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 10, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/TES：非重症监护住院患者高血糖管理的临床实践指南（2022）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

The diagnosis requires the presence of t(12;13)(p13;q12) leading to **FLT3** rearrangement (**ETV6** is the most common partner gene in both cases) or t(9;12)(q34;p13) leading to **ABL1** rearrangement.\n\n【2】**MLN-Eo** with **FLT3** or **ABL1** rearrangement is generally associated with an aggressive clinical course, disease progression, or relapse. **CEL-NOS** is the characteristic clinical presentation in **MLN-Eo** with **FLT3** rearrangement. Peripheral T-cell lymphoma or T-ALL have also been described. **De novo ALL** is the most common clinical presentation associated with **ABL1** rearrangement in children; AML and chronic myeloid/lymphoid phenotypes have been described in adults. The differential diagnosis of **JAK2** and **ABL1** fusions with a phenotype of ALL includes **Ph-like ALL**.\n\n【3】## Clinical Presentation\nChronic phase disease may present in the bone marrow or peripheral blood, with or without eosinophilia. Bone marrow may exhibit an atypical mast cell proliferation, often in an interstitial pattern but not the typical aggregates found in SM.\n\n【4】There is no current definition for accelerated phase disease; however, the presence of 10% to 19% blasts in the bone marrow or peripheral blood has been used to define accelerated phase similar to myeloid neoplasms such as CML. Blast phase (≥20% blasts in the bone marrow and/or peripheral blood) may present as AML or ALL, or acute leukemias with mixed-lineage disease and/or extramedullary myeloid sarcoma, T-ALL, or B-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma (B-ALL). Blast phase may also present as an EMD with MPN-like features in bone marrow or peripheral blood. TK fusion genes have been identified in a number of cases where eosinophilia is concurrently diagnosed with T-cell lymphomas or blast phase acute leukemias of myeloid, lymphoid, or mixed lineage (de novo or secondary).\n\n【5】**EMD** may present as extramedullary myeloid sarcoma, T-ALL or B-ALL, or myeloid/T- or B-cell lymphoid mixed-lineage blast phase disease. EMD may present alone or with chronic or blast phase disease involving the bone marrow or peripheral blood, and lineage may be different from the lineage involving the bone marrow/peripheral blood.\n\n【6】**MLN-Eo** with TK fusion gene rearrangements are associated with a variety of symptoms related to the overproduction of cytokines, growth factors, and eosinophil-derived mediators. The most common presenting signs and symptoms include weakness and fatigue, cough, dyspnea, myalgias or angioedema, rash or fever, and rhinitis. In addition, patients also present with various blood count abnormalities depending on the underlying neoplasm (eg, neutrophilia, basophilia, thrombocytosis, monocytosis, myeloid immaturity, and both mature and immature eosinophils with varying degrees of dysplasia and anemia and/or thrombocytopenia with or without increased blast cells or dysplasia).\n\n【7】删除图片描述:<u>Organ damage may occur in **HES** irrespective of the underlying subtype of HE due to the increased production and/or persistent accumulation of eosinophils in tissue. The skin, lungs, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, heart, and nervous system are the most commonly involved organ systems, although all organ systems may be susceptible to eosinophilia. Endomyocardial thrombosis and fibrosis are often documented in primary (neoplastic) **HES** variants (**HESn**), particularly in association with the **FIP1L1::PDGFRA** fusion gene.

With larger lesions or cysts containing septal nodules being more likely to be malignant than smaller ones, or than septated cysts without nodularity.\n\n【1】In an attempt to decrease the number of benign cysts classified as a Bosniak III, the v2019 has attempted to better define the characteristics of this category and has removed the requirement that all cystic masses with \"measurable enhancement\" be included as either a Bosniak III or IV. Consequently, the v2019 classification now defines Bosniak III cysts as: 1) cysts with one or more enhancing thickened septa/wall (≥4 mm width); and/or 2) cysts with one or more irregular wall or septa (displaying ≤3 mm obtusely margined convex protrusion = perpendicular axis). The clinical impact of these modifications remains to be properly evaluated. According to a report for Tse et al., the prevalence of malignancy for v2019 Bosniak III cysts was 60%. The prevalence varied according to subclasses. For examples, thick wall/septa Bosniak III cysts had a malignancy rate of 49%, while the rate was 76% for Bosniak III cysts displaying nodule(s) with obtuse margin or protrusion.\n\n【2】### Bosniak Category IV\nAccording to the original classification, category IV cysts may have similar characteristics to those classified as category III. They usually demonstrate wall thickening and/or gross and nodular thickened septa, but a solid contrast-enhancing component is also observed adjacent to the cyst wall or septa. The v2019 classification has only made small modifications to this category, as it defines Bosniak IV cysts as cysts with a nodular component of any size if the margins of protrusion are acute, or a nodular component ≥4 mm if the margins of protrusion are obtuse (perpendicular axis).\n\n【3】Lesions in this category should be considered malignant until proven otherwise, with a mean malignancy rate of 89% 删除9:<u>(Table 2)</u>. Here again, the clinical impact of the v2019 classification remains to be properly studied, but Tse et al have reported a slightly higher rate of malignancy among cysts categorized as a IV due to a nodule with acute margins of protrusion compared to Bosniak IV cysts displaying nodule with obtuse ones (87 vs. 76%).\n\n【4】## Intervention and followup\n\n【5】### RECOMMENDATION 4\nFor patients with a Bosniak I or II cyst, followup imaging is not recommended (Strong recommendation, moderate certainty in evidence of effects).\n\n【6】### RECOMMENDATION 5\nFor patients with a Bosniak I or II cyst, intervention is only warranted if the cyst becomes symptomatic (Clinical principle).\n\n【7】### Bosniak Category I\nThis category is composed of simple cysts that are considered benign. One should remember that the natural history of these cysts is that the majority will grow over time and thus, growth should not necessarily be considered a sign of malignancy. Transformation into a more complex cyst is rare and has been reported in only a handful of cases. Therefore, as this is a rare occurrence, followup imaging is not recommended and intervention is only warranted if the cyst becomes symptomatic (i.e., bleeding, recurrent infection, or pain). Treatment options include percutaneous management (aspiration ± sclerotherapy) or surgery. Percutaneous cyst decompression may also be considered prior to offering definitive treatment as a means to confirm that the source of symptoms are cyst-related.\n\n【8】### Bosniak Category II\nThese minimally complex cysts are also generally considered benign, but there are reports in the literature of category II lesions being malignant 删除9:<u>(Table 2)</u>; however, the literature is thought to overestimate the true risk of malignancy among category II cysts, as the majority were managed conservatively or had features that made them too complex to be categorized as a Bosniak II cyst. Importantly, even if malignant, most behave in a relatively benign fashion. Thus, for patients diagnosed with a properly classified Bosniak II cyst, followup is not suggested. Similar to Bosniak I cysts, intervention is only warranted if the cyst becomes symptomatic. When there is doubt as to their categorization based on imaging characteristics, these lesions should be considered as being Bosniak category IIF lesions and followed accordingly.\n\n【9】### Bosniak Category IIF\n\n【10】### RECOMMENDATION 6\nFor patients with a Bosniak IIF cyst, a followup every 6–12 months is suggested for the first year, and then yearly if the cyst is stable (Expert opinion).\n\n【11】### RECOMMENDATION 7\nFor patients with a Bosniak IIF cyst that do not demonstrate progression on imaging, a followup of five years is suggested (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty in evidence of effects).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 7, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/2023 CAU指南：囊性肾脏病变的管理（更新版）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

It should also be noted whether these symptoms occur with lower abdominal pain, dysuria, fecal incontinence, dyspareunia, or other symptoms. In addition, whether the patient requires a pad or protection should also be recorded. The duration of the symptoms and severity of all of these factors as well as the frequency of occurrence of symptoms (i.e., how many times per day or week) should also be recorded (LOE 2, grade 1B).删除17:<u>21</u>\n\n#### 3.1.1.3 | Pelvic and other physical examinations, if needed\n\n【10】Any abnormal anatomy, for example inflammatory changes and/or polyps, bleeding, tumors, or POP, should be recorded. The presence of urogenital atrophy as well as any defects in vaginal skin integrity should be recorded and may need to be treated before any surgical management of SUI is undertaken. Any anatomic evidence of previous urogynecologic surgery and current anatomical conditions or scarring should also be documented. Exteriorized POP may mask SUI, and patients may not report SUI until the POP is reduced (occult SUI). If the patient has lower abdominal pain, a focused physical examination should be performed. The patient’s ability to contract her pelvic floor muscles should be recorded and the efficacy of such contractions (i.e., Oxford score) recorded, as this may have prognostic value regarding the effectiveness of a selected management modality. Anal baseline tone as well as squeeze strength and perineal skin sensory tests should also be performed if a neurogenic bladder is suspected (LOE 2, grade 1B).删除17:<u>21</u>\n\n#### 3.1.1.4 | Stress test\n\n【12】If the patient has symptoms of SUI, a cough stress test should be performed. The test can be performed in an office setting during a pelvic examination. Urine leakage on coughing or during a Valsalva maneuver, in a lithotomy position or standing, is considered to be a positive test. It is best to perform the cough stress test with a comfortably full bladder. Sensitivity is 83% with a specificity of 90% in diagnosing SUI. If the test is performed immediately after urinating (with a normal PVR) in the lithotomy position and leakage occurs, it correlates highly with ISD, a more severe form of SUI (empty supine stress test) (LOE 2, grade 1B).删除17:<u>23</u>\n\n#### 3.1.1.5 | Measurement of PVR\n\n【14】PVR should be checked in an office setting after the patient has urinated. PVR is considered abnormal if there is >100 mL of urine remaining in patients with prolapse or symptoms of incomplete bladder emptying. There is currently no standard volume of urine retention that is considered abnormal. However, if the PVR is over 100 mL, most experts would consider the definition of urine retention to be met (GP, grade 1D).\n\n#### 3.1.1.6 | Urinary diary\n\n【16】A urinary diary may be a valuable option to assess the patient’s voiding habits and severity of SUI. The patient should keep a daily log of the volume of fluid intake, the volume and frequency of urination, urine leakage events, and the activities associated with urine leakage. For example, the diary should record if the leakage occurs with coughing/sneezing or exercise (SUI), occurs during bedtime (enuresis), or with a strong sense of urinary urgency (urge incontinence) (GP, grade 1D).\n\n#### 3.1.1.7 | Q-tip test\n\n【18】The Q-tip test is a procedure in which a lubricated cotton swab is placed in the urethra at the level of the bladder neck when the patient is in the lithotomy position during a pelvic exam. The patient then performs a strong Valsalva effort and the displacement of the Q-tip from the horizontal plane is measured in degrees. The Q-tip test is used to evaluate urethral hypermobility, which is a condition that influences SUI.

To make clinical recommendations for healthcare practitioners and patients.\n\n【6】**Design** Comprehensive multidisciplinary guideline process funded by the Quality Foundation of the Dutch Federation of Medical Specialists. This process included a development, commentary and authorisation phase. Patients participated in every phase.\n\n【7】**Data sources** Multiple databases and existing guidelines were searched up to May 2019. Information from patients, healthcare providers and other stakeholders were obtained using a digital questionnaire, focus group interview and invitational conference.\n\n【8】**Study eligibility criteria** Studies on both insertional and/or noninsertional Achilles tendinopathy were eligible. Specific eligibility criteria were described per module.\n\n【9】**Data extraction and synthesis** Data were extracted, assessed for certainty of evidence, reviewers extracted data, assessed risk of bias and used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation method, where applicable. Important considerations were: patient values and preferences, costs, acceptability of other stakeholders and feasibility of implementation. Recommendations were made based on the results of the evidence from the literature and these considerations.\n\n【10】**Primary outcome measure** The primary and secondary outcome measures were defined per module and defined based on the input of patients obtained in collaboration with the Netherlands Patient Federation and healthcare providers from different professions.\n\n【11】**Results** Six specific modules were completed: risk factors and primary prevention, diagnosis, imaging, treatment prognosis and secondary prevention for Achilles tendinopathy.\n\n【12】**Summary/conclusion** Our Dutch multidisciplinary guideline on Achilles tendinopathy provides six modules developed according to the standards of the Dutch Federation of Medical Specialists. Evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice are given for risk factors, prevention, diagnosis, imaging, treatment and prognosis. This guideline can assist healthcare providers and patients in clinical practice.\n\n【13】## GENERAL INTRODUCTION\n\n【14】**Background to this guideline**  \nSports medicine was finally recognised as a clinical medical specialty in Holland in 2014. Following this recognition, the Dutch Association of Sports Medicine could apply for funding to develop clinical guidelines. This guideline is the result of a successful funding application and was produced according to the official process. This is very similar to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence process in the UK. Achilles tendinopathy was chosen as it is common in clinical practice, seriously impacts patients and there is a significant body of scientific literature on the subject.\n\n【15】An Achilles tendon injury is a frequent problem in both active athletes and inactive individuals. In athletes, this may be caused by the external load being too high and in inactive individuals relative overload may be caused by a very low baseline capacity. In Dutch general practice, Achilles tendon symptoms occur in 2–3 per 1000 adult patients. Runners have a 52% chance (cumulative incidence) of developing Achilles tendinopathy in their life according to the literature. In those with a history of tendinopathy, the risk increases to 44% per year.\n\n【16】The terminology used to describe and diagnose tendon injuries has changed in recent decades. According to the current consensus, local pain in a tendon in association with tendon-loading activities is referred to as ‘tendinopathy’. The use of clear unambiguous terminology is important because it ensures clear communication between healthcare providers and reduces the risk of confusing patients.\n\n【17】The exact pathophysiology of Achilles tendinopathy is still unknown; it is thought to have a multifactorial origin. A better understanding of risk factors can help develop more effective (preventive) interventions.\n\n【18】The diagnosis of Achilles tendinopathy is usually made using clinical findings. The exact diagnostic criteria are not sufficiently described. The role of imaging in making a diagnosis is also not agreed on. In addition, there are a number of systemic conditions that should be considered in patients with pain in the Achilles tendon region. Recognition of these disorders by healthcare providers is important, as this strongly affects treatment and prognosis.\n\n【19】Imaging is frequently used in patients with Achilles tendon complaints. X-rays, ultrasound and MRI scans have prominent roles in imaging. In clinical practice, prognostic value is often attributed to the findings in imaging. On the other hand, imaging can have negative effects through radiation...", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 1, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/【骨科领域】2021+荷兰多学科指南：跟腱病(1).pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

What is the role of cfDNA testing in the context of genomic profiling upfront and at disease progression on EGFR TKI therapy?\n\n【1】**STATEMENT:** cfDNA testing is of value and recommended, if no tissue is available, to identify the *EGFR* alterations and some resistance mechanisms, both in primary diagnostic and resistance setting [I,A].\n\n【2】**DISCUSSION:** In patients with suspected NSCLC, a biopsy sample is essential for histological diagnosis and evaluation of biomarkers. If the tissue sample is not sufficient, inadequate or missing, cfDNA analysis represents a possible alternative for the evaluation of *EGFR* mutations. Technologies capable of identifying all *EGFR* mutations in exons 18-21 should be used for cfDNA analysis. Any negative results should be interpreted with caution due to the possibility of false negatives determined by the limited sensitivity of the cfDNA test. In fact, about 25% of NSCLC patients are defined \"non-shedder\", as their tumors release low amounts of DNA, below the sensitivity limits of currently available technologies. In patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC progressing after TKI treatment, cfDNA testing can identify mechanisms of resistance. In particular, in patients progressing on 1st or 2nd generation TKIs the identification of the p.T790M variant might suggest sensitivity to 3rd generation TKIs. EGFR mutant patients recurring on TKI treatment usually maintain the sensitizing mutation. As a consequence, in those cases in which both the sensitizing and the resistance mutations are not detected, are likely to have too low levels of cfDNA in plasma and they should be considered as non-informative, rather than negative. A low variant/allelic frequency (VAF) of the sensitizing EGFR mutation is also associated with a high rate of false negative T790M test. Therefore, in patients with negative or low VAF EGFR sensitizing mutation, a tissue biopsy is recommended.\n\n【3】cfDNA analysis offers a potential advantage over tissue analysis in better representing the tumor heterogeneity typical of progressive disease. However, some resistance mechanisms to EGFR TKI, including small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) transformation, squamous-cell transformation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), can only be identified through tissue analysis. – while MET amplification and oncogenic fusion diagnostic remains challenging using cfDNA. Therefore, cfDNA and tumor tissue analyses provide complementary information on TKI resistance mechanisms.\n\n【4】Increasing evidence suggests that cfDNA testing allows monitoring response to treatment and predicting relapse in EGFR mutant NSCLC patients on treatment with EGFR TKI. However, the clinical utility of an early diagnosis of progression has not yet been demonstrated in randomized clinical trials with adequate cohorts of patients. Therefore, the monitoring of the response to treatment with EGFR TKI should be restricted to clinical trials or cases selected by tumor boards for peculiar clinical-pathological characteristics, such as rare EGFR mutations that may not respond to treatment with TKI.\n\n【5】**Level of consensus:** 90.3% 删除11:<u>(28)</u> agree; 9.7% 删除11:<u>(3)</u> disagree.

The following summary of the 2022 male UI guidelines aims to report a practical, evidence-based, guideline on definitions, pathophysiology, diagnostic workup, and treatment options for men with different forms of UI.\n\n【2】# 2. Evidence acquisition\n\n【3】A comprehensive literature search, limited to the best available evidence and studies published in the English language, was performed. Databases searched included Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Libraries, covering a time frame from May 2017, the previous update cut-off of the EAU UI guidelines to June 删除13:<u>24, 2021</u>删除1:<u>.

After a preliminary search, 663 were excluded: 255 due to being female, animal, child, and duplicates; 49 for being protocols; 106 for being on neurogenic UI; and 253 being abstracts that were off topic.

Definitions and epidemiology\n\n【8】UI is defined as an unintentional loss of urine and has a reported prevalence of 11% in men aged 60–64 yr and 31% in men ≥85 yr of age, and affects up to 32% of men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) 删除12:<u>[8–10]</u>.\n\n【9】UI can further be classified into three types: stress urinary incontinence (SUI), urge urinary incontinence (UUI), and mixed urinary incontinence (MUI). UUI is the most bothersome urinary symptom 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[11]</u></u>, and men value improvement in urge incontinence more than other symptoms 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[12]</u></u>.\n\n【10】The recommendations for the epidemiology and pathophysiology overview of male UI are provided in Table 1.\n\n【11】- **Overflow UI** (urine loss in a small amount in a totally full bladder), postmicturition dribble (urine loss immediately after micturition), nocturnal enuresis (urine loss during sleep), and total incontinence (full inability of the bladder to store any urine) are specific forms of UI that are outside the current scope of this publication.\n\n【12】The increasing prevalence of all male UI by age is related to the impact of UUI rather than SUI. Very few studies have included a specific focus on UUI.\n\n【13】## 3.2. Pathophysiology\n\n【14】Male UI is mediated by two anatomically separate units: the internal urethral sphincter (IUS) and the external urethral sphincter (EUS) 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[3,16]</u></u>. Physiological male urinary continence depends on the integrity of IUS and/or IUS, the supporting structures, and neural innervation. The EUS is the most important element in male continence. Since men without IUS can still retain urinary continence, damage to the support mechanism, injury to the pelvic nerve, and detrusor overactivity can all contribute to male UI 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[17]</u></u>.\n\n【15】The main risk factors for male UI include advanced age, immobility, urinary tract infections (UTIs), diabetes, cognitive impairment, and neurological disease 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[10,17]</u></u>.\n\n【16】## 3.3. Diagnostic evaluation\n\n【17】Medical history and physical examination of males with UI are the same as for male LUTS, and should allow UI to be categorised into SUI, UUI, or MUI, and to identify other types of UI (overflow UI and nocturnal enuresis) or those that need rapid referral to an appropriate specialist (eg, pelvic diseases and neurological conditions). The history should include details of the type, timing, and severity of UI; associated voiding; and other urinary symptoms. A physical examination should include an abdominal examination, to detect an enlarged bladder or other abdominal mass, as well as a perineal and digital rectal examination.\n\n【18】Specific validated questionnaires can help quantify UI severity.

Excessively high or inappropriately low concentrations of sclerosants may be implicated in the pathogenesis of TM. Failure to occlude adjoining or underlying ‘feeding’ veins can result in partial closure of target vessels, phlebitis, concurrent pigmentation and TM. Further treatments  \nIn patients with post-sclerotherapy TM, the option of ‘No further sclerotherapy treatment’ should be discussed and the option of seeking a second opinion and referral to another practitioner for alternative treatment options should be considered. ‘No treatment’ option as a treatment option  \nTM can look worse than the telangiectases for which the patient is seeking treatment. The cohort of patients who seek treatment for cosmetic indications and in particular patients with CEAP-C1 or C2 CVD should be counselled on the risk of TM and other relevant cosmetic complications of sclerotherapy. It is important to emphasise that TM can result in worsening of the cosmetic appearance of the affected leg with TM potentially looking worse than the initial telangiectases for which they sought treatment.  \nPatients predisposed to matting, those with matting from a previous venous intervention, are at high risk of developing TM. These patients and those unwilling to accept the risk of TM should be given the option of having no sclerotherapy treatment or seek other appropriate or emerging treatment options 删除9:<u>(see below)</u>. Referral to other practitioners for alternative treatment options  \nPatients with post-sclerotherapy TM may benefit from referral to practitioners offering emerging or alternative treatment options. Concurrent administration of paravenous tumescent anaesthesia and prophylactic management of hypersensitivity and bleeding tendencies and alternate treatment strategies such as cryo-assisted laser and cryo-assisted sclerotherapy (CLACS) are emerging techniques and strategies that may play a role in preventing TM.  \nTechnique optimisation strategies  \nTechnique optimisation and modification strategies should be employed if sclerotherapy is to be performed on patients with a history of matting. Using the same sclerosant at the same concentration and following the same procedural methods that led to the previous complication should be avoided. Underlying reflux in truncal veins and tributaries should be treated first before the telangiectases are treated. Careful ultrasound guidance is required to identify and treat relevant ‘feeding’ tributaries communicating with the target telangiectases. At times, access to a high frequency ultrasound and identification of feeding vessels associated with the region of TM may be all that is needed to treat the existing matting and prevent future events.\n\n【2】### Pigmentation\nPost-sclerotherapy pigmentation (PSP) is the appearance of increased pigmentation along the course of veins treated with sclerotherapy. The published incidence of PSP ranges from 5 to 30%. PSP is predominantly due to dermal haemosiderin deposition secondary to lysis of erythrocytes by detergent sclerosants. In addition to haemosiderin, concurrent post-sclerotherapy phlebitis can result in post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation and melanin deposition.\n\n【3】#### Patient-related risk factors\n(i) High serum ferritin  \nPatient-related factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of PSP. Thibault reported that elevated ferritin levels increase the risk of PSP. Patients with a history of iron-storage disorders such as haemochromatosis or porphyrias should be assessed and warned of an increased risk of pigmentation. In such patients, serum ferritin levels should be obtained and if elevated, measures to reduce elevated ferritin levels should be considered. A haematological assessment is required to discuss treatment options such as phlebotomy.

Although beneficial effects of radioiodine are undisputed in high-risk patients, controversy remains in intermediate-risk and some low-risk patients. Since the last consensus on post-surgical use of RAI in DTC patients, new retrospective data and results of prospective randomized trials have been published, which have allowed the development of a new European Thyroid Association (ETA) statement for the indications of post-surgical RAI therapy in DTC. Questions about which patients are candidates for RAI therapy, which activities of RAI can be used, and which modalities of pre-treatment patient preparation should be used are addressed in the present guidelines.\n\n【6】## Introduction\n\n【7】Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) accounts for more than 90% of all thyroid cancers. Over the last decades, an increasing incidence of DTC, mainly due to cancers of papillary histology, has been reported in many countries in- and outside of Europe 删除11:<u>(1, 2)</u>. This increase is largely attributable to a better detection of small papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC), as a result of screening bias (non-selective use of neck ultrasound and fine needle aspiration cytology) 删除11:<u>(3)</u>. Thus, about 70-80% of thyroid carcinomas detected nowadays have PTC with an excellent long-term prognosis for whom overtreatment should be avoided.\n\n【8】Unfortunately, for many years the management of thyroid cancer has been based on retrospective studies which may be biased in many respects.

This evidence includes studies on misapplication of the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline 删除11:<u>(66)</u>, benefits and risks of different tapering strategies and rapid tapering associated with patient harm 删除11:<u>(68,71–73)</u>, challenges in patient access to opioids 删除11:<u>(6)</u>, patient abandonment and abrupt discontinuation of opioids 删除11:<u>(71)</u>, a seminal randomized clinical trial comparing prescription opioids to nonopioid medications on long-term pain outcomes 删除11:<u>(74)</u>, the association of characteristics of initial opioid prescriptions with subsequent likelihood for long-term opioid use 删除11:<u>(75,76)</u>, and the small proportion of opioids used by patients compared with the amount prescribed to them for postoperative pain 删除11:<u>(77–79)</u>.\n\n【2】Opioid medications remain a common treatment for pain despite efforts by patients and providers to reduce prescriptions after surgery. The prevalence of prescription opioid misuse has declined during the past decade, and the mortality rate from opioid overdoses related to pain reliever medications has also declined in recent years. In 2019, among persons aged ≥12 years in the United States, 9.7 million reported misuse of prescription opioids during the past year 删除19:<u>(a decrease from 12.5 million in 2015)</u>, and 1.4 million met criteria for a past-year prescription opioid use disorder 删除19:<u>(a decrease from 2.0 million in 2015)</u> 删除11:<u>(85)</u>. However, in 2020, prescription opioids remained the most commonly misused prescription drug in the United States 删除11:<u>(51)</u>. Also in 2020, among those reporting misuse during the past year, 64.6% reported the main reason for their most recent misuse was to “relieve physical pain” compared with 11.3% to “feel good or get high” and 2.3% “because I am hooked or have to have it” 删除11:<u>(51)</u>. Taken together, these factors underscore the need for an updated clinical practice guideline on appropriate opioid prescribing for pain and pain management.\n\n【3】This clinical practice guideline expands and updates the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline to provide evidence-based recommendations for prescribing opioid pain medication for acute, subacute, and chronic pain for outpatients aged ≥18 years, excluding pain management related to sickle cell disease, cancer-related pain treatment, palliative care, and end-of-life care (Boxes 1 and 2). Lessons learned from the development of the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline informed the process used to generate this update. This update leverages new data to expand content on prescription opioids for acute and subacute pain throughout the recommendations. Importantly, the update also aims to clearly delineate recommendations that apply to patients who are being considered for initial treatment with prescription opioids and patients who have been receiving opioids as part of their ongoing pain management.\n\n【4】CDC developed a draft clinical practice guideline on the basis of five systematic reviews of the best-available evidence on the benefits and risks of prescription opioids, nonopioid pharmacologic treatments, and nonpharmacologic treatments. The draft clinical practice guideline was reviewed by an independent federal advisory committee (the Board of Scientific Counselors of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control), peer reviewers, and the public. Additional insights from patients, caregivers, and clinicians shared during virtual conversations held in 2020 were incorporated in the update. Importantly, to discourage the misapplication of opioid pain medication dosage thresholds as inflexible standards, revised recommendation statement language emphasizes principles such as avoiding increasing dosage above levels likely to yield diminishing returns in benefits relative to risks to patients. More-specific considerations related to dosage have been moved to implementation considerations that follow each recommendation statement, where more nuance is offered to inform clinical decision-making and individualized patient care.\n\n【5】This clinical practice guideline provides recommendations but does not replace clinical judgment and individualized, patient-centered decision-making. The recommendations are based on emerging evidence, including observational studies or randomized clinical trials with notable limitations; thus, they should be considered in the context of the clinician-patient relationship built on shared understanding and a whole-person approach that considers such factors as the patient’s physical and psychological functioning, support needs, expected health outcomes and well-being, home environment, and home and work responsibilities. Flexibility for clinicians and patients is paramount when making patient-centered clinical treatment decisions.

The most important symptoms include pain and infertility.\n\n【8】### STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION:\nThe guideline was developed according to the structured methodology for development of ESHRE guidelines. After formulation of key questions by a group of experts, literature searches and assessments were performed. Papers published up to 1 December 2020 and written in English were included in the literature review.\n\n【9】### PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS:\nBased on the collected evidence, recommendations were formulated and discussed within specialist subgroups and then presented to the core guideline development group (GDG) until consensus was reached. A stakeholder review was organized after finalization of the draft. The final version was approved by the GDG and the ESHRE Executive Committee.\n\n【10】### MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE:\nThis guideline aims to help clinicians to apply best care for women with endometriosis. Although studies mostly focus on women of reproductive age, the guideline also addresses endometriosis in adolescents and postmenopausal women. The guideline outlines the diagnostic process for endometriosis, which challenges laparoscopy and histology as gold standard diagnostic tests. The options for treatment of endometriosis-associated pain symptoms include analgesics, medical treatments and surgery. Non-pharmacological treatments are also discussed. For management of endometriosis-associated infertility, surgical treatment and/or medically assisted reproduction are feasible. While most of the more recent studies confirm previous ESHRE recommendations, there are five...", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 1, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/ESHRE：子宫内膜异位症指南（2022）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

A 2022 retrospective analysis of 172 enteroscopies in 129 patients with Lynch syndrome showed that push enteroscopy identified distal duodenal or jejunal adenomatous polyps that would not have been identified by standard EGD screening in 1.2% of procedures. Push enteroscopy can be considered in place of EGD to enhance small bowel visualization, although the yield of push enteroscopy over EGD in LS remains uncertain. Individuals not undergoing upper endoscopic surveillance should have one-time noninvasive testing for $H. \\,pylori$ at the time of LS diagnosis, with treatment indicated if $H. \\,pylori$ is detected. The value of eradication for the prevention of gastric cancer in LS is unknown. There are limited available data on upper GI cancer risk in $PMS2$-associated Lynch syndrome, and upper GI surveillance described above for $MLH1, \\,MSH2, \\,MSH6,$ and $EPCAM$ P/L variants may be considered at the physician’s discretion in individuals carrying a $PMS2$ P/LP variant.\n\n【2】Risk for urothelial cancer in patients with Lynch syndrome varies and ranges from less than 1% to 18%, with greater risk among carriers of $MSH2$ P/LP variants (ranging from 2%–18%), relative to $MLH1$ (ranging from 0.2%–5%) and $MSH6$ (ranging from 0.7%–7%) P/LP variant carriers. There is insufficient evidence to recommend a particular surveillance strategy, but surveillance may be considered in selected individuals—including those with a family history of urothelial cancer or individuals with $MSH2$ pathogenic variants (especially males), as they appear to be at higher risk. These groups may benefit from annual urinalysis starting at age 30 to 35 years.\n\n【3】Risk for pancreatic cancer and brain cancer is also elevated in Lynch syndrome. Although there are limited data on pancreatic risk in $MSH2$ and $MSH6$ carriers, the panel recommends that patients with Lynch syndrome with a P/LP variant in $MLH1, \\,MSH2,$ or $MSH6$ begin screening for pancreatic cancer at age 50, or 10 years younger than the earliest familial exocrine pancreatic cancer diagnosis, whichever is earlier, for individuals with exocrine pancreatic cancer in $≥1$ first- or second-degree relatives from the same family side as the identified pathogenic germline variant. The International Cancer of the Pancreas Screening (CAPS) Consortium recommends that patients with Lynch syndrome due to a P/LP variant in $MLH1, \\,MSH2,$ and $MSH6$ and one first-degree relative with pancreatic cancer should be considered for screening. $PMS2$ carriers have not been shown to be at increased risk for pancreatic cancer. If screening is performed for pancreatic cancer, the panel recommends that it should be considered at high-volume centers with multidisciplinary teams, and only following in-depth discussions surrounding screening limitations including cost, incidence of abnormalities, and uncertainties about potential benefits of screening. Patients should be educated regarding signs and symptoms of neurologic cancer and the importance of prompt reporting of abnormal symptoms to their physicians.\n\n【4】The panel has concluded that there is not an increased risk for prostate cancer in individuals with Lynch syndrome, though prostate cancer risk in individuals with Lynch syndrome is not expected to be lower than that for the general population. Though the panel found insufficient evidence to conclude increased risk for prostate cancer in Lynch syndrome, they did recognize some studies have shown increased risk, such as one study showing a cumulative lifetime risk estimate as high as 23.8% for carriers of a $MSH2$ P/LP variant. Patients with Lynch syndrome should consider their risk based on the Lynch syndrome gene and family history of prostate cancer删除1:<u>.

The Consensus Group subsequently revised, expanded, and consolidated the statements, ultimately providing 11 statements to start the Delphi process. The Summary Statements were then posted online for voting and feedback to guide refinement. The respondents were asked to choose one of the following for each statement: agree strongly (A+), agree with minor reservation (A), agree with major reservation (A−), disagree with major reservation (D−), disagree with minor reservation (D), or disagree strongly (D+). Participants voted on statements, assessments were made on the basis of the participants’ comments, and judgments were informed of the supporting evidence. We defined consensus as 80% of respondents strongly agree (A+) or agree with minor reservation (A). When agreement was not reached, we rephrased the statement to see if this would provoke stronger agreement. If no strong agreement was reached after at least two rounds of voting, it was eliminated. We electronically collected conflicts of interest declarations at each stage of the voting process. This study is a secondary analysis of published work and did not involve human subjects or interventions; therefore, it did not require ethics committee review. However, the study was overseen by the ISDE and was subject to the review of ISDE’s guidelines committee. This document received the endorsement of the European Society for Diseases of the Esophagus (ESDE).\n\n【2】### Literature search strategy\n\n【3】Keywords identified from the clinical questions were used to construct literature searches in electronic databases. For the systematic literature search, MEDLINE, EMBASE, EMBASE Classic, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to 31st July 2023 to identify relevant literature for each PICO question. To identify potentially eligible studies published only in abstract form, conference proceedings (Digestive Disease Week, American College of Gastroenterology, and United European Gastroenterology Week) from 2000 until 31st July 2023 were also searched. There were no language restrictions. We screened titles and abstracts of all citations identified by our search for potential suitability and retrieved those that appeared relevant to examine them in more detail. Foreign language papers were translated. A recursive search of the literature was performed using bibliographies of all relevant studies. The references cited in this manuscript represent only a selection of the articles reviewed in each area and were selected to clarify the discussion.\n\n【4】### RESULTS\n\n【5】The literature search yielded 11,435 studies. After screening of title and abstract, 121 were found to be potentially relevant to the study questions. After full-text evaluation, 61 were considered for the preparation of the guideline . The overall quality of evidence related to all the statements varied from very low to moderate. At the final round of consensus voting, consensus (i.e. agreement ≥ 80%) was achieved on ten out of 11 statements, while one statement was not accepted (agreement 72.7%). Ten statements were finally selected, on the basis of the agreement level and clinical relevance, which represent an evidence and experience-based consensus of the ISDE on the preoperative gastro-esophageal diagnostic workup before bariatric surgery or endoscopic treatment for obesity 删除9:<u>(Table 1)</u>.\n\n【6】### STATEMENTS\n\n【7】1. **Preoperative esophagogastroduodenoscopy should be considered in all patients planning to undergo bariatric surgery.**\n\n【8】**Agree**: 90.9% [D + (0%); D (9.1%); D− (0%); A− (0%); A (9.1%); A + (81.8%)].\n    **Conditional Recommendation—Low Quality Evidence**\n\n【9】**Summary of evidence:**\n    Upper endoscopy is usually performed to exclude organic disease from the upper gastrointestinal tract or to identify benign diseases requiring medical or other treatments.

Key cost drivers were human resources (the provision of training to teachers) and the drug used, with intervention costs varying substantially based on the selected regimen. In Mali, the cost of delivering one course of SP+AS was US$ 2.72 per child, which decreased to US$ 1.00 per child for SP+AQ 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[127]</u></u>. Modelling of IPTsc costs in Kenya estimated the intervention cost to be US$ 1.88 per child treated per year, with US$ 0.25 per child in set-up costs and US$ 1.63 per child in recurrent costs.\n\n【6】The modelled cost-effectiveness of IPTsc in Kenya was US$ 5.36 per P. falciparum infection averted and US$ 29.84 per case of anaemia averted 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[128]</u></u>. The largest drivers of cost-effectiveness were the effectiveness of the intervention and the prevalence of anaemia.\n\n【7】The GDG determined that the resources required to implement IPTsc varied, and the certainty of the evidence on the resources required was low. The GDG concluded that IPTsc is probably a cost-effective intervention, and if existing health interventions are being delivered through schools, integrating IPTsc could yield some cost savings. The overall effectiveness of IPTsc is likely to be influenced by the local malaria epidemiology and age burden of disease: if school children are at high risk during the school term, then the cost-effectiveness of IPTsc is likely to increase.\n\n【8】More information on the evidence can be found in the summary of contextual factors report (Gutman et al *unpublished evidence (b))*.\n\n【9】### Equity\n\n【10】There is very limited data on how a school-based platform for delivery of malaria chemoprevention to children would affect equity and health equality.\n\n【11】The GDG considered the equity of IPTsc to vary, depending on the proportion of children attending school. As those absent from school are more likely to be from lower socioeconomic groups and female, delivering IPTsc solely through schools may affect the equity of the strategy. There is some evidence that the effect of IPTsc on school performance may differ between girls and boys 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[129]</u></u>.\n\n【12】More information on the evidence can be found in the summary of contextual factors report (Gutman et al unpublished evidence (b)).\n\n【13】### Acceptability\n\n【14】Few studies directly assessed the acceptability of IPTsc. Community sensitization was identified as important for improving the acceptability of IPTsc.

Another study, which evaluated IPTsc among other interventions (iron fortification and anthelmintics), delivered two rounds of IPTsc-SP three months apart.

These differences highlight the importance of multidisciplinary management of SSc-ILD, combining expertise across the multifaceted clinical manifestations of SSc.\n\n【2】There are limitations embedded in the Delphi process. There are no standard criteria defining consensus in Delphi studies, and given the breadth of topics investigated with this method, such standardization may not be feasible. Designed to elicit guidance when no strong evidence is available, the process is not statistically rigorous, and when consensus is reached there is no guarantee that it is generalizable or appropriate. Bias may be introduced during panel selection and development of the initial questionnaire. Anonymity, an integral component of the Delphi process, devolves panelists from accountability which allows medical experts to candidly share their opinions; however, this also means that weighting of responses means panelists with relatively less experience may have an impact on consensus disproportionate to their familiarity with the subject matter. In this study, limiting the expert panel to 25 participants to ensure a manageable process may have resulted in missing important perspectives from a larger, more representative population of physicians. Restricting participation to those practicing in the US focused recommendations on those relevant to and feasible within that locale, but limited the capture of global perspectives. Not including patients, pharmacists, payers, and other potential stakeholders (such as physicians practicing in the community) in the panel may have impacted the diversity of opinions impacting all of these recommendations with the Institute for Healthcare Improvement Triple Aim Initiative 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[37]</u></u>.\n\n【3】## Conclusions\n\n【4】This modified Delphi study involving experts in pulmonology and rheumatology facilitated the development of consensus recommendations and a management algorithm for screening, treatment criteria, and the potential role of antifibrotics and TCZ in patients with SSc-ILD in a real-world setting. Pulmonologists and rheumatologists aligned for the majority of recommendations, with some subtle differences in their perspectives on treatment initiation and therapeutic approaches. These differences highlight the importance of collaborative management of patients and the clinical impact of multidisciplinary discussion groups. Findings from this study provide a management algorithm that will be critical for treating patients with SSc-ILD and help expand on the latest guidelines with clinical expertise and consideration of recently published trials in SSc-ILD.\n\n【5】### Abbreviations\n\n| 6MWD | 6-Minute walk distance |\n| --- | --- |\n| CYC | Cyclophosphamide |\n| dcSSc | Diffuse cutaneous SSc |\n| DL<sub>CO</sub> | Diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide |\n| EULAR | European League Against Rheumatism |\n| FVC | Forced vital capacity |\n| HRCT | High-resolution computed tomography |\n| ILD | Interstitial lung disease |\n| IPF | Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis |\n| MMF | Mycophenolate mofetil |\n| mRSS | Modified Rodnan skin score |\n| PFT | Pulmonary function test |\n| PH | Pulmonary hypertension |\n| SD | Standard deviation |\n| SpO<sub>2</sub> | Peripheral capillary oxygen desaturation |\n| SSc | Systemic sclerosis |\n| TCZ | Tocilizumab |\n\n【7】### Supplementary Information\n\n【8】删除图片描述:<u>![13_0.png](13_0.png)</u>\n\n【9】### Acknowledgements\n\n【10】The authors did not receive payment related to the development of this Consensus Statement.

THERE SHOULD BE PATIENT-PROVIDER DISCUSSION FOR SHARED DECISION MAKING.** Recent guidelines issued by the United States and European professional societies have both made a IIb recommendation for LAAC in those with AF and contraindication to long-term OAC. Because the RCTs were designed to demonstrate noninferiority of LAAC to long-term OAC, they enrolled only patients eligible for long-term OAC. The mandate by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to perform LAAC for patients for whom long-term OAC is not appropriate had a limited evidence base at the time of the coverage decision. However, the practice in both the United States and worldwide is to treat patients with LAAC who are suboptimal candidates for long-term OAC. CMS also added requirements applied across a range of new technologies, including obligatory registry enrollment and documentation of evidence-based shared decision making with a nonimplanting physician.

These combined recommendations are intended, on the one hand, to bring the current state of knowledge, including the level of evidence and relevant literature, to the attention of colleagues and, at the same time, to offer clear and comprehensible formulations and salient images optimized for patients. The choice of colors again corresponds to the generally used and internationally understandable traffic light system, i.e. red for agents to be avoided or reduced, green for those that are permitted and blue for general dietary and lifestyle recommendations. For optimal illustration, the structure is again divided into a written part on the front and a pictorial representation with icons (circular form) on the back, using colors identical to the written recommendations. The pictorial representation is also suitable for patients with language barriers. The order of the recommendations has been altered for consideration: the three general recommendations with an emphasis on the importance of weight reduction and maintaining a normal weight range and the general favoring of a healthy diet were placed at the beginning. These are now followed by the four recommendations on foods and stimulants to be avoided or at least limited. Finally, there are the three recommendations of foods that should be promoted because they lower the SUA level.\n\n【2】The level of evidence has increased for five recommendations compared to 2014 due to more recent literature 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[11]</u></u>. For the individual recommendations, evidence levels were tallied as once for 1b (recommendation 8, low-fat dairy products), seven times for 2a/b, and twice for 3 (recommendation 5, seafood and fructose). Paper selection was determined by members of the working group. The recommendations are based on authoritative publications from the available literature, whereby all prospective randomized studies on relevant topics as well as large epidemiological studies with accepted clinical relevance, including available meta-analyses and reviews were included. The hierarchical review process was carried out applying the Oxford GRADE system rules but without a methodological quality assessment for systematic reviews (e.g. assessment tool to assess systematic studies (AMSTAR)). This must be mentioned as a limitation of our work.\n\n【3】As with the initial recommendations from 2014, the focus was placed on practical relevance in order to meet the needs of patients and clinically active colleagues. The recommendations were deliberately not differentiated between gout and hyperuricemia because both patient groups are meant to be addressed here, with the overriding goal of reducing SUA. Instead of the 9 recommendations offered in 2014, there are 10 recommendations in the updated version. Recommendations 3 (DASH diet) and 10 (Montmorency cherries) have been added. Vitamin C administration for gout patients is no longer included due to insufficient data 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[18]</u></u>. Significantly, more recent aspects regarding weight management and the DASH diet have been taken into account here.\n\n【4】Significant results from studies in recent years show that controlled weight loss not only lowers both blood pressure and cardiovascular risk but can also be considered an important factor in lowering SUA levels via adjusted dietary habits, thus reducing the risk of developing gout 删除12:<u>[13–16]</u>. Diet and lifestyle alone cannot cure gout, and this should not be suggested to any patient 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[62]</u></u>. Urate Lowering Therapy (ULT) remains the mainstay of gout therapy, ideally complemented by correspondent changes of the individual lifestyle behaviour. Following the aforementioned recommendations by professional associations, diet and lifestyle recommendations should most certainly be included in the spirit of holistic patient management, alongside prescribed medication 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[63]</u></u>. It is also important to emphasize dose dependency for all foodstuffs, beverages and stimulants mentioned, which is why an essential message is to avoid excess. One goal is to communicate to patients that foods and stimulants that increase SUA levels are not categorically banned forever, but can still be enjoyed, albeit in smaller quantities and less frequently. This is an essential strategy that may increase compliance more readily. In conclusion, the retention of eight of the original nine recommendations is evidence of the solid evidence base already present in the initial publication from 2014. The wealth of evidence on the DASH diet that has been added since the last publication in 2014 has been added in the form of an additional recommendation. Finally, the graphical representation was adapted to reflect inclusion of the new recommendations. The 2014 recommendations have already been translated into 10 languages (English, Arabic, Bulgarian, Chinese, Farsi, Croatian, Serbian, Romanian, Hungarian and Turkish) due to high demand in the field. A translation of the updated recommendations may be considered for the future.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 7, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/痛风和高尿酸血症患者的营养和生活方式建议（2022）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

The committee chose to recommend a concentration of 0.6 mg/ml as this is in line with the effective concentrations used in the available evidence.\n\n【1】The committee also discussed that there are some possible side effects of triamcinolone acetonide injections, for example hypopigmentation (especially in people with darker skin). Because of this, the committee recommended a lower dose than is used for other inflammatory conditions, noting that the recommended dose is small and is less likely to cause side effects.

The data on COVID-19 vaccine immunogenicity are mostly limited to measurement of post-vaccine antibody titers to the viral spike protein. Still, early data have demonstrated blunted antibody responses in patients with solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, particularly patients on active treatment;34-38 data among other immunosuppressed populations also indicate more limited antibody responses.删除17:<u>39</u> Antibody responses are particularly poor among patients with hematologic malignancies, including those receiving monoclonal antibodies targeting CD20 and CD38 (eg, rituximab, daratumumab, isatuximab). Antibody responses should be interpreted with caution, as they are only a surrogate marker for vaccine protection. Some studies have demonstrated additional T-cell responses to vaccination,40 although the strength and duration of neutralizing antibody responses or cellular immunity are not known at this point. Importantly, outcomes data (eg, COVID-19 disease, hospitalization, death) among fully vaccinated patients with cancer are not available.\n\n【3】There are no safety signals that suggest adverse events specifically among patients with cancer receiving currently available COVID-19 vaccines, although rare case reports have been reported in cancer populations.删除17:<u>41</u> Current SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines (eg, Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna) do not contain live virus and do not pose an immediate safety risk for immunosuppressed patients. The available single-dose SARS-CoV-2 viral vector (Adenovirus-type 26 [AdV-type 26]) vaccine (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson) is safe for use in immunosuppressed hosts, as the adenovirus vector has been modified to make it replication incompetent.删除17:<u>21</u> Although other vaccines are currently available in other parts of the world (eg, AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, Sputnik [AdV-type 26, AdV-type 5 vaccine], Covaxin [killed whole virus vaccine with adjuvant], Sinovac [killed whole virus vaccine]), they are not currently available for use in the United States.\n\n【4】All three available vaccines (in the United States) have been shown to be safe in the general population, although post-vaccination arm soreness, fatigue, fever, and headache, among other side effects are not uncommon.删除17:<u>17-19</u> Short-term safety of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer/BioNTech) mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in patients with cancer treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors has been reported.删除17:<u>33</u> Anaphylaxis has been reported with both mRNA vaccines, although incidence is very low, ranging from 2.5 to 4.9 cases per million doses administered22; severe allergic responses have also been reported with the AdV-type 26 vector vaccine.\n\n【5】Although more data are required to evaluate the safety of COVID-19 vaccination in patients with cancer, including those receiving immunotherapy, targeted regimens, and investigational therapies, the results so far show an acceptable safety profile of COVID-19 vaccination.\n\n【6】### Post-vaccine thrombosis:\n\n【7】The available single-dose SARS-CoV-2 viral vector (AdV-type 26) vaccine (Janssen/Johnson & Johnson) has been associated with an exceedingly rare risk of thrombosis with low platelets after vaccination (Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia syndrome [TTS]); similar findings have been linked to the Astra-Zeneca (AdV-type 26) vaccine.删除17:<u>42</u> The mechanism that causes TTS is not fully understood. To date there have been no associations between TTS and patients with cancer, but patients who have a history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and/or thrombosis should be counseled to receive another vaccine.\n\n【8】### Post-vaccine lymphadenopathy and imaging studies in patients with cancer:\n\n【9】Reactive lymphadenopathy has been reported in up to 16% of patients following COVID-19 vaccination with the mRNA", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 6, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/SICP_SIRM：先天性心脏病的心血管磁共振和CT检查的共识建议第1部分（2022）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Transabdominal scanning is the standard except in very early gestation. Curvilinear probes are the most frequently used type of transducer given the wide near-field view and near parallel ultrasound beams; these transducers are specifically designed for transabdominal scanning and preferred for the fetal cardiac examination, although linear and sector transducers may be used. The transducer frequency range should be 2 to 7 MHz for late second- and third-trimester scans, while a transducer with a frequency range of 5 to 12 MHz may be useful for late first-trimester and early second-trimester scans. Technological capabilities should include two-dimensional (2D; B-mode), M-mode, color flow and pulsed-wave (PW) Doppler ultrasound as minimum requirements. Continuous-wave (CW) Doppler ultrasound may be used to characterize high flow velocities if available. Settings such as frequency, harmonics, sector width, and depth should be adjustable to maximize frame rate and lateral resolution at the necessary depth.\n\n【4】### Storage删除1:<u>\nThe following is adapted from the AIUM practice parameter for documentation of an ultrasound examination 删除21:<u>^28</u> and Intersocietal Accreditation Commission standards and guidelines for pediatric echocardiography accreditation (published June 1, 2017, revised April 删除13:<u>27, 2018</u>; [https://intersocietal.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/IACPediatricEchocardiographyStandards2017.pdf]).</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 5, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/2023 ASE指南建议：胎儿超声心动图的表现（更新）(1).pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Rituximab as well as ibrutinib may be used in combination with high-dose methotrexate retreatment. Several other regimens, including ibrutinib, rituximab, TMZ with or without rituximab, lenalidomide with or without rituximab, high-dose cytarabine, pomalidomide, and pemetrexed have also shown activity in the relapsed/refractory disease setting, but none has been established as a standard of care.\n\n【1】### Radiation Therapy\n\n【2】Historically, WBRT was the treatment standard to cover the multifocal nature of the disease. The majority of studies demonstrated the limitation of high-dose RT and led to the recommended dose of 24 to 36 Gy in 1.8 to 2.0 Gy fractions to the whole brain, without a boost. Although RT alone is useful for initial tumor control, frequent and rapid relapse of the disease led to a short OS of 12 to 17 months. This dismal outcome has prompted the addition of pre-irradiation methotrexate-based combination chemotherapy in later studies. This approach yields impressive response rates of up to 94% and improved OS ranging from 33 to 60 months. However, excessive grade 3 and 4 hematologic toxicity (≤78%) as well as RT-induced delayed neurotoxicity (≤32%) sometimes leading to deaths are primary concerns, although most of these studies utilized a high RT dose of greater than or equal to 40 Gy. Of note, younger patients (aged <60 years) consistently fare better, and there is a higher incidence of late neurotoxic effects in older patients, but significant neurotoxicity can also occur in younger adults.\n\n【3】Thiel and colleagues conducted a randomized, phase III, non-inferiority trial of high-dose methotrexate plus ifosfamide with or without WBRT in 318 patients with PCNSL. There was no difference in OS (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.80–1.40; _P_ = .71), but the primary hypothesis (0.9 non-inferiority margin) was not proven. Patients who received WBRT had a higher rate of neurotoxicity than those who did not (49% vs. 26%). The panel currently recommends that patients receiving WBRT because they are not candidates for chemotherapy should receive a dose of 24 to 36 Gy with a boost to gross disease, for a total dose of 45 Gy.\n\n【4】Although WBRT alone is seldom sufficient as primary treatment and is primarily reserved for patients who cannot tolerate multimodal treatment, it may be a reasonable treatment option for patients not suitable for other systemic therapies or clinical trials. Results from a phase II trial showed that reduced-dose WBRT (23.4 Gy in 1.8 Gy/fraction) following a complete response to induction chemotherapy was associated with disease response and long-term control, as well as low neurotoxicity. When administered after chemotherapy failure, WBRT has shown response rates reaching nearly 75%. Median PFS was 9.7 months overall, 57.6 months in patients who had achieved a CR with WBRT, and 9.7 months in patients with a PR. For patients who had a less than complete response to chemotherapy, a dosing schedule consistent with that used for induction treatment may be used, followed by a limited field to gross disease, or focal RT to residual disease.\n\n【5】### NCCN Recommendations\n\n【6】#### Initial Evaluation\n\n【7】Neuroradiologic evaluation is important in the diagnosis of PCNSL and to evaluate the effectiveness of subsequent therapy. With MRI, the tumor is often isointense or hypointense on T1- and T2-weighted images and enhances frequently. In addition, restricted diffusion can be seen in the area of the enhancing abnormality on diffusion-weighted imaging sequences. On a CT scan, PCNSL is usually isodense or hyperdense compared to the brain and enhances in most cases. Hallmark features include a periventricular distribution, ring enhancement, multiple lesions, and a smaller amount of edema than might otherwise be expected from a similar-sized metastatic tumor or glioma.

Estimating harms based on rates of discontinuation due to adverse events was possible in 3 trials, with a higher discontinuation rate in the combination arms than in the placebo arms (21.3% vs 11.8%, respectively) and HR of 1.81.\n\n【1】### Recommendation: In patients with HCC undergoing TACE LRT, the AGA suggests against adjuvant bevacizumab therapy. Conditional recommendation, very low certainty evidence.\n\n【2】The AGA suggests against the use of bevacizumab in conjunction with TACE for the treatment of patients with HCC. The TR identified 2 RCTs with a total of 62 patients randomized to bevacizumab+TACE vs placebo or observation+TACE. The first study randomized 30 CTP A and B participants with HCC undergoing TACE to placebo or bevacizumab (10 mg/kg IV every 14 days, beginning 1 week before TACE); TACE was repeated at weeks 10 and 14. Participants randomized to TACE alone were allowed to crossover after week 16 if they had developed disease progression. Although the primary end point was not survival, the study found no statistically significant difference in median OS between the groups. The crossover permitted limited ability to draw conclusions regarding efficacy. There was evidence of improvements in PFS over a median follow-up of 40 weeks in participants who were randomized to the observation with TACE+bevacizumab group (79%), with HR of 4 (95% CI, 1.4–11.3). Median OS was 61 months in the TACE+observation group and 49 months in the TACE+bevacizumab group. There was a very low overall CoE, based on serious risk of bias and indirectness and very serious risk of imprecision. The authors reported rates of discontinuation due to adverse events, but noted only 1 event in the TACE+bevacizumab arm, and none in the TACE+observation group.\n\n【3】The second study randomized 32 CTP A and B participants to either TACE with doxorubicin or TACE+doxorubicin along with bevacizumab (5 mg/kg IV every 14 days); participants had BCLC A and B disease and were either treatment-naive or had recurrent disease after resection or ablation. The trial was stopped early after finding a worse OS in the combination group compared with the placebo group, with a median survival of 5.3 vs 13.7 months, respectively. There was a substantial increase in harms in the TACE+doxorubicin+bevacizumab group compared with the TACE+doxorubicin group. There were serious concerns regarding the risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision, leading to a very low overall CoE.\n\n【4】### Health Equity Considerations\n\n【5】The TR Panel conducted a search to identify studies that assessed the potential impact of different treatments on health equity and disparities, but no studies were identified. However, due to the significant cost of the drugs evaluated, the Panel agreed that a negative impact on health equity could not be excluded.\n\n【6】### Implementation\n\n【7】Implementation of this guideline may also be facilitated with the use of the accompanying Clinical Decision Support Tool and Spotlight. In addition, a table outlining the mechanism of action, indication, and additional considerations may help improve decision making 删除9:<u>(Table 4)</u>.\n\n【8】### Limitations and Evidence Gaps\n\n【9】In the second-line setting, no high-quality direct comparative evidence is available for either atezolizumab+bevacizumab, sorafenib, or lenvatinib. However, patients who place a high value on the uncertain benefit of these agents as second-line therapies, and a low value on their adverse events, may reasonably select to use either atezolizumab+bevacizumab, sorafenib, or lenvatinib in this setting. Thus, ultimate decisions for treatment selection need to weigh patient preferences as well as risks and benefits. At the present time, there is limited information and few biomarkers to guide patient selection for different regimens; this remains an area of great importance for future research. The lack of significant heterogeneity in the clinical trials were limited to participants who preserved liver function. These were individuals with CTP A cirrhosis with good functional status, as individuals with CTP A PS scores of 1 or less. Patients with CTP C cirrhosis do not have any options for systemic therapy; future research in this area would be of great importance. In addition, the TR examined the question of systemic therapy as an adjuvant treatment and found no evidence to support its use at this time. With more treatments on the horizon, including single-agent and combination regimens, we anticipate the availability of additional options in the near future.\n\n【10】### Summary\n\n【11】The advent of multiple new FDA-approved systemic therapies for HCC brings new hope to patients with advanced disease who are not candidates for curative treatments, such as liver resection, transplantation, and locoregional ablation, as well as noncurative LRTs, such as TACE and TARE. For more than a decade, the oral multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib was the only approved systemic therapy for this patient population. However, in recent years, the IV combination of an anti-angiogenic agent with a checkpoint inhibitor (bevacizumab+atezolizumab) showed a small to moderate survival benefit over sorafenib in the primary treatment setting, increasing therapeutic options for patients. In addition, lenvatinib, another oral multi-kinase inhibitor, showed equivalence to sorafenib for primary treatment of advanced HCC. For second-line treatment of patients who failed sorafenib, multiple regimens, including the oral multi-kinase inhibitors cabozantinib and", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 10, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/AGA：肝细胞癌系统治疗的临床实践指南（2022）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Metastatic disease is present in 15–30% of patients at diagnosis and up to 20–50% of those with initially localized disease eventually develop metastases. Recent scientific knowledge acknowledges that this is a clinically and biologically heterogeneous disease. As treatment options increase, prognosis for individuals with metastatic disease has steadily improved over recent decades. Disease management should be discussed among experienced, multidisciplinary teams to select the most appropriate systemic treatment (chemotherapy and targeted agents) and to integrate surgical or ablative procedures, when indicated. Clinical presentation, tumor sidedness, molecular profile, disease extension, comorbidities, and patient preferences are key factors when designing a customized treatment plan. These guidelines seek to provide succinct recommendations for managing metastatic CRC.\n\n【6】**Keywords** Colorectal cancer · Metastatic disease · Systemic treatment · Guidelines\n\n【7】删除图片描述:<u>![](0_1.png)</u>\n\n【8】Ana Fernández Montes  删除1:<u>\nafml003@hotmail.com  </u>\nVicente Alonso  \nvalonso@salud.aragon.es  \nEnrique Aranda  \nearanda@seom.org  \nElena Eléz  \nmelez@vhio.net; mfornos@vhio.net  \nPilar García Alfonso  删除1:<u>\npgarciaalfonso@gmail.com  </u>\nCristina Grávalos  删除1:<u>\ncgravalos1@gmail.com  </u>\nJoan Maurel  \njmaurel@clinic.cat  \nRuth Vera  \nruth.vera.garcia@cfnavarra.es  \nRosario Vidal  删除1:<u>\nmrosario_vidal@hotmail.com  </u>\nJorge Aparicio  \njapariciou@seom.org\n\n【9】1.

This model was constructed using data from the GWTG-Resuscitation IHCA database. The variables are all categorical and mostly binary (yes/no): age (stratified in four groups within a range from 70 to ≥ 85 years), baseline CPC = 1, major trauma, stroke, nursing facility, medical noncardiac admission, hypotension or hypoperfusion, renal insufficiency/dialysis, respiratory insufficiency, and pneumonia. Of note, this model was not originally created to inform prognostication after cardiac arrest. Instead, the purpose was to select patients who have not suffered cardiac arrest but are at high risk for poor outcome should cardiac arrest occur to permit shared decision-making about a do-not-attempt-resuscitation (DNAR) order 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[156]</u></u>. All variables are therefore available prerearest. Based on the continuous GOFAR score, four categories are identified on the basis of the likelihood of neurologically intact survival: very low (<1%), low (1–3%), average (3–15%), or higher than average (>15%).\n\n【8】Recommendation When counseling family members or surrogates of comatose survivors of IHCA, we suggest the GOFAR clinical prediction model alone not be considered a reliable predictor of poor functional outcome assessed at 3 months or later (weak recommendation; moderate quality evidence).\n\n【9】Rationale All studies evaluated outcome at discharge only and were therefore ineligible to support a recommendation.

It also suggested that ethosuximide may increase the likelihood of remission, which is the main objective of treatment for people with these seizures. The committee agreed that, despite a lack of robust evidence, their expertise and experience supported the use of ethosuximide as first-line treatment for absence seizures. The committee noted that ethosuximide treatment may lead to improved cognitive outcomes and is already well established in clinical practice.\n\n【2】The committee agreed that sodium valproate should be offered as second-line monotherapy or add-on treatment for absence seizures because the evidence suggested that it may increase the likelihood of remission and it appears to be associated with fewer adverse events than other drugs reviewed. The committee acknowledged that sodium valproate should be used with caution in women and girls, only if the risks and benefits have been thoroughly discussed, other treatments are unsuccessful and MHRA safety advice is followed. However, they agreed that sodium valproate should be considered because absence seizures are usually self-limiting, so treatment is likely to be discontinued or an alternative sought if seizures continue beyond puberty.

The SC was responsible for identifying, reviewing, and evaluating the evidence underlying the development of the initial seed statements, modifying these statements based on the Delphi panel vote, and writing the final article.\n\n【2】#### Literature search\n\n【3】The literature search focused on the evidence base for nonpharmacological, nonsurgical interventions for chronic MSK pain. A health sciences librarian, working with the SC, conducted the literature search in two stages. The databases we searched were Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and PubMed/Medline. Because it is unlikely that higher levels of evidence would be found in other databases, but not in these. The search strategy may be accessed in Supplementary Data S1. In addition, we used reference tracking and consulted topic experts on the SC to ensure that relevant articles were not missed.\n\n【4】#### First stage search\n\n【5】To identify a “seed” document or documents on which to base development of the initial set of recommendations, we conducted two searches: 删除11:<u>(1)</u> identify the most recent systematic reviews for nonpharmacological treatment of chronic MSK pain and 删除11:<u>(2)</u> identify CPGs specific to manipulation and manual therapy. We restricted the searches to recent literature rather than doing a comprehensive review, since CPGs should be based on the most current literature, and current systematic reviews were expected to cover earlier studies.\n\n【6】#### Search 1 inclusion criteria\n\n【7】1.

Nonrelevant (e.g., addressed interventions outside the scope of U.S. chiropractors or addressed risk factors, but not interventions; did not address chronic MSK pain).\n2. Addressed only one type of MSK pain as a primary complaint (e.g., only back pain) and/or one type of intervention (e.g., only CBT), to have a comprehen-sive seed document to base our recommendations.\n3. Included in another systematic review.\n\n【10】#### Search 2 inclusion criteria\n\n【11】1. Guidelines related to spinal manipulation and/or manual therapy.\n2. Published 2016–2019.\n3. English language.\n\n【12】#### Exclusion criteria:\n\n【13】1. Nonrelevant (not CPGs; outside chiropractic scope of practice or not related to chronic MSK pain).\n\n【14】Second stage search. First, we drafted preliminary evidence-based recommendations based on the results of the initial search. In cases where recommendations for specific modalities or procedures were absent due to sparse evidence for procedures commonly used in chiropractic practice (as identified by the current Practice Analysis of Chiropractic**), we did a targeted search of the published literature from the date of our preliminary search through 2019. We included guidelines, systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, or outcome cohort studies.\n\n【15】### Evaluation of the quality of the evidence\n\n【16】When we evaluated the quality of the articles identified in our searches, we evaluated them using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research & Evaluation instrument (AGREE) Global Rating Scale 删除9:<u>(Table 1)</u>.删除17:<u>23</u> We evaluated systematic reviews, RCTs, and cohort studies investigating treatments using modified SIGN (Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network) checklists, which have been used in other studies by our team.删除17:<u>24-21</u> The SIGN checklist rates the studies as “high quality, low risk of bias,” “acceptable quality, moderate risk of bias,” “low quality, high risk of bias,” or “unacceptable” quality. See Tables 2-4. for details of scoring. We did not assess the quality of other types of studies, simply identifying their design and categorizing them as “lower level.” At least two investigators read each study and discussed differences in ratings until they reached agreement.\n\n【17】We used the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system to assess the overall quality of the evidence.删除17:<u>25</u> Table 5 summarizes GRADE.

Iron deficiency is common in chronic heart failure (CHF), and is often multifactorial (evidence quality—high, consensus—92%, statement strength—strong).\n32. Parenteral IRT may improve symptoms and quality of life in CHF with FID (evidence quality—moderate, consensus—100%, statement strength—strong).\n33. In the management of iron deficiency associated with CKD or CHF, reference to the appropriate specialist published guidelines is recommended (evidence quality—moderate, consensus—92%, statement strength—strong).\n34. IDA is a common manifestation of IBD, particularly when the disease is active (evidence quality—high, consensus—100%, statement strength—strong).\n35. Intolerance and malabsorption of oral IRT can be particular problems in the treatment of IBD-associated IDA, and parenteral IRT may be required (evidence quality—medium, consensus—100%, statement strength—strong).\n\n【2】Several chronic disorders such as CKD, CHF and IBD are associated with iron deficiency. While the cause of iron deficiency in these conditions is often multifactorial, altered production of hepcidin and ferroportin is thought to be a major contributory factor. Nevertheless, the presence of iron deficiency should be actively sought because IRT may improve patient outcomes.删除17:<u>191</u> The assessment and management of iron deficiency in these conditions do have certain nuances, and consultation with detailed published guidelines is therefore recommended. Similar clinical considerations apply to other inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n【3】**Chronic kidney disease**\nAnaemia is a frequent complication of CKD. CKD is a potential cause for anaemia in anyone with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of less than 60 mL/min/1.73m². As the prevalence of anaemia increases with deteriorating renal function, CKD is especially likely to be the cause of anaemia when the GFR is less than 30 mL/min/1.73m². The investigation and management of anaemia in CKD is a complex area, and readers are advised to consult specific guidelines relevant to UK practice published by NICE and the Renal association for more detailed recommendations.删除17:<u>41 192 193</u>\n\n【4】The causes are anaemia in CKD are multifactorial. Iron deficiency is a major element, but multiple other mechanisms (eg, haemolysis, plasma cell dyscrasias) may also contribute towards the development of anaemia, hence the requirement for detailed haematological investigation. The causes of iron deficiency in CKD are also multifactorial. Renal failure itself contributes, but this may also be compounded by reduced iron intake, reduced iron absorption and blood loss via either the GI tract or other routes such as dialysis and phlebotomy.删除17:<u>194</u>\n\n【5】Assessment of iron deficiency in CKD can be difficult. Measurement of ferritin and transferrin saturation may be helpful, but the interpretation of results is not the same as in patients who do not have CKD. Specifically, absolute iron deficiency in CKD has been defined as transferrin saturation ≤20%, with SF <100 μg/L (in predialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients) or ≤200 μg/L (in haemodialysis patients).删除17:<u>194</u>\n\n【6】Patients with CKD may of course also have GI pathology underlying their confirmed iron deficiency. The decision about the need for endoscopic evaluation of the upper and lower GI tract in CKD can be difficult, and should ideally be made in conjunction with a nephrologist. However, the majority of CKD patients with confirmed IDA warrant GI investigations as long as they are fit enough to undergo these procedures.\n\n【7】The management of iron deficiency in the context of CKD is beyond the scope of these guidelines and is discussed in detail elsewhere.删除17:<u>41 192 193</u> Treatment is usually initiated and monitored by the nephrology team. In brief, oral iron replacement may be tried in patients who are predialysis. However, intravenous IRT is required if this is not tolerated or ineffective, or if dialysis has been commenced. Other treatments for anaemia such as erythropoietin may also be needed, but these should be managed by the nephrology team.\n\n【8】**Chronic heart failure**\nEvidence of some degree of iron deficiency, as defined by an SF <100 μg/L and/or a transferrin saturation of <20%, is found in 40%-70% of cases with CHF.删除17:<u>195–198</u> The causes are again multifactorial with malabsorption, malnutrition and GI blood loss (potentially exacerbated by anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents) all potentially contributing. In addition, the chronic inflammatory state present in many patients with CHF can lead to increased hepcidin release by the liver, resulting in reduced iron absorption/mobilisation.\n\n【9】Patients with CHF should be screened for iron deficiency by measurement of ferritin and transferrin saturation.删除17:<u>195–198</u> Endoscopic evaluation of the upper and lower GI tract should be considered if they have evidence of absolute iron deficiency 删除9:<u>(see the Definitions section)</u> to exclude treatable GI causes. Decisions about the need for and safety of endoscopic evaluation should ideally be made in conjunction with the cardiology team.\n\n【10】The majority however have FID rather than absolute iron deficiency. Nevertheless, both forms of ID are associated with reduced functional capacity, impaired quality of life and poorer prognosis in CHF.删除17:<u>191–194</u> Patients who meet the above criteria for iron deficiency in this condition should therefore be considered for intravenous IRT,135 as this has been shown to have prognostic benefit in meta-analyses.删除17:<u>196 199</u> No prognostic benefit has been demonstrated for oral iron, and this is best avoided as in CHF it may be poorly absorbed due to gut oedema, and is frequently associated with side-effects.删除17:<u>195</u> Specific guidelines should be consulted for detailed recommendations about the investigation and management of iron deficiency in this patient group.删除17:<u>198</u>\n\n【11】**Inflammatory bowel disease**\nA large number of patients with active IBD are estimated to have iron deficiency, though other mechanisms including vitamin B12 and folate deficiency, narrow suppression due to the anaemia of chronic disease, and overt blood loss may all contribute to the anaemic state.删除17:<u>199</u> SF levels of up to 100 μg/L in the presence of inflammation may still reflect iron deficiency,200 and so an estimate of transferrin saturation may be helpful. The absorption of oral iron may be impaired by the systemic inflammatory process,148 201 as well as by small bowel involvement and/or previous surgery, and this may favour intravenous IRT in some cases.删除17:<u>164</u>\n\n【12】Current European guidelines suggest that oral IRT in patients with IBD should contain no more than 100 mg elemental iron a day.删除17:<u>200</u> Intravenous iron is indicated for those who are intolerant of oral iron and have moderate to severe IDA (Hb <100 g/L).删除17:<u>148 164 200</u> Optimising nutritional and pharmacological management to bring active IBD into remission would be expected to help improve IDA metrics and response to iron therapy.删除17:<u>200 201</u>\n\n【13】Snook et al.

All patients with AML are at risk for acute GVHD and management should be based on institutional practice or preference. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) screening for potential HCT candidates is left to institutional policies regarding provision of CMV-negative blood products to patients who are CMV-negative at the time of diagnosis. HLA typing is routinely used in many institutions to select platelet donors for patients who exhibit alloimmunization to HLA-specific antigens.\n\n【2】Standard tumor lysis prophylaxis includes hydration with diuresis, and allopurinol administration or rasburicase treatment. Rasburicase is a genetically engineered recombinant form of urate oxidase enzyme. Rasburicase should be considered as initial treatment in patients with rapidly increasing blast counts, high uric acid, or evidence of impaired renal function. When possible, patients should be evaluated for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, as rasburicase use in these patients is contraindicated and is associated with an increased risk of inducing hemolysis. Urine alkalinization was previously recommended as a means to increase uric acid solubility and reduce the potential for uric acid precipitation in the tubules. However, this method is not generally favored as there are no data to support this practice and similar effects could be seen with saline hydration alone. Alkalinization can complicate care by increasing calcium phosphate deposits in vital organs (eg, kidney, heart) as a result of hyperphosphatemia. Furthermore, in contrast to allopurinol, rasburicase has the added benefit of rapid breakdown of serum uric acid, eliminating the need for urine alkalinization.\n\n【3】Patients who receive HiDAC should be closely monitored for changes in renal function, because renal dysfunction is highly correlated with increased risk of cerebellar toxicity. Patients should be monitored and assessed for nystagmus, dysmetria, slurred speech, and ataxia before each dose of HiDAC; patients exhibiting any neurologic signs should discontinue HiDAC, and all subsequent cytarabine therapy must be administered as standard dose. Patients who develop cerebellar toxicity should not be rechallenged with HiDAC in future treatment cycles. HiDAC should also be discontinued in patients with rapidly rising creatinine caused by tumor lysis.\n\n【4】Decisions regarding the use and choice of antibiotics to prevent and treat infections should be made by the individual institutions based on the prevailing organisms and their drug resistance patterns. Greater detail regarding the prevention and treatment of cancer-related infections can be found in the NCCN supportive care guidelines 删除9:<u>(see NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines for Prevention and Treatment of Cancer-Related Infections)</u> and commensurate with the institutional practice for antibiotic stewardship.\n\n【5】Growth factors (G-CSF or granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF]) are not recommended during induction for patients with APL as they can complicate assessment of response and increase the risk of differentiation syndrome. However, in patients with AML (non-APL), growth factors may be considered during induction for patients who are septic and who have a life-threatening infection in an attempt to shorten the duration of neutropenia. Some regimens such as FLAG incorporate G-CSF into the regimen. However, the use of growth factors may complicate the interpretation of marrow results. There is a recommendation to discontinue colony-stimulating factors at least a week before a planned marrow sample to assess remission status.\n\n【6】There is no evidence for whether growth factors have a positive or negative impact on long-term outcome if used during consolidation.

This is the 2023 International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) evidence-based guideline on offloading interventions to promote healing of foot ulcers in persons with diabetes. It serves as an update of the 2019 IWGDF guideline.\n\n【3】We followed the GRADE approach by devising clinical questions and important outcomes in the PICO (Patient-Intervention-Control-Outcome) format, undertaking a systematic review and meta-analyses, developing summary of judgements tables and writing recommendations and rationales for each question. Each recommendation is based on the evidence found in the systematic review, expert opinion where evidence was not available, and a careful weighing of GRADE summary of judgement items including desirable and undesirable effects, certainty of evidence, patient values, resources required, cost effectiveness, equity, feasibility and acceptability.\n\n【4】For healing a neuropathic plantar forefoot or midfoot ulcer in a person with diabetes, use a non-removable knee-high offloading device as the first-choice offloading intervention. If contraindications or patient intolerance to non-removable offloading exist, consider using a removable knee-high or ankle-high offloading device as the second-choice offloading intervention. If no offloading devices are available, consider using appropriately fitting footwear combined with felted foam as the third-choice offloading intervention. If such non-surgical offloading treatment fails to heal a plantar forefoot ulcer, consider an Achilles tendon lengthening, metatarsal head resection, joint arthroplasty, or metatarsal osteotomy. For healing a neuropathic plantar or apex lesser digit ulcer secondary to flexible toe deformity, use digital flexor tendon tenotomy. For healing rearfoot, non-plantar or ulcers complicated with infection or ischaemia, further recommendations have been outlined. All recommendations have been summarized in an offloading clinical pathway to help facilitate implementation of this guideline into clinical practice.\n\n【5】These offloading guideline recommendations should help healthcare professionals provide the best care and outcomes for persons with diabetes-related foot ulcers and reduce the person’s risk of infection, hospitalisation and amputation.\n\n【6】删除图片描述:<u>![](2_0.png)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 3, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/2023 IWGDF指南：糖尿病足溃疡患者减荷（更新版）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Discordant immunoassay results (e.g., EIA positive, RPR negative, and TPPA negative) were more common for pregnant than nonpregnant persons (71.4% versus 43.5%). This is likely related to the lower prevalence of syphilis among pregnant persons screened compared with nonpregnant persons at higher risk screened. A retrospective study of approximately 100,000 pregnant persons screened with an automated immunoassay found 194 women with discordant immunoassay results; 156 of these women had a reactive Liaison CIA result, nonreactive RPR, and nonreactive TPPA (isolated CIA reactive), and 38 women had a reactive Liaison CIA, nonreactive RPR, and reactive TPPA 删除11:<u>(180)</u>.

A 2007 cross-sectional study of 868 patients with genital ulcer disease indicated that RPR test sensitivity and specificity for patients with HIV infection was 81.8% and 90.6%, respectively, which was comparable to results observed for the cohort without HIV infection 删除11:<u>(181)</u>.

Other studies of populations with varying levels of HIV prevalence found overall sensitivities of 72.5%–85% for serum RPR, 68.8% for CSF RPR, 13.3%–62.5% for CSF VDRL, and 72.6%–91.2% for serum VDRL 删除11:<u>(95,152,163,169,182)</u>.\n\n【4】Although data suggest that nontreponemal (lipodial antigen) test performance sensitivities do not significantly differ between persons living with and without HIV infection, studies have reported increased likelihood of BFP in HIV-positive persons. In studies with sample sizes that ranged from 789 to 300,000, serum testing by VDRL or RPR indicated that the rate of BFP results was 2.5–34.5 times higher among HIV-positive persons than HIV-negative persons 删除11:<u>(67–69,183,184)</u>. These studies were conducted in populations before antiretroviral therapy was widely available or in populations where viral load was not assessed. BFP rates in persons living with HIV infection who are virally suppressed have not been studied.\n\n【5】Treponemal test positivity generally persists after previously treated infection, unless the infection is treated before the secondary stage, as has been previously described in persons without HIV infection.

Structural Heart Disease\n\n【2】### i. Single Ventricles and Assessment for Ductal Dependence\n\n【3】Single ventricle (SV) CHD is often detected on routine ultrasound screening because of the presence of an abnormality in the four-chamber view; most patients are diagnosed before birth. The most common form of SV CHD is HLHS, with an incidence of 0.26 per 1,000 live births. Other forms of SV CHD include hypoplastic right heart syndrome (0.22 per 1,000 live births) and univentricular AV connection, which describes a group of cardiac malformations in which the AV connection is completely or predominantly to a single ventricular chamber and includes double-inlet left ventricle, single inlet (with atresia of the left or right AV valve), and common inlet (AV septal defect with a common ventricle). SV forms of CHD are some of the most complex forms of CHD, all of which require a series of palliative operations ultimately culminating in total cavopulmonary connection (“Fontan”) circulation. In this section, we review common imaging approaches to all forms of SV CHD necessary for the counseling of families about diagnosis and prognosis as well as what imaging information is needed for delivery room and neonatal management.\n\n【4】**General Imaging Approach.** As with fetal echocardiography in structurally normal hearts, visceroatrial situs, systemic venous connections, AV junction, morphology and function of the SV, and fetal heart rate and rhythm should be assessed. A segmental approach to fetal echocardiographic imaging of SV CHD is recommended to identify important associated findings.\n\n【5】**Venous Connections.** Systemic and pulmonary venous connections and atrial situs/morphology should be evaluated, as abnormalities can have implications for counseling regarding outcomes and surgical approach for SV palliation. For systemic veins, evaluation of the IVC for intrahepatic interruption (with the hepatic vein connections directly to the atrium) and the presence of bilateral SVCs should be performed. Pulmonary venous connections should be assessed given that anomalous drainage significantly influences surgical approach and outcomes. For HLHS, pulmonary venous Doppler and is forward/reverse VT ratio is used to detect left atrial hypertension. Some centers use maternal hyperoxygenation testing to assess pulmonary vascular reactivity in the third trimester in the fetuses with HLHS to improve the specificity and sensitivity of predicting need for urgent intervention. Studies have shown that lack of pulmonary vasoreactivity (<10% decline in pulsatility index of the pulmonary artery) is associated with neonatal hemodynamic instability and the need for an urgent intervention to open the atrial septum after birth.\n\n【6】**AV Junctions.** SV CHD may have hypoplastic or atretic tricuspid or mitral valves, or a common AV valve that is unbalanced primarily committed to one ventricle. AV valve size should be measured and the degree of valvular regurgitation assessed by color Doppler. The presence of significant AV valvular regurgitation can affect both fetal well-being and postnatal outcome of SV surgical palliation.\n\n【7】**Ventriculoarterial Junction.** SV lesions can have an array of ventriculoarterial connections and variations in obstruction to either pulmonary or systemic blood flow. It is therefore imperative in the fetus with SV CHD that the outflow(s) be thoroughly imaged, including orientation (normal, transposed, malposed), patency, size, and direction of blood flow. The diameter of the ascending aorta should be measured in patients with aortic stenosis or atresia. Color Doppler imaging of the arches in the 3VV, 删除17:<u>3</u>VT, and sagittal planes is a key retrograde flow in the aortic or ductal arch is perhaps the single most powerful indicator of need for prostaglandin infusion after birth. In fetuses with aortic or pulmonary valve hypoplasia, valve stenosis can progress through gestation, and serial hemodynamic assessment of the valves and great arteries should be obtained.\n\n【8】**Rhythm, Function, and Morphology.** In clinical practice, function is assessed qualitatively, although quantitative measures including fractional shortening, tricuspid and mitral annular plane excursion, and sphericity index have been reported. Myocardial imaging techniques such as strain and strain rate may provide a more quantitative picture of ventricular function but are not currently used routinely in clinical practice. Bradyarrhythmias (e.g., complete heart block or sinus node dysfunction) are associated with left atrial isomerism and discordant AV connections. This combination carries a poor prognosis and high risk for mortality in utero.\n\n【9】# Key Points\n删除图片描述:<u>![](25_1.png)</u>\n\n【10】### ii. Complex AV Connections\n\n【11】Lesions affecting the AV junction may be isolated (although often are associated with aneuploidy, including trisomy 21) or may be exceedingly complex and found in combination with multiple associated defects. The region of the AV junction is referred to as the “crux” of the heart and is the anatomic connection point of the atrial chamber(s) to the ventricles. Normally, the left-sided mitral valve is a bileaflet valve with chordal attachments to two separate papillary muscles on the free wall of the left ventricle. The right-sided TV is slightly more apically displaced with three leaflets and chordal attachments distributed throughout the body of the right ventricle, including the ventricular septal surface. Although the four-chamber view allows optimal visualization of the cardiac crux", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 26, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/2023 ASE指南建议：胎儿超声心动图表现.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Compared with glargine U-100, degludec U-100 may lead to less severe hypoglycemia (moderate effect) and nocturnal hypoglycemia (small effect); Glargine U-300 may lead to less hypoglycemia (large effect) and nocturnal hypoglycemia (large effect), with more patients achieving HbA1c<7.0%. However, when generic degludec U-100 or glargine U-300 is unavailable, both glargine U-300 and degludec U-100 are more expensive than glargine U-100. Thus, it may affect equity and acceptability. Based on eligible evidence and clinical experience, we made the following recommendation.\n\n【11】#### Recommendation 1.2 (Strong Recommendation)\n\n【12】If both ultra-long-acting and long-acting insulin regimens are available, ultra-long-acting insulins (glargine U-300 and degludec U-100) at bedtime injection should be considered to be initiated first depending on acceptability and affordability.\n\n【13】#### Glargine U-300 versus NPH\n\n【14】**Key evidence.** Appendix Table S5: One RCT with 50 patients met our preplanned study section criteria, which was carried out in China.\n\n【15】#### Glargine U-100 versus NPH\n\n【16】**Key evidence.** Appendix Table S5: Twelve RCTs with 4233 patients met our preplanned study section criteria.

The other eight studies were part of a multicenter study carried out in Finland and the United Kingdom, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand and Singapore, the United States, and Canada, European countries.\n\n【17】**Justification.** The overall certainty of the evidence was low. Compared with NPH, glargine U-300 or detemir may result in a large reduction in hypoglycemia and nocturnal hypoglycemia; glargine U-100 may result in an increase in patients achieving HbA1c < 7%, a reduction in hypoglycemia, and a large reduction in nocturnal hypoglycemia. There is no eligible evidence to compare degludec U-100 with NPH. From the indirect evidence (network meta-analyses) between degludec U-100 and glargine U-100, it may be reasonable to conclude that degludec U-100 can lead to better clinical outcomes than NPH overall. We did not find evidence for cost-effectiveness. However, the price of glargine U-300, degludec U-100, glargine U-100, and detemir is more expensive than that of NPH.

MVO is diagnosed with mid-cavitary obliteration and a systolic gradient >30 mm Hg at rest. \n2. Echo with ultrasound enhancing agents or CMR can identify the presence of small apical aneurysms and apical clots. CTA can be used if needed. \n3. MVO is associated with higher risk of ventricular arrhythmias and mortality.\n\n【2】## F. Tissue Characterization\n\n【3】Tissue characterization by CMR plays a critical role in HCM assessment. In addition to the established role of LGE in risk stratification and prognostication in HCM , CMR provides additional techniques that can aid in tissue characterization such as T1 mapping. T1 relaxation time is measured for each individual pixel of the myocardium and extracellular volume fraction (ECV) is calculated based on the comparison of native T1 values with those obtained following gadolinium-chelate contrast agents, allowing for further tissue characterization and the detection of diffuse interstitial expansion. Increased native T1 times have been shown to correlate with areas of increased wall thickness and LGE in HCM. Moreover, T1 mapping and ECV can help differentiate HCM from hypertensive heart disease, athlete’s heart, Fabry disease, and cardiac amyloidosis, and are associated with adverse outcomes. Increased signal intensity on T2 imaging is associated with edema/inflammation and potentially increased risk for SCD. However, the incremental utility of all these techniques, in terms of prognostic value and risk stratification, remains to be determined.\n\n【4】Current echocardiographic techniques are not accurate in detecting myocardial fibrosis, as quantified by LGE, in children with HCM. But there are data suggesting good negative predictive value of standard imaging. On the other hand, myocardial stiffness assessment by shear wave imaging shows a positive correlation with fibrosis markers in LGE-CMR, although additional data in many more patients are needed.\n\n【5】## Recommendations and Key Points\n\n【6】1. LGE by CMR identifies areas of replacement fibrosis.\n2. T1 mapping can be used to determine extracellular volume fraction in HCM patients.\n3. LGE patterns and T1 mapping are of value in evaluation of patients with increased LV wall thickness.\n\n【7】## SECTION 2: MULTIMODALITY IMAGING FOR RISK STRATIFICATION AND PROGNOSTICATION\n\n【8】The overall risk of SCD in patients with HCM is low and estimated at ~0.5%/year. In addition to a personal history of ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia, reasons for consideration of ICD implantation include prior resuscitation for SCD, malignant family history of SCD, unexplained syncope, massive LV wall thickness or apical aneurysm, additional imaging features of extensive late LGE on CMR, and LV systolic dysfunction. The 2014 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines devised and recommended using an HCM Risk-SCD calculator to assess the 5-year risk of SCD. Using the results, an ICD is recommended with a 5-year risk score ≥6% (high risk) and can be considered in those with a 5-year risk ≥4% and <6% (intermediate risk). The algorithm for the HCM Risk-SCD calculator incorporates age, maximal wall thickness (MWT), LA diameter, and maximal LVOT gradient (either resting or with Valsalva) as continuous variables, along with family history of SCD, NSVT on Holter, and unexplained syncope as binary conditions. Recent studies call into question the sensitivity of the algorithm, perhaps due to the lack of inclusion of LGE and apical aneurysms. Inclusion of these features results in a higher sensitivity and smaller numbers needed to treat.\n\n【9】A validated model for SCD risk prediction in pediatric HCM has been recently published and includes age at diagnosis, documented NSVT, unexplained syncope, septal diameter z score, LV posterior wall diameter z score, LA diameter z score, peak LVOT gradient, and presence of a pathogenic variant, with >70% prediction accuracy.\n\n【10】In the section below, we address the established as well as potential risk modifiers of SCD from the perspective of cardiac imaging.\n\n【11】### A. Left Ventricular Wall Thickness\n\n【12】The importance of the magnitude of LVH as a risk factor for SCD is well established, with maximum wall thickness ≥30 mm denoting a high risk for SCD while the AHA/ACC 2020 HCM Guideline also proposes that consideration be given to borderline values of ≥28 mm at the discretion of the treating cardiologist. Notwithstanding, it is important to recognize that the association between the severity of LVH and risk is linear. Furthermore, data linking the degree of LVH and risk has largely been based on echocardiographic measurements, and wall thickness determined by CMR may refine this association further.\n\n【13】### B. Left Atrial Diameter\n\n【14】LA diameter (anteroposterior) was included as a continuous variable in the HCM Risk-SCD calculator, based on one study demonstrating increased risk for SCD with increasing LA diameters. Other studies have provided conflicting results on whether LA diameter is associated with increased risk of SCD or heart failure admissions. LA volume is considered a more accurate assessment of LA size, although only a few small studies have examined its association with outcomes.\n\n【15】### C. Left Ventricular Outflow Tract Obstruction\n\n【16】Several studies have demonstrated an association between resting and provocable LVOT gradients. The association between left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and SCD is not as well described, with some data suggesting that patients with a provoked gradient (≥ 50 mm Hg) have worse outcomes than those with less severe provoked gradients (30-89 mm Hg). A recent study also demonstrated that, in obstructed HCM patients, SRT was associated with better long-term outcomes (including SCD) vs. watchful waiting. The HCM Risk-SCD calculator includes peak LVOT gradient at rest or with Valsalva regardless.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 20, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/ASE ASNC SCRM SCCT：肥厚型心肌病患者多模式心血管影像学检查的建议（2022）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Oxygen should be administered via nasal cannulae or face mask to maintain oxygen saturation between 93% and 98%. An increasing body of evidence supports the use of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen in cases with significant respiratory distress.\n\n【4】In adults with learning disability presenting with CAP, oxygen should be prescribed to a target oxygen saturation of 94%–98% unless at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure. Oxygen should be administered in keeping with BTS Emergency Oxygen guidelines. More conservative oxygen therapy with lower target saturations is increasingly employed and a target of 94%–96% may be optimal. Patients with learning disability may be at high risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure due to underlying COPD, obesity, scoliosis or neuromuscular weakness. In this group of patients, target saturations should be 88%–92%.\n\n【5】There is a role for HFNC oxygen in adults with learning disability presenting with CAP who have acute hypoxic respiratory failure. HFNC therapy is better tolerated than conventional face mask oxygen. The heated humidification is beneficial for mucociliary clearance as compared with conventional oxygen therapy which can be drying to the mouth and to respiratory secretions. In acute hypoxic respiratory failure, it has been demonstrated to be both safe and effective.\n\n【6】### Airway clearance\n\n【7】In most cases of pneumonia, lung tissue consolidation exists without excess secretions. In this situation, there is no evidence that respiratory physiotherapy is of benefit. The BTS guidelines state patients with pneumonia should not be routinely treated with ACTs. However, where retention of secretions is present or a patient has recurrent excess secretions, ACTs are indicated and early referral for chest physiotherapy should be considered.\n\n【8】### Escalation of care\n\n【9】Patients with learning disability admitted to hospital with CAP who have signs of sepsis or acute hypoxic or hypercapnic respiratory failure should have early involvement of critical care services. The LeDeR report has highlighted the need for early involvement and a lower threshold for admission to critical care for CYP with learning disability. Although there is little evidence to help guide decision-making for adults with learning disability requiring critical care, patients with learning disability should have the same access to critical care services as other service users.\n\n【10】Care should be taken to avoid diagnostic overshadowing, defined as ‘symptoms of physical ill health mistakenly attributed to either a mental health/behavioural problem or as being inherent in the person’s learning disabilities’. Such diagnostic overshadowing may prevent a clinician recognising a patient’s deterioration or delay initiation of key treatments or discussions with critical care services regarding escalation to HDU or intensive care unit.\n\n【11】It is important to remember that patients with profound or multiple learning disability, at presentation with a severe intercurrent illness, can neurologically deteriorate which can result in clinicians making inappropriate assumptions about the quality of life at baseline. In addition, making a judgement on a patient’s quality of life without full assessment risks providing inadequate, impersonal care. Where a patient is unable to communicate their quality of life, proxies are almost as good at detecting changes in quality of life as the individual. Any advance directive (or advance care plan (ACP)) by the patient should also be considered along with previous discussions around appropriateness of escalation between clinicians, the patient and their family. The clinical frailty score should not be used to make escalation decisions for people with learning disability or long-term stable disability as it has not been validated in these groups.\n\n【12】There are no studies to suggest that patients with learning disability requiring acute ventilatory support for pneumonia have adverse outcomes on critical care compared with other patient groups. Importantly, studies in children with neurodisability requiring paediatric critical care did not show any association between baseline functional status and outcome from critical care admission. Decisions should be made on whether intubation and ventilation or other forms of ventilatory support are appropriate according to the trajectory of the patient in conjunction with relevant comorbidities. If a patient, including those with profound or multiple disabilities, has a stable trajectory, then they should not be excluded from access to critical care or from invasive ventilation. Other factors that should be considered in decision-making include comorbidities or significant neuromuscular weakness, which may impact on the appropriateness of invasive ventilation. Discussions around ventilation should involve the patient, if they have the capacity to be involved in decision-making, or proxy where possible.\n\n【13】It is essential that adequate time is given to discuss treatment expectations around escalation.

In cross-section, the muscular IVS has a curved-shaped arrangement. The convex surface is towards the RV, while the concave surface is towards the LV. As a consequence, the right surface is larger than the left surface, and it is used to describe the location of VSDs. Although real anatomic boundaries do not exist, the muscular septum can be roughly divided into three components: the inlet, the trabecular, and the outlet component. **The inlet component** begins at the levels of atrioventricular valves and ends approximately at the level of chordal attachment. **The trabecular component** extends from the membranous septum (MS) to the apex.

Thus, the superior margin of the MS is in continuity with the fibrous tissue of the ILT, while the inferior margin inserts on the crest of the muscular IVS. The hinge line of the septal tricuspid leaflet divides the MS into two parts: the atrioventricular MS, a partition between the RA and the LV, and the interventricular MS, a partition between ventricles.

While all these practitioners may refer to the procedure they offer as ‘sclerotherapy’, there is enormous variability in the actual procedure performed. Some published review and primary research papers have been flawed by comparing, for example, good surgery with badly performed or highly inadequate ‘sclerotherapy’. An example of inadequate sclerotherapy includes the practice of accessing the mid-thigh section of the saphenous vein with a butterfly needle (winged infusion sets) or a short cannula and infusing sclerosant foam with the aim of occluding the vein. This suboptimal technique would result in deactivation and dilution of the foam in the target vein, recanalisation of the vein and possible prothrombotic complications.删除17:<u>54</u>\n\n【1】**Sclerotherapy in published literature.** When reviewing the literature and the published studies, readers are well-advised to pay close attention to the procedural details of what has been called ‘sclerotherapy’. Employment of poor techniques combined with the ad-hoc delivery of the intervention, lack of treatment planning and inadequate guidelines can all lead to poor outcomes. In the face of variability in foam production techniques, the clinical variabilities make assessment of the published literature quite difficult.\n\n【2】**Risk of serious adverse events**\n\n【3】Historically, sclerotherapy was trivialised as a ‘simple’ procedure consisting of a series of intravenous injections. This apparent simplicity has encouraged medical practitioners with no training in phlebology to attempt performing the procedure. Sclerotherapy has at times been grouped together with other ‘injectables’ such as cosmetic fillers, encouraging cosmetic physicians and even cosmeticians with no medical training to attempt injecting visible veins with osmotic sclerosants such as hypertonic saline.\n\n【4】Despite the apparent simplicity, sclerotherapy is a complex procedure associated with serious and significant adverse events including anaphylaxis and death,13,55 arterial injury causing ischaemia that may require below-knee or partial foot amputation,56 stroke,10,48,57–64 myocardial infarction, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy and cardiac arrest.删除17:<u>65,66</u> In a recent review of serious adverse events reported to the Federal Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in a 51-year period 删除11:<u>删除19:<u>(1970–2021)</u></u>, POL had the highest number of complications with a total of 2174 reactions, 863 cases of adverse events including 21 cases of death. By contrast, the FAERS database recorded 803 reactions, 312 adverse events and 11 cases of death with the use of STS. While deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) were the most common complications reported with POL, local injection site reactions and necrosis were the most common complications reported with the use of STS. The most common cause of death with the use of POL was cardiac complications including cardiac arrest, while anaphylaxis/anaphylactoid reactions were the most common cause of death with the use of STS. The absolute frequency of these significant adverse reactions is possibly very low given that the total number of sclerotherapy procedures performed in the same period 删除11:<u>删除19:<u>(1970–2021)</u></u> is unknown but likely to be very high.删除17:<u>13</u>\n\n【5】Although these complications are thought to be rare, their real incidence may be higher than what is reported to the regulatory agencies or published in the medical literature. Most of the available data originate from voluntary reports from a population of uncertain size and without control groups. Some of the adverse events may be attributed to practitioner negligence, error, or lack of experience while others may occur irrespective of the level of training or experience of the practitioner.\n\n【6】**Medicolegal considerations**\n\n【7】_Duty to inform._ Physicians have two main duties to inform - a proactive duty and a reactive duty. Physicians have a proactive duty to take reasonable care to provide patients with such information that the reasonable person in the patient’s position would want to receive to aid their decision whether to undergo treatment. These likely include disclosing potential risks, complications and implications of a procedure, the physician’s level of training, experience and success rates in performing the procedure that may influence a patient’s decision to decline or proceed with the proposed intervention (Rogers v Whitaker 删除11:<u>删除19:<u>(1992)</u></u> (‘Rogers’)). K Conversely, a reactive duty requires physicians to take reasonable care to give the patient such information that the physician _ought_ to know is material or important to that particular patient.\n\n【8】_(General medical) consent v. informed consent._ Although the terms consent and informed consent are often used interchangeably, both terms have significantly different legal meanings. In _Chatterton v Gerson 删除11:<u>删除19:<u>(1981)</u></u> (‘Chatterton’)_, Bristow J provides that Consent requires the physician to inform the patient in broad terms of the nature of the procedure, where failure to fulfil this duty gives rise to a claim of trespass, specifically battery.

Long-term treatment should be considered from case to case to avoid the risk of viral reactivation.删除17:<u>59,60</u>\n- Although it is anticipated that patients with MM who have undergone CAR T-cell or BsAb therapy will exhibit poor responses to vaccination, it is still recommended that they receive updates for their influenza and COVID-19 vaccination series. Repeated vaccinations can be initiated 3–6 months post CAR T-cell therapy.\n\n【1】### Fungal infections\n\n【2】Invasive fungal infections in patients with MM range from 2.4% to 15%, with an incremental risk with cumulative exposure to treatment and disease burden. These infections represent a significant cause of morbidity and mortality.删除17:<u>35,62</u> In fact, aspergillus infection was observed in 4% of patients treated with BCMA CAR T-cell therapy.删除17:<u>40</u> Early reports suggest that PJP infections were also observed in 4% of patients treated with BsAb therapy.删除17:<u>51</u>\n\n【3】Recommendations:\n\n【4】- Fungal prophylaxis is only routinely recommended for patients with expected prolonged (>7 days) and severe neutropenia (<500/mm³).删除17:<u>34</u> Drawing on the data from CD19 CAR T-cell therapy, it is justifiable to contemplate mold-active prophylaxis for individuals at high risk who are receiving BCMA CAR T-cell therapy, particularly those with prolonged and severe neutropenia, who have been given more than one dose of tocilizumab, second-line agents such as anakinra or siltuximab, or prolonged and/or high-dose steroids (i.e. more than 3 days and 10 mg dexamethasone or receiving methylprednisolone at a dose of 1 g per day) for the management of CRS or ICANS.删除17:<u>58</u>\n- We recommend PJP prophylaxis preferably with trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole in recipients of CAR T-cell therapy starting 30 days after treatment and continuing for 6 months or until CD4>200/mm³, whichever is longer. For recipients of BsAb, we recommend starting PJP prophylaxis with onset of therapy and continue for the duration of therapy or until CD4>200/mm³, whichever is longer.删除17:<u>34,59</u> In the absence of conclusive evidence, it is recommended to assess the potential advantages of extended PJP prophylaxis after completion of therapy or CD4 count recovery in comparison to the risk of myelosuppression with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Furthermore, alternative regimens such as dapsone, atovaquone and inhalation pentamidine may also be more expensive, making the cost a significant factor to consider.\n\n【5】### PRACTICAL POINTS\n\n【6】Fever can be a manifestation of both CRS and infection. Both conditions can cause clinical deterioration when not properly addressed. Moreover, they may occur concomitantly. Broad spectrum antibiotics should be initiated swiftly, particularly in neutropenic patients and then de-escalated based on culture and imaging results. The majority of infections observed to date in recipients of CAR T or BsAb, most infections are caused by common pathogens such as respiratory viruses, bacteria such as *Streptococcus pneumoniae* and so forth. Proper empirical antibiotics should be employed in common clinical syndromes such as suspected pneumonia or urinary tract infection accompanied by conventional work-up including blood, urine and sputum culture, and molecular viral respiratory panels, among others. Patients without clinical improvement and without identification of pathogen should be investigated for atypical, opportunistic infections. Proper management of T-cell redirecting therapy recipients with suspected infection requires the combined expertise of hematologists and infectious disease specialists.\n\n【7】In conclusion, CAR T-cell and BsAb therapy in relapsed refractory MM have undoubtedly established a higher bar with very impressive clinical efficacy. However, infectious complications remain a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality. The general principles and expert recommendations in the current manuscript provide an easy to adopt template aiming at safe administration of these highly potent agents as we wait for more robust prospective data.\n\n【8】### AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\n\n【9】Meera Mohan, Rajshekhar Chakraborty, Susan Bal and Muhamed Baljevic reviewed the literature and wrote the first draft of the manuscript, Anoma Nellore reviewed and critically edited the manuscript, Peter G.

They agreed that although some studies showed greater benefits for total hip arthroplasty, this was not clinically or statistically significant for most outcomes. However, a combination of the clinical evidence and the health economic model developed as part of the guideline indicated that total hip arthroplasty may have some benefits and be more cost effective than hemiarthroplasty beyond 2 years. The committee noted that although recommendation 1.6.2 states that clinicians should offer arthroplasty (either total hip arthroplasty or hemiarthroplasty) to people with a displaced intracapsular hip fracture, hemiarthroplasty tends to be used more often than total hip arthroplasty. The evidence was not strong enough for them to recommend total hip arthroplasty for everyone with a displaced intracapsular fracture.\n\n【6】Based on their clinical knowledge and experience, the committee discussed how the long-term outcomes considered in the health economic model were important but may not be relevant to some people. For example, older people may not live long enough to experience the long-term benefits of total hip arthroplasty, and people who are not very mobile may be less concerned about the potential consequences of having a hemiarthroplasty, such as wear on the acetabulum. The committee agreed that hemiarthroplasty was a less complicated procedure than total hip arthroplasty and could result in lower dislocation rates and less blood loss.\n\n【7】The health economic evidence on the long-term cost effectiveness and potential clinical benefits of total hip arthroplasty led the committee to recommend that clinicians should consider the procedure for those who are most likely to benefit from it beyond 2 years.

A steering committee reviewed the literature, with disease experts meeting in New York, generated the statements for the 2 rounds of the Delphi process (Supplemental Data 2 and 3) regarding potential changes to diagnostic criteria for NF2 and SWN. Experts worldwide responded to the Delphi questions. The steering committee actively sought input from medical experts outside of the NF field, patients, families, and advocates regarding the proposed criteria, and the new diagnostic criteria were finalized in January 2020.\n\n【2】# Results\n\n【3】## Development of initial proposals to revision of NF2 and SWN diagnostic criteria\n\n【4】The steering committee evaluated the literature for clinical and/or genetic features that could reliably identify and distinguish NF2, mosaic NF2, SWN, and mosaic SWN. Among the clinical features considered were presence of characteristic tumors in SWN, such as schwannomas (including intradermal), hybrid nerve sheath tumors; meningiomas, ependymomas, neurofibromas or gliomas; presence of ophthalmic features; and presence of a family history. Among the molecular features considered were identification of an NF2, SMARCB1, and LZTR1 PV in tumor and unaffected tissue.\n\n【5】## Modified Delphi process\n\n【6】In total, 56 of 76 NF experts who participated in the first Delphi process rated the 24 NF2/SWN diagnostic criteria statements. There was very high consensus (median score = 10/10) for 4 proposed changes to the NF2 criteria: to update “glioma” with “spinal ependymoma,” to recommend molecular testing for individuals with multiple non-intradermal schwannomas, to specify the type of “cataract” to “juvenile cortical wedge cataract” or “presenile posterior lenticular opacity,” and to remove “neurofibroma” from the diagnostic criteria. There was high consensus (median score = 7-9/10) for 5 proposed changes: clarifying which first-degree relatives meet criteria for family history, establishing an age limit to diagnose NF2 in individuals with only bilateral VS, creating formal criteria for diagnosis of mosaic NF2 in the new criteria, creating the category “suspected NF2” in the revised criteria to recognize the phenotypic overlap with SWN, and adding “retinal hamartoma” as a nontumor criterion. There was no consensus (median score = 5/10) for 1 proposed change: to specify that meningiomas must be “nonmeningothelial meningiomas.”\n\n【7】For the SWN criteria, there was very high consensus (median score = 10/10) for 1 proposed change: requiring NF2 testing in blood or in 2 separate anatomically unrelated tumors before considering a diagnosis of SWN. There was high consensus (median score = 7-9/10) for 14 proposed changes: formally addressing nonpenetrance of SWN, specifying the MRI protocol of the brain to exclude VS, specifying extent-of-disease evaluation in persons with germline SMARCB1/LZTR1 PVS, creating the category “possible SWN” to recognize the phenotypic overlap with SWN, requiring imaging confirmation for suspected schwannomas, adding mosaic NF2 as an exclusion criterion, adding “spinal ependymoma” as an exclusion criterion, removing “intracranial meningioma” from the diagnostic criteria, adding molecular criteria for chromosome 22q-related SWN, clarifying the need for pathogenicity of SMARCB1 and LZTR1 variants in the criteria, clarifying which types of tumors induced by radiation cannot be used for diagnostic purposes, and including hybrid nerve sheath tumors into the diagnostic criteria. There was no consensus (median score = 5/10) for 1 proposed change: to modify the criteria to focus on differentiating SWN from NF1.\n\n【8】At the 2018 New York City meeting, working groups developed 19 revised statements for discussing. In total, 49 of 76 NF experts (64%) rated the 9 revised statements for NF2 and 10 revised statements for SWN. There was very high consensus (>80% agreement) for all proposed changes to the NF2 diagnostic criteria: replacing “glioma” with “ependymoma,” removing “neurofibroma,” adding “retinal hamartoma” as a minor criterion, replacing “cataract” with “juvenile (diagnosed at <40 years) subcortical and cortical wedge cataract,” adding “epiretinal membrane diagnosed at <40 years,” adding an NF2 PV as a major criterion, retaining “2 or more meningiomas” as a major criterion, declining to add an age limit for diagnosing patients with bilateral VS, and replacing the Manchester criteria by a system of major and minor criteria.\n\n【9】For the SWN diagnostic criteria, there was very high consensus (>80% agreement) for all proposed changes: stating that molecular analysis is clinically indicated for all patients with suspected NF2/SWN; clarifying that schwannomas or hybrid nerve sheath tumors can be used for diagnosis of SWN; including all tables of molecular features of each condition into the diagnostic criteria (2 questions); clarifying that a PV alone in NF2, SMARCB1, and LZTR1 is not sufficient for diagnosis of NF2/SWN; confirming that a diagnosis of SWN-not otherwise specified (NOS) can be established on the basis of clinical criteria alone; adopting the term “at risk for schwannomatosis” for individuals with 删除11:<u>(1)</u> a", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 3, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/2型神经纤维瘤病的神经鞘瘤病的诊断标准和命名的国际共识建议（2022）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Metastasis requires the acquisition of a succession of traits to disseminate, variably enter and exit dormancy, and colonize distant organs. The success of these events is driven by clonal selection, the potential of metastatic cells to dynamically transition into distinct states, and their ability to co-opt the immune environment. Here, we review the main principles of metastasis and highlight emerging opportunities to develop more effective therapies for metastatic cancer.\n\n【5】## INTRODUCTION\n\n【6】Metastasis, the growth of cancer cells in organs distant from the one in which they originated, is the ultimate and most lethal manifestation of cancer. The vast majority of cancer patients die as a consequence of their tumor metastasizing to distant primary tumors. Metastasis encompasses a series of biological events in which cells from a primary tumor progressively acquire the capacity to invade through the mucosa into deeper tissues; disseminate through the blood, lymphatics, or through direct infiltration of neighboring structures; seed distant organs; and eventually resume proliferation at distant sites to colonize these organs.删除17:<u>1-3</u> Each of these events is driven by the ability of tumor cells to adopt different phenotypic cell states and co-opt their surrounding immune and stromal cells in the tumor environment to support their growth and evade the immune system. Unlike primary tumors, which often can be cured with local therapies such as surgery and radiation, metastatic cancer is a systemic disease that affects multiple organs, either by directly colonizing organs and compromising their function or by altering their metabolism through altered secretomes, eventually leading to death.删除17:<u>4,5</u> Even response to systematic treatment can be drastically different in primary versus metastatic disease in the same patient. Clinically evident metastasis remains largely incurable with few exceptions, due to acquired resistance of metastatic tumors to existing therapies.\n\n【7】Technological advances in the form of next-generation sequencing approaches have been transformative both for basic cancer science and clinical oncology. They have enabled the accumulation of tumor genomic data characterizing disease-specific expression patterns and tumor microenvironments, tracking disease progression and resistance patterns in response to therapies through sequencing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and illuminated the heterogeneity and clonality of primary and metastatic tumors. Together, these efforts have generated unprecedented\n\n【8】development of new biomarkers and drug targets and rapidly advanced our understanding of the underlying biology of how metastatic cells hijack their host environments to ensure their survival. Here, we review the established paradigms of metastasis and emerging principles essential for dissemination, dormancy, and colonization of metastatic cells and also highlight recent discoveries and conceptual advances as well as therapeutic implications for the treatment of metastatic cancer.\n\n【9】## PHASES OF METASTASIS\n\n【10】Metastasis can be divided into three phases that can overlap in time—dissemination, dormancy, and colonization—during which cancer cells undergo a succession of steps to invade tissues, survive in transit, and colonize organs, collectively termed the metastatic cascade6,7 . During dissemination, tumor cells harbor oncogenic driver mutations invade through the basement membrane into deeper tissue layers, acquiring competence to survive in the absence of niche-specific growth factors. This is followed by intravasation into proximal blood vessels or lymphatics and ultimately extravasation into distant organs through transendothelial migration and capillary disruption, migration along neurons, or direct local spread into adjacent spaces such as the peritoneal or pleural cavities.删除17:<u>12,8</u> In circulation, CTCs suffer extensive attrition due to physical, redox, and immune stressors, demonstrated in mouse models and inferred from the low number of CTCs in the blood of most patients with metastatic cancer9,10 .

Morphine milligram equivalent doses for commonly prescribed opioids for pain management\n\n【2】**Sources:** Adapted from Von Korff M, Saunders K, Ray GT, et al. Clin J Pain 2008;24:521–7 and Nielsen S, Degenhardt L, Hoban B, Gisev N. Pharmacoepidemiol Drug Saf 2016;25:733–7.  \n**Abbreviations:** mg/h = microgram per hour; mg = milligram; MME = morphine milligram equivalent.\n\n【3】\\* Multiply the dose for each opioid by the conversion factor to determine the dose in MMEs. For example, tablets containing hydrocodone 5 mg and acetaminophen 325 mg taken four times a day would contain a total of 20 mg of hydrocodone daily, equivalent to 20 MME daily; extended-release tablets containing oxycodone 10 mg and taken twice a day would contain a total of 20 mg of oxycodone daily, equivalent to 30 MME daily. The following cautions should be noted: 1) All doses are in mg/day except for fentanyl, which is mcg/hr; 2) Because MME-based dose conversions are only estimates and cannot account for individual variability in genetics and pharmacokinetics; 3) Do not use the calculated dose in MMEs to determine the doses to use when converting one opioid to another; when converting doses, the new opioid is typically started at a substantially lower dose than the calculated MME dose to avoid overdose because of incomplete cross-tolerance and individual variation in opioid pharmacokinetics. 4) Use of the table alone with methadone for chronic pain is not recommended because methadone has a long and variable half-life, and peak respiratory depressant effect occurs later and lasts longer than analgesic effect; 5) Use particular caution with transdermal fentanyl because it is dosed in mcg/hr instead of mg/day, and it is absorbed to various degrees by heat and other factors. 6) Buprenorphine products approved for the treatment of pain are not included in this table because of the partial $\\mu$-receptor agonist activity and resultant ceiling effects compared with full $\\mu$-receptor agonists. 7) These conversion factors should not be applied to dosages used for the treatment of opioid use disorder because of differences in indication for use, pharmacokinetics, and the dosing used for these medications.\n\n【4】\\删除5:<u>†</u> Tapentadol is a $\\mu$-receptor agonist and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. MMEs are based on degree of $\\mu$-receptor agonist activity; however, it is unknown whether tapentadol is associated with overdose in the same dose-dependent manner as observed with medications that are solely $\\mu$-receptor agonists.  \n\\‡ Tramadol is a $\\mu$-receptor agonist and norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor.

Opioid dosages of 50–90 MME/day were associated with a minimally greater (below the threshold for small) improvement in mean pain intensity compared with dosages of $\\leq$50 MME/day (mean difference: -0.26; 95% CI: -0.57 to -0.02); there was no difference in mean improvement in function 删除11:<u>(7)</u>. Analyses of placebo-controlled trials also found some evidence of a plateauing effect at $\\leq$50 mg MME/day 删除11:<u>(7)</u>. One trial of more liberal dose escalation compared with maintenance of current dosage found no difference in outcomes related to pain or function 删除11:<u>(7)</u>.\n\n【8】At the same time, risks for serious harms related to opioid therapy, including opioid misuse, overdose, and death, increase at higher opioid dosage, without a single point below which there is no risk 删除11:<u>(20)</u>. One cohort study from the clinical evidence reviews found higher dosages of opioids were associated with increased risk for all-cause death; one cohort study found modest associations between higher doses of long-term opioid and increased risk for falls and major trauma; one case-control study found opioid dosages of $>20$ MME/day were associated with increased odds of road trauma injury when the analysis was restricted to drivers, with no dose-dependent association at dosages of $>20$ MME/day; and cohort studies found association between higher opioid dose and risk for various nonfatal unintentional adverse events 删除11:<u>(7)</u>. Patients on higher doses reported reliance on opioids despite ambivalence about their benefits 删除11:<u>(7)</u>.\n\n【9】Four observational studies identified in the clinical evidence reviews consistently found an association between higher doses of long-term opioids and risk for overdose and overdose death 删除11:<u>(7)</u>. Opioid dosages for chronic pain of 50 to 100 MME/day in observational studies have been associated with increased risk for opioid overdose by factors of 1.9–4.6 compared with dosages of 1–20 MME/day, and dosages of $\\geq$100 MME/day were found to be associated with increased risk for overdose of 2.0–8.9 times the risk at 1 to 20 MME/day, after adjusting for confounders on the basis of demographics, comorbidities, concomitant medications, and other factors 删除11:<u>(55,202,203)</u>. When opioids are prescribed for acute pain, similar associations have been found, with dosages of 50 to 100 MME/day associated with 4.3 times the risk for overdose and dosages of $\\geq$100 MME/day associated with 6.64 times the risk, compared with dosages of 1 to 20 MME/day 删除11:<u>(55)</u>. The range of opioid dosages selected by the authors for research purposes, and whereas their findings are consistent with progressive increases in overdose risk being associated with increases in prescribed opioid dosages, they do not demonstrate a specific dosage threshold below which opioids are never associated with overdose. In a national sample of Veterans Health Administration patients with chronic pain who were prescribed opioids, mean prescribed daily opioid dosage among patients who died from opioid overdose was 98 MME (median: 60 MME), compared with mean prescribed daily opioid dosage of 48 MME (median: 25 MME) among patients not experiencing fatal overdose 删除11:<u>(204)</u>.

In general, chronic glucocorticoid excess can influence all three factors of the Virchow triad: endothelial dysfunction, haemodynamic changes and hypercoagulability. Normalisation of haemostasis is seen in patients who achieved disease remission, though the thromboembolic risk persists for a period, even after biochemical remission. Long-term use of exogenous corticosteroids seems also to be associated with a significant increase in thromboembolic risk.\n\n【2】Adrenal insufficiency is not usually complicated by clinically significant thrombotic or bleeding episodes. However, a recent observational study found an increased bleeding tendency and reduced levels of FVIII in patients with subnormal secretion of cortisol and probably decreased sympatho-adrenal medullary function undergoing abdominal surgery.\n\n【3】Growth hormone deficiency causes a hypercoagulable state, at least partially reversible after replacement therapy with growth hormone. Limited evidence in adults with idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism treated with replacement therapy showed a tendency towards developing a hypercoagulable state. In children and adolescents with growth hormone deficiency, a partial resolution of hypercoagulability was observed after growth hormone treatment.\n\n【4】Gonadal hormone deficiency causes an alteration in haemostatic and fibrinolytic functions. In fact, reduced levels of oestrogen or testosterone can increase the levels of fibrinolytic inhibitors and decrease sensitivity to activated protein C, resulting in increased thrombotic tendency.\n\n【5】Thyroid disorders\n\n【6】Hyperthyroidism is associated with an increased risk of arterial thromboembolism due to accelerated metabolism and hypercoagulability, while hypothyroidism is linked to increased levels of VWF and FVIII and a reduction of plasma fibrinolytic activity.\n\n【7】In patients with newly diagnosed hyperthyroidism, the coagulation system is activated mainly due to an increase in VWF and FVIII and a decrease in plasma fibrinolytic potential. After the achievement of a euthyroid state, the thrombotic risk decreases but remains elevated compared to healthy individuals. Patients with hypothyroidism, including those with subclinical disease, have a higher risk of bleeding due to defects in fibrinolysis and anticoagulant pathways.\n\n【8】Systemic and metabolic diseases\n\n【9】The metabolic syndrome is a complex clinical disorder with multifactorial pathogenesis characterised mainly by impaired glucose metabolism, increased arterial blood pressure, atherosclerosis and abdominal obesity associated with increased cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. In patients with metabolic syndrome, the coagulation system is switched toward a prothrombotic state, caused mainly by increased plasmatic coagulation, hypofibrinolysis, endothelial activation and decreased endothelial thromboresistance and platelet hyperreactivity.\n\n【10】Patients with autoimmune and malignant disorders can develop autoantibodies affecting the activity or accelerating the clearance of clotting factors (acquired inhibitors). Such inhibitors are most frequently directed against FVIII or VWF, but acquired inhibitors against other clotting factors were also described. The presence of autoantibodies against clotting factors induces a high risk of bleeding, which requires immediate treatment aimed at eradicating the inhibitor. In cancer patients, acquired haemophilia A (AHA) is the most common subset of the disorder and is caused by inhibitory antibodies against coagulation FVIII activity, which can cause a significant bleeding diathesis. Successful treatment of AHA in cancer patients implies the immediate management of haemorrhagic diathesis, eradication of the autoantibody inhibitor and concurrent treatment of the underlying malignancy. Depending on the situation, bleeding can be controlled using bypassing agents (aPCC, rFVIIa), DDAVP and recombinant FVIII concentrates in patients with low-titre inhibitors. Other therapies such as plasmapheresis and/or immunoadsorption might be considered in individual cases. The most common therapy used to eradicate the inhibitor in AHA is immunosuppressive therapy, and outcome is improved with earlier detection of FVIII inhibitors and timely interventions with suppression therapy.\n\n【11】Abnormal bleeding manifestations were described in patients with immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis. According to a recent study, the most typical findings explaining the bleeding tendency in patients with immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis are prolonged PT, elevated plasmin-α2-antiplasmin complex and acquired FX deficiency suggesting the coexistence of a hypocoagulable and hyperfibrinolytic state. Deficiency of other clotting factors were described in immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis and might contribute to the bleeding diathesis. In individual cases, bleeding episodes due to acquired isolated deficiency of factor IX are treated similar to inherited FX deficiency.\n\n【12】Chronic liver disease\n\n【13】In observational studies, VHA were useful in identifying cirrhotic patients with a normal coagulative assessment despite severe abnormalities of INR and/or platelet count.\n\n【14】In observational studies in cirrhotic patients with thrombocytopenia and/or abnormal INR values undergoing invasive procedures, postprocedural bleeding was rare and unpredicted by platelet counts or abnormal INR values. In retrospective studies, peri-operative bleeding was not influenced by platelet count in cirrhotic patients undergoing excision of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) without prophylactic platelet transfusion, even when the platelet count was less than 50 x 10删除21:<u>^9</u>/l. Platelet count does not predict unprovoked major or minor bleeding in cirrhotic patients, according to an observational study with a follow-up period of 4 years.\n\n【15】According to a study in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure, low fibrinogen level is an independent predictor of bleeding events in patients with a MELD score greater than 25 undergoing invasive procedures. Recent guidelines do not recommend routine prophylactic correction of the platelet count because of the lack of evidence that elevating the platelet count reduces bleeding risk, and recommend an individualised approach to", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 20, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/2022 ESAIC指南：严重围手术期出血的管理（第2次更新）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

In addition to dose reduction of iodine contrast media, withdrawal of nephrotoxic drugs (such as certain antibiotics, renin angiotensin aldosterone system inhibitors, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) and ensuring adequate hydration may also lower the risk of CIN. Intravenous hydration with 0.9% saline is the prophylactic intervention best supported by evidence, to decrease the risk of CIN. Several other prophylactic regimens to lower the risk of CIN have been proposed, for example acetylcysteine and hydration with sodium bicarbonate instead of saline, but none has been convincingly proven to be effective. A large RCT found no benefit of intravenous sodium bicarbonate over intravenous sodium chloride or of oral acetylcysteine over placebo to prevent of contrast associated acute kidney injury.\n\n【3】In the treatment of complex AAA, preservation of large accessory renal arteries (≥ 4 mm) is feasible with low complication rates and good patency. It prevents early renal dysfunction and provides higher freedom for midterm renal dysfunction, although so far there is no demonstrated effect on death in early post-operative and follow up period. Incorporation of < 4.0 mm renal arteries during f/bEVAR is associated with lower technical success, higher risk of arterial disruption and kidney loss, and lower patency rates at one year, and should be avoided.\n\n【4】删除图片描述:<u>![](79_1.png)</u>\n\n【5】8.4. Spinal cord ischaemia prevention in complex abdominal aortic aneurysm repair\n\n【6】Impairments in spinal cord perfusion are more frequently observed following open or endovascular repair of type I, II, and III TAAA, and specific considerations and recommendations in this field are reported in the recently published ESVS Clinical Practice Guidelines on thoracic and thoraco-abdominal aorta.\n\n【7】The occurrence of SCI after OSR of juxta- and pararenal AAAs is anecdotal, and rare after open repair of type IV TAAA, but should be considered as a potential complication.\n\n【8】Endovascular repair of complex AAAs usually requires a supravisceral proximal sealing zone, and thereby a higher number of intercostal arteries are sacrificed compared with OSR. In a systematic review and meta-analysis, including 5 121 patients from 14 studies undergoing juxtarenal AAA repair, endovascular (vs. open) repair was associated with a significantly lower 30 day mortality (OR 0.50), acute renal failure (OR 0.50), bowel ischaemia (OR 0.50), and length of stay (−6 days) but with increased risk of SCI (OR 3.13). However, a more recent multicentre study reported the absence of SCI after endovascular juxta- and pararenal AAA repair while another systematic review and meta-analysis found a low incidence of SCI (3%) after type IV TAAA endovascular repair.\n\n【9】Strategies for prevention, early detection, and treatment of SCI to be implemented include 删除11:<u>(1)</u> staging the procedure, 删除11:<u>(2)</u> maintaining a high BP (MAP ≥ 80 mmHg) and oxygenation (haemoglobin level ≥ 10 mg/dL), 删除11:<u>(3)</u> preservation of collaterals, 删除11:<u>(4)</u> cerebrospinal fluid drainage (CSFD) and 删除11:<u>(5)</u> neuromonitoring.\n\n【10】Prophylactic CSFD has been shown in RCTs to prevent SCI in open TAAA repair. However, there is a lack of evidence for its role in EVAR of complex AAA. The potential benefits of CSFD must be weighed against the risks. In a recent single centre study, including 448 complex AAA endovascular repairs of which 147 had prophylactic spinal fluid drainage, 12% developed drain related complication, whereof 2% were disabling.\n\n【11】In summary, SCI is infrequent after complex AAA repair. Therefore, routine use of prophylactic cerebrospinal fluid drainage during complex AAA repair is not indicated. It may, however, be considered in high risk (for SCI) patients, such as during endovascular repair of type IV TAAA with extensive aortic coverage or in patients with previous\n\n【12】删除图片描述:<u>![](79_2.png)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 80, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/2024+ESVS临床实践指南：腹主动脉-髂动脉动脉瘤的管理(1).pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Literature does not provide clear evidence about superiority of rhythm over heart rate control in patients with AF.\n\n【2】Furthermore, it is unclear what the optimal mean heart rate is in patients with AF. Higher heart rate in patients in sinus rhythm is related to increased risk for all-cause-mortality, cardiovascular mortality, heart failure, and stroke. The reduction of heart rate in patients in sinus rhythm might improve the outcomes. Nevertheless, data on AF are ambiguous. Rawles demonstrated that mean heart rate of about 90 b.p.m, or, at least, inferior to 140 b.p.m. guaranteed good cardiac output and hemodynamic performances in patients with AF. RACE II (Rate Control Efficacy in Permanent Atrial Fibrillation: a Comparison between Lenient vs. Strict Rate Control) II study outlined that lenient heart rate control (rest heart rate < 110 b.p.m. in patients on permanent AF reduced primary endpoint (combination of cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure, stroke/systemic embolism, bleeding and major arrhythmic events) of 16% [HR 0.84, confidence interval (CI) 95.0–58-1.21] as compared to strict control (rest heart rate < 80 b.p.m. and < 110 b.p.m. during exercise).\n\n【3】Patients who suffered for AF and heart rate with preserved or reduced ejection fraction did not benefit from strict reduction in mean heart rate. King et al. pointed out that lower heart rate (< 65 b.p.m.) in patients with AF and heart failure was associated to higher risk of all-cause death and heart failure re-hospitalization than lenient control (mean heart rate between 65 and 85 b.p.m.). Furthermore, lower heart rate is more dangerous in patients with left ventricle ejection fraction <50%.\n\n【4】### Anticoagulation therapy management\n\n【5】AF-related thromboembolism is the most preventing and relevant complication of the arrhythmia. In this case, it is useful to identify those patients to be treated with UHF, thus considering the characteristics of the patient, to its thromboembolic risk, and to the onset of the arrhythmia.\n\n【6】Unfractioned heparin (UHF) and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) have always been considered as the first-line choice in patients with AF who were admitted to the ED, independently from the therapeutic strategy (rhythm vs. rate control). Indeed, evidence about the use of LMWH in patients with AF is scarce. Siu et al. randomized 96 patients with recent AF to tinzaparin (175 IU/kg/die) or UHF (activated partial thromboplastin clotting-time target 50-70 s) since ED admission. The study outlined higher thromboembolic protection with tinzaparin as compared to UHF within 48 h although results should be weighted for the small sample size. Data from the pilot study named ACUTE II (Assessment of Cardioversion Using Transesophageal Echocardiography) pointed out that treatment with enoxaparin in patients who should undergo transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)-guided electrical cardioversion was equal to UFH in terms of safety and efficacy. Indeed, hospital length of stay was significantly lower in those who were treated with enoxaparin than UHF which is really interesting in term of management costs of AF. Enoxaparin was not inferior to the combination of UHF+enoxaparin in preventing thromboembolic risk, haemorrhagic complications, and all-cause-mortality in patients with AF > 48 h and ≤1 years. A retrospective study by Khan et al. reported the safety and efficacy of enoxaparin (1 mg/kg for bid+subsequently 1.5 mg/kg/ die): among 213 patients none had any ischemic event when correct therapeutic dose of enoxaparin was administered. Nevertheless, patients already on anticoagulation therapies should not undergo interruption.\n\n【7】### Table 9 summarized the main drugs that could be adopted for mean heart rate control, their dosages, and half-lives.\n\n| Drug name  | Dosage                                             | Half-life     |\n|------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------|\n| Drug A     | xx mg, frequency yy                                | zz hours      |\n| Drug B     | aa mg, frequency bb                                | cc hours      |\n| Drug C     | dd mg, frequency ee                                | ff hours      |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 10, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/2023 ANMCO_SIMEU共识文件：急诊科房颤的适当管理.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

For patients taking maintenance ICS, changing to maintenance combination ICS-LABA provides additional improvements in symptoms and lung function with a reduced risk of exacerbations compared with the same dose of ICS (Evidence A),255,256 but there is only a small reduction in reliever use.删除17:<u>257,258</u> In these studies, the reliever was as-needed SABA. However, before prescribing a regimen with SABA reliever, consider whether the patient is likely to be adherent with their ICS-containing treatment, as otherwise they will be at higher risk of exacerbations.\n\n【2】**Maintenance ICS-LABA plus as-needed combination ICS-SABA (≥18 years):**\n\n【3】**Population:** In the double-blind MANDALA study,259 the population relevant to Step 3 recommendations comprised patients with poor asthma control and a history of severe exacerbations who were taking maintenance low-dose ICS-LABA or medium-dose ICS. In this study, patients were randomized to as-needed ICS-SABA or as-needed SABA, and continued to take their usual maintenance treatment.\n\n【4】**Evidence:** In the sub-population taking Step 3 maintenance treatment, as-needed use of 2 inhalations of budesonide– salbutamol (albuterol) 100/100 mcg metered dose (80/90 mcg delivered dose), taken for symptom relief, increased the time to first severe exacerbation by 41% compared with as-needed salbutamol (hazard ratio 0.59; CI 0.42–0.85). The proportion of patients with a clinically important difference in ACQ-5 was slightly higher with the budesonide-salbutamol reliever. A formulation with a lower ICS dose did not significantly reduce severe exacerbations.删除17:<u>259</u>\n\n【5】**Other considerations:** There are no head-to-head comparisons between this regimen and ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever therapy (MART), both of which include an anti-inflammatory reliever (AIR). However, as ICS-SABA is not recommended for regular use, and its use as the reliever in Steps 3–5 requires the patient to have different maintenance and reliever inhalers, this regimen is more complex for patients than GINA Track 1 with ICS-formoterol, in which the same medication is used for both maintenance and reliever doses. Translation between treatment steps with as-needed ICS-SABA may also be more complex than in GINA Track 1 as there is only one small study of as-needed only ICS-SABA (budesonide-salbutamol) as a Step 2 treatment.删除17:<u>215</u>\n\n【6】**Practice points:** A maximum number of 6 as-needed doses (each 2 puffs of 100/100 mcg budesonide-salbutamol (80/90 mcg delivered dose)) can be taken in a day. It is essential to educate patients about the different purpose of the maintenance and reliever inhalers, and to train them in correct inhaler technique with both devices if they are different; this also applies to SABA relievers.\n\n【7】**Other Step 3 controller options for adults and adolescents**\n\n【8】For adult patients with allergic rhinitis and sensitized to house dust mite, with suboptimally controlled asthma despite low to high-dose ICS, consider adding sublingual allergen immunotherapy (SLIT), provided FEV1 is >70% predicted.删除17:<u>260,261</u>\n\n【9】Another option for adults and adolescents is to increase ICS to medium dose150 删除9:<u>(see Box 3-14, p.67)</u> but, at population level, this is less effective than adding a LABA262,263 (Evidence A).

Although intended to reduce observer bias, multiple studies have documented observation and selection bias when those under observation became aware of the observer or when certain HCP, shifts, or areas in a unit or facility are oversampled. In a qualitative study of HCP in 10 acute-care hospitals, observers expressed concern about the Hawthorne effect, and those observed expressed concern about the inability of observers to see their compliance. In response to a survey about perceptions of hand hygiene monitoring, 58% of 1,120 British HCP did not strongly endorse direct observation for determining hand hygiene adherence.\n\n【3】Methods to reduce bias and improve representativeness of observation include randomly and confidentially scheduling observations during peak activity (eg, morning rounds) and using a systematic method to determine where observations should be collected. The specific times at which observed opportunities were found to be most representative of all opportunities in a multicenter ICU were 8 A.M., during morning rounds,删除16:<u> 8 </u>P.M., mid-shift, and midnight, to capture late-night behavior. Further methods include making observers appear as part of normal unit activity, conducting unannounced audits, and enlisting observers from within unit personnel.\n\n【4】## Automated hand-hygiene monitoring systems (AHHMSs)\n\n【5】The use of AHHMSs has increased since the early 2000s. A variety of systems capture data in several different ways using event counters or wireless connections with dispensers and badges. Data may be collected in aggregate (eg, number of activations from each entry) or linked to specific personnel and specific indications. Measurement occurs on all shifts and all days of the week and captures large numbers of hand hygiene opportunities (HHOs), providing insight into adherence patterns. Accuracy may vary, and optimal methods of validating systems have not been identified. Direct observation and remote video observation have been used to estimate denominator data for the calculation of adherence rates that may be used when an AHHMS does not capture the HHOs.\n\n【6】Real or perceived data inaccuracies generated by AHHMSs may limit the ability to interpret hand hygiene. Wearable devices that are unappealing, intrusive, or that interfere with hand hygiene (eg, wristbands) may lead HCP to reject use of the system. Successful implementation of an AHHMS hinges on leadership commitment and collaboration among the infection prevention team and HCP. To enhance collaboration, one facility performed structured interviews to obtain HCP feedback about the use and functionality of the system. This intervention resulted in acceptance of the system and sustained improvements in hand hygiene adherence. The cost of implementation of an AHHMS should be considered, including costs (eg, labor) related to other measurement methods.\n\n【7】## Remote video observation\n\n【8】Remote video observation is a form of direct covert observation in that HCP and patients should be aware that cameras are viewing or recording their hand hygiene behavior. The observer is independent of the unit and unknown to those under observation, which reduces observer and sampling bias. Remote video observation has been used to validate and benchmark HHOs for use as denominators for certain AHHMSs. A study coupling remote video observation with rapid and regular feedback to HCP and unit managers resulted in sustained statistically significant improvements in 2 ICUs. To protect patient privacy the camera view may be restricted to areas of the room in which hand cleaning supplies are located and may have curtains that can be drawn over the lens. The major challenges of this method include the restricted view of the camera (ie, obstructed at times or limited to areas where hand hygiene is performed), the potential need for patient consent, and financial cost of systems.\n\n【9】## Patient as observer\n\n【10】The patient as observer is another form of direct overt observation that may be useful in outpatient settings when resources for conducting hand hygiene observations are limited. An outpatient clinic using this method asked patients to complete a survey answering a single question, \"Did your provider clean their hands before touching you?\" More than 75% of patients returned the survey cards and expressed satisfaction with participation in the survey. The viability of this method may be limited due to limitations in patient settings because of variations in patient ability to participate in observations and the increased number of HHOs associated with inpatient care.\n\n【11】## Indirect measurement\n\n【12】Indirect methods of measuring adherence to hand hygiene include volume usage or event counters. Adherence to HHOs based on volume usage is often not attributable to specific department or units within a facility, limiting provision of feedback to HCP. When attempts were made to correlate usage with observational data, researchers noted high compliance by direct observation with no correlation to volume usage. This finding led them to suggest biased observation due to the Hawthorne effect. Using an environmental assessment to identify points of care and an anticipated number of HHOs, indirect methods were used by one facility to determine that the facility would need 200,000 L of hand sanitizer annually to attain high rates of hand hygiene adherence. This finding may not be helpful for measurement of adherence rates but may provide insight for emergency planning.\n\n【13】## Audits of the accessibility and functionality of hand hygiene supplies\n\n【14】Regular audits of the accessibility and functionality of hand hygiene equipment and supplies should be conducted to ensure that HCP adherence is supported by the physical environment of care. The National Fire Protection Association requires that ABHS dispensers be tested for proper functioning each time they are refilled. Audits of equipment can identify broken or empty dispensers or unsuitable sinks, which can then be remediated.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 7, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/2022 SHEA／IDSA／APIC实践建议：通过手部卫生预防卫生保健相关感染的策略（更新）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Assess risk-modifying factors such as age, vaccination-related or infection-related immunity, medical complexity, the presence of multiple risk factors, and the nature of the exposure.\n\n【5】**Rationale**\nPEP is a successful strategy to prevent infections by agents such as human immunodeficiency virus, and it was one of the initial strategies to prevent symptomatic COVID-19 before antiviral therapies were available. Now, in light of the availability of FDA-approved antiviral therapy such as remdesivir and the availability of other antivirals under EUAs, PEP may be limited to patients with severe immunocompromising conditions for whom there will be a continuing need to minimize the risk of severe COVID-19.\n\n【6】### Agents Previously Available for Post-Exposure Prophylaxis\n\n【7】The FDA previously updated the EUAs for casirivimab– imdevimab 删除19:<u>(on August 删除13:<u>10, 2021</u>)</u> and bamlanivimab– etesevimab 删除19:<u>(on September 删除13:<u>16, 2021</u>)</u> to include their use for COVID-19 PEP in certain children and adults at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19 删除12:<u>[删除13:<u>177, 178</u>]</u>. These authorizations were later withdrawn because of the high frequency of the Omicron variant (and its sublineages) of SARS-CoV-2, against which these agents have markedly decreased activity 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[179]</u></u>. Currently, bamlanivimab–etesevimab and casirivimab– imdevimab are not authorized in any US region and may not be administered for COVID-19 PEP. As of the publication of this guidance, no such product was available in the United States for this indication.\n\n【8】### Evidence Summary\n\n【9】#### Efficacy\n\n【10】**Bamlanivimab**\nA phase III, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the ability of bamlanivimab, a neutralizing mAb against SARS-CoV-2, to prevent COVID-19 among residents and staff in nursing homes and assisted-living facilities 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[180]</u></u>. Participants were enrolled from facilities with at least one index COVID-19 case. The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection with mild or worse disease within 21 days of detection and within 8 weeks of randomization. Among 966 participants who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR and serology at baseline, bamlanivimab significantly reduced the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection when compared with placebo (8.5% vs 15.2%; OR: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.28–0.68), with AE rates being similar in the treatment and placebo groups. Based on these findings, bamlanivimab appeared to be moderately effective at preventing COVID-19 infection among adults without evidence of prior immunity to SARS-CoV-2. However, extrapolating these findings to children or previously vaccinated individuals is challenging.\n\n【11】**Casirivimab–imdevimab**\nThe mAb combination casirivimab–imdevimab was evaluated as PEP in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in the United States, Romania, and Moldova 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[82]</u></u>. Household contacts of an index case (positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR) who were asymptomatic and at least 12 years of age were randomized to receive casirivimab–imdevimab or placebo by subcutaneous injection. The primary outcome was the development of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection within 28 days of exposure. Participants treated with casirivimab–imdevimab had an 81.4% RRR for symptomatic infection when compared with placebo-treated participants (11 of 753 [1.5%] vs. 59 of 752 [7.8%]; OR: 0.17; 95% CI: 0.09–0.33). Secondary outcomes that also favored the treated group were a reduction in positive tests for SARS-CoV-2, a reduction in viral load for virus-positive participants, and a shorter mean symptom duration for symptomatic patients.\n\n【12】#### Safety\nOverall, pediatric safety data for SARS-CoV-2 mAbs remain limited.

For differentiated vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (dVIN), an excisional procedure must always be adopted. For vulvar high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (VHSIL), both excisional procedures and ablative ones can be used. The latter can be considered for anatomy and function preservation and must be preceded by several representative biopsies to exclude malignancy. Medical treatment (imiquimod or cidofovir) can be considered for VHSIL. Recent studies favor an approach of using imiquimod in vulvar Paget’s disease. Surgery must take into consideration that the extension of the disease is usually wider than what is evident in the skin. A 2 cm margin is usually considered necessary. A wide local excision with 1 cm free surgical margins is recommended for melanoma in situ. Following treatment of pre-invasive vulvar lesions, women should be seen on a regular basis for careful clinical assessment, including biopsy of any suspicious area. Follow-up should be modulated according to the risk of recurrence (type of lesion, patient age and immunological conditions, other associated lower genital tract lesions).\n\n【4】## BACKGROUND\n\n【5】The European Society of Gynaecological Oncology (ESGO), the International Society for the Study of Vulvovaginal Disease (ISSVD), the European College for the Study of Vulval Disease (ECSVD), and the European Federation for Colposcopy (EFC) are leading international societies among gynecologists, pathologists, dermatologists, and related disciplines. One of their aims is to improve the highest quality of care for women with pre-invasive and invasive gynecological neoplasia through prevention, advancing treatment, excellence in care, and high-quality research and education.\n\n【6】ESGO, EFC, ECSVD, and ISSVD collaborated to develop a consensus statement on pre-invasive vulvar lesions.\n\n【7】## METHODS\n\n【8】The ESGO, ISSVD, ECSVD, and EFC executive councils nominated selected specialists from their membership bodies with well-recognized expertise, clinical and research activity, and leadership in the field as surrogate markers for their continuous effort in improving the quality of care for patients with vulvar and vaginal pre-invasive lesions.\n\n【9】A systematic literature review of studies published from January 2000 to March 2021 was carried out using the MEDLINE database.

Consequently, smoking patients tend to use tobacco to relieve or avoid pain 删除12:<u>[删除13:<u>11, 131</u>]</u>. Repeated use of tobacco to avoid pain increases the risk of nicotine dependence.

These findings indicate that pain patients who smoke are refractory to stop-smoking treatment.\n\n【2】In smoking patients with pain, abstinence interventions should start by addressing their pain because persistent pain is one of the main reasons for abstinence failure.

Therefore, the use of smoking cessation aids is advised.\n\n【11】<Commentary>\n\n【12】Smokers with chronic pain use a larger number of cigarettes per day and are more likely to become nicotine dependent than those without chronic pain. If they have previously experienced difficulties when trying to stop smoking, severe nicotine withdrawal symptoms will probably develop on their next attempt 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[133]</u></u>. Patients with chronic pain are resistant to smoking cessation treatment because pain intensities are positively correlated with desire to smoke 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[143]</u></u>.

As smokers with chronic pain might be unable to using pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[145]</u></u>, physicians should consider pharmacologic treatments to prevent nicotine withdrawal symptoms. Under the Japanese National Health Insurance System, smoking cessation programs cover cigarette smokers and HTP users.\n\n【13】First-line pharmacologic therapies for smoking cessation include nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), the partial nAChR agonist varenicline, and bupropion sustained release (an antidepressant that inhibits noradrenaline and dopamine reuptake).

If an IBD patient has persistent cough, cold symptoms, fever, or rapidly deteriorating gastrointestinal symptoms, they should be tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection as soon as possible. Although the BSG guidelines classified the risk level of IBD patients and recommend very strict isolation for those at high risk, most guidelines, including this statement, advise patients to comply with standard prevention policies for the general population for convenience.

Adjuvant interferon alfa (IFN alfa), particularly high-dose IFN alfa, has been widely used in patients with melanoma for many years. A large body of clinical evidence has amassed from prospective randomized trials comparing adjuvant IFN alfa with observation or control treatments now thought to be ineffective in melanoma. Results varied across trials, with some showing improvement in RFS, a few showing improvement in OS, but others showing no improvement in RFS or OS or effects with borderline statistical significance. Meta-analyses including data from a large number of trials have shown that improvements in RFS and OS are statistically significant, but small. A recent meta-analysis reported improvements in 5- and 10-year event-free survival and OS of less than 4%.\n\n【3】IFN alfa has been supplanted, however, by targeted therapy and immune checkpoint inhibitor options based on results from recent and ongoing prospective randomized trials. Although trials supporting immune checkpoint inhibitor and targeted therapy as adjuvant treatment options did not compare these agents to IFN alfa, the NCCN Melanoma Panel considers these agents to be more effective and better tolerated than IFN alfa, and therefore no longer recommends IFN alfa for adjuvant treatment of cutaneous melanoma.\n\n【4】For several years biochemotherapy was among the listed options for adjuvant treatment of resected high-risk stage III melanoma. Inclusion of biochemotherapy as an adjuvant option was based on results from the SWOG S0008 phase 3 randomized trial showing that the combination of cisplatin, vinblastine, dacarbazine, IL-2, and IFN alfa improved RFS compared with high-dose IFN alfa-2b (median of 4.0 years vs. 1.9 years; HR, 0.75 with 95% CI, 0.58–0.97; $P = .03$). Although the studies supporting adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitor and targeted therapy options did not compare these newer approaches with biochemotherapy, the latter has been removed from the list of adjuvant options because it was rarely being used at NCCN Member Institutions due both to its high toxicity profile and to the emergence of more effective adjuvant therapy options.\n\n【5】### NCCN Recommendations for Considering Adjuvant Systemic Therapy\nAdjuvant treatment outside of a clinical trial is not recommended for patients with stage I/II disease, although the rationale for this recommendation varies across the NCCN Panel. There are no FDA-approved adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors or BRAF-targeted therapies for this group of patients. Although most of the trials to date did not include patients with stage I/II disease, clinical trials are underway to define the role of adjuvant checkpoint inhibitors in high-risk stage II patients.\n\n【6】For patients with resected advanced melanoma, there have been a number of prospective randomized trials suggesting that immune checkpoint inhibitor and BRAF-targeted therapy are effective options for adjuvant treatment. Data from these trials are summarized in Table 5. These trials, the FDA-approved indications 删除9:<u>(Table 6)</u>, and the NCCN recommendations 删除9:<u>(Table 7)</u> based on these trials are discussed in greater detail in the sections below. Selection of a specific adjuvant systemic therapy for patients with resected advanced melanoma depends on many factors, including risk of recurrence, potential clinical benefit, potential toxicities, patient preference, patient age, and comorbidities. Other options include participation in a clinical trial and observation.\n\n【7】The most important factor to consider is the risk of recurrence and/or death from disease.

This was the first clinical expert consensus for the treatment of second-degree burn wounds at home and abroad, covering the following four aspects: pre-hospital first aid treatment, non-surgical treatment, surgical treatment, and infection prevention and control of burn wounds. It aimed to form a standardized treatment plan for second-degree burns.\n2. This consensus clarified and standardized the terminology related to second-degree burn wounds, including for the first time further dividing deep second-degree burn wounds into partial shallow deep second-degree and partial deep second-degree wounds, which provided a decision-making basis for standardizing the relevant diagnosis, classification, and treatment of second-degree burn wounds.\n3. Based on the evidence-based medicine evidence, comprehensive consideration of the operative feasibility of the clinical practice, and the economic level and culture in different geographic regions, a set of operable clinical practice guideline of second-degree burns was formed.\n\n【5】## Ⅱ度烧伤创面治疗专家共识（2024版）I：院前急救和非手术治疗\n\n【6】中国医学会烧伤外科学分会  \n跨海两岸医药卫生交流协会暨烧创伤组织修复专业委员会  删除1:<u>\n通信作者：翟皓帆，海军军医大学第一附属医院烧伤外科， 全军烧伤研究所，中国医学科学院烧伤医学创新技术关键技术创新单元，上海 200433，Email：xizhaofan@163.com</u>\n\n【7】**未共同项目简介**  \n本共识全文发表在《Burns & Trauma》，2024，12：tkad061\n\n【8】**摘要**：Ⅱ度烧伤临床治疗首为急救但处理十分棘手的伤害类型。目前关于Ⅱ度烧伤创面前急救、诊断归类、保守药物的方式、外用敷料或药物的选择等尚未形成统一的标准和规范，严重影响临床治疗方案的制定及临床研究开展的一致性。本共识编写团队以循证医学证据为基础，结合专家意见，制订了Ⅱ度烧伤创面治疗专家共识（2024版）I：\n\n【9】删除图片描述:<u>![](0_0.png)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 1, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/Ⅱ度烧伤创面治疗专家共识（2024版）Ⅰ：院前急救和非手术治疗.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

It aims to provide information to birth attendants and pregnant individuals on optimal perinatal care while avoiding unnecessary obstetrical intervention.\n\n【2】**Target Population:**\nAll pregnant patients.\n\n【3】**Benefits, Harms, and Costs:**\nConsistent interprofessional use of the guideline, appropriate equipment, and trained professional staff enhance safe intrapartum care. Pregnant individuals and their support person(s) should be informed of the benefits and risks of induction of labour.\n\n【4】**Evidence:**\nLiterature published to March 2022 was reviewed. PubMed, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library were used to search for systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, and observational studies on cervical ripening and induction of labour. Grey (unpublished) literature was identified by searching the websites of health technology assessment and health technology related agencies, clinical practice guideline collections, clinical trial registries, and national and international medical specialty societies.\n\n【5】**Validation Methods:**\nThe authors rated the quality of evidence and strength of recommendations using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.\n\n【6】**Intended Audience:**\nAll providers of obstetrical care.\n\n【7】**RECOMMANDATIONS**\n\n【8】1. Cervical ripening is recommended when the modified Bishop score is less than 7 (strong, high).\n2. Health care providers should not routinely offer amniotomy or oxytocin (individually or in combination) until the modified Bishop score is 7 or greater (strong, high).\n3. Should cervical ripening and/or IOL be unsuccessful, health care providers should consider an alternative or combined method of cervical ripening and/or IOL before proceeding with cesarean delivery (strong, high).\n4. Health care providers should consider balloon catheters first-line agents for cervical ripening whenever feasible, as they are safe and effective, including in an outpatient setting and in a trial of labour after cesarean (strong, high).\n5. Health care providers may use either prostaglandin E1 or prostaglandin E2 vaginal gel or insert to achieve safe and effective cervical ripening (strong, high). Providers should consider the degree of ripening required (based on the Bishop score) and the desire for outpatient management when choosing a prostaglandin for cervical ripening (conditional, moderate).\n6. Health care providers may use prostaglandin and balloon catheters concurrently for cervical ripening (conditional, moderate).\n7. Health care providers can use prostaglandin E2 for outpatient cervical ripening when there is a normal electronic fetal monitoring tracing (strong, moderate).\n8. Health care providers can use prostaglandin E2 for inpatient management of cervical ripening (strong, high). If a break from cervical ripening is required, patients can be sent home from the hospital 2 hours after an oral dose and 4 hours after a vaginal dose if electronic fetal monitoring is normal (strong, moderate).\n9. Health care providers should be cautious when using any prostaglandin in a potentially compromised fetus (strong, moderate).\n10. Health care providers may use prostaglandin E1 in the first or second trimester, but not in the third trimester with previous cesarean delivery or significant uterine surgery (strong, moderate).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 2, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/2023 SOGC临床实践指南：宫颈促成熟（No.432b）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Alcohol Septal Ablation. Imaging plays an important role in patient selection for alcohol (ethanol) septal ablation, with the goal of determining location of the increased septal thickness, dynamic obstruction, and presence of coexisting abnormalities that can indicate a preference for surgical intervention. These include the need for corrective mitral/papillary surgery as well as for extended myectomy when hypertrophy extends into the middle LV.\n\n【4】Echocardiography is essential for procedural guidance of alcohol septal ablation.\\[223-226\\] Ethanol is injected into one of the proximal septal perforator branches (which usually arises from the left anterior descending coronary artery) to produce localized myocardial infarction of the proximal anterior septum thereby reducing dynamic obstruction (Videos 5 to 8). The use of myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE) with the injection of echocardiographic contrast agent into the target septal artery (or arteries) to delineate the vascular distribution of the individual perforator branches is important to the success of the procedure. After the target septal perforator is identified and cannulated, a balloon catheter is advanced into the vessel and inflated to prevent backflow. Subsequently, 1 to 2 mL of a diluted contrast agent is injected through the balloon catheter followed by a 1-2 mL saline flush during continuous imaging. The contrast agent should be diluted with normal saline to optimize myocardial opacification and minimize attenuation.

Studies that use transcranial Doppler ultrasound or arterial spin labeling–MRI to measure CBFF and neurovascular coupling in individuals with WML provide additional support for neurovascular interactions and network connectivity as a substrate for preserving healthy brain aging.\n\n【1】Hypoperfusion in the gray matter may cause ischemic injury in the form of microinfarcts, which easily escape detection on conventional MRI because of their small size (on average, ≈200 μm postmortem examination). They are twice as frequent in individuals with dementia as in those who die without dementia. Clinical and animal studies suggest that small-vessel disease (including venular disease), hypoperfusion, and embolism can cause WML. Although the volume of each individual microinfarct is minuscule, the fact that they can number in the thousands in an individual brain and have effects on connectivity and neurovascular function beyond their borders suggests that they can have direct adverse effects on brain networks subserving cognition.\n\n【2】### Flow-Dependent Mechanisms Not Related to Ischemia\n\n【3】Recent experimental evidence has raised the possibility that neurovascular dysfunction has the potential to also alter cognitive function by disrupting the homeostasis of neuronal proteins or failing to deliver neurotrophic factors needed to maintain a healthy cognition. For example, a salt-rich diet induces cognitive impairment in mice in the absence of elevated blood pressure. Cognitive dysfunction depends on the gut-brain axis through which gut Th17 lymphocytes elevate circulating levels of interleukin-17, leading to a deficit in cerebral endothelial nitric oxide, endothelial dysfunction, and reduced resting CBF. However, these hemodynamic alterations do not play a role in cognitive dysfunction, which is instead mediated by a deficit in endothelial nitric oxide, which, in turn, leads to hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of tau, a protein involved in AD. Other studies have suggested that the increase in CBF induced by brain activity (functional hyperemia) does more than deliver oxygen and glucose to the brain. For example, hippocampal neurogenesis, which is essential for cognitive health, relies on functional hyperemia to deliver angiocrine factors to the neurogenic niche to support neuroblast survival. Failure of delivery of endothelial or circulating neurotrophic factors through blood flow has also been implicated in cognitive deficits in a model of autism (6p11.2 deletion syndrome). The relevance of these mechanisms to cognitive impairment in humans awaits further study.\n\n【4】删除图片描述:<u>![](9_0.png)</u>\n\n【5】### Failure of Clearance Mechanisms\n\n【6】Impaired perivascular clearance has been implicated in the pathophysiology of various neurological disorders. Reduced tracer movement was observed in experimental models of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, infarcts, apolipoprotein E isoforms trafficking, and hypertension. What these models have in common is impaired vessel function. In patients with cerebral small-vessel disease, loss of vessel function may contribute to the accumulation of proteins in the walls of blood vessels such as Aβ in cerebral amyloid angiopathy. This could lead into a feed-forward cycle of SMC loss, impaired clearance, and continued protein buildup, eventually resulting in vessel wall breakdown and ischemia or hemorrhage. A deeper understanding of perivascular waste clearance systems may elucidate their involvement in cognitive dysfunction and provide novel targets for intervention.\n\n【7】### Neuroimmune Mechanisms\n\n【8】Innate and adaptive immunity can have profound effects on cognitive function. Neutrophils, innate immune cells, have been shown to contribute to capillary stalling in a mouse model of AD, and blocking neutrophil-endothelium interactions improved cognitive function. In humans, hyperactivated neutrophils correlate with AD progression, whereas a higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio correlates with any dementia. PVMs are increased in aged and hypertensive rats and contribute to neurovascular and cognitive dysfunction in models of hypertension or amyloid accumulation through oxidative stress. Microglia are involved in the deleterious effects of amyloid and tau pathology and neuroinflammation in mouse models. Increased reactive oxygen species and proinflammatory cytokines, coupled with impaired migratory capacity and reduced Aβ phagocytosis, were found in blood monocytes of individuals with mild cognitive impairment and AD. As for adaptive immunity, loss of naive T cells during aging decreases T-cell diversity and favors the expansion of memory T cells, including memory effector T cells. The number of adaptive immune cells in the brain increases with age. For example, age-related increases in vascular-associated T cells were observed within the WM of monkeys. Clonally expanded interferon-γ–producing CD8+ T cells have been described in the subventricular zone of aged mice. Similarly, a higher proportion of activated CD8+ T cells are found in the CSF of patients with AD compared with their age-matched control subjects, which correlated with AD-related cognitive decline. An increased lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio was positively correlated with dementia incidence. In conclusion, although few animal studies have suggested a clear cause-effect relationship between increased immune cell trafficking to the brain and cognitive decline, correlative studies support an association of activated innate and", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 10, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/AHAASA科学声明：神经血管组在大脑健康和认知障碍中的关键作用.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

However, the Mayo Clinic performed a 5-year longitudinal study of 1819 patients aged ≥70 years and showed that exposure to general anesthesia and surgery was associated with subtle accelerated cognitive decline. \\[59\\]\n\n【4】On an individual patient basis, it is important to clarify what matters most to patients, and online resources are available to facilitate these discussions . In practice, it may be helpful to include a geriatrician and/or the patient’s primary care physician in treatment planning discussions. When planning operative treatment, it is helpful to clarify patients’ current living situation and existing support, to communicate goals for postoperative disposition as well as code status, and to have patients designate a surrogate decision-maker. Importantly, clinicians should recognize that patients’ goals of care may change during the perioperative period.\\[55\\]\n\n【5】In the emergency setting, it may be difficult to have comprehensive goals of care discussions with patients, particularly if they are septic or unstable, have cognitive impairment, or are otherwise unable to have a meaningful discussion. An interdisciplinary, 23-member expert panel recommended a structured communication framework addressing 9 key elements to facilitate decision-making among seriously ill older patients with emergency surgical conditions.\\[60\\] The difficulties with having discussions in the setting of emergency circumstances highlight the importance of taking the opportunity to engage patients and their families in early goals of care discussions, especially when patients have multiple comorbidities or a condition that may result in a subsequent emergency (eg, obstructing colorectal cancer).\\[61,62\\]\n\n【6】### 4. Cognitive function should be assessed preoperatively in frail older adults. Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 删除17:<u>1</u>C.\n\n【7】The prevalence of dementia in the United States is estimated to be 5% among 70- to 79-year-olds, 24% among 80- to 89-year-olds, and nearly 40% among people older than 90 years.\\[63\\] Meanwhile, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is distinguished from dementia in that the impairment is not severe enough to interfere with independent function. MCI is common among older adults, even those living independently, and affects up to 50% of patients older than 65 years.\\[64\\] Although the American College of Surgeons (ACS) and the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) recommend routinely assessing preoperative cognitive function and advocate using cognitive assessment tools such as the Mini-Cog preoperatively to detect MCI,\\[65\\] the results of studies evaluating an association between MCI and postoperative outcomes such as complications, length of stay, and mortality are mixed and studies have been underpowered.\\[66,67\\]\n\n【8】Nonetheless, the most compelling reason to evaluate for cognitive impairment preoperatively is to predict and prepare patients and caregivers for the likelihood of postoperative delirium; preoperative MCI is one of the strongest predictors of postoperative delirium.\\[68\\] In patients found to have cognitive impairment, it is advisable, when feasible, to involve a geriatrician and/or psychiatrist and to implement delirium risk reduction interventions such as orientation to staff and surroundings, sleep hygiene, early mobilization, and optimization of vision and hearing.\\[69-71\\] In addition, decision-making capacity may be diminished in patients with cognitive impairment or dementia, and family members, health-care surrogates, and primary care physicians should be included in the decision-making process in appropriately selected patients.\\[72\\] Upon returning home postoperatively, patients with cognitive or memory impairment may benefit from close surveillance from caregivers or home care services.\n\n【9】Culley et al studied 211 patients who underwent orthopedic surgery using the Mini-Cog, which includes a 3-item recall test and a clock-drawing task that tests visual-spatial representation, memory, recall, and executive function.

Because results of the trial did not demonstrate improved PFS or OS, ipilimumab/T-VEC combination therapy is a category 2B recommendation, only listed as an option for second or subsequent-line therapy (not first-line therapy), and is not a preferred option. Although anti-PD-1 therapy is generally preferred over ipilimumab, the NCCN Panel voted not to include combination therapy with T-VEC plus systemic anti-PD-1 therapy as a recommended option, both because there are insufficient randomized trial data on this specific combination, and because the effect of adding T-VEC to ipilimumab was fairly modest.\n\n【2】### Imatinib\nActivating KIT mutations are rare in patients with cutaneous melanoma, but for those who have them, imatinib may be helpful for disease control. Among patients with activating KIT mutations, fewer than half responded to imatinib, and randomized trials to assess impact on PFS and OS have not been conducted. For these reasons imatinib is not listed as a preferred agent, even for patients with qualifying mutations, but may be useful for those who are ineligible for or unresponsive to more effective therapies (ie, immune checkpoint inhibitors, BRAF-targeted therapy).\n\n【3】### Cytotoxic Therapy\nGiven that randomized trials have demonstrated that immune checkpoint inhibitors and BRAF-targeted regimens are all more effective than chemotherapy, cytotoxic therapy is not among the preferred options for systemic therapy, even in previously treated patients. For those who have failed or are ineligible for more effective options, however, cytotoxic therapy may be considered. Remarkable responses to cytotoxic therapies are occasionally observed, and these approaches can help with disease control or to reduce tumor load.\n\n【4】### Best Supportive Care\nGiven the number of effective options to choose from, active treatment is appropriate for most patients. Best supportive care is usually reserved for those with very poor performance status, who have experienced progression despite multiple lines of therapy, and are ineligible for the preferred systemic treatment options.\n\n【5】### Guidelines for Therapy Selection in Previously Treated Patients\nSelection of second-line or subsequent systemic therapy remains a significant challenge due to the lack of prospective randomized comparisons in this setting and the fact that much of the data are from patients whose prior therapies did not include those currently recommended as first-line options (ie, BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination, anti-PD-1 monotherapy, ipilimumab/nivolumab combination therapy). As part of an NCCN initiative to provide guidance on treatment selection considering the evidence, relative efficacy, toxicity, and other factors that play into treatment selection, the NCCN Melanoma Panel has categorized all recommended systemic therapy regimens as \"preferred,\" \"other recommended,\" or \"useful under certain circumstances.\" For second-line or subsequent systemic therapy for advanced disease, preference stratification is particularly challenging because preference is highly dependent upon the details of each patient’s clinical history. Many case-specific factors should be considered when selecting second-line therapy, including response and toxicities on prior therapies, rate of progression of the underlying disease (symptomatic or not), presence or absence of CNS progression, the presence of symptoms, patient physiologic reserve, and patient preference and compliance.\n\n【6】In general, if a patient experienced progression of melanoma during or shortly after a systemic therapy, re-challenge with the same therapy or therapy of the same class is unlikely to yield a response and is not recommended. The exception to this rule is that for patients who progressed on single-agent immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy,", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 187, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/（2024.V1）NCCN临床实践指南：皮肤黑色素瘤(1).pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Morphologically, these leukemic cells appear as small, mature lymphocytes that may be found admixed with occasional larger or atypical cells, or prolymphocytes. CLL remains the most prevalent adult leukemia in Western countries. In 2022, an estimated 20,160 people will be diagnosed with CLL in the United States, and an estimated 4410 people will die from the disease.\n\n【2】CLL and SLL are essentially different manifestations of the same disease and are managed in much the same way. The major difference is that in CLL, a significant number of the abnormal lymphocytes are found circulating in blood in addition to being resident in bone marrow and lymphoid tissue, while in SLL, the bulk of disease is in lymph nodes, bone marrow, and other lymphoid tissues and there are few (if any) abnormal lymphocytes circulating in blood.\n\n【3】Literature Search Criteria and Guidelines Update Methodology\nPrior to the update of this version of the NCCN Guidelines删除5:<u>®</u> for CLL/SLL, an electronic search of the PubMed database was performed to obtain key literature in CLL and SLL published since the previous Guidelines update using the following search terms: chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma, Richter syndrome, and histologic transformation. The PubMed database was chosen as it remains the most widely used resource for medical literature and indexes peer-reviewed biomedical literature.\n\n【4】The search results were narrowed by selecting studies in humans published in English. Results were confined to the following article types: Clinical Trial, Phase II; Clinical Trial, Phase III; Clinical Trial, Phase IV; Guideline; Randomized Controlled Trial; Meta-Analysis; Systematic Reviews; and Validation Studies.\n\n【5】The data from key PubMed articles as well as articles from additional sources deemed as relevant to these guidelines as discussed by the panel during the Guidelines update have been included in this version of the Discussion section. Recommendations for which high-level evidence is lacking are based on the panel’s review of lower-level evidence and expert opinion.\n\n【6】删除1:<u>The complete details of the Development and Update of the NCCN Guidelines are available at [www.NCCN.org].</u>\n\n【7】Staging\nThe Rai and Binet systems are the two staging systems currently used for the evaluation of patients with CLL, both in routine practice and clinical trial settings. Both staging systems rely on physical evidence (i.e., presence of lymph node involvement, enlarged spleen and/or liver) and blood parameters (presence of anemia or thrombocytopenia) to assess the degree of tumor burden.\n\n【8】The modified Rai classification stratifies patients into three risk groups: low-risk disease (Rai stage 0), intermediate-risk disease (Rai stage I–II), and high-risk disease (Rai stage III–IV) with median survival times of 150 months, 71 to 101 months, and 19 months, respectively.\n\n【9】The Binet staging system stratifies patients into three prognostic groups based on the number of involved areas and the level of hemoglobin and platelets and, similar to the Rai staging system, provides meaningful correlation with clinical outcome.\n\n【10】The Lugano Modification of the Ann Arbor Staging System is used for patients with SLL.\n\n【11】MS-2", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 44, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/_（2023.V3）NCCN临床实践指南：慢 性淋巴细胞白血病／小淋巴细胞淋巴瘤.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

The ORs, anesthetizing locations, and perioperative care locations comply with at least the minimum design and construction requirements of the national, provincial, and local building; plumbing; electrical; heating, ventilation, and air conditioning; fire; and security codes at the time of construction or renovation.\n2. Medical gas and vacuum systems, waste anesthetic gas scavenging systems, terminal units, head walls, low-pressure connecting assemblies, and pressure regulators meet the requirements of the CSA and are certified by a CSA-approved testing agency.\n3. Oxygen concentrators that comply with CSA requirements are an acceptable substitute for bulk oxygen supply systems. When such concentrators are installed, users must be aware that:\n    a. The facility medical oxygen supply may deliver a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO$_2$) that varies from 0.93 to 0.99;\n    b. Oxygen analyzers must be calibrated against 100% O$_2$ (FiO$_2$ 0.99) and room air or equivalent (FiO$_2$ 0.21); and\n    c.

There is a need for standardized guidelines on best practice with respect to the storage, preparation, identification, labelling, disposal, and use of medical gases, medications, and related materials.\n\n【2】With respect to medication safety, all efforts should be made to minimize the following errors: administration of the wrong drug, administration of the wrong drug formulation/concentration, administration to the wrong patient, administration of the wrong dosage, and administration via the wrong route.\n\n【3】All available safety systems and practices must be considered with respect to the design, implementation, and integration for the storage and administration of all medications. This includes specific considerations for medications delivered by the neuraxial route (epidural and intrathecal). It is highly recommended that facilities use strategies and equipment to reduce the risk of errors involving the wrong route of administration with respect to intravenous and neuraxial medications. Systems such as non-Luer lock, ISO 80369-6 small-bore neuraxial connection systems (e.g., NRFit删除5:<u>™</u>) should be considered when available. There should be specific, dedicated infusion pumps and infusion lines, without Luer lock injection ports, for administering neuraxial infusions that are noticeably dissimilar from intravenous pump infusion systems. Medications intended for neuraxial administration should have storage systems that are separate from those intended for intravenous or other routes of administration as far as possible. Health care facilities must be strongly encouraged to implement these safety systems across all clinical care areas.\n\n【4】a. General and specific medication safety recommendations include, but need not be restricted to:\n   - Identification of an anesthesia department lead/liaison or committee to coordinate with pharmacy for the promotion and practice of medication safety best practice.\n   - Particular attention should be paid to strategies that can mitigate the increased risk of errors associated with medication supplier brand packaging/labelling changes and lookalike medications.\n   - Different supplier brands of a specific medication should be placed in separate, automated medication dispensing systems (e.g., Omnicell删除5:<u>®</u>, Pyxis删除5:<u>™</u>).\n   - Medications should be placed in user storage systems such that the content labelling is clearly visible to the user (e.g., laying bottles and ampules flat not upright).\n   - There must be coordination and communication between pharmacy and anesthesia leadership to notify medication users of any upcoming packaging/labelling changes before they are implemented. This should ideally include colour photos of both the old and the new products. Anesthesia departments should then communicate this information as part of anesthesia care provider communications (e.g., high-alert memos).\n   - Application of highly visible (e.g., brightly coloured) high-alert stickers should be considered for medications when there is a supplier brand or concentration change, for medications that are highly concentrated and would produce harm if administered undiluted (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine, phenylephrine), and\n\n【5】...", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 10, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/加拿大麻醉医师学会：麻醉实践指南（2024修订版）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Introduction\n\n【1】Peripheral neuropathy (PN) defines damaged peripheral nerves resulting from many diseases. Diabetes is one of the common causes of peripheral neuropathy. Patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) may exhibit both positive and negative symptoms, where positive symptoms are painful or over-sensitized sensations, such as burning, electrical shock-like, and cold allodynia. While negative symptoms refer to a loss of regular sensory experiences like numbness and hypoesthesia 删除19:<u>(Inoue et al., 2016)</u>. The absence of protective sensation in patients with negative symptoms increases their susceptibility to foot ulceration. DPN can lead to severe conditions like ulcers, gangrene, and amputation, regardless of symptom manifestations. Some research reported that DPN accounts for 50–70% of non-traumatic amputations causing a massive loss of economy and productivity 删除19:<u>(Adler et al., 1999)</u>. Community pharmacists can play a crucial role in empowering patients to be aware of disease, early screenings, and treatment to prevent disease progression because patients can simply access community pharmacist’s counselling non-pharmacological and pharmacological approaches 删除19:<u>(Bodman & Varacallo, 2022)</u>. Neurotropic B vitamins (B1, B6, and B12) are often available as over the counter (OTC) in many regions. Due to various strengths of each marketed product, the therapeutic level for DPN management is concerned in terms of efficacy and safety. Currently, there is a few guidance of DPN management at primary care. Therefore, this expert guideline was developed to recommend the primary screening method for early screening and updated scientific data of neurotropic B vitamins in treatment. The ultimate goal of this guideline is to improve DPN patients care to avoid devasting severe complication from delayed treatment.\n\n【2】Certain materials may include the subjective opinions and clinical experiences of individuals. These are not mandatory to adhere to, and healthcare professionals can decide if they are suitable for their institution’s setting in order to provide the best possible outcome for their patients.\n\n【3】2. Methods\n\n【4】2.1. Study design and expert panel\n\n【5】A working group consisted of an endocrinologist, a neurologist, and three academic pharmacists. Members of the expert panel were selected based on the following criteria: a practicing neurologist or endocrinologist with more than 15 years of experience or pharmacist with the experience in pharmaceutical care; considerable experience in the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of DPN; previous experience as a committee for guideline development.

Medical history and synovial fluid analysis are important criteria for both the 2015 American College of Rheumatology/EULAR classification criteria^[9^] as well as the 2018 EULAR recommendations for the diagnosis of gout.^[8^] Similarly, the 2011 EULAR recommendation for CPPD includes both synovial fluid and tissue analysis to detect crystal deposits, as well as characteristic clinical features.^[3^] Diagnosis/classification criteria are lacking for BCPD; however, these diseases are generally diagnosed clinically with acceptable accuracy. Indeed, in a patient with acute joint symptoms and clear, macroscopic evidence of tophaceous gout or evidence of pathognomonic crystals on synovial fluid analysis or tissue analysis, imaging may not be necessary. In case imaging is employed, the clinical scenario will typically guide the choice and order of imaging examinations performed. Another crucial aspect to consider for diagnosis and/or appropriate monitoring is the anatomical site to be examined by imaging.\n\n【4】### Overarching statement E: imaging in CiAs should be performed and interpreted by trained healthcare professionals.\n\n【5】Task force members, in particular musculoskeletal radiologists, strongly felt that the complex and multifaceted nature of CiAs necessitates expertise in performing and analysing imaging findings. However, published literature is scarce about the predictable benefit of expertise in interpreting imaging examinations^[21-23^]; this issue should be clarified by future studies and has been added to the research agenda. When CT or DECT is considered, the basic principles of radiation protection, that is, justification, optimisation and limitation of radiation dose, must be always contemplated, as prescribed in the European Directive 2013/59/Euratom.^[24^]\n\n【6】### Recommendation 1: when performing imaging in CiAs, both symptomatic areas and disease-specific target sites (ie, first metatarsophalangeal in gout, knee and wrist in CPPD, shoulder in BCPD) should be considered.\n\n【7】The task force deemed it important to point out that in addition to areas that show clinical symptoms, also those commonly involved in individual CiAs should be examined by imaging. The term area was purposefully chosen to make it clear that CiAs commonly involve periarticular and other soft tissue structures such as tendons or ligaments which may also be targets of imaging. DECT and ultrasound can be used to identify MSU deposits in patients not showing clinical symptoms at the time of the examination, as seen in intercritical gout^[25^] but also in patients with asymptomatic hyperuricaemia or other rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases.^[27-31^]\n\n【8】### Recommendation 2: in the diagnostic assessment of gout, ultrasound and DECT are both recommended imaging modalities.\n\n【9】The majority of the studies for the diagnostic RQ on gout investigated either ultrasound or DECT with few studies on CR or CT.^[6^] Considering the overall evidence on the diagnostic use of various imaging techniques concerning gout, the task force considered it pertinent to specify these two techniques as the preferred modalities as opposed to CR or CT where the evidence was much less. Either one of these techniques can provide information that is helpful for making the diagnosis of gout, and the choice of technique should depend on the clinical scenario, in addition to availability and operator expertise. In general, early disease will warrant investigation with ultrasound rather than DECT, due to the capability of ultrasound to depict synovitis. In case of ultrasound, the term crystal deposition covers a plethora of findings, particularly double-contour sign and tophi, while for the purpose of DECT, crystal deposition is an overall term.^[32^] The overwhelming evidence of diagnostic utility for ultrasound in gout was demonstrated for crystal deposition, in particular double contour and tophi, rather than inflammation or bone erosion, while the evidence for DECT naturally concerns only crystal deposition. The task force acknowledges that access to DECT, and probably to a lesser extent to ultrasound, may be limited in certain countries, and at least the former, mostly available in academic or tertiary centres.^[33^] In such situations, or in case of financial or insurance-related limitations, modalities that are not specifically mentioned in the recommendation, but for which there is evidence and low cost, such as CR, may be applied.\n\n【10】### Recommendation 3: when characteristic features of MSU crystal deposition on ultrasound (ie, double-contour sign or tophi) or on DECT are identified, synovial fluid analysis is not needed to confirm a diagnosis of gout.\n\n【11】While evidence of MSU deposition in synovial fluid or tissue analysis remains the diagnostic hallmark, it has been recognised that this may not always be possible, due to unsuccessful arthrocentesis or lack of facilities/expertise to analyse joint fluid.^[34^] Other expert groups have acknowledged this, as evidenced also by recent classification criteria which consider imaging evidence of crystal deposition among the criteria in patients with imaging signs typical for gout or CPPD disease but lacking confirmation of relevant crystals of synovial fluid analysis in an appropriate clinical scenario suggestive of the disease 删除11:<u>(8-10)</u>. The decision on whether to perform arthrocentesis should be evaluated in the clinical context; however, as a general rule, this should always be attempted, whenever feasible, especially for ruling out other causes of acute arthritis, such as septic arthritis, regardless of whether there is previous evidence for gout for instance, positive DECT and hyperuricaemia. Indeed, gout may coexist with septic arthritis or CPPD, which would again necessitate synovial fluid to rule out/confirm differential diagnosis. It should be noted that while ultrasound may be useful to identify synovitis in gouty flares, there is only limited evidence for the use of DECT in visualising inflammation. However, both are capable of visualising MSU deposits, which have diagnostic utility in gout. Imaging findings should be interpreted carefully, taking into account the fact that they are not entirely specific (ie, double-contour sign is more typical of gout, but may be present in CPPD and also in asymptomatic hyperuricaemia).^[[29-31^, 删除21:<u>^35</u>^] Overall, the task force felt that the higher the number of typical signs present and in case of gout or CPPD, the larger the variety of findings (ie, double contour and synovitis with tophi), the more certain the diagnosis of CiA will be; this however needs to be demonstrated in future studies.\n\n【12】### Recommendation 4: in the diagnostic assessment of CPPD, CR and ultrasound (or CT if axial involvement is suspected) are recommended imaging modalities.\n\n【13】While the diagnosis of CPPD can be made in the absence of imaging, by demonstrating the presence of CPP crystals in synovial fluid or tissue, diagnostic imaging is usually required and performed in CiAs and indeed in most cases of CPPD.

PATIENTS RECEIVING ANTITHROMBOTIC THERAPY\n\n【1】#### Recommendations/Keypoints\n- For patients receiving antithrombotic therapy for stroke prevention, a BP target of < 130/80 mmHg is recommended (COR I, LOE B).\n\n【2】Elevated BP is closely related to the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage. In a prospective, multicenter, observational cohort study (BAT Study) of 4,009 Japanese patients taking oral antithrombotic agents for CV or cerebrovascular diseases, the optimal cutoff BP level to predict impending risk of ICH was ≥ 130/81 mmHg. Lowering SBP reduced ICH in the PROGRESS trial, in which the lowest risk of intracranial bleeding was observed in participants with the lowest follow-up SBP (median, 113 mmHg).\n\n【3】The management of BP is an important issue for atrial fibrillation (AF) patients since hypertension is the most common comorbidity associated with AF, which was present in 62.9% of Taiwan AF patients and the prevalence continuously increased to near 80%.\n\n【4】Close link between hypertension and increasing risk of major bleeding have been reported for AF patients in the subanalysis of RCTs. BP control is even more crucial for Asian AF patients who had a higher risk of ICH treated with oral anticoagulants. In the subanalysis of ENGAGE trial, patients with a SBP higher than 140 mmHg were associated with a significantly higher risk of major bleeding compared to those with a SBP between 130-140 mmHg. Of note, the risk of ischemic stroke/systemic embolism events was also significantly lower for patients with a SBP of \"110 to < 120 mmHg\" or \"120 to < 130 mmHg\". In the ROCKET-AF trial, each 10 mmHg increase of DBP was associated with a higher risk of ICH with a HR of 1.17 (95% CI: 1.01-1.36; p < 0.042). In the J-RHYTHM registry which included 7,406 Japanese AF patients, a higher incidence of systemic thromboembolism and major bleeding for patients treated with warfarin compared to those without was only observed among patients with a SBP ≥ 136 mmHg. The findings supported the concept that a well-managed BP could alleviate the risk of bleeding associated with oral anticoagulants.\n\n【5】### 17. ELDERLY PATIENTS\n\n【6】#### Recommendations/Keypoints\n- For patients aged ≥ 65 years, the SBP threshold for pharmacological therapy is ≥ 130 mmHg (COR I, LOE A).\n- For patients aged ≥ 65 years, the SBP target for pharmacological therapy is < 130 mmHg. (COR I, LOE B).\n\n【7】In a meta-analysis of individual data from one million adults from 61 prospective studies (Prospective Study Collaboration), BP was associated strongly with the age-specific mortality rates from stroke and IHD. In general, a 20 mmHg difference in SBP is approximately equivalent in its hazards to a 10 mmHg difference in DBP. These relationships with vascular mortality continued steeply down as far as a SBP of 115 mmHg and a DBP of 75 mmHg, below which there was little evidence. All of these proportional differences in vascular mortality were about half as extreme at ages 80-89 years as at ages 40-49 years, but the annual/absolute differences in risk were greater in old age. Similar findings were observed in the Asia Pacific Cohort Studies Collaboration and a Chinese cohort study. In the sub-analysis of the Felodipine Event Reduction (FEVER) trial, the relative risk reduction of CV events was greater in patients aged > 65 years compared with those aged ≤ 65 years.

In NHS clinical practice, a tranexamic acid dose of 15 mg/kg is used in people under 16 with extracranial injuries. But, in this age group, tranexamic acid is not currently widely used for isolated head injury and dosing is variable (15 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg). Evidence for people 16 and over with a head injury from a pre-hospital setting suggested that a 2 g dose of tranexamic acid reduced all-cause mortality (at 28 days and 6 months), with no evidence of negative effects. So, the committee concluded that it could recommend the equivalent of a 2 g dose of tranexamic acid for people under 16. They discussed that, based on the average weight of people 16 and over being 70 kg, a 2 g dose of tranexamic acid for people 16 and over would equate to a 30 mg/kg dose for people under 16. So, they concluded that a dose range of 15 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg was appropriate for people under 16.\n\n【2】For people with mild traumatic brain injury, it is less clear whether the benefits of tranexamic acid outweigh the potential risk of blood clots. So, the committee made a [recommendation for research on tranexamic acid](#) for this group.\n\n【3】### How the recommendations might affect practice or services\n\n【4】Tranexamic acid is already used for people who have a head injury and other major trauma. NICE has not previously recommended it for people with an isolated head injury. It is expected that doing so will increase tranexamic acid use by paramedics. This should lead to improved survival for people with a head injury. More resources might be needed for treatment, rehabilitation and care for the people who would not have survived without tranexamic acid.\n\n【5】[Return to recommendations](#)\n\n【6】### Direct access from the community to imaging\n\n【7】#### Recommendation 1.3.19", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 53, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/2023 NICE 指南 ：颅脑损伤的评估和早期处理[NG232].pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Patients undergoing endovascular repair for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm in whom imaging was performed during permissive hypotension, should be considered for stent graft oversizing of up to 30%.\n77. In ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, intra-operative administration of systemic anticoagulation with heparin should be considered once the rupture bleeding has been controlled.\n78. Patients with a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm should be considered for post-operative deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis with low molecular weight or unfractionated heparin unless there are signs of ongoing bleeding or of a clinically significant coagulopathy.\n84. For patients undergoing open or endovascular treatment for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm in whom colonic ischaemia is suspected, flexible sigmoidoscopy should be considered, to confirm the diagnosis.\n91. For patients undergoing complete explantation of an infected aortic graft or stent graft, in situ reconstruction using biological graft material should be considered the preferred repair modality.\n95. For patients with aorta or graft enteric fistula, adjuvant antifungal therapy should be considered, until fungal infection has been properly investigated.\n96. For patients treated for aortic graft or stent graft infection deemed at high risk of re-infection or when complete graft removal is not achieved, long term culture specific antibiotic therapy should be considered.\n97. For patients undergoing open repair of graft enteric fistula, assessment and management of the enteric defect by a gastrointestinal surgeon should be considered.\n100. For patients treated for abdominal aortic aneurysm who are distressed by post-operative new onset sexual dysfunction, referral to specialist teams should be considered.\n101. For patients with para-anastomotic aneurysm formation after previous abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, infection as underlying cause should be considered.\n102. For patients with non-infectious aorto-iliac para-anastomotic aneurysm formation after previous abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, endovascular repair should be considered preferentially.\n103. For patients with compromised proximal seal* after endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, proximal extension with fenestrated and branched devices should be considered in preference to other endovascular techniques.\n117. For patients undergoing endovascular repair of complex abdominal aortic aneurysms, consideration should be given to limiting the aortic coverage to reduce the risk of spinal cord ischaemia, however without compromising the proximal sealing zone.\n118. During endovascular aortic repair of complex abdominal aortic aneurysms, the use of intra-operative image fusion should be considered, to reduce radiation exposure, contrast volume, and operating time.\n126. For patients undergoing endovascular repair of a complex abdominal aortic aneurysm as a strategy to preserve renal function by dose reduction of iodine contrast media, withdrawal of nephrotoxic drugs and ensuring adequate hydration should be considered.\n127. For endovascular repair of complex abdominal aortic aneurysm, preservation of large accessory renal arteries (≥ 4 mm) should be considered.\n133. Patients with target vessel obstruction after complex abdominal aortic aneurysm repair should be considered for prompt evaluation for possible revascularisation.\n134. For patients with an iliac artery aneurysm (common iliac artery, internal iliac artery, and external iliac artery, or combination thereof), imaging surveillance using ultrasound should be considered; every three years for aneurysms 删除13:<u>20 – 24</u> mm in diameter, every two years for aneurysms 删除13:<u>25 – 29</u> mm in diameter, and yearly for aneurysms ≥ 30 mm, taking into account life expectancy, suitability for future repair, concomitant aortic dilatation, and patient preferences.\n160. Use of decision support tools to assist patients in their decisions about the management of abdominal aortic aneurysms being considered for repair should be considered.\n\n【3】### New Class IIB recommendations\n\n【4】44. Patients undergoing elective endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair may be considered for locoregional anaesthesia in preference to general anaesthesia.\n71. Intra-operative use of activated clotting time (ACT) may be considered during open and endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, to measure the effect of heparin in the individual patient and guide additional heparin administration.\n51. Reconstruction of the left renal vein after its division during open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair may be considered if important collaterals have been sacrificed.\n71. After endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture into the inferior vena cava, subsequent endovascular closure of the aortocaval fistula may be considered in the presence of an endoleak associated with increased cardiac output, heart failure, or pulmonary embolism.\n89. Patients treated with endovascular abdominal aortic repair who present with symptomatic, evolving, or haemodynamically significant thrombus formation inside the stent graft may be considered for individualised intervention or escalation of antithrombotic therapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 7, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/2024+ESVS临床实践指南：腹主动脉-髂动脉动脉瘤的管理.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Many reports on stroke scales, emergency medical service (EMS) training and educational programmes, structured EMS pre-notification to hospital stroke teams, emergency department streamlining and different triage pathways (mothership vs drive the doctor vs drip and ship) have all demonstrated an improvement of treatment numbers and times, but timely delivery of the available and highly beneficial reperfusion therapies (IVT and mechanical thrombectomy (MT)) to AIS patients is still underachieved. Furthermore, delays in onset to treatment times correlate to longer hours to reperfusion times in AIS patients with primary intracranial occlusion treated with IVT. Similarly, for patients with intracranial haemorrhage (ICH), the time to treatment and thus time to diagnosis is critical. Large haematoma volumes and haematoma expansion are associated with poor clinical outcome leading to a recommendation for early BP management. Furthermore, given the fact that the use of anticoagulation has been associated with haematoma growth, anticoagulation reversal represents a key treatment option for ICH patients on anticoagulation therapy.\n\n【5】Many of these strategies depend on a quick differentiation of stroke patients from those with so-called stroke mimicking diseases or different subtypes of stroke, which strongly depends on the training and expertise of the individual teams involved as well as brain imaging availability. To optimise access to treatments and the acute management of stroke patients, strategies crossing institutional boundaries are needed and have to also involve the prehospital stage.\n\n【6】Over the last 18 years, a new concept for acute stroke management using Mobile Stroke Unit (MSU) ambulances has emerged and evolved. MSUs are emergency ambulances equipped with a computed tomography (CT) scanner for multimodal brain imaging (including CT angiography with or without CT perfusion), point-of-care blood analysis, telemedicine connection to stroke centres and dedicated and specialised teams on board, who if not part of their medical education, received additional training in stroke medicine删除1:<u>. There are increasing numbers of stroke centres worldwide using MSUs to provide acute stroke care to their patients (world map with active centres on [www.prestomsu.org]). Reported results indicate an earlier treatment, increased numbers of patients receiving treatment and optimised triage to the individually required level of care. Most importantly, some studies have resulted in clinical benefits for patients treated with a MSU rather than conventional stroke care. In view of the former considerations and to address the current knowledge gap on this topic, we set out to provide the first guideline on the use of MSUs for stroke care. The current guideline aims to provide recommendations about whether MSU ambulances are of advantage for prehospital stroke management and to facilitate decision-making when considering MSU implementation as a service improvement. However, at the time of the emergency call a definite diagnosis is not clear and MSU ambulances will be involved in the assessment and treatment of patients with suspected stroke as well as those with confirmed ischaemic or haemorrhagic stroke. Therefore, for patients with suspected stroke, who require the operation of a MSU within the EMS, the service improvement aspects outweigh the confirmation of the diagnosis in the prehospital setting. To reflect this operational aspect, we combined all issues to one recommendation only, which can be found at the end of the result section.</u>\n\n【7】## Methods\n\n【8】This guideline was initiated by the European Stroke Organisation (ESO) and prepared according to ESO standard operating procedures, which are based on the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) system. The ESO Guideline Committee and Executive Committee reviewed the intellectual and financial disclosures of the module working group (MWG) members and approved the composition of the group, which was co-chaired by the first (SW) and last (G Tsivgoulis) authors.\n\n【9】The MWG undertook the following steps:\n\n【10】1. Produced a list of topics of clinical interest to Guideline users that were agreed by all MWG members.\n2. Three Patient Intervention Comparator Outcome (PICO) questions were developed and agreed upon within the MWG following a teleconference and e-mail correspondence. The three PICO questions were related to the following populations: patients with suspected stroke, patients with confirmed AIS & patients with confirmed acute ICH.

Multiple studies since have shown correlations between smoking and renal dysfunction, with the PREVEND study suggesting that smoking >20 cigarettes per day lead to elevated risk for high urine albumin concentrations. Studies in the general population have also shown that those with a history of smoking have a marked risk for microalbuminuria, indicating irreversible kidney damage. Alongside the effect on smoking on renal function, this work indicates that the well-known risks of smoking on cardiovascular morbidities is concurrent in kidney patients and as such similar recommendations should be made in the non-dialysis CKD population as those suffering from cancer and cardiovascular disease states删除1:<u>.

The current evidence base looks to break alcohol consumption down into two categories, those that suffer from excess alcohol intake and one patient group, approximately 20–36% of patients consume alcohol in light or moderate quantities with approximately 10% showing behaviors classified as excess alcohol intake. Research suggests that alcohol intake within the recommended guidelines for the general population should not further exacerbate their condition, though decisions should be made on a per patient basis, with those with other co-morbidities (e.g. Diabetes) requiring greater considerations.

Advanced imaging can be considered in cases where patients may benefit from it. Emergent situations should be treated prior to further investigative studies or interventions. Consider medical management to treat focal neurologic deficits, seizure, and pain (ie, dexamethasone, antiepileptics, acetaminophen). However, medications that may alter the patient’s neurologic examination or increase surgical risks (eg, narcotics) should be avoided. Outside of emergent clinical presentations, multidisciplinary case discussion should be utilized for treatment planning and optimization of patient care, including radiation oncology, neurosurgery, radiology, and oncology/neuro-oncology. Physical therapy/occupational therapy and sleep and swallow assessments can be considered to assist with comorbidity management and referral to a child life social worker can be considered for family/patient support.\n\n【2】**Surgical Procedure**  \nStudy-level and individual patient data meta-analyses, as well as a small number of prospective and retrospective studies have demonstrated an association between greater extent of resection and improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with pediatric diffuse high-grade gliomas. In the HIT-GBM study of 85 pediatric patients with malignant non-pontine gliomas, gross total resection (GTR) was the strongest predictor of OS and event-free survival (EFS). In the HIT-GBM-C study, 5-year OS was significantly improved in patients with tumors that were completely resected prior to combination chemoradiotherapy (63%; N = 21) when compared to historical controls (17%; P = .003).\n\n【3】Nearly all diffuse high-grade gliomas recur. Re-resection at the time of recurrence may improve outcomes, although evidence varies widely. As in adult patients with diffuse high-grade gliomas, tumor involvement in specific critical brain areas and poor performance status may be associated with unfavorable re-resection outcomes.\n\n【4】**Postoperative Management**  \nAfter surgical resection, patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, fluctuations in blood pressure, and sodium and serum osmolarity. Prophylaxis for seizures, infections, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) can be considered.\n\n【5】**Principles of Radiation Therapy Management**  \nRT plays an essential role in the adjuvant treatment of patients with pediatric diffuse high-grade gliomas who are aged 3 years and older. Out of concern for long-term complications with brain development, it is reasonable to omit RT in patients younger than 3 years. Child life specialists, audio and video distraction techniques, and other pediatric-friendly interventions are recommended to improve pediatric tolerance of RT without anesthesia. The dose of RT administered varies depending on the setting and pathology. See Principles of Radiation Therapy Management in the algorithm for specific information.\n\n【6】Following surgery, patients aged 3 years and older with pediatric diffuse high-grade gliomas (except for those with pontine DMG) are treated with RT combined with concurrent and/or adjuvant systemic therapy. Initiation of RT is recommended whenever the patient has recovered from surgery and should begin within 4 to 8 weeks of resection. Intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) is used in most instances to allow reduction of risk or magnitude of side effects from treatment. Accepted normal tissue constraints should be used, and although the prognosis of these patients is often poor, as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) principle still applies to the lenses, retina, pituitary gland/hypothalamus, cochlea, lacrimal glands, hippocampi, temporal lobes, spinal cord, and uninvolved brain. Normal tissue constraints can be found in the Principles of Radiation Therapy Management in the algorithm. Proton therapy, which offers maximal sparing of normal tissue, may be considered for patients with better prognoses (eg, IDH1-mutated tumors, 1p/19q-codeleted, younger.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 34, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/儿童中枢神经系统肿瘤.V2_EN (1).pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Arterial and venous anatomy with emphasis on cerebral vessels that require navigation during stroke interventions including common variants and cerebral territories and their neurological function supplied by the respective vessels treated by endovascular means.\n2. Identification of difficult arch and bovine aortic arch.\n3. Establishment of carotid and vertebral artery accesses.\n4. Carotid artery thrombectomy and stenting including familiarity with proximal and distal protection, stent designs, balloon angioplasty, thrombectomy catheters, and complication recognition and management.\n5. Wiring tortuous cerebral anatomy.\n6. Preparation and use of equipment for EVT such as balloon tipped sheaths, cerebral microcatheters, thrombectomy devices, stent retrievers, and aspiration catheters.\n7. Catheter-based local intra-arterial lytic therapy.\n8. Management strategies for persistent vessel occlusion after first- or multiple-pass attempts of thrombectomy device use.\n9.

Antithrombotic and antiplatelet medications.\n11. Patient and arterial blood pressure management.\n12. Pros and cons of local versus general anaesthesia in different scenarios.\n\n【2】Demonstration of sufficient knowledge of the above areas requires passing a written standardized test administered by the WIST.\n\n【3】### 9. Hands-on practical training\n\n【4】Before thrombectomy is independently performed by an interventionalist, in addition to passing the previously mentioned standardized clinical and procedural knowledge tests, a minimum number of cerebrovascular interventions is required. These may have already been performed by the applying physician during their clinical practice or can be acquired during supervised training on high-fidelity simulators or human cadaver models.\n- Selective cerebral angiography 60 (this may include angiography performed as part of carotid stenting procedures)\n- Carotid artery stenting 50\n- Cerebrovascular thrombectomy 25 (including both anterior and posterior circulation)\n\n【5】The above-described procedures can be performed at any institution as primary operator or under the guidance of a proctor (documented in a procedure log) and/or under the guidance of a WIST qualified proctor using a high-fidelity simulator meeting predefined standards. This will cover a range of scenarios including emergency and rescue procedures. Proficiency must be demonstrated by simulated acute stroke interventions at a WIST qualified simulation centre.\n\n【6】A successful acute stroke/IM program is the result of a team effort, which ideally includes a stroke and imaging specialist and an interventionalist able to perform endovascular stroke treatment and support staff with sufficient knowledge of pre-, peri-, and postprocedural stroke care and able to manage arterial line and invasively monitored blood pressure. The WIST certifies, on an annual basis, intervention centres that are deemed competent to perform acute stroke interventions. Centre certification requirements include:\n1. Comprehensive training undertaken by all key specialties of the thrombectomy service according to the guidance of the WIST.\n2. Evaluation of the stroke/thrombectomy service during a WIST inspection visit.\n\n【7】Key elements that must be identified during the inspection visit are as follows:\n1. Required hospital environment:\n   - Engagement of hospital leadership and specialties involved in stroke care pathways.\n   - Governance lead for the endovascular stroke service.\n   - Governance for pathways selection, imaging, pre-, peri- and postprocedural care in place.\n   - Named lead for Hospital Quality Management that guides the process.\n   - Storage of patient and procedure critical data to ensure data availability for internal and external audit including symptom and door to arterial puncture, device deployment, and recanalization time.\n   - Conduct of internal audits with integrated quality improvement process. The goal of this is to optimize the pre-, peri-, and postprocedural processes and thus improve patient outcomes.\n2.

Zivelonghi et al performed successful angiography in 65 out of 66 subjects after TAVI (25 self-expanding THVs with a supra-annular leaflet position and 41 balloon-expandable THVs with an intra-annular leaflet position); only one artery was not accessible because of a high implantation of an Evolut R (Medtronic) THV 54. However, Blumenstein et al reported that selective cannulation of the coronary ostium was feasible in all patients who received balloon-expandable valves but only in 80% of THs treated with supra-annular self-expanding prostheses 55.\n\n【1】Thus, decision-making on PCI in patients scheduled for TAVI should be based on patient characteristics, including the presence or absence of angina, CAD severity, lesion location and complexity, and type of implanted THV. The evidence base is limited but, in general, does not support routine PCI prior to TAVI in asymptomatic lesions and suggests that when PCI is performed, a separate staged procedure prior to TAVI is preferable.\n\n【2】The ongoing 900-patient TAVI PCI Trial 删除19:<u>(ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04310046)</u> randomises patients 1:1 to FFR-guided PCI 1-45 days before or after implantation of a SAPIEN 3 (Edwards Lifesciences) THV. This study will also inform current practice on the value of invasive coronary physiological assessment of intermediate coronary lesions in AS patients, as a second iFR measurement in the group undergoing PCI after TAVI is planned. The aforementioned COMPLETE TAVR trial is currently randomising 4,000 TAVI patients with severe CAD (i.e., at least one coronary artery lesion of ≥70% visual angiographic diameter stenosis in a native segment that is at least 2.5 mm in diameter, excluding chronic total occlusions) to staged complete revascularisation after TAVI with a balloon-expandable valve versus medical management alone.\n\n【3】### ANGIOGRAPHY-GUIDED VERSUS PHYSIOLOGY-GUIDED PCI\nAngiography alone versus physiology-guided revascularisation was compared in a propensity score-matched analysis of 318 patients with AS. Following FFR, the number of diseased vessels was downgraded (from 1.85±0.97 to 1.48±1.00; p<0.01) and significantly lower than in the angiography-alone group (1.48±1.00 vs 1.80±0.97; p<0.01) without significant differences in MACE at 5 years 56.\n\n【4】The FAITAVI 删除19:<u>(Functional Assessment In TAVI; ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT03360591)</u> trial is randomising patients with severe AS and CAD to percutaneous myocardial revascularisation dictated according to an angiography-guided versus physiology-guided (i.e., FFR/iFR) strategy and evaluating the incidence of MACE, bleeding and target lesion failure at 24 months. The FAITAVI trial will also inform current practice.\n\n【5】At present, there are no randomised studies comparing complete versus incomplete revascularisation in patients with stable CAD undergoing TAVI. Thus, no recommendations can be made. A Heart Team-based decision of the most appropriate revascularisation strategy for TAVI patients should be aimed for in all cases.\n\n【6】### ANTITHROMBOTIC THERAPY POST-TAVI AND PCI\nAntithrombotic therapy after TAVI remains a field of rapidly evolving evidence. Recent data suggest that monotherapy (either single antiplatelet therapy [SAPT] or oral anticoagulant therapy [OAC]) is associated with better clinical outcomes than dual therapy (dual antiplatelet therapy [DAPT] or SAPT+OAC) 57,58. Consequently, the standard treatment after TAVI is aspirin, while patients with an indication for OAC should receive this as monotherapy. However, treatment should also be adjusted to patient-specific factors such as CAD, and in particular recent PCI, with DAPT prescribed according to existing clinical practice guidelines for patients with recent acute coronary syndromes and/or PCI. The balance between the benefit of reduction of ischaemic events and the risk of bleeding remains the major determinant in decision-making, as TAVI patients often have concomitant high bleeding", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 6, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/2023 EAPCI临床共识声明：接受经导管主动脉瓣植入术患者冠状动脉疾病的管理.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

A femoral artery approach is conventional, but radial or brachial artery access are alternatives. The initial technology used was 0.035-inch, and now small-diameter renal arteries using 0.014-inch platforms are being deployed with lower complication rates. Recent consensus guidelines recommend establishing the presence of a hemodynamically significant stenosis, defined as $>70\\%$ lumen occlusion or mean gradient exceeding 10 mm Hg across the lesion or a fractional flow reserve <0.8 before revascularization. Stenotic FMD lesions may be treated with balloon angioplasty alone. ARVD lesions may be treated with angioplasty and stent placement, because both primary patency and restenosis are more favorable with stenting.\n\n【3】#### Potential Complications\n\n【4】Potential complications occurring during renal artery stent placement include atheroembolism, dissection, renal artery rupture, and thrombosis. These complications occur in 3% to 5% of patients. Complication rates have decreased with the use of lower-profile renal artery stent delivery systems. Some studies have demonstrated that atheroembolism can be prevented using embolic protection devices. These devices have been used for coronary and carotid artery application but have been used off label for treating renal artery stenosis. There are few data that compare technical outcomes for different platforms for renal artery interventions. Restenosis can occur, with rates between 13% and 39% by duplex ultrasound, often within a year. Many of these are asymptomatic.\n\n【5】### Accessory Renal Arteries\n\n【6】Patients with early bifurcation of the anterior and posterior renal arteries with a stenosis involving the bifurcation or involving an accessory renal artery pose a special challenge. An example of early bifurcation stenosis is shown in Supplemental Figure S2. In this situation, kissing renal artery stents can be placed through a 7F guide catheter with 2 drug-eluting coronary stents placed side-by-side as described elsewhere. Approximately one-third of patients have an accessory renal artery. These arteries are often smaller but can have stenoses that may cause hypertension. The normal renal artery measures 5 to 7 mm, and accessory arteries measure 2 to 3.5 mm. Stenosis of a smaller-caliber artery is amenable to placement of a drug-eluting stent, as used in the coronary vasculature. This can be done in the setting of a separate origin that arises from the main renal artery.\n\n【7】### Role for Renovascular Surgery\n\n【8】The role of open renal revascularization has changed with the widespread use of angioplasty and stenting. The number of open renal reconstructions steadily decreased from 1.3 to 0.3 per 100000 adults between 1988 and 2009, in part, because of higher associated morbidity and mortality. Open renal reconstruction is reserved for a select group of patients with specific indications, primarily patients in whom previous endovascular procedures failed or who have complex renal lesions affecting arterial bifurcations, distal renal artery, or subsegmental branch vessels. Longer dysplastic lesions and medial fibroplasia involving branches or complicated by a renal artery aneurysm are more suited for open reconstruction and may need ex vivo techniques because of prolonged renal ischemia. Concomitant aortic procedures to treat aneurysm or occlusive disease may favor the use of open renal revascularization if clinically indicated. Children with hypoplastic renal lesions, including those in whom open or endovascular procedures failed or who have lesions associated with abdominal aortic coarctation, benefit from open renal revascularization.\n\n【9】### Extrarenal Reconstructions\n\n【10】The primary goal of open aortic reconstruction techniques is to address all hemodynamically significant renal artery disease in a single operation . One exception is the patient with complex bilateral renal lesions who needs ex vivo renal artery reconstruction. Such patients are treated in 2 staged procedures. The choice of specific reconstruction takes into consideration the selection of incision, source of inflow (eg, direct or extraanatomic), the need for a conduit, and adjunctive techniques of renal preservation.\n\n【11】Direct reconstruction with aortorenal bypass has been most commonly used because of excellent inflow and lower rates of stenosis or occlusion. The proximal anastomosis is usually done in the infrarenal aorta or supra-celiac aorta.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 9, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/AHA：肾血管疾病的血运重建的科学声明（2022）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

The apparent bidirectional relationship between pre-eclampsia and placental insufficiency remains a paradox in the field that can hinder accurate inferences about RAAS measurements observed in preclinical models and clinical studies. Placental insufficiency in preclinical models and in women may be a precursor to maternal hypertensive disorders. Preeclampsia, in turn, exacerbates placental insufficiency and may program adverse cardiovascular health in affected women and their offspring independently of placental insufficiency.

Dose prescription method.\n\n【9】The dose is prescribed at the ICRU reference point. That point is generally the intersection of the beam axes for simple techniques. For more complex techniques such as rotational beams or non-coplanar beams, x-ray photons with energy ranging from 4 to 25 MV are used (linear accelerator).\n\n【10】#### 3.4.1.3. Beam modifiers.\n\n【11】Multileaf collimators and filters are used to adapt to the skull curvature.\n\n【12】#### 3.4.2. Intensity-modulated conformal radiotherapy\n\n【13】IMRT is currently being evaluated to determine the option to increase the dose received by the tumour (hypofractionation, concomitant boost) with or without the use of functional imaging (PET, multiparametric MRI) to improve local control rates 删除12:<u>[19,50–54]</u>. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is an option to better protect organs at risk 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[55,56]</u></u>.

Clinical trials generally allow a period of six months to elapse before offering reirradiation;\n- Karnofsky index: a score > 70% is often reported as a prognostic factor;\n- age of patients: age was not reported to be a prognostic factor;\n- tumour volume: tumour volume does not seem to be a prognostic factor due to variable values in the series, with these values also relating to the type of radiotherapy. Volume appears more to be a determining factor of toxicity;\n- histological grade: despite conflicting outcomes, the prognosis of grade III tumours is better than grade IV after reirradiation.\n\n【22】##### 3.4.3.2.2. Radiation techniques.\n\n【23】Stereotactic radiotherapy is the main technique used for the treatment of recurrences, in a single or hyperfractionated (hypo- or normofractionated) session in view of the fact that tolerance of multifractionated methods is superior 删除12:<u>[55–58]</u>.\n\n【24】The proposed doses/fractionation are:\n\n【25】- 36 Gy at a rate of 2 Gy per day on the 90% isodose 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[60]</u></u>;\n- 30–35 Gy at a rate of 3–3.5 Gy per day, i.e., 删除17:<u>20–40</u> Gy, limiting the doses per fraction < 5 Gy to the isodose envelope of 80–90%.

In these studies, different imaging strategies are performed on randomised groups followed by management on the basis of the results, to compare patient outcomes after different imaging strategies. Therefore, the committee used their knowledge and experience to conclude that clinical assessment is the best form of diagnosis at this point. The committee agreed that CT is most useful when there is a clinical suspicion of an alternative diagnosis that CT could detect. It should not be routinely performed for everyone with a suspected TIA because it rarely confirms a diagnosis in these patients.\n\n【4】Routine CT imaging is common in current practice and the committee agreed that this could waste resources, extend the length of stay in the emergency department, and expose people to unnecessary radiation.\n\n【5】The committee discussed the possible risks of not offering CT brain imaging to everyone with a suspected TIA. They agreed that, in the absence of clinical 'red flag' indicators (for example, headache, anticoagulation, head injury, repetitive stereotyped events), it is rare for a CT scan to reveal an alternative diagnosis needing a different referral pathway. Therefore, the number of referrals to TIA clinics should not increase greatly.\n\n【6】In a TIA clinic, not all people will need an MRI.

In many cases, symptoms were mild and transient 删除19:<u>(Anderson and Reti, 2009; Miller, 1994)</u>. No maternal deaths were reported.\n\n【2】Among 339 cases summarised by Anderson and Reti 删除11:<u>删除19:<u>(2009)</u></u>, 11 foetal or neonatal deaths were reported, one of which was attributed to the treatment: it occurred in the context of maternal status epilepticus following three successive stimuli administered during ECT. Leiknes et al. 删除11:<u>删除19:<u>(2015)</u></u> found a high rate of complications in their systematic review of case reports and series, including 12 foetal and neonatal deaths among 169 cases. However, the authors did not state whether these outcomes were caused or thought to be caused by ECT. This review included all adverse maternal and foetal outcomes among complications of ECT even if they were highly unlikely to be related to the treatment, such as, for example, anencephaly and other congenital anomalies. This approach led the authors to call for great caution when considering the use of ECT in pregnancy. The authors of the other four systematic reviews 删除19:<u>(Anderson and Reti, 2009; Calaway et al., 2016; Miller, 1994; Pompili et al., 2014)</u> - while acknowledging the difficulties with interpreting case literature - concluded that ECT is an effective treatment for severe mental illness during pregnancy and that the risks to mother and foetus are relatively low. This view is shared by publications of the Royal College of Psychiatrists 删除19:<u>(Gregoire and Soosay, 2019)</u>, the APA 删除19:<u>(American Psychiatric Association Committee on Electroconvulsive Therapy, 2019)</u>, and the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists 删除19:<u>(Weiss et al., 2019)</u>.\n\n【3】To achieve the optimal outcomes for mother and child, it is important that professionals with expertise in ECT, perinatal psychiatry and obstetrics are involved in a decision to deliver ECT during pregnancy 删除19:<u>(Weiss et al., 2019)</u>. It is essential that clinicians identify pre-existing risk factors for poor outcomes, appropriately monitor maternal and foetal well-being before, during and after the procedure, and utilise effective preventative interventions. The location and team composition conducting the ECT and what measures should be taken before, during and after the procedure to prevent maternal and foetal complications depend on the stage of pregnancy 删除19:<u>(Lakshman et al., 2014)</u>.\n\n【4】There is evidence from three observational studies that ECT is more effective for women with severe affective disorders after childbirth than for non-postnatal patients 删除19:<u>(Haxon et al., 2016; Cantwell, 1999; Rogers et al., 2017)</u>. These studies suggest that it may be beneficial to consider ECT as a treatment option for women with severe mental illness who are experiencing postpartum depression or psychosis, particularly if they are not responding to medication and/or have a high risk of suicide or pose risks to the baby, including during breastfeeding after treatment.\n\n【5】Due to inherent methodological difficulties, considerable uncertainties exist in the evidence, and research findings should be interpreted with caution.\n\n【6】### Recommendations for catatonia in the perinatal period\n\n【7】- If catatonia is severe and the woman suffers from a mental illness, the psychiatric and obstetric team should make a joint decision as to which inpatient setting is most appropriate for treatment.

A systematic approach to hypotension should be used, as shown in Figure 1.\nLevel of Evidence: C.\n\n【1】### Neurohormonal blockade and treatment of hypertension post-MCS implant\n\n【2】Medical therapy is a critical component of the care of LVAD patients, and neurohormonal blockade should be started following vasopressor wean during the postoperative period. The primary goals of medical therapy during this phase of care include volume management, treatment of systemic hypertension and optimization of RV function. Early initiation of neurohormonal blockade may also provide long-term benefits for ventricular reverse remodeling and myocardial recovery during LVAD support 删除11:<u>(20-22)</u>.\n\n【3】Hypertension increases pump afterload and impairs LVAD function. Due to the association of hypertension with hemorrhagic stroke in LVAD patients 删除11:<u>(23)</u>, blood pressure management should be initiated to maintain a mean arterial pressure 75 to 90 mm Hg for patients on continuous flow LVAD support. 删除11:<u>(删除13:<u>11, 24</u>)</u> Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are well established vasodilator therapies in heart failure patients, and their use is recommended in LVAD patients as well. Observational data support a role for ACE inhibitors and ARBs in the reduction of gastrointestinal bleeding due to arteriovenous malformations 删除11:<u>(25-27)</u>. In particular, one study showed marked reductions in subsequent gastrointestinal bleeding when ACE inhibitors or ARBs were started within the first 30 postoperative days.删除11:<u>(25)</u> If additional afterload reduction is required, or if ACE inhibitor/ARB use is limited or contraindicated, hydralazine and nitrates can be introduced. Nitrates should not be given if the patient is already being treated by a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor. 删除11:<u>(28)</u> There are presently no large studies available to support the use of angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors in LVAD patients, but they may be considered in carefully selected patients who well tolerate moderate doses of ACE inhibitor/ARB therapy. It is important to monitor for medication side-effects, including headaches (nitrates and milrinone), nausea (hydralazine and milrinone), and cough or angioedema (ACE inhibitors and ARNIs).\n\n【4】While neurohormonal blockade therapy in LVAD patients has not been studied in a randomized trial, observational data from the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) showed improved 4-year survival and quality of life in patients taking neurohormonal blockade therapy.删除11:<u>(29)</u> Importantly, outcomes were most favorable in patients who were taking all 3 classes of neurohormonal blockade therapy as compared to those taking medications from only one or 2 classes. Furthermore, another INTERMACS analysis found significantly higher rates of use of all neurohormonal blocking agents in patients who achieved complete recovery permitting device explantation.删除11:<u>(20)</u> Beta-blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists should also be started during the postoperative period due to their known beneficial effects on reverse remodeling and heart failure outcomes. Beta-blockers can be initiated once patients are stable off inotropes, although caution and slow titration should be employed in patients with poor right ventricular function. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists can be started once renal function has stabilized postoperatively. The use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in patients with advanced CKD and/or hyperkalemia is not recommended.\n\n【5】### Recommendations for neurohormonal blockade and the treatment of hypertension after LVAD implantation\n\n【6】**Class I**\n1. Pharmacotherapy with neurohormonal blocking agents (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, angiotensin receptor blocker-neprilysin inhibitors, beta-blocker, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist) is preferred for blood pressure management in durable LVAD patients.\n   Level of Evidence: B.\n\n【7】2. Early neurohormonal blockade should be started in all stable durable LVAD patients to promote ventricular reverse remodeling and myocardial recovery during LVAD support.\n   Level of Evidence: B.\n\n【8】**Class IIb**\n1. Use of hydralazine and isosorbide mononitrate or dinitrate may be considered as second line therapy for hypertension control. Data in LVAD patients are lacking and utilization can be extrapolated from studies in other heart failure populations and those with secondary pulmonary hypertension. These medications are limited by data and need for frequent administration due to short half-lives.\n   Level of Evidence: C.\n\n【9】2. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, centrally acting alpha-2 receptors agonists (clonidine), and peripheral alpha-1 antagonists are third line agents in the management of hypertension in patients on MCS support. These agents should be used when first and second line agents are contraindicated or as supplemental therapy in individuals with resistant hypertension.\n   Level of Evidence: C.\n\n【10】Pulmonary vasodilators reduce RV afterload and are often used perioperatively. In patients with persistent RV failure, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors or nitrates may be used as a transition from inhaled or intravenous pulmonary vasodilators such as inhaled nitric oxide or epoprostenol. Long-term use of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors has been associated with reduced pulmonary vascular resistance in LVAD patients who are being evaluated for heart transplantation, although it is unclear whether the benefits observed could have been achieved with LVAD therapy alone.删除11:<u>(30)</u> Presently, individual and meta-analyses showing definitive benefit for phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor use after LVAD are lacking. Following extubation, careful monitoring of blood gases and patient mentation is necessary to avoid hypoventilation and hypoxia, which can trigger reactive pulmonary hypertension and RV dysfunction.

Of the trials included in the LNMA, all were registered and examined patients with severe or critical illness related to COVID-19 (trial characteristics table available upon request). Of the trials, 37% were published in peer-reviewed journals, 3% were available as preprints and 60% were completed but unpublished.\n\n【3】The evidence summary for mortality was based on 27 RCTs and 10 930 participants from the PMA 删除11:<u>(107)</u>. We used the PMA for mortality as it included some additional unpublished data that reported on this outcome. The GDG recognized that usual care is likely variable between centers and regions, and has evolved over time. However, given all of the data come from RCTs, use of these co-interventions that comprise usual care would be expected to be balanced between study patients randomized to either the intervention or usual care arms.\n\n【4】The GRADE Summary of Findings table shows the relative and absolute effects of IL-6 receptor blockers compared with usual care for the outcomes of interest in patients with severe and critical COVID-19, with certainty ratings. See Section 7 for sources of baseline risk estimates informing absolute estimates of effect.\n\n【5】Subgroup analysis  \nAll included RCTs evaluated IL-6 receptor blockers exclusively in severely or critically ill adults with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization. The GDG requested subgroup analyses based on age (≥ 70 years versus older), disease severity (severe versus critical), levels of inflammatory markers and baseline corticosteroid use for the following outcomes: mortality, need for and duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of hospitalization, and risks of SAEs and bacterial infections.\n\n【6】Based on subgroup analyses, the GDG determined that there was no subgroup effect across any pre-specified outcomes of interest based on disease severity. The GDG considered the results of a subgroup analysis of all included RCTs based on systemic corticosteroid use for the outcome of mortality. The analysis suggested that the relative effects of IL-6 receptor blockers varied as a function of the use of systemic corticosteroids as baseline. Crucially, steroids did not abolish and may even enhance the beneficial effect of IL-6 receptor blockers on mortality. For reasons described below, the GDG did not formally evaluate the credibility of this subgroup analysis.\n\n【7】When comparing tocilizumab and sarilumab, based on the PMA, there was no evidence of a subgroup effect 删除11:<u>(107)</u>. However, there were more data, and therefore greater precision, for tocilizumab+steroids versus steroids alone (OR 0.删除13:<u>77, 95</u>% CI 0.68–0.87) as compared with sarilumab+steroids versus steroids alone (OR 0.删除13:<u>92, 95</u>% CI 0.61–1.03), in addition to these subgroup data, the GDG reviewed head-to-head data from REMAP-CAP investigators which demonstrated no difference between tocilizumab as compared with sarilumab in a population of patients receiving corticosteroids (36.5% mortality with tocilizumab, 33.9% mortality with sarilumab). The NMA estimate of tocilizumab+steroids versus sarilumab+steroids, incorporating both direct and indirect data, provided moderate certainty data of no difference between the drugs (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.86–1.34) (1/3).\n\nOutcome | Timeframe | Study results and measurements | Comparator | Standard care | Intervention | IL-6 receptor blockers | Certainty of the Evidence (Quality of evidence) | Plain language summary  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \nMortality (severe and critical) | Odds ratio 0.86 (CI 95% 0.79 – 0.95) | 130 | 114 | High | IL-6 receptor blockers reduce mortality.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 80, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/WHO：新冠治疗动态指南（2022）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

The original ‘recommendation 3a’ was revised to be more precise, particularly in relation to the inclusion of a computed tomography (CT) scan of the pelvis. Thus, the original ESMO recommendation was reworded as per the additions made in bold text, below and in Table 1:\n3a. Initial staging and risk assessment should include physical examination, full and differential blood count, liver and renal function tests, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and a contrast-enhanced CT scan of the thorax and whole abdomen including the pelvis  [V, A, consensus = 100%].\n\n【4】In relation to ‘recommendation 3c’, there was considerable discussion regarding the use of diagnostic laparoscopy. The Japanese experts did not consider routine diagnostic laparoscopy essential for all patients due to the fact that perioperative ChT is not the standard of care for all patients in Japan. Typically, the peritoneal cavity is inspected at the time of surgery with diagnostic laparoscopy part of the procedure before resection. However, the Japanese experts did recommend diagnostic laparoscopy for selected patients with a relatively high risk of peritoneal dissemination such as those with macroscopic type 4 or large type 3 disease as per the Japanese GC treatment guidelines.删除17:<u>25</u> The Korean experts said that consideration should be given to the feasibility of diagnostic laparoscopy and peritoneal washings in the real-world setting. The proposal was that laparoscopy should only be undertaken if peritoneal seeding was suspected based on CT scans or a physical examination, and positron emission tomography (PET) used if needed to ensure no distant metastases are present, as recommended for the Korean phase III PRODIGY trial.删除17:<u>29</u> The Chinese experts held the view that diagnostic laparoscopy could improve the diagnostic rates of occult metastasis within the abdominal cavity. Before neoadjuvant therapy (for T3-4 or N+ cases), explorative laparoscopic staging and cytological examination of intraperitoneal washings are recommended in the CSCO guidelines. The representatives of the other oncological societies present thought that the ESMO recommendation would be challenging for some treatment centres. Thus, the original ESMO recommendation 3c below:\n3c. Diagnostic laparoscopy and peritoneal washings for cytology are recommended for patients with resectable gastric cancer who are also candidates for perioperative ChT [III, B]. Patients with CY+ are uncertain candidates for curatively-intended surgical resection, was revised by dividing it into two recommendations (i) for patients with resectable GC recommended for upfront surgery and (ii) those patients with resectable GC recommended for perioperative ChT 删除9:<u>(see below and Table 1)</u>.\n\n【5】3ci. Diagnostic laparoscopy and peritoneal washings for cytology should be considered for selected patients with a high risk of peritoneal metastasis [III, B; consensus = 100%].\n\n【6】3cii. Diagnostic laparoscopy and peritoneal washings for cytology are recommended for patients with resectable gastric cancer who are candidates for perioperative ChT [III, B; consensus = 100%].\n\n【7】It should be noted that patients with positive peritoneal cytology (CY+ disease) are uncertain candidates for surgery with curative intent, although some CY+ Asian patients achieve long survival,30 and the benefits of diagnostic staging laparoscopy and peritoneal washings are uncertain for patients with early cT1-cT2, cN0 disease.删除17:<u>31.32</u>\n\n【8】4. Localised gastric cancer—recommendations 4a-d\n\n【9】The Pan-Asian panel of experts agreed with and accepted completely (100% consensus) the original ESMO recommendations, ‘recommendations 4a, b and d’ 删除9:<u>(Table 1)</u>. However, following discussion at the face-to-face meeting, the original ‘recommendation 4c’ below was deleted (100% consensus) and the original ‘recommendation 4d’ renumbered as 4c in Table 1.\n4c. For stage II-III gastric cancer, peri-operative therapy and radical gastrectomy is recommended [I, A].\n\n【10】This was because in Eastern Asia, upfront D2 gastrectomy followed by adjuvant ChT is still the standard of care for most GC cases due to the fact that GCs are detected at an earlier stage and patients have a more favourable prognosis than most non-Asian GC patient populations.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 5, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/_2024 ESMO临床实践指南：胃癌患者的 诊断、治疗和随访——泛亚洲人群适用.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Aspiration may be useful for Gram staining and bacterial aerobic culture.\n- Vesicular lesions should be tested (eg, HSV, VZV PCR). Institute proper isolation precautions and begin empiric therapy with acyclovir pending results.\n\n【3】### Empiric antimicrobial therapy selection\n- In a hemodynamically stable patient, monotherapy with an anti-pseudomonal agent is recommended.\n- In a hemodynamically unstable patient (eg, hypotension, respiratory failure, ill-appearing) initiation of additional antibiotics (eg, vancomycin, aminoglycoside) is prudent pending results of cultures and patient's clinical progression.\n- Additions or modifications to initial empiric therapy should be guided by the patient's clinical syndrome, past history of infections and antimicrobial susceptibilities, and colonization status.\n- Addition of a second antibiotic active against Gram-negative bacteria is prudent for patients with a history of prior infections or colonization with these Gram-negative organisms or in patients who are hemodynamically unstable pending the results of cultures.\n- Appropriate coverage for viridans group streptococci may be considered in empiric antibiotics for fever occurring in patients after high-dose cytarabine.\n\n【4】### Modifications to the initial empirical antibiotic regimen should be guided by the patient's clinical and microbiological data.\n- If blood cultures at 48 hours identify Gram-negative bacteria, obtain one set of repeat blood cultures and start vancomycin (or linezolid in a patient with a history of vancomycin-resistant enterococci [VRE]) pending results of repeat cultures and final identification and susceptibilities of the Gram-positive bacteria. If cultures at 48 hours do not reveal a Gram-positive infection and vancomycin was started, it can be discontinued at 48 hours.\n- Filgrastim (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF]), pegfilgrastim, sargramostim (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF]), and granulocyte transfusions are not generally recommended and may be used at the discretion of the health care provider in situations of serious/life-threatening infection in the context of neutropenia.\n- Additional diagnostic investigation, such as radiographic evaluation of lungs and sinuses, and empirical antifungal therapy should be started for patients with persistent fever and prolonged (≥4–7 days) fever despite empirical antibiotics and who are expected to remain neutropenic, or who have new symptoms (eg, cough, facial pain, swelling).\n  - If yeast (Candida species) is suspected, initiation of an echinocandin (ie, micafungin, caspofungin) or liposomal amphotericin is appropriate.\n  - If mold coverage is warranted, then voriconazole, liposomal amphotericin, posaconazole, or an echinocandin (ie, micafungin, caspofungin) may be used, based on clinical and diagnostic results.\n- Patients should be vaccinated for varicella, measles, mumps, and rubella 3 months after chemotherapy following the CDC schedule for immunocompetent individuals. For patients receiving regimens that include anti-B-cell antibodies, vaccinations should be delayed at least 6 months.\n\n【5】### It may be appropriate to refer to Infectious Disease or Immunology for guidance regarding specific vaccinations for each individual patient.\n- For general information regarding COVID-19 vaccinations in patients with cancer and for management of concurrent COVID-19 and cancer, see: 删除1:<u>\n  - [https://www.nccn.org/covid-19]</u>\n  - [NCCN Guidelines for Prevention and Treatment of Cancer-Related Infections]\n- For specific information regarding COVID-19 vaccinations and management of pediatric ALL in patients who become infected with SARS-CoV-2, see: 删除1:<u>\n  - [https://www.hematology.org/covid-19/covid-19-and-pediatric-all]</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 25, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/（2023.V2）NCCN临床实践指南：儿童急性淋巴细胞白血病.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

The incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular events during the early stages of CKD increases significantly with a decline in renal function. More than 50% of dialysis patients die from cardiovascular disease. Therefore, developing effective methods to control risk factors and improve prognosis of cardiovascular disease is the primary focus during the diagnosis and treatment of CKD. For example, the Systolic blood pressure intervention trial (SPRINT) study demonstrated that CKD drugs are effective in reducing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events by controlling blood pressure. Uncontrolled blood pressure not only increases the risk of these events but also accelerates the progression of CKD. Recent studies have repeatedly confirmed that the first and so far the only angiotensin receptor - neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) sacubitril/valsartan can reduce blood pressure more effectively than renin – angiotensin system inhibitors and improve the prognosis of heart failure in patients with CKD. Here, to better guide the application of ARNI in patients with CKD, and reduce the occurrence of cardiovascular events, we formulate a consensus based on clinical evidence and experience.\n\n【4】## Key words\nChronic kidney disease; Consensus; Angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor; Hypertension", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 1, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/血管紧张素受体-脑啡肽酶抑制剂在慢性肾脏病患者中应用的中国专家共识.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Guidance is needed regarding appropriate use of TRT, PCI, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) surveillance while new data are awaited.  \n**Materials and methods:** In two web-based meetings, a pan-Canadian expert working group of five radiation oncologists and four medical oncologists addressed eight clinical questions regarding use of radiation therapy (TRT and MRI surveillance among patients with ES-SCLC receiving immunotherapy. A targeted literature review was conducted using PubMed and conference proceedings to identify recent 删除19:<u>(January 2019–April 2022)</u> publications in this setting. Fifteen recommendations were developed; online voting was conducted to gauge agreement with each recommendation.  \n**Results:** After considering recently available evidence across lung cancer populations and clinical experience, the experts recommended that all patients with a response to chemo-immunotherapy, good performance status (PS), and limited metastases be considered for consolidation TRT (e.g.,删除16:<u> 30 </u>Gy in 10 fractions). When discussing appropriate after multidisciplinary team discussion, TRT can be initiated during maintenance immunotherapy. All patients who respond to concurrent chemo-immunotherapy should undergo restaging with brain MRI to guide decision-making regarding PCI versus MRI surveillance alone. MRI surveillance should be conducted for two years after response to initial therapy. PCI (e.g.,删除16:<u> 25 </u>Gy in 10 fractions or 20 Gy in 5 fractions) can be considered for patients without central nervous system involvement who have a response to chemo-immunotherapy and good PS. Concurrent treatment with PCI and immunotherapy or with TRT, PCI, and immunotherapy is appropriate after completion of initial therapy. All recommendations were agreed upon unanimously.  \n**Conclusions:** These consensus recommendations provide practical guidance regarding appropriate use of RT and immunotherapy in ES-SCLC while awaiting new clinical trial data.\n\n【7】删除图片描述:<u>![](0_0.png)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 1, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/加拿大共识建议：在接受免疫治疗的广泛期小细胞肺癌患者中使用放射治疗.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Although there was committee consensus that higher doses have a greater effect, they agreed that starting at the lowest effective dose was likely to be preferable to patients, but that up-titration of the dose should be considered as appropriate, following recommendations in the section on follow-up of people started on statin treatment.\n\n【4】The committee agreed to retain the following recommendations for research because there is still a lack of direct evidence in these areas:\n\n【5】- [statin therapy for older people](#)\n- [lipid modification therapy for people with type 1 diabetes](#)\n\n【6】### How the recommendations might affect practice\n\n【7】Most recommendations about statin treatment have been retained from the 2014 update of the guideline and so should not require a change in practice.\n\n【8】National audit data suggests that less than half of people with a QRISK score of 10% or more are on lipid-lowering therapy.

Mechanisms should be in place to review care provided against the guideline recommendations. The reasons for any differences should be assessed and addressed where appropriate. Local arrangements should then be made to implement the national guideline in individual hospitals, units and practices. Implementation of this guideline will be encouraged and supported by SIGN. The implementation strategy for this guideline encompasses the following tools and activities.\n\n【4】### 17.2 Resource implications of key recommendations\n\n【5】No recommendations are considered likely to reach the £5 million threshold which warrants resource impact analysis.\n\n【6】### 17.3 Auditing current practice\n\n【7】A first step in implementing a clinical practice guideline is to gain an understanding of current clinical practice. Audit tools designed around guideline recommendations can assist in this process. Audit tools should be comprehensive but not time consuming to use. Successful implementation and audit of guideline recommendations requires good communication between staff and multidisciplinary team working.\n\n【8】The guideline development group has identified the following as key points to audit to assist with the implementation of this guideline:\n\n【9】- Collect appropriate, nationally-agreed baseline and outcome data on all patients.\n- Collect specific data on the uptake of services by minority ethnic groups, men and people of different gender identities.\n- Any Scottish NHS boards that implement the FREED model will automatically be included in the FREED research group and should contribute to data collection and further evaluation of the model.\n- When using therapies with only preliminary evidence, collect baseline and outcome data to determine efficacy.\n- Collect prescribing data in adults with AN.\n- Collect data on training provided to staff on EDs.\n- Research whether services can provide the recommended psychological therapies and associated accredited training and supervision requirements.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 58, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/SIGN：英国进食障碍指南（2022）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Shortened telomere length has been associated with diseases of bone marrow failure, including inherited disorders such as DC, particularly in the presence of mutations in the **DKC1**, **TERT**, or **TERC** genes that encode for components of the telomere complex. Telomere length can be measured by FISH assays using leukocyte (or leukocyte subset) samples. Other genetic lesions, such as those occurring in the **RUNX1** or **GATA2** gene, have been implicated in familial cases of MDS and other myeloid malignancies.\n\n【2】Lesions within the **RUNX1** gene (mutations, deletions, or translocations) have been identified as one cause of a relatively rare autosomal-dominant familial platelet disorder that predisposes these patients to myeloid malignancies. In affected families with the **RUNX1** lesions, the incidence of MDS/AML is high, ranging from 20% to 60% in which the median age of onset is 33 years. This familial platelet disorder is characterized by the presence of thrombocytopenia, and a tendency for mild-to-moderate bleeding generally presents from childhood; however, some affected individuals may not display these clinical characteristics. Different types of genetic lesions in **RUNX1** account for the variable phenotypes associated with familial platelet disorder between different families. Cryptic genetic lesions in **RUNX1** have been reported in some patients with Fanconi anemia and MDS/AML. Identification of Fanconi anemia is clinically important, because it is associated with chromosomal fragility that results in variability of disease response to HMAs.\n\n【3】The **GATA2** gene codes for a transcription factor involved in gene regulation during the development and differentiation of hematopoietic cells and its expression was shown to correlate with severe dysplasia in patients with primary MDS. Heritable mutations in **GATA2** were identified in families with highly penetrant, early-onset MDS and/or AML. The mutations showed an autosomal-dominant pattern of inheritance, and affected individuals with this familial form of MDS/AML had poor outcomes in the absence of allogeneic HCT. More importantly, family members may not be eligible as donors for allogeneic HCT.\n\n【4】## Additional Testing\n\n【5】For HCT candidates, cytomegalovirus (CMV) status and full human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing (A, B, C, DR, and DQ) of the patient and potential donors are needed. Flow cytometry for assessing the percentage of blast cells in the bone marrow (as measured by the cell surface expression of CD34) may also be valuable in some clinical situations, including detection of LGL disease. It should be emphasized, however, that estimates of blast percentage by flow cytometry do not provide the same prognostic information as the blast percentage derived from morphologic evaluation. Accordingly, flow cytometry data should not be used in lieu of the determination of morphologic blast percentage by an experienced hematopathologist.\n\n【6】The screening for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) or **STAT3-mutant** cytotoxic **T-cell** clones is potentially useful for determining which patients may be more responsive to IST, particularly young patients with normal cytogenetics and hypoplastic MDS 删除9:<u>(see *Prognostic Stratification*)</u>. PNH is a rare acquired disorder of the blood arising from mutations in the **PIGA** gene resulting in defective synthesis of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. This, in turn, leads to a deficiency of proteins that are normally linked to the cell membrane of blood cells via a GPI anchor. Deficiency in GPI-anchored proteins such as those involved in complement inhibition (eg, **CD55**, **CD59**) leads to complement sensitivity of RBCs and subsequent hemolysis. Flow cytometry is the established method for detecting GPI-anchor–deficient", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 58, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/（2024.V1）NCCN临床实践指南：骨髓增生异常综合征.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

In the United States, dabrafenib and trametinib are approved in adult and pediatric patients 6 years of age and older with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with BRAF p.V600E mutation who have progressed following prior treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment option; registration in Europe and other countries is pending (ESCAT 1B; ESMO-MCBS grade 3). BRAF p.V600E mutant tumors of lower-grade histologies are likely to benefit more in terms of response rate and duration. In some of these very rare disease entities, the standard of care is actually ill-defined with prospective studies lacking and treatment recommendations inferred from other glial tumors. Upfront targeted treatment with BRAF or BRAF/MEK inhibition could be considered in these entities in specific situations (large tumors, no well-established standard of care) but preferably inside clinical trials or clinical registries. KIAA1549::BRAF fusion-positive pilocytic astrocytoma recurring after standard of care should be considered for trials on MEK inhibitors or type II RAF inhibitors (ESCAT ⅢA).\n\n【2】### Somatic Neurofibromin 1 gene (NF1) mutations\nRoutine testing for somatic NF1 variants is currently not recommended for patients with sporadic adult-type diffuse gliomas (ESCAT ⅢA). Testing for somatic NF1 variants should be considered in patients with recurrent H3-K27-altered diffuse midline glioma, in glioblastomas IDH-wildtype, and in tumor types with a high prevalence of NF1 mutations (eg, high-grade astrocytoma with piloid features, high-grade glioma with oligomorphic and pseudopapillary features, and rosette-forming glioneuronal tumors), in whom standard treatment options are exhausted and with clinical trial options available (ESCAT ⅢA). In patients with progressive pilocytic astrocytoma in whom standard treatment options are exhausted and with clinical trial options available, somatic NF1 testing is recommended unless a canonical BRAF alteration has already been identified or a diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 is established. Genetic counseling should be considered for patients in whom NF1 alterations were identified in tumors of the NF1 spectrum even if the clinical criteria of neurofibromatosis type 1 are not fulfilled. This should be done prior to germline testing given the consequences of the NF1 diagnosis.\n\n【3】### Growth Factor Receptors\n\n【4】#### ALK alterations\nThe published data indicate that activating ALK fusions or mutations do not play a role in the pathogenesis of the vast majority of primary CNS tumors, except for the very rare cases of infant-type hemispheric gliomas in newborns. Because of the rare occurrence, general testing for ALK alterations is not recommended and targeted treatment with ALK inhibitors is of limited value in gliomas, glioneuronal and neuronal tumors in adults and the vast majority of pediatric-type CNS tumor patients (ESCAT ⅢA): treatment should only be considered in the context of clinical trials or prospective registries once standard treatment options are exhausted.\n\n【5】#### EGFR gene alterations\nDetection of EGFR gene amplification represents an important diagnostic biomarker for IDH-wildtype glioblastoma that suffices for the diagnosis even in the absence of typical histological features. In addition, the detection of EGFR mutation, or, rarely, EGFR amplification serves as a diagnostic biomarker for the EGFR-mutant subtype of diffuse midline glioma, H3 K27-altered. However, despite the large number of clinical trials examining the efficacy of EGFR inhibitors, antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, and vaccines in gliomas, none has demonstrated clinical activity (ESCAT X). We, therefore, recommend investigating EGFR inhibitors on entities that have thus far not/poorly been studied (including the rare cases with mutations affecting the tyrosine kinase domain, eg, in a subset of EGFR-mutant thalamic diffuse midline glioma,", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 8, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/2023 EANO指南：成人神经胶质瘤、胶质神经元和神经元肿瘤用于靶向治疗选择的合理分子检测.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Acetaminophen is antipyretic, and its analgesic activity is additive to NSAIDs and opioids. NSAIDs should be part of a multimodal strategy after open aortic surgery unless there are patient-specific contraindications for its use. Several RCTs in other surgical specialties have also investigated other non-opioid postoperative analgesia, including gabapentin, α2-agonists, S-ketamine, magnesium sulfate, β-blockade and high dose steroids, which all showed a reduction in pain.\n\n【1】Opioids remain the most frequently prescribed class of drugs globally; however, it is also recognized that patients are at high risk of opioid misuse and addiction in the long-term. In the short-term, opioids are also related to many undesirable side effects slowing recovery, specifically including delirium, which is of particular relevance to the aortic surgery population. Oral or intravenous opioids may be less effective in treating acute postoperative pain following open aortic surgery compared to epidural analgesia, but in a single-center RCT of 168 patients undergoing open aortic surgery, patients with patient-controlled epidural analgesia had similar outcomes and time to recovery compared to patients with patient-controlled intravenous narcotic analgesia.\n\n【2】**Recommendation:** Routinely use multimodal analgesic regimens to improve pain control and minimize opioid consumption.\n\n【3】**Quality of evidence:** B (Moderate)\n\n【4】**Strength of recommendation:** Grade 1 (Strong)\n\n【5】疑似页脚### 15.

Which non-pharmacological interventions are recommended to prevent delirium in cancer patients?\n\n【5】**Recommendations**\n\n【6】- Non-pharmacologic therapies to prevent the onset of delirium in cancer patients include multicomponent interventions and bright light therapy for post-operative delirium and delirium in the cancer treatment phase. Multicomponent non-pharmacological interventions commonly consist of education about delirium for healthcare providers, patients and their families; a multidisciplinary and specialist team approach; symptom management, including pain, dehydration and constipation; environmental adjustments (date/time awareness and music); and delirium risk assessment and removal of risk factors including medication modification and adjustment.\n\n【7】There were 10 studies on this CQ.  \nNakagawa et al. conducted an observational study on 102 patients who underwent head and neck reconstructive surgery to determine whether early postoperative bed release significantly reduced the incidence of postoperative delirium 删除11:<u>(10)</u>. They found that the incidence of delirium was significantly lower in the group of patients who began mobilization on the second postoperative day than in the group of patients who began mobilization on the third postoperative day or the third to fifth postoperative days. Taguchi et al. conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine whether postoperative bright light therapy significantly reduced the incidence of postoperative delirium compared with usual care in 15 patients with esophageal cancer 删除11:<u>(11)</u>. The intervention group received 5000 lx for 2 h in the morning on days 2–5 postoperatively. The control group received their usual care in a private intensive care unit (ICU) room with 600 or 1000 lx lighting. The intervention group showed no differences in the incidence of terminal delirium compared with usual care in 1516 terminally ill cancer patients receiving specialized palliative care services at seven palliative care centers 删除11:<u>(12)</u>. The intervention included the following: upon admission, nurses utilized a delirium risk assessment form to assess the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS); presence of brain or meningeal metastases; presence of metabolic disturbances; the dose of opioid analgesics; the dose of benzodiazepines; and use of anticholinergics, corticosteroids or anxiolytics. The form was shared with the physician and recorded in the patient's medical records. The physician made changes in the medications to minimize the risk of delirium. Nurses also communicated the date, time and location to prevent patient disorientation. Family members were educated on delirium prevention. There were no significant differences in the incidence of delirium between the two groups after adjustment for length of hospital stay, ECOG PS and history of delirium. Hempenius et al. conducted an RCT among 297 elderly cancer patients to determine whether a multicomponent intervention by a geriatric team significantly improved the incidence of postoperative delirium compared with the usual care 删除11:<u>(13)</u>. In the intervention group, a preoperative Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment by a geriatrician was performed to assess the risk of delirium, and a customized treatment plan was developed for each patient. During the hospitalization period, a geriatric nurse also conducted a daily risk assessment of delirium using a delirium checklist, and if symptoms were suspected, they were discussed with the treating physician.

Reasons for exclusions were non-comparative (25 cases), inappropriate study design (11 cases), data for pNET not separately reported (3 cases), or other (4 cases). A total of five studies$^{37–41}$ were systematic reviews, of which four$^{37–39,41}$ included a meta-analysis 删除9:<u>(Table S5)</u>. Between 3 and 10 studies were included in each systematic review, including between 98 and 1555 patients. All other studies$^{8,9,24,42}$ were observational cohort studies 删除9:<u>(Table S6)</u>. A total of eight studies$^{8,9,24,42}$ were prospective cohorts and the remaining studies were retrospective. Multivariable analysis was performed in 19 studies$^{8,24,42–47}$, one study used propensity score adjustment删除22:<u>$^{42}$</u>, and six studies used propensity score matching$^{41,49–52}$ to reduce selection bias.\n\n【8】Many studies analyzed data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, indicating that the same patients can be included in different studies$^{41,47–49,52–56}$. A total of four studies included patients from the National Cancer Database (NCDB)$^{48,54,56}$ or another national cancer database删除22:<u>$^{8}$</u>. Of the other studies, four were multicentre studies$^{42,43,45,54}$ and seven were single-centre studies$^{9,53,57–65}$. The number of patients included ranged from 47 to 1947 for studies from the SEER database, from 620 to 6088 for NCDB studies, from 93 to 194 for multicentre studies, and from 19 to 135 for single-centre studies. The number of patients who underwent resections ranged from 111 to 392 for studies from the SEER database, from 111 to 460 for NCDB studies, from 31 to 73 for multicentre studies, and from 7 to 187 for single-centre studies.\n\n【9】A total of 10 studies did not report the hormonal status of the tumours treated$^{46,50,52,54,55,57,58}$. Of the studies, eight included both non-functioning pNET and functioning pNET$^{8,42–45,50,54,56}$, five included non-functioning pNET$^{8,38,51,56,58}$, and three included functioning pNET$^{9,50,62}$.\n\n【10】None of the included studies assessed the primary tumour for patients with resectable liver metastases. Moreover, none of the studies only included patients with resectable liver metastases. Liver metastases, as reported by the individual cohort studies, were deemed unresectable$^{8,9,24,42,50,51,53,58}$ or unresectable and resectable$^{8,45,46,53–56}$. In many studies it was not stated if the tumour were resectable$^{47–49,52–56}$. Bertani et al.删除22:<u>$^{42}$</u> specifically included patients who underwent a distal pancreatectomy and one study only included patients who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy删除22:<u>$^{54}$</u>. There were two studies that specifically studied outcomes for patients older than 65 years$^{49,66}$.\n\n【11】### Question 4: In patients with resectable pNET liver metastases, does resection of the primary tumour lead to improved survival compared with non-surgical management?\n\n【12】**Survival**\n\n【13】Multiple studies included patients who underwent synchronous liver resections. Only one study specifically reported on all resections being curative删除22:<u>$^{5}$</u>. Partelli et al.删除22:<u>$^{45}$</u> included 166 patients with stage IV pNET, of which 18 patients (11%) underwent curative resection, 73 patients (43%) underwent palliative resection, and 75 patients (46%) underwent no resection.

The median OS was 97 months for patients who underwent curative resection, compared with 89 months for non-curative resection and 36 months for no resection 删除19:<u>(P = 0.0001)</u>删除22:<u>$^{45}$</u>. The PFS was 42 months compared with 27 months in the palliative group and 15 months in the no-resection group.\n\n【14】Chawla et al.删除22:<u>$^{54}$</u> specifically focused on patients who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy from the NCDB. Some 167 patients underwent only pancreatoduodenectomy and 184 patients underwent synchronous resection. Patients who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy plus metastasectomy had a median OS of 93.2 months. The median OS for patients who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy alone was 71.8 months, the median OS for patients who underwent metastasectomy alone was 25.2 months, and the median OS for patients without any operation was 15.2 months. The 5-year OS was 59 months for patients who underwent primary tumour resection versus 19 months for patients who did not undergo primary tumour resection (P < 0.001).\n\n【15】Franco et al.删除22:<u>$^{56}$</u> included 614 patients from the SEER database; it was not reported how many patients had resectable distant metastatic disease. Nevertheless, they observed that the highest survival percentage was observed for patients who underwent primary tumour resection and metastasectomy. In line with this, Keutgen et al.删除22:<u>$^{58}$</u> found in the SEER database that, after resection of the primary tumour and resection of metastases, the median survival was 8.5 (95% CI: 8.4 to not defined) years for patients who underwent resection of the primary tumour and metastases versus 5.6 (95% CI: 4.0 to 6.6) years for patients who did not undergo resection (P = 0.052).\n\n【16】Studies including patients with resectable and unresectable liver metastases reported 5-year OS rates ranging from 59% to 76% after primary tumour resection compared with from 19% to 52% without resection$^{43–45,54,56,63}$. The median OS ranged from 36 to 140 months after resection compared with from 12 to 60 months without resection$^{43,45,54,56,63}$ and the median PFS ranged from 17 to 20 months and from 14 to 19 months respectively$^{43,63}$.

Regimen-related toxicities (vomiting, mucositis, anorexia) and increased catabolism can all contribute to rapid post-HCT nutritional decline 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[43,44]</u></u>. Obesity and underweight status have been associated with an increased risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[45,46]</u></u>, although data are conflicting 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[47,48]</u></u>. Although body mass index should not affect the decision of whether to proceed to HCT, it might alter the transplantation approach, supportive care, or conditioning regimen drug dosages 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[49]</u></u>. All children should be evaluated by an experienced dietitian, including baseline anthropomorphic measurements and identification of food allergies. Serum albumin and prealbumin biomarkers are used to assess and monitor nutritional status 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[43,50]</u></u> but can be confounded by other HCT complications; therefore, no single biomarker has been shown to correlate directly to nutritional status 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[51]</u></u>. Baseline electrolyte and vitamin D levels should be obtained as part of nutritional screening to be optimized prior to HCT 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[52]</u></u>. Anticipatory guidance should be provided to the child and family regarding an expected decline in oral intake, avoidance of undercooked foods that may be a source of infection, and approaches for nutritional supplementation. This includes enteral feeding via a nasogastric tube and i.v. total parenteral nutrition.\n\n【2】### Hepatic Dysfunction\n\n【3】During HCT, the liver is subject to increased metabolic demands and is at risk for injury from conditioning chemotherapy and/or radiation, medications, infection, veno-occlusive disease, and GVHD. Current recommendations for assessment of hepatic function rely on measurement of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, albumin, prothrombin time/international normalized ratio, and total bilirubin. However, appropriate cutoff levels that portend increased hepatic complications post-HCT are unknown. Children can be at increased risk for veno-occlusive disease compared to adults, with an incidence between 10% and 40% 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[53,54]</u></u>. Risk factors include young age (< 2 years), low body weight, receipt of a mismatched graft 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[53]</u></u>, prior chemotherapy with inotuzumab ozogamicin or gemtuzumab ozogamicin 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[55,56]</u></u>, steatohepatitis from long-term steroid use 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[57,58]</u></u>, or prior liver injury, prior abdominal radiation for solid tumors, and busulfan- or total body irradiation-based conditioning. The significance of an elevated ferritin level may vary by patient and disease entity. In heavily transfused patients, estimation of liver iron content can be a more accurate marker of hepatic iron overload and may be used to guide decisions about the utility of pre-HCT chelation.\n\n【4】### Endocrine\n\n【5】Multiple late endocrine effects are seen after HCT 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[59]</u></u>, including thyroid dysfunction 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[60]</u></u>, diabetes 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[61]</u></u>, dyslipidemia 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[62]</u></u>, growth and bone health problems 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[63]</u></u>, adrenal insufficiency 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[64]</u></u>, and issues with puberty or fertility 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[65,66]</u></u>. For all patients, we recommend fasting blood glucose, a lipid panel and triglycerides, and thyroid-stimulating hormone as a baseline pre-HCT. Patients with a history of prolonged exposure to steroids also may require a baseline early morning cortisol level for screening or a cosyntropin stimulation test if there is significant concern for adrenal insufficiency. Preparations also may be made for menstrual suppression, when appropriate.\n\n【6】### Neurocognitive\n\n【7】Reports on the effect of HCT on neurocognitive development in children are mixed, and additional research is needed 删除12:<u>[67–77]</u>. Certain factors may portend a higher risk, including younger age at transplantation, chemotherapy that crosses the blood-brain barrier, radiation to the brain, immunosuppressive therapy, and the occurrence of GVHD or infection 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[73,78]</u></u>. Pretransplantation screening for neurocognitive function may be considered to provide a baseline and identify areas of dysfunction that may already exist from prior treatment or underlying diagnosis, although the implications of neurocognitive test changes on psychosocial outcomes are unclear and should be the subject of additional research.\n\n【8】### Dental\n\n【9】As many as 58% of children preparing for HCT have dental issues that necessitate intervention 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[79]</u></u>. A comprehensive dental evaluation has been associated with reduced rates of mucositis and febrile neutropenia 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[80]</u></u>, and minimizing gingivitis and periodontitis may result in less gingival bleeding 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[81]</u></u>. The oral evaluation should be performed at least 2 weeks before conditioning to allow for healing 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[82]</u></u> and should include cleaning and elimination of active dental infections or sources of trauma 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[83]</u></u>. Primary teeth preparing for exfoliation may be extracted, and incipient caries may be temporized with fluoride application and sealants 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[84]</u></u>. Orthodontic hardware, which may increase the risk of mucosal trauma and secondary infection, may be removed 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[83]</u></u>. Anticipatory guidance about mucositis and proper pre-HCT oral hygiene also can be provided 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[82,84]</u></u>.\n\n【10】### Performance status\n\n【11】The Lansky Play-Performance Scale (age, 1 to 16 years) attempts to parallel the Karnofsky Performance Status scale used for patients age ≥ 16 years and has become the standard assessment for functional fitness and ability of children to tolerate HCT. A single study of adults and children receiving nonmyeloablative conditioning showed that pre-HCT performance score (Karnofsky or Lansky) was independently associated with post-HCT survival 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[85]</u></u>. Despite the limitations in applying performance scoring to children who have cognitive delays or are chronically hospitalized, the Lansky Scale remains the sole available functional assessment tool for children. Therefore, we recommend pre-HCT scoring of performance status using the Lansky or Karnofsky Scale as age-appropriate.\n\n【12】To summarize a patient's physiologic condition pre-HCT, the HCT-Comorbidity Index (HCT-CI) is often used for adults. The HCT-CI quantifies the patient’s pre-HCT comorbidity burden; those with a higher HCT-CI have inferior survival outcomes 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[86]</u></u>. However, the HCT-CI can be challenging to apply in children, and its applicability to this age group has not been sufficiently validated 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[22,87-89]</u></u>. Efforts for pediatric adaptation of the HCT-CI are ongoing 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[22]</u></u> and are expected to yield a useful tool for pre-HCT evaluation 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[90]</u></u>.\n\n【13】### Psychosocial\n\n【14】Children exhibit a wide spectrum of emotional capabilities and neurodevelopmental stages, making psychological and social considerations extremely important in the pre-HCT preparations for children. HCT causes an enormous disruption to normal childhood milestones and social development through long hospitalizations, isolation, pain, fear, critical illness, and loss of privacy and control. As a result, children may develop anxiety of a sense of isolation. This loss of control can lead to behavioral problems, depression, anger, and frustration 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[91]</u></u>.

Due to the lack of guidelines for dental patients with CVD in our country, how to implement standardized preoperative evaluation and perioperative risk prevention remains a problem to be solved for dentists at present. The present expert consensus was reached by combining the clinical experiences of the expert group of the Fifth General Dentistry Special Committee, Chinese Stomatological Association and respiratory and cardiology experts in diagnosis and treatment for CVD patients, and by systematically summarizing the relevant international guidelines and literature regarding the relationship between CVD and oral diseases and the diagnosis and treatment of dental patients with heart failure, hypertension and antithrombotic therapy. The consensus aims to provide, for the dental clinicians, the criteria on diagnosis and treatment of CVD in dental patients in China so as to reduce the risk and complications, and finally to improve the treatment levels of dental patients with CVD in China.\n\n【2】**Key words**\nCardiovascular diseases; Oral medicine; Hypertension; Heart failure; Antithrombotic therapy; Treatment medical risk prevention; Experts consensus\n\n【3】近 年 来 ，我 国 心 血 管 病 （cardiovascular diseases, CVD）患病率仍处于持续上升阶段，CVD 死 亡率仍居我国居民死因构成的首位。由于指南及其他系统、专项多例汇编至今尚未出台专门针对牙科CVD病人的相关规定，如何在诊疗中选择器械、诊疗时要注意的问题等再次成为研究热点和难点。为了提高口腔医学者对CVD及其病患诊疗中常见问题及风险的认识，减少在诊疗中存在的问题与不足，参考胸痛、卒中等心脑血管急性问题病人，目前已经完成了一些探索，如抗凝治疗、降压治疗、糖尿病合并CVD慢病病人口腔医学诊疗路径等。20年来多家机构、医学者和口腔专家一致在此领域权威发布共识报告。而本共识即为其中的指导之一。  \n随着人口 增 长，心脏病及其并发症診患量和诊疗难度递增，加上在诊疗中口腔病人接受心脏病筛查与救治已成为国际前沿共识之一，对于提高口腔病人心脏病识别率和早期筛查成功率是一次重要契机。为此，我们合并多单位、多实践反复讨论与严格依从，编制成为现有分指南。《中国医学前沿口腔医学》报导的这一系列共识研究已经开始实施，发现其牙周病、缺牙、游离牙片及支持组织损伤多长期存在。  \n这些相关损伤不仅能表现为口腔疾病，也能为心脏病患诊断提供支持证据，尤其对房颤、心衰等病人，常规检查难全面捕捉的口腔特征更是重要。口腔破损因素与心衰病人用药也密切相关，抗凝药应用等推动了这方面深入探讨。如前所述共识也对应列出了相关实例和原作者研究显示，临床要注重细节提示与病人诊前预评估相结合，纳入更多实践和大量文献整理总结后的准则，构成迄今现成的此领域医学精华，特供我国医学者参考。2021年1月制定专家共讨版，随后讨论落实肯定，2021年12月形成共讨初稿。", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 2, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/心血管疾病患者口腔诊疗风险防范专家共识（2022版）(1).pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Therefore, it is important to correct the imbalance between energy expenditure and energy intake. Over the estimation of individual energy requirements (according to age, gender, and weight), patients can be advised regarding practical strategies to increase their food intake, such as consuming smaller and more frequent meals (six meals/day, snacking every 3 hours), drinking away from meals to avoid early satiety, and limiting foods or beverages labeled “light”, “low fat”, or “low calorie”.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 6, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/COVID-19后综合征的饮食建议（2022）(1).pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

To reduce the burden placed on individuals, the committee decided that organisations should have clear policies on confidentiality.\n\n【2】The committee discussed that a preventive approach is important for reducing poor mental wellbeing. But they acknowledged that some employees will already have poor mental health and others will be at increased risk of poor mental health. Therefore, these employees should be offered support. The committee suggested that, although there was no specific evidence for them, wellness action plans were likely to be a useful way to open a dialogue between managers and employees about mental health concerns and what support could be put in place to help employees. They could also help to highlight needs for organisational change.\n\n【3】The evidence agreed with the committee's collective experience and showed that cognitive behavioural therapy, mindfulness and stress management were effective in improving mental wellbeing outcomes in employees with poor mental health. However, there was more limited evidence for cognitive behavioural therapy than for the other 2 options. They noted that if treatment is commissioned by the employer, they are required to check that the provider has the necessary qualifications and is accredited and regulated by relevant professional organisations to offer the interventions.\n\n【4】The committee noted that there was a potential resource impact for offering these and that for smaller organisations, free or low-cost options existed (for example, online resources such as the local Improving Access to Psychological Therapies scheme). The committee thought it was important that employees were made aware of the option to not have an intervention and to take up an offer of it at a later date, or to stop an intervention at any time and restart it later. This avoids employees feeling pressured to start or continue an intervention. They also agreed it was important that employers recognise that an employee may prefer a particular type of intervention, possibly because of their previous experiences with interventions.\n\n【5】The committee noted the lack of evidence about which strategies can be used to identify employees at risk of poor mental wellbeing.\n\n【6】# How the recommendations might affect practice\n\n【7】The recommendations reflect good practice around managing and supporting employees.

HE reduces the patient's and caregiver's quality of life. However, it is a poorly understood complication with no consensus for diagnosis. Therefore, HE is often underdiagnosed. The pathophysiological mechanisms are also poorly understood, and indications for the various treatment options available are not well classified. The present guidelines assist clinicians in the diagnosis of overt and covert forms of HE to implement curative and preventive treatments and lifestyle and therapeutic education measures for patients and clarify which patients require referral to expert centres for consideration for liver transplantation. These guidelines should be envisioned as a complement to international guidelines 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[1-3]</u></u>, including the recently published EASL clinical practice guidelines (CPG) 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[4]</u></u>. The present guidelines adhered to these latest recommendations, especially the semantics. Therefore, we retained the term \"covert\" instead of minimal + grade 1 stages, despite ongoing controversies 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[5]</u></u> because we did not want to add confusion for readers. Other current controversial points in the field are also identified: the differential diagnosis of HE in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is particularly difficult; combination vs. single therapy after a first episode of overt HE; pathogenesis and prevention of HE after TIPS placement, if this entity truly exists. We tried to address these controversies in the present guidelines considering the literature and our expert opinion, and all controversial issues are written in italics. The guidelines are clinically oriented and address different frequent clinical issues without significant overlap with the EASL CPG.\n\n【3】## Methods\n\n【4】These guidelines were the work of a panel of experts gathered by the AFEF Management Board and including hepatologists, intensivists, neurologists, biologists, pharmacists, and liver surgeons. Briefly, the experts created a list of 16 questions. The questions were formulated using the Patient Intervention Comparison Outcome (PICO) model. The Grade Method (Grade of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation) was used to compile the guidelines. The quality of evidence and the level of recommendation were rated.\n\n【5】The strength of the recommendations was determined according to key factors and validated by the experts after a vote using the Grade Grid method 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[6]</u></u>. The compilation of a guideline required that at least 50% of voting participants had an opinion and that fewer than 20% of participants voted for the opposite proposal. The compilation of a strong agreement required the approval of at least 70% of the voting participants.\n\n【6】The methodology is detailed in the Supplements.\n\n【7】## Results\n\n【8】Recommendations were made for adults in the three areas: diagnostic management of HE, therapeutic management of HE, and management of HE in 2 specific contexts, TIPS and liver transplantation. The summarizing work of the experts and the application of the GRADE methodology resulted in a total of 23 recommendations. Among the 23 formal recommendations, three recommendations had a high level of evidence (GRADE 1+/-), and 10 recommendations had a low level of evidence (GRADE 2+/-). The GRADE methodology could not be applied for nine recommendations, which resulted in 10 expert opinions. After two rounds of scoring, strong agreement was reached for all recommendations and protocols.\n\n【9】### I. First area: Diagnosis of HE\n#### a.

At present, the lack of epidemiological data from large-sample studies in our country persists, and there are many difficulties in diagnosis and treatment. It is imperative to formulate diagnosis and treatment guidelines for FMS in our country. As such, a project was jointly initiated by the China Association of Chinese Rheumatology Society, the Fibromyalgia Research Group of Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine in Rheumatology and Immunology, and the Capital Institute of Rheumatology and Immunology of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine, which adopted the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation grading system and the Reporting Items for Practice Guidelines in Health Care for guideline development. Detailed evidence-based recommendations on 11 clinical problems of FMS that concern Chinese first-line physicians are given in the guideline, aiming to encourage the departments of rheumatology, psychology, pain, and other related departments to attach great importance to the comprehensive management, early identification and intervention, and assessment of FMS to improve the quality of life of patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 1, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/中国纤维肌痛综合征诊疗指南.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

We then evaluated these modalities separately and defined each as first-, second-, and third-line methods to create a treatment algorithm.\n\n【2】While most of the recommended modalities for OPD were strong recommendations, most of the recommendations for ED were weak. The reason for this may be that rehabilitation modalities for ED are not widely used and that in our country and worldwide, recommendations for rehabilitation modalities for this situation are lacking.\n\n【3】#### 删除11:<u>(1)</u> First-line treatment modalities\n\n【4】**Education and information (OPD-ED):** Most older people lack information about their nutritional status and proper diet. Reviews and studies have reported that patient perception, motivation, willingness to change, technical knowledge, and health literacy affect treatment compliance in patients with dysphagia. Thus education is important in the rehabilitation of dysphagia. Therefore, we strongly recommended that: “education and information involving patients and their relatives are effective rehabilitation modalities for older adults with both OPD and ED and are recommended as a first-line treatment method.”\n\n【5】**Oral hygiene-oral care and dental care-prosthodontic rehabilitation (OPD-ED):** “Oral hygiene, dental care, and prosthodontic rehabilitation are effective rehabilitation modalities and are recommended as a first-line treatment methods for older adults with both OPD and ED” (strong recommendation strength for OPD, weak recommendation for ED) (OPD: oral hygiene is a strong recommendation, dental care is a weak recommendation; ED: both weak recommendations).\n\n【6】Regular oral hygiene and dental care reduce the colonization of virulent bacteria and the incidence of AP, increase sensory sensitization, and improve the sensitivity of the cough reflex. Studies on oral hygiene are often based on OPD. However, GER, the most common cause of ED, also affects the oral region. The major oral symptom of GER is dental erosion. In addition, it can also cause tonsillitis, oral mucosa atrophy, glossitis, xerostomia, and dysgeusia. Moreover, in the presence of GER, microaspiration of bacteria into the oral flora along with saliva contents may occur due to esophageal dysmotility, damaged swallowing coordination, and decreased sensitivity of pharyngeal and laryngeal protective reflexes. Therefore, regardless of the pathology of dysphagia, we recommended oral hygiene and oral/dental care.\n\n【7】**Positioning and posture modification (OPD-ED):** “Positioning and posture modifications are effective rehabilitation modalities and are recommended as first-line treatment methods for older adults with both OPD and ED” (strong recommendation for OPD, weak recommendation for ED).\n\n【8】A simple position of at least 60°, and ideally 90°, can prevent residue, penetration, and aspiration by altering swallowing structural placement relative to gravity. However, no study has provided strong evidence for positioning. Therefore, our recommendations are important to the literature.\n\n【9】Our consultant experts recommended positioning patients with OPD in a sitting position as much as possible and using head and posture modifications for OPD. The most common postural modification considered to be effective is the chin-tuck position (98%), which prepares the airway for swallowing by reducing the rate of bolus passage, especially in patients with preterm. In contrast, our experts recommended the use of trunk modification for ED, most commonly an upright sitting position (91%). Lifting the head while lying down and remaining in a sitting position for at least 30 minutes after meals were among the recommendations for postural modification in patients with GER.\n\n【10】**Dietary (bolus volume, texture, consistency) modification (OPD-ED):** “Dietary modifications are effective modalities for older adults with both OPD and ED and are recommended as a first-line treatment method” (strong recommendation).\n\n【11】Dietary modifications are the most recommended compensatory methods for treating dysphagia. Modifications such as volume, viscosity, bolus, and texture changes are common methods, especially for OPD. In older adults with chronic dysphagia, texture modification such as pureeing and mixing and thickened fluids such as nectar, honey, and pudding consistencies are modera-", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 21, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/老年人吞咽困难的5Ws和1H治疗的最佳实践建议（2022）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

However a contemporary Cochrane review concluded that due to low certainty evidence pre-habilitation might slightly reduce cardiac and renal complications compared with standard care but uncertainty remained about the impact on 30 day mortality, pulmonary complications, the need for re-intervention, or post-operative bleeding.\n\n【2】Smoking cessation prior to both EVAR and OSR has been demonstrated to reduce respiratory complications and one year mortality rate in a recent large series reported from the Vascular Quality Initiative of Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS-VQI) (please also see section 4.2.1 Recommendation 16 and section 4.2.2 Recommendation 18).\n\n【3】#### 5.1.2.1. Assessment and management of cardiac risk.\nCardiac complications are estimated to cause up to 42% of peri-operative deaths after non-cardiac surgery and the level of cardiac risk should be assessed clinically.\n\n【4】In cases with active cardiovascular disease, such as unstable angina, decompensated heart failure, severe valvular disease, and significant dysrhythmia, further specialist assessment and management are required before AAA repair planning.\n\n【5】In the absence of active cardiovascular disease, clinical cardiovascular risk factors 删除9:<u>(Table 10)</u> and the patient’s functional capacity 删除9:<u>(Table 11)</u> should be assessed. Functional capacity is estimated by the patient’s ability to perform activities of daily living, assessed by metabolic equivalent (MET), which is the amount of oxygen expenditure while sitting at rest. By convention 1 MET corresponds to 3.5 mL O₂/kg/min.\n\n【6】Patients capable of moderate physical activities 删除9:<u>(Table 11)</u>, such as climbing two flights of stairs or running a short distance (MET ≥ 4), will not benefit from further testing. Patients with poor functional capacity (MET < 4) and or with significant clinical risk factors should be referred to a specialist for cardiac work up prior to AAA repair. Although poor capacity alone is only weakly associated with impaired outcomes after aortic repair, cardiac prognosis is good if functional capacity is high, even in the presence of stable IHD or other risk factors. Cardiac work up includes non-invasive evaluation of left ventricular dysfunction, heart valve abnormalities and stress induced myocardial intervention with a cardiac risk between 1% and 5%. This section provides a broad overview of the relevant factors that should be taken into account in the pre-operative evaluation of patients undergoing aortic repair.\n\n【7】There is extensive guidance on operative risk assessment and reduction which should be consulted for in depth information. As a minimum, all patients should undergo a medical history and clinical examination, functional assessment, full blood count, electrolytes and renal function, and electro-cardiogram. Additional testing depends upon the individual circumstances of the patient as described below.\n\n【8】A UK RCT has shown that a period of pre-operative supervised exercise training is beneficial to patients undergoing open or endovascular aortic surgery by reducing cardiac, respiratory and renal complications postoperatively, as well as reducing the length of hospital stay. Furthermore a contemporary study of a 24 week community exercise programme RCT demonstrated improved cardiopulmonary exercise testing parameters for those randomised to exercise.\n\n【9】#### Table 10.

Race/ethnicity may have a significant impact on the validity of \ncardiovascular risk assessment tools and certain higher risk race/ethnic groups may further inform the use of preventive therapy. \n6. Social determinants of health may exert independent effects \nbeyond race/ethnicity and need also to be part of the clinician-patient discussion when discussing the most appropriate ways \nto optimize ASCVD risk. \n7. Among subclinical atherosclerotic disease screening tests, CAC is \nprobably the most useful, providing substantial improvement of risk reclassification over global risk scoring in most primary \nprevention groups, including diabetes. In addition to the consideration of risk enhancing factors (discussed earlier), CAC testing can be used to further inform treatment decisions for preventive therapy, including statin and aspirin use in particular. \n8. The use of ABI for assessment of PAD is also valuable and can \nimprove risk reclassification beyond global risk scoring. \n9. Carotid ultrasound imaging, if accompanied by carotid plaque \nassessment may also be useful for risk assessment, especially as an option when CAC scoring is not available. \n10. In patients with pre-existing ASCVD, stratification into those at \nhighest risk (e.g., very high risk ASCVD status) for more aggressive treatment is based on the history of multiple major ASCVD events or one major event and multiple high-risk conditions. Moreover, those with recurrent ASCVD events in the short-term define an extreme risk condition warranting even more aggressive risk factor management.\n\n【1】#### 9. Conclusions\n\n【2】Cardiovascular risk assessment is the foundation of preventive cardiology for determining the appropriateness or intensification of preventive therapy. Global risk assessment/screening is the first step in cardiovascular risk assessment, after which the presence of other risk enhancing factors, inflammatory and other biomarkers, sex, ethnic, and social determinants of health, and screening for subclinical atherosclerosis can further refine risk estimation. Moreover, nutritional factors and physical activity and fitness levels (addressed in other ASPC clinical practice statements) should be considered. In secondary prevention those at very high risk can be identified on the basis of the presence of multiple major ASCVD events and/or high-risk conditions where more intensive treatment may be warranted. Ultimately, ASCVD risk assessment remains an inexact science and while it can be useful for assessing risk in populations of subjects, application to the individual patient is still limited; however, novel emerging methods to incorporate sociogeographic, genetic, clinical, and lifestyle measures will hopefully improve precision for risk prediction for the individual patient.\n\n【3】#### Author Contributions\n\n【4】All authors contributed to the writing of the manuscript and provided critical revision and review and approval of submission.\n\n【5】#### Funding\n\n【6】No funding was received for the preparation of this manuscript.\n\n【7】#### Author Disclosures\n\n【8】Dr. Michos reports advisory board participation for Astra Zeneca, Amarin, Bayer, Boehringer Ingelheim, Esperion, Novo Nordisk, and Novartis.

Moreover, accurate LVEF evaluation is important for indications for GDMT and non-pharmacological treatments such as implantable-cardioverter defibrillators and cardiac resynchronization therapy. LVEF is calculated as the difference between the volume of the LV at the end of diastolic and systolic phases divided by the volume at the end of diastolic phase. In addition to LVEF, LV global longitudinal strain (GLS), measured by speckle-tracking echocardiography, reflects subclinical myocardial systolic function. In Korean patients with HF, LV GLS exhibited incremental predictive value for long-term outcomes.\n\n【1】In addition, echocardiography helps assess the size of the ventricles and atria and wall thickness. Evaluation of diastolic function is essential in diagnosing HFpEF (elucidated in Chapter 7 of Part I). In patients with HF, RV dysfunction is often concomitant. Pressure or volume loads may affect RV function. The most common cause of chronic right HF is pulmonary HTN due to left-sided HF. Myocardial infarction, arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy, or valvular disease may cause RV dysfunction as well. Echocardiographic parameters used to evaluate RV function include fractional area change, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, and tissue Doppler imaging of tricuspid annulus. The diagnosis of right-sided HF is elucidated in Part II, Chapter 26 (Diagnosis and treatment of right-sided heart failure).\n\n【2】### 删除11:<u>(2)</u> Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging\n\n【3】CMR imaging may be performed to assess myocardial function. It has high accuracy and reproducibility; therefore, it is accepted as a gold standard for the assessment of volume, EF, and mass. Moreover, CMR imaging is recommended to assess the myocardial structure and function if echocardiographic imaging is of poor quality. In particular, CMR imaging is the most accurate method for measuring RV volume and EF.\n\n【4】### Identifying the etiology of heart failure\n\n【5】Identifying the etiology of HF is essential for its treatment and prognosis prediction. The diverse causes of HF can be assessed through various imaging, blood, and genetic tests.\n\n【6】### 删除11:<u>(1)</u> Echocardiography\n\n【7】Echocardiography is the fundamental imaging test recommended to determine the cause of HF. It can assess RWMA, valvular structure and function, and myocardial thickness. If local RWMA is observed and it corresponds to a coronary artery territory, ischemic-origin HF may be suspected. If diffuse hypokinesia or non-coronary territory RWMA are observed, other cardiomyopathies (e.g., stress cardiomyopathy, sarcoidosis, and myocarditis among others) may be suspected 删除9:<u>(see Part II, Chapters 27–33)</u>. If structural and functional abnormalities of the valves are observed, HF caused by valvular heart disease may be suspected, and in such cases, surgery or percutaneous valve procedures should be considered 删除9:<u>(see Part II, Chapter 23: Treatment of valvular heart disease)</u>. Stress echocardiography with exercise or drugs such as dobutamine may be performed to evaluate the inducible myocardial ischemia or myocardial viability in patients considering coronary artery revascularization. It is also useful in evaluating changes in diastolic functional parameters during stress.\n\n【8】### 删除11:<u>(2)</u> Computed tomography coronary angiography and invasive coronary angiography\n\n【9】Computed tomography coronary angiography may help to rule out coronary artery disease in patients with low-to-intermediate pre-test probability, or in patients whose non-invasive stress test results are difficult to determine. Additionally, CT has the supplementary benefit of being able to investigate extracardiac structures such as the lung and thyroid.
