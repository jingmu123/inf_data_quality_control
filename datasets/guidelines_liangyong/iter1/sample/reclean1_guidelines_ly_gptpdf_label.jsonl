Evidence of ERAS in patients with IBD is sparse 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[226]</u></u>. It is however the opinion of the working group that the ERAS concept should be adopted to IBD patients. The subsequent guidance should be followed during the perioperative period. From a metabolic and nutritional point of view, the key aspects of perioperative care include.\n\n【5】* avoidance of long periods of preoperative fasting\n* re-establishment of oral feeding as early as possible after surgery\n* integration of nutrition into the overall management of the patient\n* metabolic control e.g. of blood glucose\n* reduction of factors exacerbating stress-related catabolism or impairing gastrointestinal function\n* early mobilization to facilitate protein synthesis and muscle function.\n\n【6】**Which nutritional strategies should be considered in the perioperative phase?**\n\n【7】#### Recommendation 42.\nIn surgical patients, medical nutrition therapy (EN and/or PN as indicated) should be initiated without delay if the patient is malnourished at the time of surgery or if oral diet cannot be adequately recommenced within seven days after surgery.  \n**Grade of recommendation GPP – Strong consensus 96% agreement.**\n\n【8】**Commentary.**\n\n【9】This recommendation has been adapted from the ESPEN Guideline: Clinical Nutrition in Surgery 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[107]</u></u> in a slightly modified way since the principles apply equally to the IBD patient undergoing surgical intervention. Nutritional support is indicated in patients with malnutrition and even in patients without significant malnutrition if it is anticipated that the patient will be unable to eat for more than five days perioperatively. It is also indicated in patients who cannot maintain oral intake above 50% of the recommended intake for more than seven days. In these situations, it is recommended to initiate nutritional support (preferably by the enteral route) without delay 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[107]</u></u>.\n\n【10】#### Recommendation 43.\nPatients who do not meet their energy and/or protein needs from normal food should be encouraged to take ONS during the perioperative period.  \n**Grade of recommendation GPP – Strong consensus 96% agreement.**\n\n【11】**Commentary.**\n\n【12】Insufficient preoperative intake is an indication for dietary counseling or ONS because as Kuppinger et al. 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[227]</u></u> showed for patients undergoing abdominal surgery, low food intake before hospital admission is an independent risk factor for postoperative complications. Twenty-four trials on the use of ONS and EN have reported significant advantages from EN with particular regard to the reduction of infectious complications, length of hospital stay, and costs. In six RCTs postoperative and post-hospital administration of ONS have been investigated 删除12:<u>[228–232]</u>. The available data do not show with certainty that routine administration improves outcomes, but they do show benefits in terms of nutritional status, rate of minor complications, well-being, and quality of life in patients who cannot meet their nutritional requirements at home from normal food 删除9:<u>(See ESPEN Guideline: Clinical Nutrition in Surgery 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[107]</u></u></u>).\n\n【13】#### Recommendation 44.\nIf malnutrition is diagnosed, then IBD surgery should be delayed for 7–14 days whenever possible, and that time should be used for intensive medical nutrition (ONS, EN, and/or PN if indicated).  \n**Grade of recommendation B – Strong consensus 95% agreement.**\n\n【14】**Commentary.**\n\n【15】Undernutrition has a negative impact on the clinical course, the rate of postoperative complications, and mortality 删除12:<u>[233–238]</u>. Therefore, patients with severe nutritional risk will benefit from nutritional therapy before major surgery even if surgery has to be delayed. “Severe” nutritional metabolic risk has been defined by the ESPEN working group as the presence of at least one of the following criteria 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[107]</u></u>.\n\n【16】* Weight loss >10–15% within six months\n* BMI <18.5 kg/m²\n* NRS >5\n* Serum albumin <30 g/L (with no evidence of hepatic or renal dysfunction)\n\n【17】A meta-analysis of five studies of 1111 patients showed a reduction in the rate of postoperative complications in the group receiving preoperative nutrition (20.0% - EN or total PN) compared with 61.3% in the group with standard care without nutrition therapy support (OR 0.删除13:<u>26, 95</u>% CI 0.07–0.99, p < 0.001) 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[222]</u></u>. The recommendation is based on studies performed mostly on cancer patients, IBD individuals are different, and possibly they can wait longer in most cases. Because of the extrapolation from cancer to patients with IBD, a downgrade of the original grade of recommendation 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[107]</u></u> from A to B seems to be justified. The time frame of 7–14 days is questionable, it might be longer in patients with IBD 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[239,240]</u></u>. There are no controlled data for the duration of medical nutrition therapy before surgery – the recommendation of 7–14 days is in agreement with ESPEN Guideline: Clinical Nutrition in Surgery 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[107]</u></u>, which might be even longer in patients with IBD 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[239,240]</u></u>.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 12, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/2023 ESPEN指南：炎症性肠病的临床营养.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

This strong recommendation will provide impetus to address these concerns and maximize access across regions and countries. The GDG did not anticipate important variability in patient values and preferences, and judged that other contextual factors would not alter the recommendation.\n\n【1】## Emerging evidence\n\n【2】When making the strong recommendation for treatment with baricitinib, the GDG carefully considered the implications of a yet unpublished large trial (RECOVERY) having randomized patients to baricitinib or no baricitinib. Uncertainties regarding this trial included the proportion of patients who also received an IL-6 receptor blocker 删除9:<u>(see below)</u>, and when the information will be available. The GDG considered the benefits of baricitinib, supported by moderate to high certainty evidence, sufficient for an immediate strong recommendation for use of the drug, with readiness to update the living guideline as necessary once RECOVERY trial data are published. The RECOVERY trial is now published and confirms the beneficial effects of baricitinib in patients with severe and critical COVID-19. The GDG will fully assess the updated evidence for baricitinib once the LNMA has been updated and before the next iteration of the guideline.\n\n【3】## The role of IL-6 receptor blockers and baricitinib\n\n【4】The GDG has previously made a strong recommendation for use of IL-6 receptor blockers (tocilizumab and sarilumab) in patients with severe or critical COVID-19. The GDG carefully considered whether, on the basis of the current evidence, baricitinib should be administered as an alternative to IL-6 receptor blockers or in addition to IL-6 receptor blockers. Combining them may unacceptably increase harms, including secondary bacterial and fungal infections. In the absence of evidence of incremental benefit, the GDG advises that clinicians do not administer the drugs together.\n\n【5】The issue then arises regarding the basis for choosing between IL-6 receptor blockers and baricitinib. The drugs have not undergone direct comparisons, and so the best evidence of their relative effects comes from indirect comparisons generated by the LNMA that informs these guidelines. Baricitinib may reduce mortality relative to IL-6 receptor blockers (low certainty) and may reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation (low certainty). There may be little or no difference in the agents’ impact on mechanical ventilation (low certainty), and there is probably little or no difference in adverse events leading to discontinuation (moderate certainty).\n\n【6】The GDG felt that the low certainty evidence did not warrant a recommendation favouring the use of baricitinib versus IL-6 receptor blockers on the basis of their impact on patient-important benefits and harms. Therefore, when both agents are available, clinicians should choose between them based on other considerations. These might include experience and comfort using the drugs; local institutional policies; route of administration (baricitinib is oral; IL-6 receptor blockers are intravenous); and cost.\n\n【7】## Applicability\n\n【8】None of the included RCTs enrolled children, and therefore the applicability of this recommendation to children remains uncertain. Uncertainty also remains with regard to administration of baricitinib to pregnant or lactating women. The decision regarding use of this therapeutic should be made between the pregnant individual and their health care provider while discussing whether the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the mother and fetus.\n\n【9】### Clinical Question/PICO\n\n【10】**Population:** Patients with severe or critical COVID-19  \n**Intervention:** Baricitinib  \n**Comparator:** Standard care\n\n【11】### Summary\n\n【12】**Evidence summary**\n\n【13】The LNMA for baricitinib was informed by three RCTs which enrolled 2659 patients across disease severities. All RCTs were registered, and two were published in peer-reviewed journals; one study was a pre-print. All three RCTs enrolled patients in in-patient settings. None of the included studies enrolled children or pregnant women.

Four of these studies 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[235,240,242,243]</u></u> used electrochemically activated (ECO) water. The water was generated by electrolysis of solution containing NaCl and HCl. This produced alkaline and acidic water with free chlorine, and neutral pH water was obtained by combining the two. One study 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[240]</u></u> showed that up to 10 min of exposure (concentration of 33.22 free chlorine, pH 5.12) was required to remove HNV (GI and GII) by 3 x log10.

Another study 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[242]</u></u> showed complete inactivation of FCV within 1 min of exposure on plastic coupons with free chlorine concentrations of 150 ppm or 500 ppm at neutral pH. One study 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[243]</u></u>, which used MNV on stainless steel coupons, reported that ECO water may be effective and that the availability of free chlorine and acidity may positively affect the disinfection. However, another study 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[235]</u></u>, which assessed the effectiveness of ECO water and NaCl-L- deactivation of MNV from stainless steel and PVC surfaces, reported that when the concentration of free available chlorine was the same, NaCl-L was superior to ECO water. Finally, one laboratory study 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[241]</u></u> assessed the effectiveness of fogged chlorine dioxide on removal of HNV and GII and inactivation of MNV.

MANAGEMENT OF HFpEF\n\n【1】Management of HFpEF focuses on: 1) risk stratification and management of comorbidities, including hypertension, DM, obesity, AF, CAD, CKD, and obstructive sleep apnea; 2) nonpharmacological management, including the role of exercise and weight loss and the use of wireless, implantable pulmonary artery monitors; and 3) symptom management and disease-modifying therapy with loop diuretic agents, SGLT2is, mineralocorticoid antagonists (MRAs), angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs), and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs).\n\n【2】## 7.1. Guideline-Directed Medical Therapy for HFpEF\n\n【3】Historically, medical therapy for HFpEF resulted in a discouraging array of negative trials with no demonstrated benefit in HFpEF, including trials of perindopril, irbesartan, beta-blockers, nitrates, digoxin, ivabradine, sildenafil, and serelaxin. However, recent clinical trials have demonstrated the benefit of GDMT in individuals with HFpEF, and initiation of key agents is essential to improve symptoms and functional capacity and reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with HF 删除9:<u>(Table 2)</u>. Initiation of GDMT is safe and effective in both acute and chronic-care settings. Table 3 provides recommended starting and target doses for GDMT for HFpEF. Clinicians should also consider relevant cautions and contraindications when prescribing GDMT, as outlined in Table 4. Figure 9 outlines the approach to GDMT initiation and titration.\n\n【4】Diuretic agents should be used judiciously as needed to reduce congestion and improve symptoms. Of note, beta-blockers may be used in individuals with HFpEF who have specific indications, including prior myocardial infarction (for up to 3 years), angina, or AF, but exercise tolerance should be monitored due to the potential for chronotropic incompetence.\n\n【5】### 7.1.1. Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitors\n\n【6】Originally developed to improve glucose control in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), the SGLT2is have demonstrated significant cardiovascular benefits in individuals with and without T2DM. This is particularly evident in individuals with HF, as SGLT2is significantly reduce the risk of hospitalization for HF and cardiovascular death across all EF subgroups. Therefore, SGLT2i should be initiated in all individuals with HFpEF lacking contraindications.\n\n【7】The DELIVER (Dapagliflozin Evaluation to Improve the LIVEs of Patients With PReserved ejection fraction Heart Failure) and EMPEROR-Preserved (Empagliflozin Outcome Trial in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction) trials specifically evaluated\n\n【8】## 表格内容\n\n【9】### TABLE 1 Diagnostic Clues and Recommended Testing for HFpEF Mimics\n\n| HFpEF Mimic               | Clinical Clues                                              | Diagnostic Testing                                                                                          |\n|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Cardiac amyloidosis**   | Increased LV wall thickness                                 | Monoclonal protein screen (serum/urine immunofixation electrophoresis and serum free light chains)          |\n|                           | Musculoskeletal issues (carpal tunnel syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis) | Tc99m pyrophosphate scan (interpreted in the context of a negative monoclonal protein screen)                |\n|                           | Neuropathy (sensory or autonomic)                           | Endomyocardial biopsy if monoclonal protein screen is positive                                               |\n| **Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy** | Unexplained LV hypertrophy                           | CMR if diagnosis is uncertain based on echocardiogram                                                       |\n|                           | LV outflow tract obstruction                               |\n|                           | Family history                                             |\n| **Cardiac sarcoidosis**   | Extracardiac disease (pulmonary, ocular, dermatologic)      | CMR                                                                                                         |\n|                           | High-degree atrioventricular block (especially if age <60) | FDG-PET scan                                                                                                |\n|                           | Ventricular arrhythmias                                    | Tissue biopsy (cardiac or extracardiac)                                                                     |\n| **Hemochromatosis**       | Family history or history of frequent blood transfusions    | Ferritin and transferrin                                                                                    |\n|                           | Diabetes                                                   | HFE genetic testing                                                                                         |\n|                           | Erectile dysfunction                                       | CMR with T2* imaging                                                                                        |\n| **Fabry disease**         | Angiokeratomas                                              | Serum alpha-galactosidase level (in men)                                                                    |\n|                           | Sensory neuropathy                                         | GLA genetic testing                                                                                         |\n|                           | Proteinuria                                                | Biopsy of affected tissue                                                                                   |\n|                           | X-linked inheritance                                       |\n| **High-output HF**        | Echocardiogram with 4-chamber enlargement and/or increased LV outflow tract VTI | Investigate and treat underlying cause: anemia, arteriovenous malformations, cirrhosis, fistulas, thiamine deficiency |\n| **Myocarditis**           | Antecedent viral infection                                  | CMR                                                                                                         |\n|                           | Elevated troponin in the absence of coronary artery disease | Endomyocardial biopsy                                                                                       |\n|                           | Heart block and/or ventricular arrhythmias                 |\n| **Pericardial disease**   | Prior cardiac surgery, chest radiation, or pericarditis     | CMR                                                                                                         |\n|                           | Right-sided HF symptoms                                    | Right and left heart catheterization to demonstrate discordance in LV/RV pressure tracings during inspiration|\n\n【11】CMR = cardiac magnetic resonance;

Mehta, MD, FAHA, Vice Chair; on behalf of the American Heart Association Council on Cardiovascular Surgery and Anesthesia; Council on Cardiopulmonary, Critical Care, Perioperative and Resuscitation; and Council on Peripheral Vascular Disease\n\n【5】**ABSTRACT:** The pregnancy-related mortality rate in the United States is excessively high. The American Heart Association is dedicated to fighting heart disease and recognizes that cardiovascular disease, preexisting or acquired during pregnancy, is the leading cause of maternal mortality in the United States. Comprehensive scientific statements from cardiology and obstetrics experts guide the treatment of cardio-obstetric patients before, during, and after pregnancy. This scientific statement aims to highlight the role of specialized cardio-obstetric anesthesiology care, presenting a systematic approach to the care of these patients from the anesthesiology perspective. The anesthesiologist is a critical part of the pregnancy heart team as the perioperative physician who is trained to prevent or promptly recognize and treat patients with peripartum cardiovascular decompensation. Maternal morbidity is attenuated with expert anesthesiology peripartum care, which includes the management of neuraxial anesthesia, inotrope and vasopressor support, transthoracic echocardiography, optimization of delivery location, and consideration of advanced critical care and mechanical support when needed. Standardizing the anesthesiology approach to patients with high peripartum cardiovascular risk and ensuring that cardio-obstetrics patients have access to the appropriate care team, facilities, and advanced cardiovascular therapies will contribute to improving peripartum morbidity and mortality.\n\n【6】**Key Words:** \nAHA Scientific Statements • anesthesiology • cardiovascular disease • maternal mortality • obstetrics • patient care team • peripartum period\n\n【7】The pregnancy-related mortality rate is disconcertingly high in the United States compared with other high-income nations. In 2017, the pregnancy-related mortality rate in the United States was 17.3 per 100 000 pregnancies compared with <10 per 100 000 in other high-income nations. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of maternal mortality in the United States, accounting for >25% of maternal deaths, with cardiovascular maternal morbidity and mortality disproportionately affecting Black patients, who have a 3- to 4-fold higher rate of death than non-Hispanic White pregnant patients. The evolving discipline of cardio-obstetrics aims to improve maternal morbidity and mortality through the multidisciplinary care of pregnant patients with congenital or acquired heart disease. The discipline seeks to improve the recognition of CVD in pregnancy and to promote multidisciplinary care coordination to mitigate peripartum and postpartum complications. The role of the anesthesiologist in a multidisciplinary pregnancy heart team is crucial to peripartum care. The goal of this scientific statement is to provide a practical framework for coordinating the anesthetic care of cardio-obstetric patients undergoing delivery .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 1, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/2023 AHA科学声明：患有心血管疾病孕妇的麻醉护理.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Routine premedication has been generally avoided for fear of masking hypersensitivity reactions. However, given the difficulty in distinguishing hypersensitivity and non-allergic infusion reactions and the availability of TDM, universal premedication and TDM can be considered, which can decrease the incidence and severity of adverse events and the need to substitute pegaspargase with ERW-rywn.

When evaluating a bone lesion on MRI, one should begin with the T1 signal characteristics. If a T1 sequence is not available, the patient should return for dedicated T1-weighted imaging.\n\n【2】**T1 signal much higher than skeletal muscle or adjacent intervertebral disc**  \nLesions with internal high T1 signal that matches subcutaneous fat signal on all pulse sequences are almost always benign (Bone-RADS1). The differential considerations are focal fatty marrow, intraosseous hematoma, lipoma, osteonecrosis, Paget disease, Modic type 2 discogenic degenerative changes, and other post-inflammatory bone marrow changes. When there is high signal on all pulse sequences, both benign and malignant lesions are considerations. Here, post-contrast imaging can then help further narrow the differential diagnosis. If a T1 hyperintense lesion shows no or only thin peripheral enhancement, an intraosseous ganglion or subchondral cyst containing proteinaceous material should be considered, particularly when in a periarticular location (Bone-RADS1). Conversely, a T1 hyperintense lesion with central or mass-like enhancement would warrant a Bone-RADS4 designation, with differential considerations including melanoma metastasis or hemorrhagic metastasis. Of note, internal enhancement within intraosseous ganglia or subchondral cysts can be related to internal fibrous component, enhancing synovial joint fluid entering the cyst, or contrast diffusion into the cyst from surrounding bone marrow. Melanoma metastases can present as well-circumscribed high T1 lesions owing to the paramagnetic effect of melanin and presence of hemorrhage and show solid enhancement on post-contrast images. If post-contrast images are not available, a high T1 lesion not matching the subcutaneous fat signal is considered a Bone-RADS2 lesion, and additional imaging with contrast or chemical shift sequences is recommended for further characterization. On chemical shift images, a signal drop of >20% supports a benign diagnosis, while a signal drop of less than or equal to 20% is indeterminate and cannot differentiate between benign and malignant neoplasms. Using 20% signal drop as a cutoff has a 95-100% sensitivity and 61-95% specificity.\n\n【3】**T1 signal slightly higher than skeletal muscle or adjacent intervertebral disc**  \nFocal islands of red marrow are the classic lesion in this category and are common diagnostic dilemmas. One should search for the presence of macroscopic internal fat in the lesion which is highly predictive of benignity. Red marrow can have concerning MRI appearance as some lesions can be mass-like and may not show evidence of macroscopic fat. For these equivocal areas of red marrow, chemical shift imaging with in-phase and out-of-phase T1-weighted gradient images may be helpful in differentiating between red marrow from neoplastic processes. If chemical shift imaging is not available, these slightly high T1 lesions are considered Bone-RADS2, and additional chemical shift imaging, radiographs, and/or bone scan should be performed. The red marrow lesion would be normal on plain film radiograph, and the bone scan would not show uptake. A focal marrow abnormality that fails to show macroscopic or microscopic fat mandates further investigation, and we recommend applying the “low T1” algorithm to these lesions.\n\n【4】**High T1 signal in fluid level or due to hemorrhage**  \nHemorrhage is the most common lesion to have a high T1 signal at the fluid level within a cystic component. When following the “High T2” algorithm for lesions with intralesional high T1 signal attributed to fluid-fluid or fluid-blood level, as these lesions most likely have simultaneous high T2 signal, and the hemorrhage could be masking an underlying lesion.\n\n【5】## Low T1 lesion\nIf lesion shows low T1 signal, the next step is to evaluate T2 signal characteristics.\n\n【6】**Low T1 high T2 lesions**\nMany neoplastic diseases are characterized by low to intermediate signal intensity on T1 and high signal intensity on T2 when compared to normal muscle. When detected, both primary benign and malignant bone tumors as well as metastatic lesions should be considered. Although MRI cannot accurately differentiate between the benign and malignant lesions solely based on signal characteristics, the incorporation of other imaging features can help in the diagnostic management of these lesions.\n\n【7】**Presence of concerning imaging features**\nWhen faced with a low T1 and high T2 incidental bone lesion, a search for concerning imaging features should be a primary focus.

Eye involvement may occur in 80% of patients, and other organs, including the liver, kidney, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract can be involved. Medications are the most common trigger, however, other etiological factors include mycoplasma, viruses, and vaccines. There have been several published reports of TEN associated with COVID-19 infection, however, the majority, in adults, were probably associated with medication used for treatment. SJS/TEN has also been documented following COVID-19 vaccination. Classification of SJS and TEN is determined mainly by severity and percentage of body surface involved. SJS is the less severe condition, in which skin sloughing is limited to <10% of body surface area (BSA) while mucous membranes are affected in >90% of patients. TEN involves sloughing of >30% BSA with nearly 100% involvement of mucous membranes. In SJS/TEN overlap syndrome, patients have BSA involvement of >10% but <30%. Exposure to the inciting drug commonly precedes the onset of symptoms by 1 to 4 weeks in medication-related cases and it rarely more than 8 weeks. Upon re-exposure, symptoms may recur in as little as 48 hours. Typically, there is a prodrome of fever and flu-like symptoms. In the early stages of the disease, skin pain may be prominent and out of proportion to clinical findings. Skin lesion distribution is symmetrical, starting on the face and chest before spreading to other areas. Vesicles and bullae form followed, usually within days, by skin sloughing. Prognosis is related to the extent of epidermal involvement. Re-epithelialization typically occurs within 1 to 3 weeks. Fulminant cases of TEN highly resistant to therapy have been described. Skin biopsies in TEN shows full thickness epidermal necrosis, subepidermal detachment and limited lymphocytic infiltration at the dermoepidermal junction. Mortality in SJS is 1% to 3%, while mortality for TEN is 25% to 30%. The pathogenesis of SJS/TEN remains incompletely understood. Proposed mechanisms implicate granulysin (a protein secreted by cytotoxic T and NK cells), fas/fas-ligand mediated keratinocyte apoptosis, perforin, reactive-oxygen species, and TNF-alpha in mediating keratinocyte cell death. There is a strong associated between the HLA-B*1502 allele and carbamazepine induced TEN.\n\n【6】## Current management/treatment\n\n【7】For medication-induced SJS/TEN, the causative medication must be immediately withdrawn. Delayed removal of the causative drug, and drugs with long half-lives are associated with worse prognosis. A prognostic scoring system (SCORTEN) based upon easily measured clinical and laboratory variables has been validated for use on days 1 and 3 of hospitalization. TEN is managed by supportive care in an intensive care unit or burn center, and includes skin care, fluid and electrolyte management, nutritional support, eye care, temperature management, appropriate analgesia, and treatment of infections. Fluid and electrolyte losses may occur due to the extensive mucocutaneous lesions. Patients with TEN are at high risk for infection, and sepsis is the major cause of death. Aggressive culture and sterile precautions are important in minimizing this risk. Use of prophylactic antibiotics is not recommended. Beyond supportive care, there are no universally accepted therapies for this disease. Treatment may include one or a combination of medications (glucocorticoids, cyclosporine, etanercept), IVIG and TPE. Two large meta-analyses of nearly 100 studies have suggested a promising survival benefit with the use of glucocorticoid and cyclosporine 删除19:<u>(Zimmerman, 2017; Houschyar, 2021)</u>. One retrospective study demonstrated that high-dose steroid administration with or without TPE and/or IVIG was associated with a lower mortality rate (13.6% vs. 24.0%) predicted by the SCORTEN based on the analysis of patients with TEN treated with supportive care alone 删除19:<u>(Watanabe, 2021)</u>. A metanalysis and metaregression of observational studies in TEN suggested that of the interventions reviewed, the lowest mortality rate was associated with treatment using etanercept or steroids whereas the highest mortality rate was observed in those patients that received TPE and TPE + IVIG 删除19:<u>(Krajewski, 2022)</u>. This mortality was higher than supportive care alone. It was noted, however, that patients in these studies receiving TPE and/or IVIG did have a higher SCORTEN. One large group review noted their 10-year experience of using simultaneous TPE and IVIG to control the disease. Twenty-eight patients receiving both TPE and IVIG were compared to 7 patients that received a single therapy treatment. The mortality in the test group was 14.29%, and the difference reached statistical significance (P<.05) in comparison with the single therapy group 删除19:<u>(Strużyna, 2022)</u>.\n\n【8】## Rationale for therapeutic apheresis\n\n【9】The rational supporting TPE in TEN includes removal of drug/drug metabolites, cytokines, or other mediators of keratinocyte cytotoxicity. At least one report has demonstrated decreased levels of serum cytokines following TPE 删除19:<u>(Narita, 2011)</u>. TPE is typically not used in patients with SJS.\n\n【10】Numerous uncontrolled CRs and CS have noted use of TPE in the setting of severe cases of TEN refractory to standard treatment.

The polyps are readily identified as PJS polyps pathologically, and only 1 known gene (STK11) is associated with this entity. The phenotype is clinically distinct. Not all patients (or families) have detectable germline pathogenic variants in STK11, so additional genes in this pathway are possibly contributors to this entity. The polyps may evolve through an expansion of elements of the gut stroma due to haploinsufficiency of STK11. In children, the main risks are for gastrointestinal obstruction and bleeding. Later in adult life, a very high risk of intestinal and extraintestinal cancers exists. The major organs at risk for cancer (in order of decreasing relative risk) include the small intestine, stomach, pancreas, colon, esophagus, ovary, lung, uterus, and breast, with estimated lifetime risks for any cancer reaching >90%. The ovaries and testes are also at risk for rare variant tumors. The screening and surveillance strategies change dramatically when the children reach adulthood.\n\n【2】JPS has principal risks for obstruction and bleeding in the pediatric ages, but the management in adults shifts to cancer risks in the stomach and colon. Importantly, unlike PJS, the gastrointestinal cancers tend to arise within the juvenile polyps, suggesting that polyp removal might prevent cancer. Cancer risk is linked to germline pathogenic variants in the SMAD4 gene rather than the BMPR1A gene. The polyps are histologically inflammatory in nature, and their growth may be driven by haploinsufficiency of SMAD4 in the immune cells of the polyp stroma. The management of these patients involves the identification of pathogenic variants in the SMAD4 gene and evaluation for HHT.\n\n【3】The hamartoma syndromes associated with PTEN and infantile polyps present a completely different clinical challenge. Although nearly all patients with PHTS have a variety of different hamartomatous gastrointestinal polyps, studies suggest an increased risk of cancer in this setting. The noncolonic cancer risks are greatest for the breast, thyroid, melanoma, and endometrium. The absolute risk for CRC appears to be increased, ranging from 9% to 18% during a lifetime, and the rest of the gastrointestinal tract does not have an established increase in cancer risk. The age for beginning surveillance for CRC remains to be determined, but the early onset of CRC provides some suggestions. Be aware that the PTEN gene and BMPR1A are located near one another on chromosome 10, and that large-scale chromosomal deletions could adversely affect both genes, complicating the clinical picture. Long-term prospective studies of mutation carriers are still needed to further clarify the risk of cancer and the role of surveillance in these syndromes. With increases in genetic testing and evaluation, future studies will be conducted with more robust cohorts of genetically characterized, less heterogeneous populations. However, there is also a need to study patients and families with unusual phenotypes where no genotype can be found.\n\n【4】## Conflicts of interest\n\n【5】The authors disclose no conflicts of interest directly relevant to this work since 2016.

In a retrospective comparison study, ATRA induced similar outcomes with modest single-agent activity compared to bexarotene in the treatment of patients with relapsed MF and SS. In a small cohort of 35 patients with early-stage MF, acitretin and isotretinoin resulted in ORRs of 64% and 80%, respectively (although the CR rates were low at 4% and 8%, respectively).\n\n【3】## Brentuximab Vedotin\nIn the ALCANZA trial, brentuximab vedotin, an anti-CD30 antibody drug conjugate, was more effective than methotrexate or bexarotene in patients with previously treated MF (≥ stage IB). The final analysis confirmed that brentuximab vedotin resulted in significantly improved ORR lasting for at least 4 months (ORR4; 55% vs. 13%), median PFS (17 vs. 4 months) and patient-reported symptom burden compared to methotrexate or bexarotene in patients with CD30-positive MF. Peripheral neuropathy was the most common adverse event reported in 44 (69%) patients. At the median follow-up of 46 months, 86% (38 of 44) of patients had completed resolution of peripheral neuropathy grades 1 and 2.\n\n【4】In ALCANZA trial, CD30 positivity was defined as CD30 expression in ≥10% of total lymphoid cells in at least 1 skin sample (43% of patients had at least 1 sample with CD30 <10%). The results of an exploratory analysis showed that brentuximab vedotin resulted in higher ORR4 and improved PFS in patients with ≥10% CD30 expression, regardless of LCT status. The ORR4 (41% vs. 10% for <10% CD30min expression; 57% vs. 10% for ≥10% CD30min expression) and median PFS (17 months vs. 2 months for <10% CD30min expression; 16 months vs. 4 months for ≥10% CD30min expression) were significantly higher for brentuximab vedotin compared to vorinostat across all CD30 expression levels.\n\n【5】In other phase II studies, clinical responses with brentuximab vedotin were observed across all CD30 expression levels (including negligible CD30 expression) and in patients with high blood Sézary cell count. Lesions with less than 5% CD30 expression had a lower likelihood of global response than those with greater than or equal to 5% CD30 expression ($P < .005$), but responses are still seen in those with CD30 positivity of greater than or equal to 1%. While responses were observed in patients with very low or absent CD30 expression, the likelihood and/or depth of response may be lower in these situations and further studies are needed to define the activity of brentuximab in this setting. Brentuximab vedotin is a more effective treatment option than methotrexate or bexarotene for patients with CD30-positive MF but carries greater risk, particularly a cumulative risk of peripheral neuropathy.\n\n【6】Patients with SS were excluded from ALCANZA trial and the efficacy of brentuximab vedotin in patients with SS in the setting of refractory disease or low CD30 skin expression has only been demonstrated in a small case series of 13 patients.\n\n【7】## Mogamulizumab\nIn the MAVERIC trial, mogamulizumab, a humanized anti CCR4 monoclonal antibody, was more effective than vorinostat in patients with previously treated MF (≥ stage IIB) and SS. Mogamulizumab resulted in significantly higher ORR (28% vs. 5%) and median PFS (8 vs. 3 months) compared with vorinostat and the ORR was higher in patients with SS than those with MF (37% vs. 21%). Patients with LCT were excluded from this trial. In a post hoc analysis, the number of prior therapies did not impact the ORR, PFS, and duration of response observed with mogamulizumab.

Despite their proven efficacy, use of topical hemostatic agents (THAs) lacks comprehensive published literature and guidelines particularly in the Indian setting. The present study provides the first-ever Indian expert panel recommendations for effective adjunct THA use in different intraoperative bleeding sites and situations in neuro-spine surgeries. A comprehensive approach, encompassing a literature review, followed by experience sharing in a meeting using a survey helped integrate expert opinions in the form of practical algorithms to guide THA selection. Our survey results revealed a strong inclination towards specific THAs, flowable gelatin + thrombin being choice of THA for difficult to access and problematic bleeding situations during tumor removal/resection, transphenoidal hypophysectomy and skull-based procedures. Both oxidized regenerated cellulose (ORC)/Fibrillar and flowable gelatin + thrombin were recommended for continuous oozing. ORC/Fibrillar was preferred for arteriovenous and cavernous malformations. This expert panel guidance on THA use aims to optimize hemostat use practices and improve surgical outcomes in neuro-spine surgery.\n\n【5】## 1. Introduction\nIntraoperative bleeding remains a major complication in surgical procedures and bleeding complications arise in nearly 30 % of surgeries $删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[1,2]</u></u>$. Neuro-spine surgery, in particular, has unique challenges due to the potential for significant intraoperative blood loss from large wound surfaces and cancellous bone. This results in long operative hours, elevates risks of postoperative complications such as hematomas and infections, and may even cause hemodynamic instability $删除12:<u>[3–5]</u>$. The impact of intraoperative bleeding extends beyond the immediate surgical setting. The need for blood transfusions, prolonged stays in intensive care units, and ventilatory support often contribute to longer\n\n【6】删除图片描述:<u>![](0_0.png)</u>\n\n【7】```\n* Corresponding author at: Arena Space, behind Majas Depot, Shyam Nagar, Jogeshwari East, Mumbai, Maharashtra 400060, India.\n  E-mail address: SDas186@ITS删除1:<u>.JNJ.com (S.

Since then, evidence has accumulated that 10p deletions are associated with GATA3 haploinsufficiency, which can result in hypoparathyroidism, sensory neural hearing loss, and renal dysplasia 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[64]</u></u>. Other associated 10p deletion findings include heart defects, delayed language development, and intellectual disability 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[13]</u></u>. A DGS expert who reviewed 23 papers on 10p deletions found that T cell or thymic defects were uncommonly associated with this condition 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[13]</u></u>.

The size of the thymus in individuals with trisomy 21 is reduced in size, hypocellular, and contains a decreased proportion of phenotypically mature thymocytes vs healthy controls 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[66]</u></u>. These findings are seen even in infants. Thymic biopsies in this population have demonstrated abnormal architecture with accelerated maturation kinetics and premature involution, with early degeneration of Hassall’s bodies 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[66]</u></u>. The thymi of affected individuals have been shown to lose their function early in childhood versus the age-related involution that would otherwise occur after puberty 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[66]</u></u>.

As with 22q11.2del, 22q11.2 duplication is also widely variable phenotypically, with many asymptomatic individuals reported 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[76]</u></u>. It has, however, also been associated with some manifestations similar to 22q11.2del, including cardiac defects, velopharyngeal insufficiency, intellectual and learning disabilities, short stature, and facial dysmorphism 删除12:<u>[76–78]</u>. In a small case series of seven patients between 3 and 17 years of age affected with 22q11.2 duplication syndrome, all were found to have normal absolute T, B, and natural killer cell numbers, and all 6 patients evaluated for naïve to memory T cells had normal ratios. However, several were diagnosed with humoral deficiencies. Three of six had low switched memory B cells (CD19 + CD27 +, IgM−). In total, two of the seven were determined to have IgG deficiency, while two others had memory-specific antibody deficiency (SAD) due to rapid waning of pneumococcal titers, and due to this, in conjunction with a concerning infections history, IGRT was recommended 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[79]</u></u>.

(100% consensus)**\n\n【3】Retinoids were suggested as second-line systemic therapy for CLE by the ‘American Academy of Dermatology’ guidelines in 1996 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[99]</u></u>. Ruzicka et al. conducted a double-blind, randomized, multicenter trial in 1992 to compare the efficacy of acitretin (50 mg/d) and HCQ (400 mg/d) in 28 and 30 CLE patients, respectively 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[77]</u></u>. Overall improvement was seen in 46% (13/28) of the patients treated with acitretin and in 50% (15/30) of the patients treated with HCQ. In addition, oral isotretinoin has been reported to be effective in the treatment of refractory SCLE 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[100,101]</u></u>. For VLE and (or) hyperkeratotic lesions of CLE, sporadic case reports have shown significant therapeutic effects of either acitretin or isotretinoin 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[102,103]</u></u>.\n\n【4】The recommended daily dose of acitretin and isotretinoin in treatment for CLE is 0.2–1.0 mg/kg body weight. It usually takes 2–6 weeks for patients to achieve treatment response 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[104]</u></u>, however, relapse of CLE can occur shortly after withdrawal of retinoids 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[100,101]</u></u>.\n\n【5】# 5.3.5. Dapsone\n\n【6】## 5.3.5.1. Recommendations.\n\n【7】- **We recommend dapsone as second-line treatment in refractory CLE, especially bullous lesions of CLE or bullous systemic lupus erythematosus (BSLE), preferably in addition to antimalarials. (100% consensus)**\n\n【8】- **To reduce the risk of its severe side effects, we recommend examination of G6PD activity and HLA-B*13:01 alleles prior to the initiation of treatment with dapsone. (100% consensus)**\n\n【9】- **We recommend to begin with a low-dose (50 mg/day) of dapsone and to increase the dose according to treatment response and side effects. The dose of dapsone must not exceed the upper limit of 1.5 mg/kg/day. (100% consensus)**\n\n【10】Dapsone is mainly used in the treatment of BSLE 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[105]</u></u>, and it is also used in DLE and SCLE where the conventional treatment is not satisfactory 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[106,107]</u></u>. Recommended by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR), dapsone (100 mg/day) alone or in combination with prednisone, is the treatment of choice for BSLE 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[108]</u></u>. A retrospective analysis of 34 CLE patients showed that dapsone was effective in more than 50% of CLE patients with or without antimalarial drugs 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[109]</u></u>. Successful treatment of LE with dapsone has been reported in 11 cases 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[110]</u></u>.\n\n【11】For safety concern, dapsone is not recommended in patients with G6PD deficiency to avoid one of its severe side effects, hemolytic anemia, in these individuals. Recent studies have confirmed that HLA-B*13:01 is associated with the development of dapsone hypersensitivity syndrome, a fatal side effects of this drug, among patients with leprosy treated with this drug 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[111]</u></u>. Thus, dapsone is not recommended in individuals carrying the HLA-B*13:01 allele. HLA-B*13:01 is present in about 2–20% of individuals in Chinese population, 1.5% in Japanese, 1–12% in Indians, and 2–4% in Southeast Asians, while it is largely absent in Europeans and Africans 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[111]</u></u>.\n\n【12】# 5.3.6. Methotrexate (MTX)\n\n【13】## 5.3.6.1. Recommendations.\n\n【14】- **We recommend low-dose MTX, usually less than 15 or 20 mg per week, preferably subcutaneously, as second-line treatment for refractory CLE, especially SCLE. (97% consensus)**\n\n【15】- **We suggest intake of folic acid at a dose of 5–10 mg/week to reduce side effects of MTX during the treatment with MTX. (91% consensus)**\n\n【16】- **We suggest regular monitoring of complete blood counts and serum levels of liver enzymes during long-term use of MTX. (100% consensus)**\n\n【17】A systematic review included a RCT and two observational trials looking at MTX in the treatment of CLE 删除12:<u>[95,112–114]</u>. In the RCT study of 41 SLE patients comparing the efficacy and safety of MTX and chloroquine (CQ) for skin manifestations of SLE, the skin lesions in both groups were significantly improved after a 24-week treatment, with no significant difference between groups, demonstrating that low-dose methotrexate can be as effective as CQ 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[112]</u></u>. In the two observational trials, improvement was achieved in most patients. Briefly, a retrospective analysis of 43 patients with CLE showed that MTX significantly reduced disease activity, with improvement in skin lesions recorded in 98% of patients treated with MTX; and in addition, 15 of these patients switched from intravenous to subcutaneous administration of MTX at subsequent follow-up, demonstrating a similar therapeutic effect 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[115]</u></u>. In the other retrospective analysis, 10 of the 12 patients with CLE receiving weekly administrations of 10–25 mg MTX showed significant improvement, whereas two patients did not respond to this treatment 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[114]</u></u>.\n\n【18】The side effects of methotrexate are mainly loss and elevated liver enzymes, and these effects are usually only mild and transient, but black box warnings on these side effects are included in the MTX label. A recent large cohort study on 2397 patients with rheumatic diseases investigated 2093 patients on oral MTX and 949 patients on subcutaneous MTX. The results showed that subcutaneous MTX had a non-significant trend to lower rates of neutropenia and only a slightly higher rate of transaminitis despite significantly higher doses than oral MTX; and in addition, continuation rates of subcutaneous MTX were higher than that of oral MTX when adjusted for follow-up duration, suggesting a superior tolerability of subcutaneous administration of this drug 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[119]</u></u>.\n\n【19】# 5.3.7. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and other immunosuppressant agents\n\n【20】## 5.3.7.1. Recommendations.\n\n【21】- **We recommend MMF as third-line treatment for refractory CLE, preferably in addition to antimalarials. (100% consensus)**\n\n【22】- **We suggest initiation of MMF at a dose of 500 mg twice daily that can be increased or tapered later depending on treatment response and side effects. (97% consensus)**\n\n【23】- **We suggest MPA as an alternative choice for MMF. (97% consensus)**\n\n【24】- **We suggest against azathioprine, cyclophosphamide and cyclosporine as a treatment for CLE without systemic involvement. (97% consensus)**\n\n【25】There is a lack of randomized controlled trials on the application of immunosuppressant agents such as mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), azathioprine, cyclophosphamide and cyclosporine in CLE. Nonetheless, the therapeutic efficacy of MMF in refractory CLE, in combination with HCQ and (or) systemic corticosteroids, has been repeatedly reported.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 9, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/【风湿免疫领域】2021+ADA／AADV／CSD指南：皮肤红斑狼疮的诊断，治疗和长期管理.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

(Grade 1A)\n\n【1】The preoperative diagnosis of HSCR mainly depends on the histopathological analysis of rectal biopsies, including rectal suction biopsy (RSB) and full-thickness rectal biopsy (FTRB). A systematic review demonstrated that the mean sensitivity of RSB was 96.84% (95% CI: 95.57–97.47%), and the mean specificity was 99.42% (95% CI: 97.19–99.57%), but 8.46% (95% CI: 7.55–9.46%) repeated RSB was required due to insufficient specimens. Systematic review showed that the conclusive rates of RSB and FTRB did not significantly differ.\n\n【2】Commonly used histological staining methods include hematoxylin and eosin (HE), enzyme histochemical staining for acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and immunohistochemical staining for calretinin. In a systematic review and meta-analysis, HE staining alone and AChE alone obtained pooled proportions of 89% (95% CI: 83–93%) and 95% (95% CI: 90–99%) conclusive results, respectively. In addition, 89% (95% CI: 81–95%) in the HE + AChE group and 94% (95% CI: 89–98%) in the HE with calretinin with or without AChE group were found.\n\n【3】### Recommendation 5: RSB or FTRB should be used as the gold standard for the preoperative diagnosis of HSCR, but consensus on the preferred histological staining method is lacking. (Grade 1A)\n\n【4】Intraoperative frozen sections are commonly used to identify ganglion cells at the resection margin of the bowel. Generally, the most commonly cited features of TZ are partial circumferential aganglionosis (absent myenteric and/or submucosal ganglion cells in a contiguous eighth of the circumference), myenteric hypoganglionosis (as defined above at 2/18 circumference), and submucosal nerve hypertrophy (e.g., >2 submucosal nerves with >40 μm thickness in one high-power field).\n\n【5】### Recommendation 6: Intraoperative frozen sections could be used to guide the length of bowel resection. (Grade 1D)\n\n【6】At present, establishing ideal guidelines for diagnosing neonatal HSCR remains challenging. Although a recent study showed that the sensitivity and specificity of CE examination exceeded 80% and 90% for neonatal HSCR, respectively, it is less reliable in the neonatal period than in older children. Furthermore, the accuracy of CE in neonatal total colonic aganglionosis (TCA) is only approximately 25%.\n\n【7】Typically, ARM is still used as a screening tool for HSCR, although the accuracy of ARM in the diagnosis of HSCR in neonates varies among the literatures.\n\n【8】As for rectal biopsies, infants <3 months of age (43.5%) had a significantly higher risk of inconclusive results than infants >3 months of age.\n\n【9】### Recommendation 7: Neonates with clinical symptoms of suspected HSCR can be screened using CE and ARM, and histopathological evaluation, such as RSB or FTRB, is the most important examination for diagnosing neonatal HSCR. (Grade 2C)\n\n【10】Preoperatively radiological patterns of TCA in CE examination include microcolon, a question mark-shaped colon, or a lack of distinct features in an otherwise normal colon. In clinical practice, multiple biopsies on the terminal ileum and whole colon during primary exploratory laparotomy are recommended to confirm the diagnosis if TCA is suspected.\n\n【11】### Recommendation 8: If TCA is suspected, a multisite biopsy involving the terminal ileum and whole colon during primary surgery is needed. (Grade 2D)\n\n【12】### Surgery for HSCR\n\n【13】Compared with multistage surgery, the single-stage pull-through procedure has the prominent advantages of shortening the length of hospital stay, reducing the number of operations, decreasing hospitalization costs, and avoiding complications of enterostomy.\n\n【14】### Recommendation 9: A single-stage pull-through procedure is recommended; however, for patients with complicated conditions, a multistage operation should be performed. (Grade 1C)\n\n【15】In recent decades, the primary pull-through approach for HSCR has gradually transformed from traditional laparotomy to minimally invasive surgeries (MIS), such as robot or laparoscopic techniques and transanal endorectal pull-through (TERPT). Evidence from a meta-analysis indicated that compared with laparotomy, laparoscopic-assisted pull-through is associated with less visible scarring, enhanced postoperative recovery, and shorter hospitalization time.\n\n【16】### Recommendation 10: Generally, the TERPT or laparoscopy approach is recommended for short-segment HSCR, and the laparoscopy or laparotomy approach is recommended for long-segment HSCR or TCA. (Grade 1B)\n\n【17】Whether primary pull-through should be performed in neonates remains controversial. In a recent meta-analysis, Westfal et al suggested that patients with short-segment HSCR who were less than 2.5 months of age at the time of TERPT had higher rates of postoperative complications, such as soiling and anastomosis problems, including stricture and leak.\n\n【18】### Recommendation 11: Single-stage pull-through is not recommended in the neonatal period. (Grade 2B)\n\n【19】Successful treatment of TCA using a single-stage laparoscopic technique has been reported. The opposite view tends to multi-stage operation, which is helpful to perform multi-site biopsies in the initial exploration operation to detect the range of the affected intestines. More importantly, multi-stage surgery reduces the risk of severe perianal irritant dermatitis and provides a window of time for behavioral training, which can improve parents' ability to control defecation after definitive operation.\n\n【20】### Recommendation 12: For TCA patients, staged ileostomy with multi-site biopsies before definite operation is preferred, and a single-stage operation is not recommended.

Converting this to a human dose, 500 mg of ceftriaxone corresponds to 5 mg/kg of body weight in a person of 80 to 100 kg, while 250 mg of ceftriaxone corresponds to 3 mg/kg of body weight.

Ceftriaxone-resistant *N. gonorrhoeae* strains have already been identified worldwide including the UK 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[14,15,24,25]</u></u>. Although low-dose ceftriaxone might be suitable for treating most gonococcal species, high-dose ceftriaxone is more effective for most isolates with increased MICs than low dose 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[23]</u></u>. Therefore, the recommended dose of ceftriaxone was increased to 500 mg for adults weighing less than 100 kg and to 1 g for adults weighing more than 100 kg to successfully treat the strain with reduced susceptibility . Intramuscular injection is thought to be helpful in maintaining concentrations above the MIC for more than 24 hours due to the “depot effect” 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[26]</u></u>. In the US FDA approval label of ceftriaxone , there is no significant difference in 24-hour plasma concentrations between intramuscular and intravenous administration. Moreover, intramuscular injection of ceftriaxone can cause pain, which most patients complain about. In the past, when intramuscular injection of 250 mg ceftriaxone was recommended, pain was not greatly considered. However, when its dose was increased to 500 mg or 1 g, the pain could not be ignored.

Alternative therapy: Gentamicin plus azithromycin\n\n【2】A large randomized controlled-trial has investigated the efficacy and safety of gentamicin for treating gonorrhea 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[21]</u></u>. In that study, gentamicin was used in combination with 1 g of azithromycin. Microbiological cure (negative NAAT after 2 weeks of treatment) was achieved in 94% of urogenital infections, 90% of rectal infections, and 80% of pharyngeal infections 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[21]</u></u>. Another randomized trial has used a 2 g dose of azithromycin in combination with gentamicin 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[28]</u></u>. Although gonococcal infection was 100% eliminated in that study, its objectives included very few non-genital infections, which was insufficient to provide a reliable estimate of the efficacy of this treatment regimen for rectal or pharyngeal infections 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[28]</u></u>. In particular, when using 2 g of azithromycin, gastrointestinal adverse reactions (mainly vomiting within 1 hour after administration) occurred in 3%–4% of patients treated with gentamicin plus azithromycin 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[28]</u></u>. Nevertheless, gentamicin plus azithromycin therapy can be considered as an alternative to ceftriaxone for cephalosporin- allergic patients with genital gonococcal infections. Since spectinomycin is available in Korea, it is recommended as an alternative therapy to ceftriaxone. In a previous meta-analysis study, cure rates of spectinomycin and ceftriaxone were not significantly different (82.6% vs. 88.0%, p=0.05) 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[29]</u></u>. According to results of analysis of antimicrobial resistance of gonorrhea in Korea, strains resistant to spectinomycin were not observed in 2017 or 2018 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[30]</u></u>. Gentamicin plus azith- romycin or spectinomycin is less effective for non-genital infections, especially pharyngeal gonococcal infections than for urogenital gonococcal infection 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[31]</u></u>. Thus, it is not recommended.\n\n【3】### 4.

They provided a single reference to support this which was a case series of eight patients who had an Impella device in an arrest, of whom four survived to hospital discharge. We identified a further paper documenting use in 7 patients in arrest, although only 1 survived, and a multicentre study across four countries of 35 patients having Impella insertion while in cardiac arrest with a 45% survival.\n\n【5】There have been case series and cohort studies of the use of the Impella in cardiogenic shock in adults and children and in high-risk PCI cases and there is an interesting ongoing RCT currently recruiting that aims to randomise 360 patients with shock post-myocardial infarction (MI) to standard therapy or Impella that will report in the coming years.\n\n【6】The 2021 joint ERC and European Society of Intensive Care medicine guidelines for postresuscitation care state that ‘the evidence about which type of mechanical device is superior appears inconclusive and thus their use should be decided on a case-by-case basis.’\n\n| Recommendation                                                                              | Class | Level |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| The use of an Impella is not routinely recommended in cardiac arrest in the catheter laboratory | III (lack of benefit) |   |\n\n【8】### The identification and treatment of pericardial tamponade\n\n【9】Sethi et al reported the findings of the US National Inpatient Sample database from 2009 to 2013 which covers around 90% of all patients in the USA. They document 64 000 pericardiocentesis procedures and 57% of these were in unstable patients, 17% were in PCI cases, 13% in EP procedures and 14% in structural heart procedures. Thus, pericardiocentesis is performed in all types of catheter laboratory interventions. As this was a database study they were unable to comment on the procedural success rate, although the inpatient mortality in the database overall was around one in four.\n\n【10】Tsang et al documented a 21-year experience with a thousand pericardiocentesis procedures at the Mayo Clinic, including many patients with perforation in the catheter laboratory. They report a 97% procedural success for this procedure in all settings with only a 2% major complication rate. They also reported that they saw a significant increase in the rate that clinicians left a drain in situ during the period of the study from 25% to 75%.\n\n【11】Cho et al confirmed these findings in a report of nearly 300 echocardiography guided pericardiocentesis procedures, with approximately 40 during PCI. They reported a 99% procedural success with a 1% complication rate.\n\n【12】A UK observational study of 270 329 PCI procedures in the context of acute coronary syndromes describes 103 coronary perforations (0.37%). Importantly, the adjusted ORs for all clinical outcomes were adversely affected by coronary perforation. The conclusion was ‘coronary perforation is an infrequent event during ACS-PCI but is closely associated with adverse clinical outcomes’.\n\n【13】The ESC position statement on the urgent management of cardiac tamponade gives a class I indication for pericardiocentesis for tamponade, preferring echocardiographic guidance where possible although fluoroscopic guidance is an accepted alternative. If unsuccessful, surgical drainage is recommended. Of note these guidelines are mainly for non-iatrogenic causes of the tamponade.\n\n【14】It is extremely important that all catheter laboratories have immediate access to an echo machine in order to be able to confirm or exclude tamponade in an emergency. All cardiologists who perform interventional procedures should be trained in pericardiocentesis techniques, and all catheter labs should have a dedicated and easily accessible pericardiocentesis kit, which the team are familiar with. The emergency procedures for pericardiocentesis should be familiar to all catheter laboratory staff. The pericardiocentesis/perforation kit should be stored together and include drainage equipment, coils and covered stents. There should be an agreed unit protocol as to the method of distal embolisation technique as a wide variety of options are available.\n\n【15】In all cases of pericardial collection, repeat TTE should be performed within 24 hours of return to the ward and often again within the following few hours. This is particularly important in the case of distal wire perforations and any case in which a perforation has apparently sealed spontaneously.\n\n| Recommendations                                                                                     | Class | Level |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|-------|\n| Pericardiocentesis should be performed for all patients with pericardial tamponade and where possible this should be with echocardiographic or fluoroscopic guidance.

This comprised of 1762 patients of whom 14% developed tamponade (246 pts) and 3% required emergency surgery (52 patients). Thus, there are roughly 250 coronary perforations per year with around 35 associated episodes of tamponade and seven patients per year in the UK who require emergency surgery after coronary perforation.\n\n【19】This number is likely to have increased since 2013. Furthermore, this database does not include pacing procedures, EP or structural heart procedures. Thirty-seven per cent of coronary perforations occurred in a unit without surgical cover (589 coronary perforations in units without on-site surgical cover compared with 997 in units with cover). Coronary perforations can be classified using the Ellis Classification both in the arrest and the non-arrest situation according to the significance of the defect created in the artery.\n\n【20】With regard to the perforation of cardiac chambers from non-PCI interventions, the National Cardiovascular Data Registry in the USA documented 625 cardiac perforations in a 5-year", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 11, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/BHRS BCS BCOS：心脏导管室内心脏骤停的管理指南（2022）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

With dose optimisation based on TDM in the morning on day 2, the probability of achieving day 2 AUC (24–48 h) targets can be increased.\n\n【2】2. Candidates for day 2 TDM and two-point measurement have similar patient/infection characteristics (e.g., high risk of AKI or serious infection). Therefore, two-point measurement (e.g., before [trough] and 1–2 h after [peak] the third dose) is a reasonable approach in ICU patients in whom vancomycin is administered q12h and TDM is performed on day 2 (III-A).\n\n【3】3. As mentioned in CQ 4, two-point measurement was recommended in patients receiving q24h administration. It should be considered that only a loading dose was administered on day 1 in such patients, and two-point measurement is strongly recommended when TDM was planned in the morning on day 2. When only the trough concentration was measured on day 2 in non-ICU patients, the third dose may be postponed to optimise the dose until the confirmation of TDM results.\n\n【4】4. Delaying TDM until near steady state (i.e., 3 days after vancomycin therapy) might be applicable in patients with mild/moderate MRSA infections and those without a risk of AKI (III-A).\n\n【5】5. Performing earlier and frequent TDM is prudent in critically ill ICU patients (I).\n\n【6】CQ 6. What is the target AUC in TDM?\n\n【7】1. The target AUC/MIC for improving the efficacy of treatment for MRSA infection is ≥400 when using the MIC determined by the broth microdilution method (MIC_BMD). The ratio should be ≥200 when using the MIC determined by Etest (MIC_Etest) (III-A). For empirical therapy before MIC determination, the target AUC should be ≥400 μg h/mL presuming an MIC of 1 μg/mL (III-A).\n\n【8】2. Because of the insignificant difference of a 2-fold dilution in the measurement of MIC, the AUC/MIC ratio has excessive sensitivity to errors of MIC. Hence, the committee recommend the same AUC targets irrespective of the MIC even after determination of the MIC (III-A).\n\n【9】3. To reduce the risk of AKI, the AUC should be ≤600 μg h/mL (I).\n\n【10】4. In the actual clinical setting, the recommended target AUC is 400–600 μg h/mL (I).\n\n【11】5. Because limited data are available regarding AUC targets for increasing treatment success rates against infections caused by antibiotic-resistant organisms other than MRSA (III-B), revision of the dosing regimen should be decided according to the treatment response even at AUC/MIC < 400 for such infections.\n\n【12】CQ 7. Is a continuous infusion administration strategy superior to intermittent infusion?\n\n【13】1. A lower AKI risk was demonstrated with continuous administration than with intermittent administration using trough-guided dosing (II).\n\n【14】2. As the common practice of continuous infusion, after a loading dose (15–20 mg/kg), a maintenance dose (30–40 mg/kg) was administered continuously over 24 h (III-A).\n\n【15】3. The PK level to monitor is the plateau level (i.e., steady-state concentration), and the target concentration is 20–25 μg/mL for continuous infusion (III-A).\n\n【16】4. Because no comparative study on efficacy and safety between continuous and intermittent infusion therapy based on AUC-guided dosing is available, vancomycin continuous infusion is not currently recommended (III-B).\n\n【17】CQ 8. Is a loading dose required to achieve the target concentration and improve treatment efficacy?\n\n【18】1. To increase the concentration on days 1–2, the routine use of a loading dose is required irrespective of renal function (I). This may increase the early treatment response (III-A).\n\n【19】2. A loading dose does not increase the risk of AKI (III-C).\n\n【20】3. Not only the initial loading dose but also the subsequent maintenance doses have a significant impact on the achievement of AUC targets at steady state (III-C).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 6, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/JSC_JSTDM：模型引导精准用药框架下的万古霉素治疗药物监测指南（2022）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

There is no consensus on the frequency of biopsies in children. Some centers do no EMB at all, but instead use detailed echocardiographic assessment.

However, in spite of the overall weak diagnostic potential of PSG, objectively assessed sleep quantity parameters may distinguish insomniacs from those with short or with normal sleep duration, with the former constituting the most biologically severe phenotype, with significant therapeutic and prognostic implications 删除19:<u>(Vgontzas et al. 2013; Bertisch et al. 2018)</u>.\n\n【1】Since the publication of the neurocognitive model of insomnia 删除19:<u>(Perlis et al. 1997)</u>, spectral analysis of sleep EEG is assumed to provide a more fine grained approach to evaluate changes in sleep of patients with insomnia; fast frequencies (in the sigma/beta range), which seem to be overexpressed in the sleep of insomniac patients, may reflect increased levels of consciousness during sleep, thus corresponding or even reflecting the increased ruminations patients with insomnia typically suffer from. As shown in Table 3(a), all four studies reviewed indicate the presence of sleep EEG spectral analysis findings denoting a considerable degree of hyperarousal during sleep; however, in three of them, the data reported were inadequate to establish statistical validity 删除19:<u>(Buysse et al. 2008; Hatch et al. 2007; Cervena et al. 2014)</u>, whereas the diagnostic grading of the remaining one 删除19:<u>(Spiegelhalder et al. 2012)</u> corresponds to low diagnostic accuracy. To the contrary, a study on CAP rate analysis showed high diagnostic accuracy 删除19:<u>(Chouvarda et al. 2012)</u>. In general, the evidence from studies applying more fine-grained neurophysiological methods, such as sleep EEG spectral analysis or CAP rate analysis, favours the hypothesis of an increased CNS hyperarousal in patients with insomnia in relation to good sleepers 删除19:<u>(Riemann et al. 删除13:<u>2010, 2015</u>; Morin et al. 2015; Zhao et al. 2021)</u>, which may be reduced after cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia 删除19:<u>(Cervena et al. 2004; Krystal and Edinger 2010, see Supplementary Table S2 for both)</u>.\n\n【2】Actigraphy seems to be a valuable method for the diagnosis of insomnia, with the studies reviewed herein showing high diagnostic accuracy 删除19:<u>(Natale et al. 删除13:<u>2009, 2014</u>)</u>, although the quantification of the resulting recordings and the establishment of relevant diagnostic cut-offs have not been achieved as yet. Actually, recent guidelines for the treatment of insomnia 删除19:<u>(Riemann et al. 2017)</u>, recommend actigraphy only in the case of clinical suspicion of irregular sleep-wake schedule or circadian rhythm disorders (strong recommendation), but to a much smaller extent for the quantitative assessment of sleep parameters (weak recommendation). On the other hand, the value of actigraphy is also supported by the fact that actigraphs are easy to use across many nights with almost no impact on patient’s activities and habits. Finally, with the existing pace of progress regarding personal electronic devices and wearables, we can look forward to new methods of collection and analysis of actigraphic data.\n\n【3】The studies presented in Table 3(c) show that an increase of heart rate before and after sleep onset can be considered as a psychophysiological biomarker for the diagnosis of insomnia. To the contrary, no diagnostic usefulness has been shown for heart rate variability (HRV), although alterations of HRV patterns have been reported, as an indication of autonomic hyperarousal and a sympathovagal disbalance in insomnia. Consequently, it has been suggested that more research needs to be conducted including further HRV measures, such as VLF, non-linear complexity indices, or qEEG-ECG coupling analyses 删除19:<u>(Jurysta et al. 2009; Yang et al. 2011; Mikoteit et al. 删除13:<u>2017, 2019</u>)</u>.\n\n【4】Regarding other psychophysiological measures, which have been studied in insomnia and are reviewed in this paper 删除9:<u>(Tables 3(d–f)</u>), an increased core body temperature in some studies suggests that the use of measuring core body temperature is obviously impractical for clinical purposes. Oxygen consumption rate has also shown to have some diagnostic ability, but not for insomniacs with only subjective complaint; the clinical application of this method, however, is also impractical. As far as skin conductance is concerned, it has not shown diagnostic accuracy. In spite of the lack of usefulness of the above methods for diagnostic purposes, converging evidence from many studies on different psychophysiological markers of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), support the hyperarousal model for insomnia 删除19:<u>(Riemann et al. 2010)</u>. However, there is a need for further research to clarify if indicators of hyperarousal are secondary to sleep disturbance and fragmentation caused by insomnia, or if hyperarousal is a primary background of insomnia itself.\n\n【5】Neuroimaging studies, especially those based on PET scan and fMRI, generally indicate that in insomnia there is a failure of arousal mechanisms to decline in activity from wake to sleep; besides, in certain studies, a lower recruitment of frontal areas during cognitive tasks has been observed. While these findings are in keeping with the understanding that insomnia is characterised by the persistence of hyperarousal, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions due to small", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 21, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/2023 WFSBP共识声明：诊断失眠的潜在生物标志物.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

The synergist inhibits certain metabolic enzymes within the mosquito that would otherwise provide a protective effect against the insecticide. Therefore, compared to a pyrethroid-only net, a pyrethroid-PBO net should have an increased killing effect on malaria vectors that express such resistance mechanisms.\n\n【6】The systematic review 删除11:<u>(45)</u> identified one cluster RCT in the United Republic of Tanzania with epidemiological data 删除11:<u>(46)</u>. The study indicated that a pyrethroid-PBO net product had additional public health value compared to a pyrethroid-only LLIN product in an area where the principal malaria vector(s) had confirmed pyrethroid resistance (results from CDC bottle bioassays indicated that >30% of mosquitoes were killed following exposure to pyrethroids). Resistance was conferred (at least in part) by monooxygenase-based resistance mechanisms, as determined by standard procedures. Mathematical modelling work, drawing on mosquito mortality data obtained from WHO test kit assays, CDC bottle bioassays and experimental hut trials, indicated that the added benefit of pyrethroid-PBO nets compared to pyrethroid-only LLINs is expected to be greatest where pyrethroid resistance is at \"intermediate levels\", which was defined as a range of 10% to 80% mosquito mortality after exposure to a pyrethroid insecticide in WHO test kits or CDC bottle bioassays 删除11:<u>(47)</u>.\n\n【7】Based on the above evidence, WHO concluded and recommended the following in 2017:\n- Based on the epidemiological findings and the need to deploy products that are effective against pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes, pyrethroid-PBO nets were given a conditional endorsement as a new WHO class of vector control products.\n- National malaria control programmes and their partners should consider the deployment of pyrethroid-PBO nets in areas where the principal malaria vector(s) have pyrethroid resistance that is: a) confirmed, b) of an intermediate level (as defined above by the mathematical modelling studies), and c) conferred (at least in part) by a monooxygenase-based resistance mechanism, as determined by standard procedures. Deployment of pyrethroid-PBO nets must only be considered in situations where coverage with effective vector control (primarily ITNs or IRS) will not be reduced. The primary goal must be to ensure continued access and use of ITNs at levels that ensure optimal coverage for all people at risk of malaria as part of an intervention package.\n- Pyrethroid-PBO nets should not be considered a tool that can alone effectively manage insecticide resistance in malaria vectors.

However, reports from larger prospective studies are warranted. In this regard, a phase 3 trial of dapagliflozin (DEAN study) based on histological endpoints is now ongoing 删除19:<u>(NCT03723252)</u>. In sum, meta-analyses of recent studies have not reached consensus and the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on liver fibrosis, especially beyond weight loss, remain to be confirmed.\n\n【1】Consensus statement 5.6: Treatment with pioglitazone is beneficial in MAFLD patients and may reduce CVD outcomes, but potential adverse effects (e.g. weight gain, edema and worsening of pre-existing congestive heart failure) should be kept in mind (Grade A).\n\n【2】Pioglitazone was proven to improve hepatic histology in steatohepatitis patients with and without T2DM and is recommended for patients with T2DM and biopsy-proven steatohepatitis. The benefits of pioglitazone on CVD outcomes in patients with and without T2DM are promising. The major limitation of pioglitazone in clinical practice as an off-label use for metabolic steatohepatitis is its adverse long-term effects, including moderate weight gain, risk of fracture, and fluid retention. The development of PXL065 (a novel pioglitazone stereoisomer) represents a unique opportunity to enhance the therapeutic benefits of pioglitazone while reducing or eliminating PPARγ-related side effects. Interestingly, PXL065 at a dose less than 22.5 mg/day for metabolic steatohepatitis is equal to or greater than 45-mg pioglitazone, but without any detrimental weight gain and oedema.\n\n【3】Consensus statement 5.7: Statins (if required for the treatment of dyslipidemia or CVD risk reduction) should be prescribed for patients with MAFLD even with modestly elevated serum liver enzyme levels (< 3 ULN) (Grade A).\n\n【4】All patients with MAFLD should be considered for statin treatment due to their increased CVD risk. Statins are the first-line to prevent CVD events in patients at risk for atherosclerotic CVD. Statin treatment in MAFLD patients with mild-to-moderate abnormal serum liver enzymes is safe and may improve liver enzyme levels and reduce CVD morbidity and mortality. Importantly, clinicians are commonly concerned about drug-induced liver injury, but statin use is not associated with abnormal serum liver enzyme levels in patients with steatohepatitis. Based on this, statins are thought to reduce the risk of CVD in MAFLD patients with dyslipidemia even without a beneficial effect on liver histology.\n\n【5】Consensus statement 5.8: Bariatric surgery (if required in severely obese patients with MAFLD) improves liver histology features and reduces CVD risk (Grade U).\n\n【6】Lifestyle interventions require long-term adherence, though sustained weight loss is difficult to achieve in patients with long-standing obesity. It has been reported that only 50% of patients can reach 7% weight loss following a 1-year lifestyle intervention. Bariatric surgery has been shown to achieve significant weight loss of 20% to 30% and improves liver histology including fibrosis. Bariatric surgery is also associated with significant reduction in CVD risk in individuals with morbid obesity and MAFLD with the risk of primary and secondary composite CVD outcomes reduced by 47% and 50%, respectively. Hence, bariatric surgery should remain a consideration for selected patients, particularly those without evidence of portal hypertension, with a body mass index (BMI) > 35 kg/m² (BMI > 30 kg/m² in Asian people) and MAFLD or metabolic steatohepatitis. For morbidly obese patients with MAFLD, especially those who have not responded to lifestyle intervention, bariatric surgery is arguably an attractive and appropriate treatment option that offers promising liver-related outcomes. However, there are not enough data to support the use of bariatric surgery in all patients with MAFLD. Rather it could be an option for those needing it for obesity reduction and MAFLD; early cirrhosis without significant portal hypertension should not be a contraindication for bariatric surgery.\n\n【7】### Strengths and Limitations\n\n【8】Although the Delphi method is a robust consensus-building approach to assess the levels of agreement on specific issues and for exploring whether a consensus can be reached, it has strengths and limitations. As an important strength, our Delphi survey demonstrated increased consistency in each subsequent round, allowing us to determine whether the feedback improved statements, increased the degree of consensus, and helped reach an agreement. In the two rounds of surveys, the experts’ ability to include detailed comments on each draft statement and the integration of feedback into the new statement resulted in a growing level of agreement on the consensus statements, from 92.8% in the R1 survey to 95.7% in the R2 survey. The consistently increasing (mean) levels of agreement with the consensus statements together with the high levels of participation [80.0% (52/65) in the R1 survey and 100% (52/52) in the R2 survey] strengthen our confidence in the observed results. Another important strength of the present study is that the resultant consensus statements have been endorsed by representative scientists from 31 countries from six continents globally (involving Hepatologists, Cardiologists, Endocrinologists, Diabetologists and other specialists with extensive research and clinical expertise). This international and multi-disciplinary approach further testifies to its global relevance.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 12, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/关于非酒精性脂肪肝病和心血管疾病风险的国际多学科共识声明.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

The best effect on hypoglycemia is observed for basal insulin analogues that combine longer action and low variability (glargine U100). There are no available trials comparing newer basal insulin analogue formulations with NPH insulin. However, comparisons between glargine U100 and the newer formulations of insulin (degludec and glargine U300) show similar, and for some endpoints, more favorable effects for these latter two insulin formulations. Therefore, the recommendation to use basal insulin analogues, instead of NPH insulin, can be extended also to degludec and glargine U300.\n\n【10】The quality of available evidence is generally low, particularly due to the open-label design of the majority of the included trials and to the presence of heterogeneity.\n\n【11】Pharmacoeconomic studies showed that direct costs of drugs is generally increased with newer formulations despite the cost-effectiveness ratio generally suggest good value for money because of the implication in terms of both QALY and the effects on the risk of events, weight gain etc.; the availability of biosimilars contains the cost of out-of-patent insulin analogues.\n\n【12】**Subgroup considerations:** No available evidence in patients aged over 75 years.\n\n【13】**Implementation:** Long-acting analogues are already the standard of care. The prescription of NPH insulin should be strongly discouraged, with specific educational program for non-specialists, recommending its substitution with long-acting analogues.\n\n【14】**Assessment and monitoring:** The monitoring of adherence to guidelines on insulin pharmacological treatment of type 2 diabetes remains limited. The recommendation derived from the majority of RCT, a modest positive effect on HbA1c and FPG.\n\n【15】#### Assessment\n\n【16】**Problem**\n\n| Problem          | Is the problem a priority?         |\n|------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Yes              | Hypoglycemia has a major impact on quality of life of insulin-treated patients 删除12:<u>[53–55]</u>, and it represents a major obstacle for attaining desired glycemic goals.

As a result, it is promising that nations in the AP area are presently actively formulating the fracture prevention intervention guideline. Furthermore, the AP specialists agreed that enhancing osteoporosis screening and treatment was generally necessary for the AP region, but those specific modifications were required to improve their fitness for the area. The following recommendations were made.\n\n【2】#### Statement 1. Postmenopausal women without a history of fragility fractures who are at high risk should be offered to use pharmacological therapy for the prevention of fractures.\n\n【3】- The experts recommended the use of pharmaceutical regimens for the prevention of osteoporotic fracture in postmenopausal women with an increased risk of fracture, low bone mass, or osteoporosis, but no history of fragility fracture.\n- The majority of patients presenting with fractures have a history of previous fractures, hence this history is an important prognostic factor. Although all osteoporotic patients do not necessarily indicate the need for treatment, a high risk for future fractures as determined by risk calculators (e.g. FRAX) may indicate the necessity for osteoporosis treatment.\n\n【4】#### Statement 2. For the prevention of fragility fractures in postmenopausal women, raloxifene, alendronate, and risedronate are well-recognized options.\n\n【5】- The experts agreed that raloxifene, alendronate, and risedronate will prevent osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women with low bone mass or osteoporosis.\n\n【6】#### Statement 3.

In patients for whom chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dacarbazine (CVD) is not tolerated, not wished for by the patient, or if there are contraindications to CVD, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (eg, sunitinib) or temozolomide can be used as alternative agents while carefully evaluating their adverse effects.\n\n【8】**Recommendation 34**  \nWe recommend either tyrosine kinase inhibitors (eg, sunitinib; grade strength=1; quality of evidence rating=3) or temozolomide (grade strength=1; quality of evidence rating=2) in patients with progressing tumours who are not eligible for peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) or ¹³¹I-MIBG or following progression to radionuclide therapy or CVD.\n\n【9】#### Evidence for recommendations 28–34\n\n【10】Assessment of disease progression mainly relies on anatomical and functional imaging in selected patients (preferably PET–CT with somatostatin analogues). The Consensus on Molecular Imaging and Theranostics in Neuroendocrine Tumours has proposed that the detection of new lesions, the exclusion of pitfalls, by functional imaging with the same tracer can be considered sufficient to define progression. However, data are too scarce to provide any recommendation in the setting of patients with metastatic SDHx PPGLs.\nIn a study that included therapy-naive patients with metastatic PPGLs, 87% of patients who experienced progressive disease at one year had progressive disease at baseline. Therefore, an imaging assessment 3 months after the diagnosis of metastatic disease might be recommended. As SDHD PPGL metastases are often associated with slow progression, active surveillance might be reasonable for patients with low tumour burden.\nSurgery for the primary tumour 删除9:<u>(see recommendation 14)</u> and locoregional treatments should be considered on an individual basis in an interdisciplinary tumour", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 12, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/2023 临床共识指南：携带种系SDHD致病变异患者的嗜铬细胞瘤和副神经节瘤的管理.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

G27 guidance 删除11:<u>删除19:<u>(2005)</u></u>, later replaced by NG12, recommended urgent referral for patients with symptoms persistent for 6 weeks. Underpinning evidence to inform the timing of any safety netting action is lacking including: what might be considered the ‘normal’ duration of a benign symptom, the time taken for progression of high-risk adenomas to cancer, or the interval of stage progression.\n\n【4】Many cohort studies have documented the clinical presentation of patients later diagnosed with FIT negative CRC, suggesting that these characteristics could be usefully referred or included in the communication of safety netting advice to patients. However, there is marked variation in the characteristics of FIT negative cancers between these studies so relying on these characteristics to inform a safety netting strategy could be falsely reassuring.\n\n【5】### Modelling Studies\n\n【6】Modelling studies to date have not demonstrated the benefit of combining FIT with other clinical features and blood test results to enhance sensitivity for diagnosing false negative FITs. A comparative analysis of strategies by combining FIT with the FAST score model showed no improvement in sensitivity. Both the FAST and FIT-PLUS models indicate a different 18% of CRC, respectively, and FAST score missed 27.3%. Combining simple blood tests with FIT at best matches the sensitivity of FIT alone in patients tested in primary care, whether as pairs of results or within a multivariable model.\n\n【7】### IS A REPEAT/SECOND FIT USEFUL AND DOES IT ENHANCE DIAGNOSTIC ACCURACY?\n\n【8】Studies suggest repeat FIT testing may enhance sensitivity, but very specific, and this depends on whether the second test is used to identify people to be investigated/referred after the first test is negative (increase sensitivity and decreased specificity) or to identify people who may need referral based on both tests are positive (decrease sensitivity and increased specificity). Studies have examined cohorts identified for investigation (or already investigated/diagnosed) rather than prospectively using FIT to guide referral in ‘real world’ situations. Although the populations under study have varied considerably (symptomatic vs screening; high vs low risk), the findings of sensitivity and specificity have been relatively consistent. No studies were found that examined the optimal period for undertaking a repeat/second FIT. Where it was clear in the methods, most studies instructed repeat FITs to be sampled from consecutive stools.\n\n【9】In conclusion, although there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend use of repeat/second FIT to guide referrals in routine practice, further data are required to clarify the role of this approach (online supplementary file 2).\n\n【10】There have been no randomised controlled trials or systematic reviews comparing diagnostic yield, time to diagnosis, stage at diagnosis or longer-term CRC outcomes between patients who have one and those having repeat/second FIT tests. Moss et al. conducted an RCT of 3121 participants comparing uptake of a two sample regimen 删除11:<u>删除19:<u>(1562)</u></u> with one sample FIT 删除11:<u>删除19:<u>(1559)</u></u>. Participants were given the same instructions with the 2-FIT group required to do the test twice. The FIT was requested in the context of bowel cancer screening. No significant difference in the baseline characteristics of each group. The FIT kits were posted to the participants and returned by mail. A total of 43.3% of the 1-FIT group were compared with 39.6%  of the 2-FIT group. In a large systematic review summarising the diagnostic performance of FITs for CRC including 69 536 symptomatic adults from primary care including 23 cohort studies, where studies included findings from patients tested more than once, only the first FIT result was analysed. Therefore the predominant evidence source is observational.\n\n【11】Turvill et al. undertook a prospective, blinded observational study of associations between FIT results from two samples in all patients referred to York Hospital with suspected CRC within the urgent (2WW) pathway from February 2016 to March 2017. The FIT samples were provided by the patients before the hospital clinical appointments and investigations in secondary care. For patients with a single positive FIT, a threshold of ≥10 μg/g, was associated with sensitivity of 84.6% and specificity of 88.7%. For patients with two positive FIT tests, sensitivity was 91.7% and specificity of 85.1%. The paper did not examine and compare sensitivity and specificity in patients who were only offered one FIT test. Nor did it report on the negative predictive value (NPV) of a second FIT <10μg/g.\n\n【12】Hunt et al. examined the association between CRC diagnosis and FIT results in patients who had FIT following a referral in the 2WW pathway. The samples were received from 3897 patients. The patients were asked to return two FIT kits from different stools before the hospital assessment and cancer care. They found that if patients had been referred based on FIT result, sensitivity for CRC would have been 97.8% and 91.5%, specificity 66.2% and 81.6% and PPV 3.1% and 2.5% with one or two FIT positive test results ( >10 μg/g), respectively. Two tests were returned by 96.1% of the study population indicating that this is representative of the study population. Those studied were initially those referred with low-risk symptoms and later those with high-risk symptoms. Missed CRC detection with two FIT <10 μg/g found in 7/73 (9.6%). All other patients with missed cancers had anaemia and one had an obstructing tumour.\n\n【13】This study provides evidence that a requirement to test positive (FIT >10 μg/g) twice rather than once before the decision to refer, or to investigate post-referral, may reduce the numbers of people referred or investigated, respectively, though at the cost of missing a proportion of CRC cases. The experience may not directly test real-world practice where however those with one or even two negative tests may still be referred and/or investigated if they remain clinical concerns.\n\n【14】Maaten et al. studied 289 patients who underwent colonoscopy who had been entered into either a one-sample or two-sample FIT protocol. It is not clear from the description if patients selected were from a symptomatic FIT screening population. Among them 127 had one-sample FIT; the reasons for positive/negative rates were not reported but colonoscopy outcome findings were reported in 99 cases and 117 people received the 2-sample FIT and of these 94 (80.3%) patients had FIT below the threshold, 13 (11.1%) had both FIT positive and 10 (8.6%) had one FIT positive (≥10 μg/g). For the one-sample FIT group, positive FIT had a sensitivity and specificity of 83.3% and 86.9%, respectively.

This finding has important clinical implications for the clinical application of unwarranted clinical interventions. Further, the finding of clonal hematopoiesis itself may portend adverse clinical outcomes, such as the development of hematologic neoplasia and increased non-hematologic mortality.\n  - Blood and/or saliva is an unsuitable source of DNA for germline testing for cases with a history of hematologic abnormalities with a hematologic malignancy with current blood involvement or a prior allogeneic stem cell transplant.

In either case, palliative/best supportive care remains an option.\n\n【2】High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue may also be considered as treatment for relapsed/refractory disease in patients who did not previously receive this treatment (ie, patients who were treated with high-dose methotrexate-based therapy or with WBRT) (category 2B). Regardless of primary treatment received, stem cell rescue should only be used for relapsed/refractory disease if there is a complete or partial response to re-induction high-dose chemotherapy.\n\n【3】For patients previously treated with high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue, retreatment may be considered if there was a previous disease response and if time to relapse was at least one year. For patients who did not have a response to high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue, and the time to relapse was less than one year, treatment options include RT to the whole brain or to the involved field.

Extradural tumors are primarily due to metastatic disease and are discussed in the section *Metastatic Spinal Tumors*. This section focuses on intradural primary spinal tumors.\n\n【7】Primary spinal cord tumors are a histologically diverse set of diseases that represent 2% to 4% of all primary CNS tumors. The overall incidence is 0.74 per 100,000 person-years with a 10-year survival rate of 64%. Extradurally lesions, most commonly benign meningiomas, account for 70% to 80% of spinal cord tumors. Astrocytomas (more prevalent in children) and ependymomas (more prevalent in adults) are the most common intramedullary tumors. Clinicians are advised to refer to the corresponding sections in these guidelines for further details regarding these subtypes, as intracranial and spinal lesions are biologically similar.\n\n【8】Individuals with type I neurofibromatosis, type II neurofibromatosis, and von Hippel–Lindau (VHL) syndrome are predisposed to form, respectively, spinal astrocytomas, spinal peripheral nerve sheath tumors, spinal ependymomas, and intramedullary hemangioblastomas.\n\n【9】Since 70% of primary spinal cord tumors are low-grade and slow-growing, it is common for patients to suffer from pain for months to years before diagnosis. Pain that worsens at night is a classic symptom for intramedullary lesions. Progressive motor weakness occurs in half of the patients, and patients may experience sensory loss with late autonomic dysfunction (incontinence).\n\n【10】### Treatment Overview\n\n【11】#### Observation\nMany asymptomatic primary tumors of the spinal cord, especially grade 1 meningiomas and peripheral nerve sheath tumors, follow an indolent course and can be followed by observation without immediate intervention.\n\n【12】#### Surgery\nSurgery is the preferred primary treatment when the tumor is symptomatic and amenable to surgical resection.

Mechanical dyssynchrony in patients who are considered suitable for CRT is most often delayed LV activation of the posterolateral wall. This region is therefore targeted during implantation for LV lead position. There is substantial individual variation in the latest activated region as well as in the presence and location of scar that could influence the effect of CRT. Three randomized studies reported that an LV lead placement approach targeting the latest activated region free from scar using preprocedural radial strain imaging by echocardiography resulted in a significant improvement in clinical outcome after CRT. However, these results were not consistent for all imaging modalities.\n\n【1】4. The clinical effect of CRT varies considerably between patients. Many patients encounter significant improvements after CRT, but there remains a substantial group of patients that has little or no effect from this therapy. Since LV dyssynchrony was considered to be the substrate amenable to CRT, many echocardiographic measurements of LV dyssynchrony have been prospectively evaluated. These observational, mostly single-center, studies had promising results, as they showed that the presence of LV dyssynchrony was associated with reverse remodeling or improved clinical response after CRT. These results, however, were not confirmed in larger multicenter prospective trials. In these studies, echocardiographic measurements of ventricular dyssynchrony showed only a modest accuracy to predict response to CRT, suggesting that the echocardiographic parameters of LV dyssynchrony have not been accurate enough for clinical decision-making in CRT. Since then, many other cardiac imaging techniques have been studied in observational studies, generating various new parameters of dyssynchrony that were associated with CRT response. These parameters need to be prospectively confirmed. Therefore, at this time there is still no measure of LV mechanical dyssynchrony with enough predictive power that can be recommended to improve patient selection for CRT beyond current guidelines, and the ECG remains the standard for patient selection in CRT.\n\n【2】### 4.2. Assessment for other predictive factors associated with CPP response\n\n【3】Although several risk factors may identify patients at an increased risk of PICM, many patients tolerate high-burden RVP without adverse outcomes. The ability to identify those at highest risk remains challenging. Current HBP and LBBAP studies, while demonstrating feasibility and safety, do not contribute greatly to determining patient selection. Most studies contain small numbers of patients, the patient population appears younger than those seen clinically, and data are generally lacking on race, sex, and comorbidities. The studied populations include patients with different clinical profiles (such as pacing indications and risk factors), but most lack a control group.\n\n【4】Factors associated with reverse remodeling following CRT are female sex, nonischemic etiology, and LBBB. In the case of HBP and LBBAP, the studies are largely limited to retrospective, observational, single-center or multicenter studies with inherent limitations, such as potential bias in patient selection and patient treatment. Clinical benefits and risks have not been systematically examined. Specific reporting of clinical outcomes also varies, making clear recommendations challenging. Information regarding patients where HBP or LBBAP was not successful is generally also not available. Many groups are underrepresented. For example, women tend to be underrepresented and data on race are often not provided.\n\n【5】### 4.3.

One example of clinical utility is to determine how the availability of NIPS impacts the uptake of diagnostic testing.\n\n【1】Historically, advanced maternal age was the single largest indication for diagnostic testing. Several reports have documented that after the introduction of NIPS, there was a substantial decline in the number of diagnostic procedures.\n\n【2】The SER identified several studies including patients with mixed indications that uniformly demonstrated reductions in diagnostic testing both when NIPS was used as a primary screen or as a secondary screen (following abnormal traditional screening). Overall, reports included in the SER demonstrated a 31% to 79% reduction in diagnostic procedures depending on the population and indications.\n\n【3】The impact of NIPS on diagnostic testing rates in a historically low-risk population is not likely to be as dramatic given fewer of these individuals would seek out primary diagnostic testing. The primary indications for diagnostic testing in this cohort have most often been abnormal traditional screening and/or detection of “soft markers” at the time of midtrimester anatomical survey. Many professional societies state that diagnostic testing is the preferred method of evaluation after positive traditional screening, but they also state that NIPS is an acceptable alternative with appropriate counseling about limitations. Many patients use NIPS as a secondary screen (instead of diagnostic testing) if traditional screening has returned positive results.\n\n【4】Prenatal sonography performed in the midtrimester has historically been used to adjust risk for fetal T21 or T18 by assessing for the presence of “soft markers.” Patients with the presence of a soft marker on fetal ultrasound who would have routinely been offered amniocentesis now may be offered NIPS in the absence of previous screening. If NIPS indicates reduced risk, further testing is usually not recommended. This is because the presence of a soft marker is not associated with an absolute risk but rather a likelihood ratio, none of which are large enough to negate the degree of risk reduction associated with negative NIPS results.\n\n【5】Another possible measure of utility is the reduction in the number of diagnostic procedures required to establish a diagnosis in cases of abnormal screening. The number of diagnostic tests needed to confirm a suspected trisomy is 1 per PPV. Therefore, applying the reported PPVs 删除9:<u>(Table 3)</u> for the 2 screening modalities for fetal T21 yields the following:\n\n【6】1. The PPV for NIPS for T21 is 50% to 95%, which means 1.1 to 2 amniocentesis procedures to confirm trisomy in an affected pregnancy. Traditional screening PPV for T21 is about 2.2% to 3.6%, which translates as needing to perform between 28 to 45 diagnostic procedures to confirm a single case, depending on the specific traditional screening algorithm.\n\n【7】删除图片描述:<u>![/mnt/data/file-ekNFf7KMJmCdi07zanDWiR9F_6_0.png]</u>\n\n【8】删除图片描述:<u>![/mnt/data/file-ekNFf7KMJmCdi07zanDWiR9F_6_1.png]</u>\n\n【9】删除图片描述:<u>![/mnt/data/file-ekNFf7KMJmCdi07zanDWiR9F_6_2.png]</u>\n\n【10】“No-Call” Results\n\n【11】The SER found that approximately 1% of initial patient samples submitted for NIPS are not provided a result and are termed “no-call”. Optimal management of such pregnancies remains unclear and depends to some degree on the potential reason for the no-call result. The most frequent explanation for no-call results is insufficient fetal fraction, i.e., the proportion of circulating DNA that is from the placenta and, not maternal. Repeat testing (which inherently is at a later gestational age) provides a result approximately 75% to 80% of the time.\n\n【12】Some studies have demonstrated a higher than expected rate of fetal chromosome disorders in pregnancies that have no-call results. Others have not confirmed that association. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommend offering diagnostic testing to individuals with a no-call result. There are a number of maternal conditions that have been associated with higher no-call rates. These include the use of certain anticoagulants, autoimmune disorders, and obesity. There are some technological interventions that may mitigate the impact of low fetal fraction.

Disease severity is associated with the time of symptom onset, and earlier onset is associated with more severe disease. The SMN2 gene also produces SMN protein, and the presence of SMN2 genes can compensate for the SMN1 deletion to some degree. The number of SMN2 gene copies is inversely related to the severity of SMA and can be used to predict the course of the disease. SMA can be diagnosed before there are symptoms (that is, presymptomatically), if newborn screening is done. There is currently no routine newborn screening programme for SMA in England, but genetic testing is offered when a sibling has been diagnosed with SMA. A very small number of people are diagnosed with presymptomatic SMA in England each year. It is not possible to determine the type of SMA that will develop in a baby with presymptomatic SMA, but age at diagnosis and the number of SMN2 gene copies can influence the severity of SMA that will develop.\n\n【1】## Clinical effectiveness\n\n【2】### Comparators\n\n【3】3.2 The company considered that best supportive care was the most appropriate comparator. The EAG thought that onasemnogene abeparvovec should also be considered in part of the comparator arm when presymptomatic SMA develops into type 1 SMA. This is because onasemnogene abeparvovec is recommended as an option in NICE's highly specialised technologies guidance on onasemnogene abeparvovec for treating SMA (from now, HST15). The committee was also aware that, although NICE has recommended nusinersen and risdiplam as part of managed access agreements for presymptomatic SMA and other SMA types, they are not routinely available. So, they could not be considered as routine care nor as relevant comparators for this evaluation. The committee concluded that the most relevant comparators were onasemnogene abeparvovec for type 1 SMA and best supportive care for type 2 SMA and type 3 SMA.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 8, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/2023 NICE 高度专业化的技术指南：用于治疗症状前脊髓性肌萎缩症的 Onasemnogene abeparvovec【HST24】.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Consensus panel expertise, 92% agreement (n = 24), median 9, IQR 8–9.\n\n【1】Methods have been developed to decrease the risk of pathogen transmission in pooled plasma products. Observational data suggest that pathogen-reduced plasma may be independently associated with lower risk of mortality 删除11:<u>(23)</u>, but the hemostatic effects of pathogen reduction on plasma have not been studied in children. The method used for pathogen reduction may be based on local availability.\n\n【2】### 10.4. When considering pathogen reduction and selecting products for platelet transfusion, products may be selected that balance risk of transfusion-transmitted infection, hemostatic effects, and clinical outcomes, as well as feasibility. Consensus panel expertise, 87% agreement (n = 23), median 9, IQR 8–9.\n\n【3】Similar methods have been developed to decrease the risk of pathogen transmission related to room temperature storage of platelets. However, the hemostatic efficacy is unclear.\n\n【4】### 10.5. When a critically ill pediatric patient has persistently poor platelet count increments following platelet transfusion, a clinical and laboratory assessment for platelet refractoriness is suggested to elucidate the cause. Consensus panel expertise, 96% agreement (n = 23), median 9, IQR 8–9.\n\n【5】Platelet transfusion refractoriness (PTR) is generally defined as persistently insufficient posttransfusion platelet count increments following platelet transfusion from random donors. PTR can be due to either immune or nonimmune causes, with nonimmune causes common. Human leukocyte antigen-matching of platelet transfusions can be done if immune causes are identified.\n\n【6】## DISCUSSION\n\n【7】The TAXI-CAB program, the second phase following the TAXI RBC transfusion guidelines, has been able to determine by systematic assessment of the literature that, in regard to platelet or plasma transfusion, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of a specific laboratory test as a threshold or as a target for prophylactic or therapeutic transfusion. Furthermore, in none of the eight clinical settings that were reviewed (i.e., 1 severe trauma, ICM, or TBI; 2, CPB surgery; 3, ECMO; 4, oncologic diagnosis or HSCT; 5, acute liver failure or liver transplantation; 6, noncardiac surgery; 7, invasive procedures outside the operating room; 8, sepsis and/or DIC) could we find sufficient evidence to support specific indications for transfusion strategies to direct use of plasma or platelet transfusion. However, we were able to make four evidence-based recommendations: two of these with strong recommendations albeit based on low-quality pediatric evidence for laboratory processing/selection practice and two with weak recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence for post-CPB surgery care. The panel of 29 experts was also able to use the systematic literature to develop and agree on five good practice statements and 44 expert consensus statements. In contrast to TAXI, our extensive systematic review identified very few studies of high quality related to plasma and/or platelet transfusion strategies in our population of interest. Therefore, a supplement in Pediatric Critical Care Medicine also includes work on research priorities for plasma and platelet transfusion strategies in critically ill children 删除11:<u>(28)</u>.\n\n【8】Similar to TAXI, which concluded that hemoglobin level alone should not drive the decision to transfuse RBCs 删除11:<u>(35)</u>, our search demonstrated that the commonly used coagulation parameters, INR, aPTT, and platelet count, are not sufficient, either alone or in combination, to guide the prescription of plasma and platelet transfusions in critically ill children. Our experts agree that more emphasis should be given to the overall clinical hemostatic status of the patient, such as bleeding signs and physiologic markers, alongside other laboratory results such as fibrinogen, a key factor determining overall hemostatic competence. Although not routinely available nor standardized in the pediatric setting, VET and measures of platelet function may also aid the clinician in identifying those situations where a transfusion of platelets and/or plasma may be more likely to be beneficial or can be safely withheld.\n\n【9】Whereas total platelet count, INR, and/or aPTT are often incorporated into the clinical decision trees as support to withhold transfusion and use restrictive transfusion practices, one must use caution not to interpret them inversely (i.e., transfuse below these thresholds). The listed values were, for the most part, not determined by rigorous testing 删除11:<u>(36)</u>. Clinicians must also consider that in many circumstances, transfusion of plasma and/or platelets may cause harm without benefit when administered above the stated values.

Patients with stable asymptomatic brain metastases were sometimes allowed, but for many of these studies this subpopulation was small. Several prospective non-comparative trials have tested single-agent dabrafenib, single-agent vemurafenib, and dabrafenib/trametinib combination in patients with brain metastases 删除9:<u>(Table 20)</u>. Some of these studies included patients with symptomatic brain metastases, and some included patients whose intracranial disease had progressed after local therapy. All of the studies shown in Table 20 included patients who had prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease, but most excluded patients with prior BRAF inhibitor therapy. Results from these trials show that melanoma brain metastases can respond to BRAF inhibitor monotherapy or BRAF/MEK inhibitor combination therapy, albeit with lower response rates than for extracranial disease. It is notable that intracranial responses were seen even among patients with prior systemic therapy for metastatic disease, symptomatic brain metastases, and intracranial progression after local therapy, as these populations tend to be difficult to treat. One of the studies in patients with symptomatic brain metastases also reported symptomatic improvement based on reduction in use of corticosteroids and increase in performance score. Results from COMBI-MB suggest that among patients with brain metastases, dabrafenib/trametinib combination therapy may provide higher rates of response than single-agent BRAF inhibitor therapy. However, cross-trial comparisons in studies of patients with brain metastases are particularly difficult because there are a number of factors that may profoundly impact measured outcomes—including extent and location of intracranial disease, severity of symptoms, and number and type of prior systemic and local intracranial therapies. Prospective randomized trials are needed to determine which BRAF-directed therapy options provide the best results in patients with brain metastases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 174, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/（2024.V1）NCCN临床实践指南：皮肤黑色素瘤.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Childhood movement disorders encompass heterogeneous conditions with various comorbidities implying distinct needs of the youth and her/his family, for example motor, emotional and social well-being. These needs should be addressed in a holistic manner and some important issues are often not addressed during the transition process, such as addiction problems, driving, sexuality or pregnancy/reproductive issues. A checklist of key issues to be potentially addressed depending on each youth situation would thus help the transition teams.\n\n【4】### Recommendation 3.3\n\n【5】Special attention should be paid to guide the transitioning patient towards more autonomy (where possible) for health-related issues, including self-management training which takes into account the intellectual and behavioral functioning of each patient.\n\n【6】### Rationale for Recommendation 3.3\n\n【7】Youth with chronic neurological disorders tend to not have the level of independence and knowledge about their disease that is expected in adult settings, as clearly identified in patients with epilepsy. In addition, cognitive deficits and behavioral disturbances represent major brakes on the development of transition readiness. Autonomy is considered as a major ethical principle in adult health care and can influence the care trajectory. With moving towards adulthood, the focus of the health care environment should thus gradually move from a family-based approach towards more autonomy in adult health care system. It is mandatory to ensure continuity of care and adequate continuation of drugs. It is therefore crucial to guide youth towards more autonomy for health-related issues taking into account the individual intellectual and behavioral abilities.\n\n【8】### Recommendation 3.4\n\n【9】Emotional support should be provided to the patient and their family during the transition process by the transitional care team, including preparing and accompanying patients to their first visit in the adult setting.\n\n【10】### Rationale for Recommendation 3.4\n\n【11】Transition of care is a time of uncertainty associated with a heightened emotional response, whereas emotional needs are often neglected during the transition process. A significant proportion of patients with ADHD and their parents reported a need to have someone to speak with regarding their emotional needs during the process of transition. Transition-related factors that could influence the emotional well-being of patients with neurological disorders during this period can comprise difficulties with the practical aspects of transition, a sense of abandonment, the combination of sadness at leaving a system with familiar health professionals and trusted relationships and fear of the unknown. Special attention should thus be paid to the emotional support of the youth and parents during the transition process.\n\n【12】### Recommendation 3.5\n\n【13】Both the pediatric and adult care providers should use the transition process as an opportunity to reappraise the diagnosis and treatment of the patient.\n\n【14】### Rationale for Recommendation 3.5\n\n【15】For many patients presenting in early childhood, the diagnostic odyssey may have occurred several years prior to transition, and thus re-appraising the diagnosis based on interim scientific advances is important to ensure diagnostic accuracy. A study focused on patients with a childhood-onset movement disorder demonstrated that a multidisciplinary approach involving a team with a pediatrician, a movement disorders specialist, a metabolic disorder expert and a geneticist can promote a high diagnostic yield (34%) in formerly undiagnosed patients and also result in treatment adjustment with positive consequences in more than 40% of patients. In a study about a transitional care clinic in patients with childhood-onset epilepsy, diagnosis was revised in 12% of patients and 55% received adjustment of the antiepileptic medication. The core medical component of transition process includes a review of history, examination findings along with investigations and discussion in a multidisciplinary manner. Therefore, it offers a unique opportunity to reappraise the diagnosis and treatment of the youth with childhood-onset movement disorders.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 5, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/MDS儿科特别工作组基于共识的建议：对患有运动障碍的年轻人的过渡性护理.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

After a median follow-up of 53 months, no differences were detected in EFS (P = .95) or OS (P = .78) between GDP and DHAP.\n\n【3】Second-line combination chemotherapy is recommended for patients with an intention to proceed to transplant. Rituximab should be included if there is disease relapse after a reasonable remission period (>6 months) and biopsy demonstrates continued CD20 expression; however, rituximab can be omitted in patients with primary refractory disease. Consolidation therapy with HDT/ASCR (category 1 for patients with CR) with or without RT is recommended for patients with CR or PR to second-line therapy, if they are candidates for transplant. ISRT before HDT/ASCR has been shown to result in good local disease control and improved outcome. Additional RT can be given to limited sites with prior positive disease before or after HDT/ASCR.\n\n【4】CAR T-cell therapy (axicabtagene ciloleucel or tisagenlecleucel or lisocabtagene maraleucel) is recommended for patients without a CR following second-line therapy.\n\n【5】Allogeneic HCT should be considered in selected patients with mobilization failures and persistent bone marrow involvement or lack of adequate response to second-line therapy, though patients should be in CR or near CR at the time of transplant.\n\n【6】## Second-Line Therapy: No Intention to Proceed to Transplant\n\n【7】Optimal management for patients who are not candidates for transplant are not established and therefore, clinical trial is preferred for these patients.\n\n【8】Lisocabtagene maraleucel is an option for patients who are not eligible for transplant but are eligible for CAR T-cell therapy. Polatuzumab vedotin + BR and tafasitamab + lenalidomide are included as options for second-line therapy for patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL in patients who are not candidates for transplant or CAR T-cell therapy. Bendamustine should be avoided in patients potentially eligible for CAR T-cell therapy prior to collection.\n\n【9】Gemcitabine-based regimens with or without rituximab, lenalidomide (with or without rituximab), and ibrutinib (particularly for patients with non-GCB DLBCL) are appropriate treatment options for patients who are not eligible for transplant or CAR T-cell therapy. Brentuximab vedotin can be considered as an option for patients with CD30-positive DLBCL.\n\n【10】Patients who are not candidates for transplant with PR to second-line therapy or those with progressive or refractory disease to second-line therapy (regardless of transplant eligibility) or those with disease relapse following HDT/ASCR or allogeneic HCT should be managed with third-line systemic therapy, palliative ISRT, or best supportive care. Repeat biopsy should be strongly considered prior to additional therapy for patients achieving PET-positive PR to second-line therapy because PET positivity may represent post-treatment inflammation.

Subsequent trials aimed at determining which platinum-based combinations are the most effective and safe.\n\n【2】### Selecting a Platinum Agent\n\n【3】Multiple randomized trials compared carboplatin versus cisplatin, either alone or in combination with other agents (examples in Table 5 and 6). All of these trials showed equivalent efficacy, but differences in toxicity profiles and QOL. Cisplatin was associated with higher rates of neurotoxicity, GI toxicities (eg, nausea, emesis), renal toxicity, metabolic toxicities, anemia, and alopecia, while carboplatin was associated with higher rates of thrombocytopenia and granulocytopenia. The AGO-OVAR-3 study found that QOL was significantly better with carboplatin/paclitaxel versus cisplatin/paclitaxel, both in global QOL metrics and on various subscales. Several randomized studies tested alternating carboplatin and cisplatin every other course, but found that efficacy was similar and toxicity somewhat worse than using carboplatin for every course. Based on results from all these studies carboplatin is the recommended platinum agent for postoperative IV chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers.\n\n【4】### Selecting a Non-Platinum Agent (for Use in Combination with a Platinum Agent)\n\n【5】Many different chemotherapy agents have been tested in combination with platinum agents as options for IV chemotherapy in newly diagnosed ovarian cancer. Large randomized trials have compared various platinum-based doublet, triplet, and quadruplet combinations with cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel, docetaxel, topotecan, doxorubicin, epirubicin, gemcitabine, topotecan, and melphalan. Trials that compared platinum-based doublets with cyclophosphamide versus paclitaxel showed that paclitaxel was associated with significantly better response rate, PFS and OS. Thus, paclitaxel is preferred over cyclophosphamide for platinum-based combination therapy in the first-line setting. Based on results from randomized trials showing improved safety and QOL with carboplatin/paclitaxel versus cisplatin/paclitaxel 删除9:<u>(Table 5)</u>, carboplatin/paclitaxel became the “standard” combination therapy option for postoperative first-line IV chemotherapy in patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

No significant differences in non-relapse mortality after MRD allogeneic HSCT with or without PTCy were reported in the EBMT matched retrospective study or MRD-specific subgroup analyses of retrospective cohorts. Despite significant relapse rates (41% vs 21%; p=0·039) that were estimated in the PTCy group of the matched EBMT retrospective study, improved GVHD-free and relapse-free survival was associated with PTCy use in the CTN 1703 ($36% vs 35%; p=0·001) trial, and in two large retrospective studies. On the basis of these data, PTCy was considered a potential option for preventing GVHD instead of immunosuppression without ATG for recipients of allogeneic HSCT from MRDs.\n\n【1】We were unable to find direct evidence comparing PTCy versus ATG prophylaxis in MRD allogeneic HSCT since most of the reported populations included both MRDs and MUDs. The retrieved studies included a network meta-analysis, a randomised trial (31 of 80 recipients of MUD allogeneic HSCT), and retrospective studies enrolling mostly recipients of MUD allogeneic HSCT. No significant difference in non-relapse mortality of PTCy-treated patients versus ATG was reported by these studies. No significant difference in the occurrence of cGVHD was documented by the randomised trial or by the EBMT retrospective study. However, a favourable odds ratio in the PTCy group was shown by the network meta-analysis and a significant decline of grade 2–4 aGVHD (hazard ratio [HR] 0·41; p=0·035) and moderate to severe cGVHD (HR 0·15; p<0·001), and a significant improvement of GVHD-free and relapse-free survival (50·2% vs 21·8% at 2 years; HR 0·42; p=0·001) were reported for PTCy by multivariate analysis in a retrospective study selectively enrolling patients older than 50 years. The panel considered the indirect evidence (mainly based on data from MUD transplants) not sufficiently reliable to support practice-changing recommendations and therefore suggested that for recipients of allogeneic HSCT from MRDs, PTCy should not be generally preferred to ATG for preventing GVHD. Based on these data, we consider PTCy a potential option for preventing GVHD over immunosuppression without ATG for recipients of allogeneic HSCT from MRDs. This treatment option might be specifically applicable in settings where rATG is not available. However, we support our previous recommendations to use rATG as GVHD prophylaxis in patients undergoing MRD allogeneic HSCT. The recommendations are based on high evidence by publications demonstrating reduced GVHD rates in MRD allogeneic HSCT.\n\n【2】We then wanted to assess if we could recommend PTCy instead of no PTCy or ATG in allogeneic HSCT recipients from MUDs to prevent GVHD and reduce non-relapse mortality. Several studies, including four randomised controlled trials, compared PTCy prophylaxis with no PTCy (without ATG) in MUD allogeneic HSCT. The incidence of both severe aGVHD and severe cGVHD was significantly reduced in both the CTN 1703 and HOVON-96 randomised trials: the HR of multivariate analysis from the HOVON-96 trial was 0·48 (95% CI 0·29–0·82) for aGVHD and 0·36 (0·21–0·64) for cGVHD. No significant differences in non-relapse mortality after MUD allogeneic HSCT with or without PTCy were reported, but both the randomised trials showed significantly improved GVHD-free and relapse-free survival associated with PTCy use with an HR of 0·50 (95% CI 0·34–0·74) in the HOVON-96 trial and 0·64 (95% CI 0·49–0·84) in the CTN 1703 trial. Of note, the HOVON-96 trial has several caveats: it was initially designed as a two-group study comparing two different durations of immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and cyclosporine A, and PTCy was only introduced as a third group after study initiation. The primary endpoint was non-severe GVHD at day 180 (defined as aGVHD grade 1,aGVHD grade 2 without gut involvement, or cGVHD not requiring systemic treatment [not NIH consensus criteria]). Furthermore, many centres use sirolimus in addition to cyclosporine A and MMF after non-myeloablative MUD allogeneic HSCT, whereas the control group of the HOVON-96 trial used cyclosporine A and MMF without sirolimus. Nevertheless, the panel considered that the body of evidence sufficient to recommend that PTCy should be preferred to GVHD prophylaxis without ATG in recipients of allogeneic HSCT from MUDs.\n\n【3】The body of evidence comparing PTCy versus rATG included two randomised trials, a moderate quality meta-analysis, and several large retrospective studies. One randomised trial did not report any significant difference in the major outcomes of the 80 patients assigned to either PTCy or ATG prophylaxis in MUD or MRD transplantation; however, no subgroup analysis was provided for MUD allogeneic HSCT. The randomised trial was interrupted early after enrolment of 33 patients. A recent EBMT analysis in MUD allogeneic HSCT recipients with acute leukaemia found a reduced risk of severe cGVHD and inferior leukaemia free survival when rATG was used in comparison to PTCy. These data underline that disease-specific considerations are of importance in clinical practice. One meta-analysis pooled the results of six retrospective studies enrolling a total of 2379 patients receiving either PTCy or ATG for GVHD prophylaxis after MUD allogeneic HSCT: lower rates of grade 2–4 aGVHD (risk ratio [RR] 0·68; 95% CI 0·50–0·93), lower rates of non-relapse mortality (RR 0·7; 0·53–0·94), and higher overall survival (RR 1·29; 1·03–1·62) were reported with PTCy.

Where required, the GDG determined the context of recommendations by the same process of consensus, based on discussions around the balance of evidence on the benefits and disadvantages of the interventions across different contexts, in the context of rigorous research or targeted monitoring and evaluation.\n\n【2】### 2.9 Declaration of interests by external contributors\n\n【3】In accordance with WHO procedures for declaration of interests (DOIs) 删除11:<u>(37)</u>, all GDG, TWG and ERG members and other external collaborators were asked to declare in writing any competing interests (whether academic, financial, or other) using the standard WHO form, before engaging in the guideline development process. All experts were instructed to notify the responsible technical officer of any change in relevant interests during the course of the process, in order to update and review conflicts of interest accordingly. In addition, experts were requested to submit an electronic copy of their curriculum vitae.\n\n【4】The WHO Steering Group reviewed all DOI forms and curriculum vitae, and determined whether a conflict of interest existed. All findings from the received DOI forms were managed in accordance with the WHO DOI guidelines on a case-by-case basis. To ensure consistency, the WHO Steering Group applied the criteria for assessing the severity of a conflict of interest in the _WHO handbook for guideline development_ 删除11:<u>(19)</u>.\n\n【5】No declared conflicts of interest were considered serious enough to pose any risk to the guideline development process or reduce its credibility, and therefore all experts were only required to declare such conflicts at the first GDG meeting. At each subsequent virtual GDG meeting, members were required to share any new conflict of interest with the group. Prior to the final virtual GDG meeting, all GDG and TWG members, and observers, were again asked to complete their DOI forms and declare any conflict at the meeting, to ensure information was up-to-date as the formulation of recommendations concluded. Conflicts of interest that warranted action by WHO staff arose where experts had performed primary research or a systematic review related to any guideline recommendations; in such cases, the experts were restricted from participating in discussions and/or formulating any recommendation related to the area of their conflict of interest. A summary of DOIs from the GDG and information on how conflicts of interest were managed are included in Annex 2.\n\n【6】The names and short biographies of the GDG members were published on the WHO website for public review and comment two weeks prior to the first GDG meeting.\n\n【7】### 2.10 Document preparation and peer review\n\n【8】Following the final GDG meeting, an independent consultant and the WHO responsible technical officers prepared a draft of the full guideline document to accurately reflect the deliberations and decisions of the GDG. Other members of the WHO Steering Group provided comments on the draft guideline document before it was sent electronically to the GDG members for further comments. The document was also sent to the ERG for peer review. The ERG members were asked to review the final draft guideline to identify errors of fact, comment on clarity of language, and express considerations related to implementation, adaptation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 27, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/WHO：促进积极产后体验的产妇和新生儿护理建议（2022）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Options that are useful in certain circumstances include pembrolizumab or dostarlimab-gxly for MSI-H/dMMR tumors, pembrolizumab for TMB-H (≥10 mutations/megabase) tumors, and entrectinib or larotrectinib for $NTRK$ gene fusion-positive tumors. See Targeted Therapies below for more information on pembrolizumab, dostarlimab-gxly, entrectinib, and larotrectinib.\n\n【3】## Targeted Therapies\n\n【4】At present, several targeted therapeutic agents, trastuzumab, pembrolizumab/nivolumab, and entrectinib/larotrectinib, have been approved by the FDA for use in advanced gastric cancer. Treatment with trastuzumab is based on the presence of HER2 overexpression. Treatment with pembrolizumab/nivolumab is based on testing for MSI by PCR/NGS or MMR by IHC, PD-L1 expression by IHC, or high TMB by NGS. Treatment with the tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) inhibitors entrectinib and larotrectinib is based on testing for $NTRK$ gene fusions. When limited tissue is available for testing or the patient is unable to undergo a traditional biopsy, comprehensive genomic profiling via a validated NGS assay performed in a CLIA-approved laboratory may be used for the identification of $ERBB2$ amplification, MSI status, MMR deficiency, TMB, and $NTRK$ gene fusions. The use of IHC/ISH/targeted PCR should be considered first, followed by NGS testing as appropriate.\n\n【5】### Trastuzumab\n\n【6】The ToGA trial was the first randomized prospective phase III trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab in patients with HER2 overexpression-positive advanced gastric or EGJ adenocarcinoma. In this trial, 594 patients with HER2 overexpression-positive, locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic gastric or EGJ adenocarcinoma were randomized to receive trastuzumab plus chemotherapy (cisplatin plus fluorouracil or capecitabine) or chemotherapy alone. The majority of patients had gastric cancer (80% in the trastuzumab group and 83% in the chemotherapy group). Median follow-up was 19 months and 17 months, respectively, in the two groups. Results showed significant improvement in median OS with the addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy in HER2 overexpression-positive patients (13.8 vs. 11 months, respectively; $P$ = .046). This study established trastuzumab in combination with cisplatin and a fluoropyrimidine as the standard treatment for patients with HER2 overexpression-positive advanced gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma. In a post-hoc subgroup analysis, the addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy further improved OS in patients whose tumors were IHC 2+ and FISH positive or IHC 3+ (n = 446; 16 months vs. 11.8 months; HR,", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 96, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/（2023.V1）NCCN临床实践指南：胃癌.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

A trial of SCS has the potential for temporary and long-term complications such as spinal cord and nerve root injury. These can lead to additional morbidity apart from possibly influencing patient satisfaction and trial outcome assessment. Potential adverse effects include procedural pain, infection, lead fracture, lead migration, and headache due to inadvertent dural puncture.删除22:<u>$^{18}$</u> The existing literature indicates that the incidence of such complications (usually minor) to be approximately 2%–5%. Epidural fibrosis around a trial SCS electrode can theoretically cause difficulties in permanent lead insertion but has not been reported in any studies. Overall, based on available literature the benefits of performing an SCS trial override its potential limitations.\n\n【2】## Economic analysis\n\n【3】Cost analysis is an important aspect of understanding the overall value of a trial. However, there are several factors that determine the costs including country-specific payment system, payors and insurance coverage involved, aspects of trial conduct including number and type of leads, costs involved in procedural expenses, and others. Because of these factors we do not include any specific statements or economic considerations within our recommendations. A cost-analysis paper noted that SCS trials may be cost saving if at least 20% of patients who underwent a trial of SCS did not go through to a full implant, indicating the benefit gained from identifying non-responders. However, this was based on the use of permanent leads (with temporary percutaneous extensions) and may not be generalizable to practices in the USA where temporary leads are commonly used for SCS trials.删除22:<u>$^{43}$</u> Recently, a budget impact analysis considered a scenario where all patients would use temporary leads for the SCS trial.删除22:<u>$^{44}$</u> The study observed that among 1,506 SCS trial failure rate, the incremental cost associated with SCS trials for each 100 patients would range between £61,325 (US$73,769) and £87,837 (US$105,661). Estimates from the budget impact analysis suggest that SCS trials with temporary leads may become cost saving if at least 13.5%-14.75% of patients undergoing trials do not proceed to full SCS implant. Estimates were generated using the UK's National Health Service reference costs and it is plausible that these costs may differ from one country to another. A microcosting exercise may provide a more accurate estimate of the cost of an SCS trial.\n\n【4】Explant rates can give us an indirect estimate of therapy success, but these are not the interchangeable. Explant could be due to complications that require explantation to manage the issue, or patients who claim unsuccessful therapy (non-responders); it can also include successful cases with full remission of symptoms. At the same time, differences in clinical practices may not allow all unresponsive patients to be explanted. Studies of SCS reporting long-term outcomes must consider the possibility that the original pain diagnosis and location necessitating the SCS therapy may evolve or change over time and the success/failure of the existing SCS therapy should be considered in relation to the original indication. Based on reported RCTs and observational studies capturing patient-relevant clinical outcomes, the median trial success rate ranges between 72% and 82%, and therapy success is between 65% and 61% at 12 months, respectively.删除22:<u>$^{16}$</u> Although it is notable that Eldabe et al were able to publish the only reported RCT comparing SCS trial with a no trial approach,删除22:<u>$^{22}$</u> it was a relatively small study in a mixed population including complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) with some salient limitations such as using on-table SCS trial, a small\n\n【5】## Position statements\n\n【6】- There are clinical benefits in performing a trial of SCS therapy before performing a definitive SCS implant. The value of an SCS trial as compared with patient selection with clinical screening alone can be considered using measures of ‘diagnostic accuracy’ for predicting long-term therapy success or failure.

The sputum eosinophil count ($\\geq 3\\%$) is the most accurate indicator and can be evaluated via sputum induction or bronchoalveolar lavage; however, it is not routinely available and requires expert interpretation. Evidence of sputum eosinophilia is usually associated with the presence of asthma or cough-variant asthma, although in the absence of bronchial hyper-responsiveness, it is suggestive of eosinophilic bronchitis. Blood eosinophil count is a simple and readily available surrogate for the sputum eosinophil count, but is affected by higher variability. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) has moderate association with blood/sputum eosinophilia, and is helpful in both the diagnosis of asthma and useful in monitoring the efficacy of therapy. However, FeNO has been shown to be predictive of positive response to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in patients with elevated baseline FeNO values.\n\n| Statement                                                                                                                  | Type                 | Strength of recommendation/quality of evidence |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| In the absence of sputum, bronchoscopy with broncho-alveolar lavage may be indicated in the presence of high suspicion of infection or interstitial lung disease. | Recommendation       | C/moderate                                      |\n| Evidence of eosinophilic inflammation can be determined by induced sputum examination.                                      | Statement of fact    |                                                  |\n| FeNO testing and blood eosinophil count are non-invasive means to determine the presence of airway eosinophilia.            | Statement of fact    |                                                  |\n| FeNO levels, if increased, are predictive of a positive response to inhaled corticosteroids.                                 | Statement of fact    |                                                  |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 8, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/成人慢性咳嗽：意大利社会间共识的建议（2022）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Thus, additional recommendations for adults with LFS are general and include comprehensive physical examinations (including neurologic examination) every 6 to 12 months, especially when there is a high index of suspicion for second malignancies in cancer survivors and rare cancers. Clinicians should address screening limitations for other cancers associated with LFS. Screening methods for other LFS-associated cancers include periodic colonoscopy and upper endoscopy, dermatologic examination, and PSA. Education regarding signs and symptoms of cancer is important. Cancer screening in LFS should take into account prior treatment with radiation therapy.\n\n【2】Individuals with a TP53 P/LP variant are at increased risk of second malignant neoplasms. Radiosensitivity in individuals with a TP53 P/LP variant is not significantly different than in the general population, but carriers seem to be more susceptible to radioresistance. Though use of therapeutic RT should generally be avoided in individuals with a TP53 P/LP variant, clinical decision-making should take into account the availability of other curative treatment options.\n\n【3】There is little evidence regarding care of TP53 P/LP variant carriers with PZM or hypomorphic variants. Until there are more data on these carriers, they should be cared for as LFS, as opposed to patients with TP53 CH, which should not be managed as LFS. Instead, given TP53 mutation is considered a high-risk clinical feature in CH, patients with TP53 CH may be referred to hematology expertise.\n\n【4】### Cowden Syndrome/PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome\n\n【5】The spectrum of disorders resulting from germline P/LP variants in PTEN are referred to as PHTS. The spectrum of PHTS includes Cowden syndrome, Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRRS), adult Lhermitte-Duclos disease (LDD), Proteus-like syndrome, and autism spectrum disorders with macrocephaly. Cowden syndrome is rare, with an incidence of 1 in 200,000, although it is likely to be underestimated due to difficulties associated with making a clinical diagnosis of the disease. Cowden syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder, and most cases are associated with germline PTEN P/LP variants, though one study found that germline KILLIN methylation may also be associated with this syndrome. The frequency of germline PTEN P/LP variant in Cowden syndrome cases is high, at approximately 80%.\n\n【6】Hamartomas (benign tumors resulting from an overgrowth of normal tissue) are a common manifestation of the PHTS syndromes. Cowden syndrome is associated with multiple hamartomatous and/or cancerous lesions in various organs and tissues, including the skin, mucous membranes, breast, thyroid, endometrium, and brain. However, it has been suggested that patients with other PHTS diagnoses associated with PTEN P/LP variants should be assumed to have Cowden syndrome-associated cancer risks.\n\n【7】The lifetime risk for breast cancer for females diagnosed with Cowden syndrome/PHTS has been estimated at 40% to 60%, with an average age of 38 to 50 years at diagnosis. Some studies (as discussed above) have reported a higher cumulative lifetime risk for breast cancer (77%—", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 118, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/（2024.V3）NCCN临床实践指南：遗传／家族高风险评估-乳腺癌，卵巢癌和胰腺癌.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

They considered a slower induction phase appropriate, and temporally discontinuing treatment in cases where the adverse effect is clinically relevant and affects the continuity of treatment with apremilast, resuming treatment once the adverse effect has subsided, and administering antidiarrhoeals, antiemetics and/or analgesics only in cases where the adverse effect is clinically relevant (I-49, I-50).\n\n【12】### Discussion\n\n【13】Consensus recommendations based on expert opinion and developed using validated and rigorous methodologies produce useful guidelines, providing experts with valuable specific information.

NAFLD includes a histological spectrum of liver conditions ranging from simple steatosis [non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL)] to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis 删除11:<u>(3)</u>. NAFLD is always a diagnosis of exclusion in clinical practice; to entertain the diagnosis of NAFLD, clinicians need to exclude “excessive” alcohol consumption and all competing causes of hepatic steatosis. This is despite the fact that the coexistence of NAFLD with other chronic liver diseases (including but not limited to alcohol use disorder) is not rare in clinical practice 删除11:<u>(4)</u>. On the other hand, in the realm of drug development and regulatory approval processes, the definition of a patient population in which the mechanism of the drug can be linked to one underlying dominant pathophysiological process is critical. For these reasons and given the high heterogeneity and stigma around the NAFLD name, in 2020, several experts proposed the new term metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) 删除11:<u>(5,6)</u>. A diagnosis of MAFLD is based on evidence of hepatic steatosis (as assessed by liver biopsy, imaging techniques or blood biomarkers/scores) in persons who are overweight or obese or have type 2 diabetes (T2D), or metabolic dysregulation, regardless of the coexistence of excessive alcohol consumption and other chronic liver diseases. The newly proposed definition of MAFLD better emphasises the pathogenic role of metabolic dysfunction in the development of this common liver disease and uses inclusive criteria for diagnosis 删除11:<u>(7-10)</u>.

The steps we have proposed in this article represent an iterative and rational path forward towards clinical breakthroughs that can be modelled on success in other lung cancer pathologies.\n\n【4】删除1:<u>British Journal of Cancer; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41416-021-01407-9</u>\n\n【5】Large cell neuroendocrine lung carcinoma (LCNEC) is a rare lung cancer subtype yet no firm progress in management has followed the significant developments seen in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using targeted therapies and checkpoint inhibitors.删除17:<u>1</u> The World Health Organisation classes LCNEC as a neuroendocrine carcinoma.

A skeletal first article draft suggesting main sub-headings was sent to APP and BTOG members in February 2020. Feedback was received from co-authors by April 2020, who re-drafted based on their comments. All authors declared themselves aligned with this version in June 2020. Members were also asked to highlight key articles that may be missing from initial drafts.\n\n【7】Overall, we aim to (a) define the fundamental questions that have limited progress in LCNEC to date, and (b) propose a framework for the pursuit of translational and clinical progress in future work. An essential first aim is a determination that addresses the following fundamental questions:\n\n【8】1. What is large cell neuroendocrine lung carcinoma?\n2. How many patients are affected by it?\n3. What is standard of care treatment?\n\n【9】Unless these questions are answered conclusively, clinical progress for patients with this cancer will continue to be limited.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 1, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/【肿瘤领域】2021+BTOG／APP共识声明：大细胞神经内分泌肺癌.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Patients with EDMD and LGMD1B are at high risk for cardiac disease, often identified with initially asymptomatic abnormalities on electrocardiogram (ECG). Genetic testing in affected patients with appropriate cascade screening of relatives, with or without symptoms, allows proper surveillance and treatment and, in some case series, improves clinical outcomes. The type of mutation is a predictor of sudden death—specifically, truncation (nonsense) mutations in LMNA. X-linked EDMD confers a higher risk for sudden death, as well.\n\n【1】FSHD is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Genetic testing and cascade screening can identify affected individuals. Cardiac involvement in FSHD is rare, and genetic testing does not predict risk.\n\n【2】FA is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. An earlier age of symptom onset, increasing severity of neurological symptoms, and worsening left ventricular hypertrophy are observed in patients in whom genetic testing shows a greater expansion of the GAA triplet repeat in frataxin (FXN). Therefore, genetic testing of patients and their siblings is appropriate. It does not appear, however, that transformation to a dilated cardiomyopathy correlates with the size of the repeat expansion.\n\n【3】Mitochondrial disorders are heterogenous with variable inheritance. Mitochondrial DNA is inherited maternally and mitochondrial disorders are transmitted from a mother to children of both sexes. The penetrance and expressivity of the maternally inherited diseases can be affected by the presence of more than one mitochondrial DNA type, termed heteroplasmy. The genetic variability of these disorders is further enhanced by other modes of inheritance, such as X-linked or autosomal, while sporadic occurrences are also observed. Decisions on genetic testing in these disorders will typically be made in consultation with a medical geneticist and/or neuromuscular specialist.\n\n【4】### 2.3 Pediatric considerations\n\n【5】The pediatric patient with NMD raises special considerations, as these individuals have been largely excluded from the arrhythmia-management literature. The document mentions this discordance, for example, when using criteria developed for adults to assess thromboembolic risk due to atrial arrhythmias. A significant portion of the document, however, deals with the use of CIEDs. CIED implantation may be readily performed in an adult with NMD, but such surgery may have significantly greater consequences in a child, including the possible need for epicardial approach, frequent system modifications, psychosocial implications, and, in the case of ICD implantation, the specter of inappropriate shock. These concerns are also underscored by the potentially limited benefit in children with NMDs, as the vast majority of evidence pertaining to CIED use (and arrhythmia management in general) has been conducted in adult patients without NMDs. Through collaboration with pediatric cardiology societies, the document aims to balance these perspectives, making arrhythmia-related care available to children with NMDs based on existing evidence and experience while emphasizing the importance of shared decision-making and clinician judgment, coupled with the understanding that some interventions may not always be appropriate or desired in some pediatric patients. It is expected that further research and experience will provide greater clarity regarding arrhythmia care in the pediatric NMD patient.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 14, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/HRS：神经疾病心律失常风险的评估和管理的专家共识声明（2022）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Following ESD for lesions limited to the epithelium (m1) or the lamina propria (m2), the 5-year disease-specific survival (DSS) and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were reported to be 98 %–100 %, and 85 %–95 %, respectively.

The first concerns the role of ER as first-line treatment for noncircumferential esophageal SCC that has prospectively been clinically staged as T1a-m3/T1b-sm1 (N0M0). The second concerns ESD for superficial SCC involving the entire circumference of the esophagus.\n\n【4】There are no available European data covering these two topics, but the most recent Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society (JGES) guideline suggests that ESD is weakly recommended as first-line treatment for prospectively clinically diagnosed cT1a-m3/T1b-sm1 noncircumferential esophageal SCC.

A recent study adds evidence to these recommendations, showing that almost 80 % of endoscopically predicted T1a-m3/T1b-sm1 tumors involving less than three-quarters of the circumference can be cured by ER alone but if the lesion is circumferential then the ES capability rate drops to less than 20 % 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[69]</u></u>.\n\n【5】#### 4.1.1 Comparison with endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR)\nThere is no randomized study comparing EMR with ESD for SCC, but several new European reports have confirmed the efficacy and the superiority of ESD compared to EMR already stated in the previous 2015 guideline 删除12:<u>[删除13:<u>10, 67, 70, 71</u>]</u>. In a French trial, the complete resection rates for the ESD group and the EMR group were, respectively, 97.1 % versus 85 % (P < 0.01), and the 5-year disease-free survival rates were, respectively, 95.2 % versus 73.4 % (P < 0.01) 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[71]</u></u>.

Furthermore, there were significantly fewer severe complications in the ESD group than in the surgical resection group (15.2 % vs. 27.7 %, P < 0.001). Post-treatment stenosis was more common in the ESD group but the difference was not significant (13.4 % vs. 9.9 %, P = 0.203). However, in the ESD compared with the surgical resection group, the treatment duration and length of hospital stay were significantly shorter (49 min vs. 240 min, P < 0.001, and 3 days vs. 11 days, P < 0.001, respectively) and the cost of hospitalization was significantly lower 删除19:<u>(median 2813 US dollars vs.删除16:<u> 10001 </u>US dollars, P < 0.001)</u>.

Another report from Shanghai 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[76]</u></u> that specifically addressed outcomes according to invasion depths concluded that ESD oncologic outcomes were comparable to those achieved with esophagectomy, but were associated with minimal invasiveness, lower cost, and lower incidence of serious adverse events. However, in sm2/sm3 tumors or patients, the ESD RO resection rates were lower than those of esophagectomy 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[76]</u></u>.\n\n【8】Long-term outcomes were recently analyzed in a systematic review and meta-analysis that included 3796 patients and 5 comparative studies 删除12:<u>删除14:<u>[77]</u></u>.

In addition, ESD was associated with fewer adverse events (19.8 % vs. 44.0 %; odds ratio 0.3, 95 % CI 0.23–0.39).\n\n【9】ER is, therefore, considered safer and less invasive than surgical resection in patients with pT1 cancers, as well as being superior in terms of medical economics. Furthermore, patients are likely to prefer ER over surgical resection. Hence, balancing the benefits of organ preservation and the harm of postoperative complications, ESD should be recommended as first-line therapy for selected lesions (if a tumor classification no more severe than T1b-sm1 is expected).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 11, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/ESGE：内镜粘膜下剥离术治疗胃肠道浅表病变的指南（2022）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

One of the barriers to performing FMT is a lack of national guidelines. Accordingly, multidisciplinary experts in this field have developed practical guidelines for FMT. The purpose of these guidelines is to aid physicians performing FMT, which can be adapted to treat CDI and other conditions. \n**J Neurogastroenterol Motil 2022;28:28-42**\n\n【5】疑似页脚### Key Words\nFecal microbiota transplantation; Guideline; Treatment", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 1, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/KSNM：韩国粪菌移植的临床实践指南（2022）(1).pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Once functional, access durability also varies between access types, with fistulas generally lasting longer. For example, in 200 studies covering 800 000 patients, Almasri found primary (without maintenance) patency (95%CI) rates with fistulas, grafts and catheters to be 55删除11:<u>(52-58)</u>%, 40删除11:<u>(35-44)</u>% and 50删除11:<u>(41-61)</u>% at 2 years 删除11:<u>(4)</u>. Secondary (with maintenance, therefore total functional time) patency for fistulas and grafts was 63删除11:<u>(59-67)</u>% and 60删除11:<u>(55-65)</u>% at 2 years. Maintenance usually involves surgery or interventional radiology, with additional treatment burden therefore, in particular with grafts. Patency figures in modern studies include initially unsuccessful access, so these rates equate to the loss of initially successful fistulas at around 10% per year, and catheters / grafts at around 25% per year. The improved initial functionality of grafts is therefore offset by higher maintenance and shorter total durability. This outcome is particularly important, with the SONG-HD study (Standardised Outcomes in Nephrology) identifying vascular access function as the most important outcome for both patients and healthcare professionals 删除11:<u>(30)</u>.\n\n【2】3. Patient satisfaction with their vascular access has been compared in two studies, both favouring fistula access. In a Canadian study including two cohorts of 132 and 140 patients, using a validated questionnaire, satisfaction scores in patients dialysing by fistula, graft and catheter were 6.5, 5.2 and 5.9 (with higher scores indicating greater satisfaction) 删除11:<u>(31)</u>. And in a study of 749 patients from Birmingham, using a similar validated questionnaire (but in which lower scores indicate fewer patient-perceived problems) Field found scores of 5.1, 7.2, and 6.6 in patients dialysing by fistula, graft and catheter respectively  删除11:<u>(32)</u>. Differences between these satisfaction scores were explained by specific patient-perceived problems, such as pain (perhaps more common with AV access, p=0.068), bleeding and bruising (distinctly more common with AV access, p<0.001), redness and infection (more common with catheters, p<0.001), and clotting (more common with grafts and catheters, p=0.008). Perhaps surprisingly, daily physical symptoms were generally of more concern to patients than delayed departure from dialysis or hospitalisation 删除11:<u>(31)</u>. Overall quality of life has also been linked to access, with Nimmo finding that AV access was associated with reduced disease burden and improved physical and mental composite scores using the KDQOL questionnaire in 738 patients in Scotland 删除11:<u>(33)</u>. Though much like mortality data, this study would be biased by any association between quality of life and access selection, which is quite likely.\n\n【3】Qualitative research also demonstrates a significant burden associated with vascular access regardless of type, best summarized in Casey's thematic analysis of 46 studies including 1,034 patients 删除11:<u>(34)</u>. Their synthesis demonstrates that vascular access for patients is not just about having a fistula, graft or catheter for dialysis sessions, but acts as a constant link to a life sustaining treatment, creating anxiety and feelings of vulnerability. Vascular access can cause patients concern with physical intrusion, fear of cannulation, a threat of complications and failure, dependency, disfigurement, impingement on their life including family life and a constant reminder of their need for haemodialysis 删除11:<u>(34)</u>. However, it also is associated with self-preservation, enabling them to have haemodialysis. It is easy to see therefore how important and highly personal these decisions are, since they affect patients deeply, going far beyond clinical outcome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 16, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/2023 UKKA临床实践指南：血液透析血管通路.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Many countries have national schistosomiasis control programmes, although their focus has been historically on SAC. Any lack of acceptability of preventive chemotherapy in the treated population is ascribed to low and variable levels of knowledge, concern for side-effects and lack of perceived benefit. There is no clear evidence to support a differential acceptability of preventive chemotherapy by age group. In general, significant gaps still exist in knowledge about schistosomiasis and the damaging health effects associated with infection. The understanding of infection and associated disease will vary across age groups and should be addressed when tailoring programmes of engagement, educating and empowering communities, shaping interventions and securing support for participation in multi-year preventive chemotherapy programmes.\n\n【2】## Resource implications\n\n【3】The GDG agreed that the inclusion of all at-risk age groups for preventive chemotherapy against schistosomiasis would provide a favourable ratio of resources relative to the expected benefit.\n\n【4】A review of the costing literature yielded an average cost of delivering treatment per child of US$ 0.50 and per-community member of US$ 1.50 (which would include pre-SAC, adolescents and adults). This cost was reduced with increasing size of the treated population due to economies of scale. These estimates included procurement and distribution of medicines, training and supervision of teachers, and monitoring. The additional cost of praziquantel depends on whether or not it was donated and on the average number of pills per person given the need for weight-based dosing. The overall cost was driven largely by the delivery of medication rather than the medication itself.\n\n【5】A review of the literature considering cost–effectiveness concluded that the strategy of community-wide preventive chemotherapy across all age groups, compared with treatment of SAC alone, met conventional measures of cost–effectiveness in many scenarios. Treatment of only SAC would also be cost-effective with lower total resource utilization, but would limit the total avertable disease burden. The cost–effectiveness of treating all age groups would be increased if applied in settings of moderate and high prevalence (≥ 10%). Thus, the choice of prevalence thresholds to guide the frequency of praziquantel can improve the efficiency of resource utilization.\n\n【6】## Equity\n\n【7】The GDG agreed that preventive chemotherapy across all age groups would yield greater reductions in schistosomiasis disease burden and improve equity.\n\n【8】Schistosomiasis is a disease that disproportionately affects poor, vulnerable people who are unable to routinely access health services. Historically, treatment has focused on SAC, which neglects the remainder of the population who carry a substantial disease burden, namely pre-SAC, older adolescents and adult populations. Preventive chemotherapy applied across all key age groups would improve equity significantly by treating the disease burden in the entire at-risk population, thus providing better control of the overall disease burden. However, careful programmatic design and delivery would be essential to ensure that access to medicines is provided equitably to reach the entire at-risk population and avoid repeated treatment of more easily accessed populations.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 41, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/WHO：控制和消灭人类血吸虫病指南（2022）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

ISRT fields for NLPHL generally include adjacent but clinically uninvolved nodes when treated with RT alone.\n\n【5】- **Palliative RT:** 4–30 Gy\n\n【6】### ISRT: Volumes\n\n【7】- **ISRT principles should be followed when designing RT fields for HL.**\n  - Planning for ISRT requires modern CT-based simulation and treatment planning capabilities.\n  - Incorporating other modern imaging such as FDG-PET and MRI often enhances treatment volume determination.\n\n【8】- **ISRT targets the site of the originally involved lymph node(s).**\n  - The clinical target volume (CTV) encompasses the original or suspected extent of disease prior to chemotherapy or surgery. This volume is then modified to account for tumor shrinkage and spares adjacent uninvolved organs (e.g., lungs, bone, muscle, kidney) when lymphadenopathy regresses following chemotherapy.\n\n【9】- **For CHL, the pre-chemotherapy or pre-biopsy gross tumor volume (GTV) provides the basis for determining the CTV.**\n  - Concerns for questionable subclinical disease and uncertainties in original imaging accuracy or localization may lead to expansion of the CTV and are determined individually using clinical judgment.\n  - For NLPHL, the CTV will depend on whether treatment consists of ISRT alone or CMT.\n\n【10】- **A dose of 20 Gy following ABVD x 2 is sufficient if the patient has non-bulky stage I–IIA disease with an ESR <50, no extralymphatic lesions, and only 1 or 2 lymph node regions involved. See HODG-3 for definition of nodal sites according to GHSG.**\n\n【11】- **ISRT alone: The CTV should be expanded to include potential microscopic disease in the immediate region of the FDG-PET–positive disease.**\n  - CMT: Similar to CHL after chemotherapy (treating originally involved lymph node(s) only)\n  - Possible movement of the target by respiration as determined by 4D-CT or fluoroscopy (internal target volume, [ITV]) should also influence the final CTV.\n\n【12】- **The planning target volume (PTV) is an additional expansion of the CTV that accounts only for setup variations and may differ by site and immobilization technique.**\n  - See ICRU definitions\n\n【13】- **OARs should be outlined for optimizing treatment plan decisions.**\n  - The treatment plan can be designed using conventional, 3-D conformal, proton therapy, or IMRT techniques using clinical treatment planning considerations of coverage and normal tissue avoidance.\n  - The treatment of extranodal disease is individualized, but similar principles of GTV/CTV/PTV definition should be applied as for nodal disease.\n  - Chest wall extension – Effort should be made to include regions of initial chest wall extension to definitive doses.\n  - Lung involvement – Areas of extension into the lung from mediastinal or hilar disease may be treated with lower doses (~15 Gy) unless the relative volume is small, in which case higher doses may be utilized. Careful consideration of partial lung tolerance is essential. Pulmonary nodular disease is usually not treated following chemotherapy unless residual disease is present.\n  - Pleural or pericardial effusions are not included in the GTV. Nodular pericardial involvement may be included with consideration of cardiac tolerance.\n  - Bone – Areas of osseous disease may be treated with a CTV expansion beyond the GTV defined by imaging.

A bone marrow assessment should show trilineage hematopoiesis and fewer than 5% blasts (M1) or <1% by flow or molecular testing. For a CR, absolute neutrophil counts (ANCs) should be greater than 1000/μL and platelet counts should be greater than 100,000/μL. In addition, no recurrence should be observed for at least 4 weeks.\n\n【3】A patient is considered to have a CRi if criteria for CR are met except the ANC remains less than 1000/μL or the platelet count remains less than 100,000/μL. In general, ORR is the sum of CR and CRi values. Of note, MRD assessment is not included in morphologic assessment and should be obtained.\n\n【4】Refractory disease is defined as the inability to achieve a CR at the EOI therapy. Progressive disease (PD) is defined as an increase in the absolute number of circulating blasts (in peripheral blood) or bone marrow blasts by at least 25%, or the development of extramedullary disease. Relapsed disease is defined as the reappearance of blasts in the blood or bone marrow (>5%; M2 or greater); or >1% with previous/supportive molecular findings; or in any extramedullary site after achievement of a CR.\n\n【5】#### Response in CNS Disease\nRemission of CNS disease is defined as achievement of CNS-1 status in a patient with CNS-2 or CNS-3 at diagnosis. CNS relapse is defined as development of CNS-3 status or development of clinical signs of CNS leukemia (eg, facial nerve palsy, brain/eye involvement, CNS hemorrhage, hypothalamic syndrome) without an alternative explanation. CNS relapse is also considered in development of CNS-2 status on two consecutive lumbar punctures (between 2–4 weeks apart) with confirmation by immunophenotyping or other molecular testing methods.\n\n【6】### Surveillance\nAfter completion of the ALL treatment regimen (including maintenance therapy), the panel recommends surveillance at regular intervals to assess disease status. During the first year after completion of therapy, every 1 to 4 months, patients should undergo a complete physical examination (including a testicular examination as applicable) and blood tests (CBC with differential). Liver function tests should be performed until normal values are achieved. During the second year after completion of therapy, a physical examination (including a testicular examination as applicable) and blood tests (CBC with differential) should be performed every 2 to 6 months. During the third year (and beyond) after completion of therapy, physical examination (including a testicular examination as applicable) and blood tests (CBC with differential) can be performed every 6 to 12 months or as clinically indicated.\n\n【7】An assessment of bone marrow aspirate and CSF for suspected relapse should be performed as clinically indicated; if a bone marrow aspirate is performed, flow cytometry with additional studies that may include comprehensive cytogenetics, FISH, molecular tests, and MRD assessments should be carried out. If relapse is suspected, a full workup should be considered.

Major bleeding was higher in patients receiving upstream treatment with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors.\n\n【3】#### Recommendations\n- Stenting with newer-generation DES is recommended over balloon angioplasty or implantation of BMS.\n- Routine use of deferred stenting is not recommended. However, it may be considered for some patients, such as those with anterior STEMI or those with a large thrombus burden.\n- Routine use of thrombus aspiration is not recommended. However, it may be considered in lesions with a large thrombotic burden.\n- Routine use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors is not recommended. However, they may be considered as bailout therapy for some patients, such as those with no-reflow phenomenon, a high risk of thrombus-related complications, or evidence of a large thrombus.\n\n【4】### PART 2. REVASCULARIZATION STRATEGY FOR NON-ST-SEGMENT ELEVATION MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION\n\n【5】#### Summary of the major guidelines and recent publications\n\n【6】In patients with NSTEMI, a routine invasive strategy is commonly performed, unless otherwise indicated. A meta-analysis of seven randomized trials that included 8,375 patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) showed that an early invasive strategy was associated with lower risks of death, MI, and rehospitalization for unstable angina at a mean follow-up of 2 years. Another meta-analysis of eight randomized trials that included 10,412 patients with NSTE-ACS found that routine invasive therapy significantly reduced the composite endpoint of death, MI, and recurrent ACS in patients with NSTEMI. Although these randomized trials were performed before the development of advanced PCI techniques, before newer-generation DESs and potent P2Y$_{12}$ inhibitors became available, and also included patients with unstable angina in addition to NSTEMI, routine and earlier implementation of invasive approaches was favored over conservative treatment, especially in patients with NSTEMI.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 8, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/【心血管领域】2021+KSMI专家共识：急性心肌梗死的血运重建.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Addressing palliative needs at the end of life involves eliciting end-of-life treatment preferences, creating care plans, and providing education about possible scenarios, including infection, bleeding, and HE.\n\n【2】62. Hospice is a patient- and caregiver-centered option for EoLC that is underused by patients dying with cirrhosis.\n\n【3】63. In addition to current criteria, hepatology teams may consider using MELD >21 and Child-Pugh >12 to determine whether patients are prognostically appropriate for hospice (i.e., have estimated survival of ≤6 months).\n\n【4】64. Providing caregivers with information about imminent death may help support decisions aligned with the patient's prognosis (e.g., providing pain medications despite past substance use disorder at the end of life).\n\n【5】### Future Clinical and Policy Implications\n\n【6】To successfully weave the principles of palliative care into clinical hepatology requires substantial research, advocacy, and infrastructure change, and health policy changes. A critical first step is workforce training and programmatic development to support palliative care. Although not every hepatology trainee or team member requires expert-level palliative care skills, there is a growing consensus that clinicians across all medical and surgical specialties need to develop core competencies in providing TPC and then engage with specialists as needed. This is even more critical in light of palliative care workforce shortages. Palliative care is a growing field, but its penetrance is uneven across the USA, with the largest gaps existing in ambulatory and community palliative care services. Several societies have developed key competencies in PPC for nonspecialists, including communication, ACP, and symptoms assessment and management skills. For example, competencies for cardiologists include, but are not limited to, communication and shared decision-making skills, pain and symptom management, caring for caregivers, understanding hospice indications, end-of-life decision making and care, and working with an interdisciplinary team to manage psychosocial, spiritual, and cultural aspects of care. Similarly, some skills that are important for hepatology clinicians include identifying and documenting surrogate decision maker, communicating prognosis, eliciting and documenting goals and values, and delivering care concordant with these goals and values. Offering trainees in hepatology the opportunity to serve on palliative care consultative services and in hospice settings may provide hands-on experience and training that can diffuse into current hepatology practitioners. Resources for further skill development are offered in Table S2.\n\n【7】In addition to training opportunities, there are other potential opportunities to increase palliative care implementation in clinical hepatology settings. For example, specialty palliative care providers can round on inpatient hepatology services or have colocated clinics with hepatology. Alternatively, palliative care consultation can be automated based on trigger criteria (e.g., intensive care unit admission, removal from the transplant list). Simply offering information about palliative care in hepatology settings can help caregivers and patients become more aware of their options. Routine symptom assessment in hepatology can increase providers’ expertise with triaging and managing symptoms that are often underaddressed for patients with cirrhosis.\n\n【8】Policy and infrastructure changes can also facilitate palliative care implementation in hepatology. Advocating for payers and hospice agencies to innovate to best meet the needs of patients with cirrhosis will ensure that the specific issues facing our patients are addressed. For example, policies supporting reimbursement for specialty palliative services should be expanded. Furthermore, dissemination of information about available supports and benefits is important. For example, many are unaware that patients on the transplant list can receive hospice benefits until a donor organ becomes available. Finally, incorporating measures of hospice and palliative care into cirrhosis quality metrics can demonstrate the importance of these topics to providers and payers.\n\n【9】Clinical research gaps have been highlighted throughout this guidance. These include developing evidence around which interventions work at what times for patients with cirrhosis, delineating the optimal ways to measure and report patient-reported outcomes for patients with cirrhosis, and addressing the high symptom burden of patients with cirrhosis, particularly using nonpharmacological approaches. Thus, fully implementing palliative care for patients with DC requires a multipronged approach to address ongoing training, practice, policy, and research gaps.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 24, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/AASLD：失代偿期肝硬化的症状管理和姑息治疗的实践指南（2022）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

TOF is characterized by an overriding aorta and varying severity of subpulmonary and pulmonary valve obstruction, ranging from mild pulmonary stenosis to pulmonary atresia or dilation in the presence of absent pulmonary valve syndrome (APVS). TOF may also be seen in association with AV septal defect. The branch pulmonary arteries must be identified at their origins, as discontinuity, segmental stenosis, and major aortopulmonary collateral vessels can coexist with an apparently patent outflow tract and/or ductus arteriosus and have implications for management and long-term outcomes 删除9:<u>(Table 13)</u>. Imaging for associated arch anomalies and thymus allow tailored counseling regarding risk of 22q11 deletion. In TOF with absent pulmonary valve, ventricular dysfunction predicts fetal and perinatal morbidity and mortality.\n\n【3】In double-outlet right ventricle, the VSD can be subaortic, subpulmonary, doubly committed, or remote, and therefore it is necessary to determine the orientation and relative sizes of the aorta and pulmonary artery as they exit the ventricle, as well as their relationship to the VSD. If the VSD is subpulmonary, an anterior aorta may be obstructed in the subaortic region, necessitating careful aortic arch imaging with 2D and color Doppler as coarctation often accompanies this situation. If the VSD is subaortic, the anatomy and postnatal physiology may be like that of TOF.\n\n【4】Truncus arteriosus, also called common arterial trunk, is characterized by a single arterial trunk that gives rise directly to the coronary arteries, aorta, and one or both pulmonary arteries. Truncal valve function, especially significant regurgitation, can affect in utero survival. A fair amount of anatomic variability exists with dominant commitment to the pulmonary circulation (branch pulmonary arteries from the common trunk, smaller aortic partition with or without arch interruption) or to the aortic circulation (dominant ascending aorta with branch pulmonary arteries arising together or separately from the common trunk). Although the ductus arteriosus is often absent, one may be present in all forms of common arterial trunk, with the more pulmonary-dominant variants and truncus with interrupted aortic arch entirely dependent on ductus arteriosus patency for perfusion of the lower body. These features are dependent on prostaglandin E1 initiation at birth.\n\n【5】Lesions with LV Outflow Giving Rise to a Posterior Pulmonary Artery. Both d-TGA and L-transposition of the great arteries (l-TGA) demonstrate a similar posterior pulmonary artery arising from the LV outflow tract .

A patient with a vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) device in situ requires early multidisciplinary input and planning in the peri-operative period to optimise patient safety and avoid potential damage to the device.\n\n【2】2. It is generally safer to formally deactivate the VNS device before elective surgery to avoid potential complications of vagal stimulation. There should be a plan for reactivation of the device in the postoperative period. If formal deactivation and reactivation is not readily available and the VNS device is to be left activated for surgery, then the patient’s personal device magnet must be available in the operating theatre to allow for emergency deactivation should complications arise.\n\n【3】3. In the emergency setting, if it is not possible to arrange formal deactivation of the VNS device, it is reasonable to proceed with surgery with the device in the active mode. If left activated, the anaesthetist should be alert to the potential adverse side effects of vagal stimulation as outlined in this guideline. If VNS-related complications arise, the device can be temporarily deactivated by securing the patient’s personal VNS device magnet over the pulse generator location (commonly the anterior chest wall).\n\n【4】4. In an emergency, if a VNS-specific magnet is not available, any magnet with a strength over 50 gauss (e.g. a typical pacemaker magnet) can be secured over the pulse generator to deactivate the device.\n\n【5】5. If the VNS device is active, vagus nerve stimulation can cause unilateral vocal cord adduction with consequent airway obstruction in the presence of a supraglottic airway device. Consideration should thus be given to securing the airway by tracheal intubation.\n\n【6】6. Vagus nerve stimulation devices should be deactivated before spinal anaesthesia due to potential cardiovascular complications. However, the safety of continuing VNS therapy during epidural analgesia or anaesthesia is unclear. If VNS is continued in this situation, monitoring with continuous telemetry should be used and the patient’s device magnet should be immediately available to turn off stimulation if required.\n\n【7】7. Cannulation of the internal jugular and subclavian veins on the ipsilateral side to the device should be avoided.\n\n【8】8. The decision to continue VNS therapy during periods of critical illness should be made on an individual patient basis with input from neurology and critical care services. The balance of risks of increased seizure frequency or status epilepticus associated with device deactivation versus the potential for adverse cardiorespiratory effects in the presence of an active VNS device should all be considered.\n\n【9】9. Vagus nerve stimulation devices must be deactivated in the MRI suite.\n\n【10】### What other guidelines currently exist?\n\n【11】Online resources include the physician’s and technical manuals for various VNS device models from the manufacturer. There are a small number of publications, including case reports, which offer guidance on the role of VNS therapy and its implications in the peri-operative, peripartum and critical care setting.\n\n【12】### Why were these guidelines developed?\n\n【13】There are an increasing number of patients who have implanted VNS devices. As more data emerge, the indications for VNS therapy are also increasing. These guidelines are intended to inform anaesthetists, as well as the multidisciplinary team, about the practical implications of VNS therapy during the peri-operative period.\n\n【14】### How and why does this statement differ from existing guidelines?\n\n【15】This guideline provides a complete update that integrates expertise in neurology with the practicalities of anaesthetic and surgical service delivery, and addresses the needs of both adults and children.\n\n【16】### Disclaimer\n\n【17】These guidelines are not intended to represent a minimum standard of practice, nor are they to be regarded as a substitute for good clinical judgement. They present key principles and suggested strategies for the management of VNS therapy in the peri-operative and peripartum periods and during times of critical illness.\n\n【18】### Introduction\n\n【19】The earliest reports recognising the effect of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) as a means of seizure suppression date back to the late 1800s. The first human implantation of a vagus nerve stimulator for drug-resistant epilepsy was reported in 1988. Vagus nerve stimulation therapy has been shown to be an effective and safe adjunct to maximal pharmacological therapy in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. It was licensed for use in Europe in 1994 and in the USA in 1997 as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy; though there are age restrictions on its use in the American market.

However, GERD symptoms may \nbe absent in case of pathological gastroesophageal reflux and do not always indicate the presence of abnormal acid exposure.删除17:<u>36</u> In this regard, ARM is the gold standard diagnostic test to obtain confirmatory evidence of GERD. ARM includes catheter-based or wireless pH-monitoring devices and catheter-based impedance and pH-monitoring devices. In particular, 24-hour multichannel intraluminal pH-impedance monitoring provides the most comprehensive assessment of gastro-esophageal reflux events to detect acidic (pH < 4), weakly acidic (pH 4–7), and alkaline reflux events (pH > 7), which would not \nbe assessed without impedance monitoring, as well as adjunctive metrics that support a diagnosis of GERD. Silent GERD, defined as objective evidence of GERD on ARM in the absence of symptoms, may be present in asymptomatic patients planning bariatric surgery, and a meta-analysis based on \nresults from10,718 patients undergoing LSG found a postoperative19% increase in GERD prevalence. A recent systematic review included 12 studies on 547 patients assessing ambulatory pH-monitoring results before and after bariatric procedures. In eight of the included studies, the authors observed an increase in DeMeester Score (DMS) and/or \nan increase in DMS and/or AET after LSG in two \nstudies, an increase of AET and total refluxes following LSG and GB but not after EB, RYGB, mini gastric bypass, biliopancreatic bypass, or biliopancreatic diversion in one study. Finally, one study reported an increase of AET after LSG, but no difference after GB or EB. De novo GERD rate ranged from 17.8 to 69%. Another systematic review conducted a meta-analysis with meta-analysis investigated GERD outcomes following LSG or RYGB based on pH/pH-impedance monitoring in 498 and 347 patients, respectively. In nine studies, DMS, AET, and number of acid refluxes significantly decreased following RYGB. In contrast, in 14 studies, total and recumbent AET, and total number of reflux episodes and nonacid reflux episodes significantly increased following LSG. In this regard, two recent prospective non-RCTs found that preoperative DMS and management with LSG (OR 12.3, 95%CI: 2.9–52.5) could predict the development of erosive esophagitis and postoperative GERD at12 months after surgery, respectively. In a meta-analysis on GERD outcomes after GB in 129 patients, the percentage of patients with pathological pH monitoring decreased in five studies, although the mean total reflux time increased in two studies. De novo GERD after GB ranged \nfrom 14.3 to 30.1%. In this regard, a recent meta-analysis found that GERD was the cause of 30.4% \nof conversions from LSG to RYGB, resulting in the resolution of symptoms in 91.3% of patients at 24-month follow-up. Similarly, severe postoperative GERD required conversion from LSG to RYGB in \n9% of patients included in a recent RCT. Finally, a prospective study on 222 patients investigating postoperative outcomes of silent GERD (defined \nas objective evidence of GERD on endoscopy or pH monitoring in absence of symptoms) found that \n25% of patients planning bariatric surgery had silent GERD and, of these, 66% became symptomatic following LSG. Additionally, silent GERD accounted for 17% of symptomatic or advance GERD.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 6, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/_2024 ISDE立场声明：减重手术或 内镜治疗肥胖前的胃食管诊断检查.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

A multidisciplinary discussion among surgeons, interventional radiologists and pathologists is critical in deciding the best approach to obtain adequate tissue for diagnosis. Diagnostic modalities include open tumour biopsy, laparoscopic or thoracoscopic tumour biopsy, image-guided (ultrasound, computed tomography (CT)) biopsy, bone marrow biopsy (rarely sufficient for performing all the molecularly required studies) or biopsy of metastatic disease (pathological enlarged lymph nodes, soft tissue masses including skin nodules, cortical bone lesions; liver metastases). The decision on the best surgical approach for diagnosis of stage L2 and M neuroblastoma is based on the disease pattern characteristics and the local resources of each institution. For patients with stage L1 who undergo upfront surgery, the extent of resection needed is uncertain.\n\n【1】Although rare, it is critical to take into consideration pheochromocytoma and adrenocortical tumours in the differential diagnosis of an adrenal mass when considering a possible biopsy, because adrenocortical carcinoma and malignant pheochromocytoma will be upstaged by performing a biopsy. These tumours are generally chemo resistant and are better treated with upfront resection and locoregional staging. Clinical signs and symptoms including patient age, hypertension, palpitations, hyperglycaemia, virilisation and hormonal lab studies for neuroblastoma may help to guide the diagnosis.\n\n【2】Renal tumour (Please refer to Wilms Tumour Guidelines)\n\n【3】Although the International Society of Paediatric Oncology (SIOP) protocol calls for neoadjuvant chemotherapy without tissue confirmation of Wilms and the Children's Oncology Group (COG) continues to advocate upfront surgery, there are instances, albeit different in each protocol, when biopsy of the primary is called for. The argument for biopsy of the primary tumour is similar but the timing and subsequent steps vary between the SIOP and COG protocols in both unilateral and bilateral tumours. In a child with unilateral kidney tumour outside the age range where Wilms is most common or when the radiologic findings are inconclusive or suggestive of other than nephroblastoma, both exceptions either alone or in combination, the SIOP protocol is able to accommodate upfront percutaneous retroperitoneal primary tumour biopsy becomes justifiable vs an upfront nephroureterectomy or empiric neoadjuvant chemotherapy. An important exception would be the newborns and infants younger than 6 months when upfront nephrectomy remains the standard. It is important to emphasize that the best option would be the one decided collectively by the managing multi-disciplinary team. Another situation when percutaneous biopsy should be considered is the absence of tumour response or progression during therapy. Again, discussion by the multidisciplinary team of its paramount importance and informed controversy should be weighed in.\n\n【4】The COG protocol, which advocates upfront primary tumour resection for all children, provides a window for kidney biopsy to justify neoadjuvant chemotherapy and it includes: A primary renal tumour with a tumour thrombus above the level of the hepatic veins pulmonary compromise from a massive primary or extensive pulmonary metastases when resection requires removal of contiguous structures (other than adrenal gland) or individual surgeons' judgement stating that attempting nephre صحت(timer يحدث in سيات handling operability as neoadjuvant chemotherapy does not result in improved survival rates and results in a loss of مهم 중요한 staging information.\n\n【5】Open or laparoscopic primary tumour biopsy is discouraged by both protocols as it upstages the tumour. The only exception would be when the tumour is considered unresectable during an actual attempt at upfront nephrectomy.\n\n【6】In the setting of bilateral kidney tumours, the SIOP protocol does not require tissue diagnosis to initiate neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This is based on the extreme rarity of bilateral tumours other than Wilms. Biopsy, however, should be considered when there is no response or progression while receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This applies to unilateral and bilateral renal tumours. Similarly, the COG protocol recognises that biopsy is not necessary before initiating chemotherapy in most children with bilateral Wilms tumours (BWTs). It is strongly recommended in cases where there are unusual features (e.g. older than 8 years and atypical intra-abdominal findings).\n\n【7】In 20% of BWT cases, the pathology is not the same bilaterally. Therefore, when deciding on biopsy, it is important to sample both kidneys and since anaplasia cannot be detected on percutaneous or core-needle biopsies, open biopsy remains an option.\n\n【8】Liver tumour (Please refer to Hepatoblastoma and Hepatocellular Carcinoma Guidelines)\n\n【9】Liver tumours are rare in children, accounting for 1% of all paediatric malignancies. Two distinct entities, hepatoblastoma (HBL) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), are seen in this age group. While HBL is typically diagnosed in children younger than 4 years of age (usually younger.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 20, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/IPSO：外科实践指南（2022）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Due to the complex etiology, multiple surgical procedures and postoperative complications, the diagnosis and treatment strategies of HSCR have always been the focus of pediatric surgeons around the world. Seventy pediatric surgical experts with rich clinical experience from almost all national and provincial children’s medical centers in China constituted the Chinese Research Group of Hirschsprung disease (CRGHSCR)删除1:<u>. All members discussed and compiled the disagreements concerning the diagnosis, treatment [Supplementary File, http://links. lww.com/CM9/B890], and perioperative management of HSCR based on existing evidence from previous articles, in combination with the latest high-quality evidence. The current consensus statement is aimed at standardizing the diagnostic and surgical strategies, and emphasizing postoperative rehabilitation training, to systematically improve postoperative recovery and to improve the quality of life in long-term follow-up.</u>\n\n【5】The consensus was reached through a total of three rounds of discussions between February 2019 and June 2022. A modified Delphi method was used for as many reiterative rounds as necessary. The quality of evidence and recommendations were evaluated according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system.\n\n【6】## Diagnosis of HSCR\n\n【7】Meconium is delayed 24 h after birth in approximately 90% of HSCR patients. The symptoms of premature infants with HSCR are similar to those of full-term infants.\n\n【8】**Recommendation 1:** HSCR should be considered for all neonates who fail to pass meconium within 24 h after birth. (Grade 1A)\n\n【9】Digital rectal examination (DRE) is an important method for screening HSCR. It is also a simple method for the differential diagnosis of anorectal malformations.\n\n【10】**Recommendation 2:** DRE can exclude anorectal malformations and screen for HSCR. (Grade 1B)\n\n【11】In contrast enema (CE) test, the most intuitive manifestation of HSCR is the transition zone (TZ) between the narrow distal segment without ganglion cells and dilated proximal colon with normal ganglion cells. In a systematic review, CE had a mean sensitivity of 70% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 64–76%) and a mean specificity of 83% (95% CI: 74–90%) for the diagnosis of HSCR.\n\n【12】**Recommendation 3:** Preoperative CE can detect the TZ and provide information, which can be beneficial to determine the lesion range in HSCR. (Grade 1A)\n\n【13】Anorectal manometry (ARM) is used to evaluate the voluntary and involuntary properties of the anorectum. One of the most important manometry assessment indicators for anorectal function is the recto-anal inhibitory reflex (RAIR). In a systematic review, the mean sensitivity and mean specificity of ARM were 91% (95% CI: 85–95%) and 94% (95% CI: 89–97%), respectively.

The primary goals of medical therapy during this phase of care include volume management, treatment of systemic hypertension and optimization of RV function. Early initiation of neurohormonal blockade may also provide long-term benefits for ventricular reverse remodeling and myocardial recovery during LVAD support 删除11:<u>(20-22)</u>.\n\n【3】Hypertension increases pump afterload and impairs LVAD function. Due to the association of hypertension with hemorrhagic stroke in LVAD patients 删除11:<u>(23)</u>, blood pressure management should be initiated to maintain a mean arterial pressure 75 to 90 mm Hg for patients on continuous flow LVAD support. 删除11:<u>(删除13:<u>11, 24</u>)</u> Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are well established vasodilator therapies in heart failure patients, and their use is recommended in LVAD patients as well. Observational data support a role for ACE inhibitors and ARBs in the reduction of gastrointestinal bleeding due to arteriovenous malformations 删除11:<u>(25-27)</u>. In particular, one study showed marked reductions in subsequent gastrointestinal bleeding when ACE inhibitors or ARBs were started within the first 30 postoperative days.删除11:<u>(25)</u> If additional afterload reduction is required, or if ACE inhibitor/ARB use is limited or contraindicated, hydralazine and nitrates can be introduced. Nitrates should not be given if the patient is already being treated by a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor. 删除11:<u>(28)</u> There are presently no large studies available to support the use of angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitors in LVAD patients, but they may be considered in carefully selected patients who well tolerate moderate doses of ACE inhibitor/ARB therapy. It is important to monitor for medication side-effects, including headaches (nitrates and milrinone), nausea (hydralazine and milrinone), and cough or angioedema (ACE inhibitors and ARNIs).\n\n【4】While neurohormonal blockade therapy in LVAD patients has not been studied in a randomized trial, observational data from the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) showed improved 4-year survival and quality of life in patients taking neurohormonal blockade therapy.删除11:<u>(29)</u> Importantly, outcomes were most favorable in patients who were taking all 3 classes of neurohormonal blockade therapy as compared to those taking medications from only one or 2 classes. Furthermore, another INTERMACS analysis found significantly higher rates of use of all neurohormonal blocking agents in patients who achieved complete recovery permitting device explantation.删除11:<u>(20)</u> Beta-blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists should also be started during the postoperative period due to their known beneficial effects on reverse remodeling and heart failure outcomes. Beta-blockers can be initiated once patients are stable off inotropes, although caution and slow titration should be employed in patients with poor right ventricular function. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists can be started once renal function has stabilized postoperatively. The use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in patients with advanced CKD and/or hyperkalemia is not recommended.\n\n【5】### Recommendations for neurohormonal blockade and the treatment of hypertension after LVAD implantation\n\n【6】**Class I**\n1. Pharmacotherapy with neurohormonal blocking agents (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, angiotensin receptor blocker-neprilysin inhibitors, beta-blocker, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist) is preferred for blood pressure management in durable LVAD patients.\n   Level of Evidence: B.\n\n【7】2. Early neurohormonal blockade should be started in all stable durable LVAD patients to promote ventricular reverse remodeling and myocardial recovery during LVAD support.\n   Level of Evidence: B.\n\n【8】**Class IIb**\n1. Use of hydralazine and isosorbide mononitrate or dinitrate may be considered as second line therapy for hypertension control. Data in LVAD patients are lacking and utilization can be extrapolated from studies in other heart failure populations and those with secondary pulmonary hypertension. These medications are limited by data and need for frequent administration due to short half-lives.\n   Level of Evidence: C.\n\n【9】2. Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, centrally acting alpha-2 receptors agonists (clonidine), and peripheral alpha-1 antagonists are third line agents in the management of hypertension in patients on MCS support. These agents should be used when first and second line agents are contraindicated or as supplemental therapy in individuals with resistant hypertension.\n   Level of Evidence: C.\n\n【10】Pulmonary vasodilators reduce RV afterload and are often used perioperatively. In patients with persistent RV failure, phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors or nitrates may be used as a transition from inhaled or intravenous pulmonary vasodilators such as inhaled nitric oxide or epoprostenol. Long-term use of phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors has been associated with reduced pulmonary vascular resistance in LVAD patients who are being evaluated for heart transplantation, although it is unclear whether the benefits observed could have been achieved with LVAD therapy alone.删除11:<u>(30)</u> Presently, individual and meta-analyses showing definitive benefit for phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor use after LVAD are lacking. Following extubation, careful monitoring of blood gases and patient mentation is necessary to avoid hypoventilation and hypoxia, which can trigger reactive pulmonary hypertension and RV dysfunction.

It can lead to the delay and dose reduction of follow-up treatment, induce febrile neutropenia and severe infection easily, and affect the prognosis of patients. It is of great significance to pay attention to the harm of neutropenia and to carry out risk assessment and standardized prevention and treatment. The pegylated recombinant human granulocyte colony–stimulating factor (PEG–rhG–CSF), as a long-acting preparation of recombinant human granulocyte colony–stimulating factor (rhG–CSF), can prevent and treat neutropenia and is convenient for clinical use. In order to promote clinical rational administration of drugs, based on evidence–based evidence, the consensus formulation team evaluated the efficacy and safety of its application during chemoradiotherapy for gynecological malignancies, defined the clinical pathway and administration mode of prevention and treatment, and then formed the Chinese expert consensus on the application of PEG–rhG–CSF during chemoradiotherapy for gynecological malignancies.\n\n【9】**Keywords:** Gynecologic malignancies; Chemoradiotherapy; Neutropenia; PEG–rhG–CSF\n\n【10】放化疗是妇科恶性肿瘤的重要治疗手段, 其最常见的血液学毒性为骨髓抑制, 尤其是中性粒细胞减少症(neutropenia), 严重者可引起中性粒细胞减少性发热(febrile neutropenia，FN)，甚至因发热伴严重感染、脓毒性休克, 乃至危及生命删除12:<u>[1–3]</u>, 导致后续治疗延\n\n【11】减少和减量发生, 进而降低临床疗效. 粒细胞集落刺激因子(granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, G-CSF)是预防和治疗中性粒细胞减少症的主要药物, 常用药物包括重组人粒细胞集落刺激因子(recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating fac-", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 1, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/妇科恶性肿瘤放化疗期间应用聚乙二醇化重组人粒细胞集落刺激因子（PEG-rhG-CSF）的中国专家共识（2023年版）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Carotid stenting or sacrifice with subsequent reconstruction should only be used in select circumstances and for patients with adequate collateral intracranial circulation.\n\n【2】The classic approach to patients with jugular paragangliomas requires overclosure of the ear canal and facial nerve mobilisation, resulting in facial paresis and substantial conductive hearing loss.

Balloon occlusion testing is recommended for lesions that encase the internal carotid artery and in patients for whom carotid artery sacrifice and reconstruction are a remote possibility.

An individualised approach is recommended, as is the use of an experienced interdisciplinary team that includes various surgical teams, endocrinology, radiation oncology, and speech and swallow therapy.

The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) ultimately recommended a set of 25 pathogenic variants, later revised to 23 pathogenic variants2 with an allele frequency of ≥0.1% in patients with CF in the US population to represent a minimum variant set for pan-ethnic carrier screening of individuals with no family history of CF. This minimum variant set (often referred to as the \"ACMG-23\") has remained unchanged since then, even as molecular diagnostic technologies and genetic knowledge have dramatically advanced.\n\n【1】The original recommendation left open the option for laboratories to offer an expanded CFTR variant set beyond the recommended set, and at the time, expanded variant sets were met with some controversy on the basis of the available technologies and limited phenotypic knowledge of rare variants.删除17:<u>3</u> However, several aspects have now evolved, including the widespread availability of cost-effective, high-throughput DNA sequencing, as well as more standardized variant classification and interpretation at both the general  and gene-specific  level. In 2020, the ACMG published an updated set of technical standards for CFTR variant testing, which recommended that laboratories could now use either targeted or comprehensive (ie, next-generation sequencing [NGS]) methods for testing and reaffirmed the original set of 23 variants as the minimum set for CF carrier screening;5 an overlapping workgroup subsequently convened to evaluate whether an update to the minimum CFTR variant set was necessary. In addition, in 2021, the ACMG published a new carrier screening clinical practice resource, which continued to recommend offering testing of CFTR (now along with many additional genes) to all pregnant patients, as well as those planning a pregnancy.删除17:<u>6</u>\n\n【2】The original ACMG-23 CF variant set was derived primarily from databases comprising individuals with well-characterized CF who were Non-Hispanic White or Ashkenazi Jewish, thereby allowing individuals from those ancestries to be more easily identified during carrier screening. However, given that CF has been reported across all races, ethnicities, and ancestries, improved equity in variant detection is both necessary and desirable. Self-reported ethnicity also has its own flaws,7,8 and this workgroup wanted to maintain a uniform recommended screening approach that would not be subject to this bias.\n\n【3】### Databases Considered for CFTR Variant Pathogenicity\n\n【4】**ClinVar**  is a public archive of genetic variants and associated phenotypes with occasional submitted supporting evidence. ClinVar accepts submissions from multiple sources including clinical testing laboratories, research laboratories, genetics clinics, patient registries, locus-specific databases, and expert panels. CFTR variants that are submitted to ClinVar may have been identified in patients with CF or a CFTR–related disorder (including CBAVD and pancreatitis). Importantly, they may have also been identified in unaffected individuals undergoing carrier screening or genetic testing for other indications. ClinVar aggregates the records submitted for each variant and reports the level of review supporting the assertion of clinical significance for each variant ranging from 0 to 4 stars, with 0 stars reflecting a variant assertion that was submitted by an individual without any supportive criteria provided and 4 stars reflecting a variant assertion that is present in a practice guideline. It is important to highlight that often the details regarding the phenotype of the associated individual may be limited or unavailable at the time a genetic variant is submitted. ClinVar does not curate information (ie, determine its validity) or modify classifications once they are submitted; it instead applies the star rating described above based on the data submitted and the source of the submission.\n\n【5】**The CFTR-France database**  is a national database focused on sharing genetic and phenotypic information for rare CFTR variants that have been identified by genetic testing laboratories in partnership with the French Clinical Registry of patients with CF.删除17:<u>9</u> The database was established in 2012 and includes approximately 900 different CFTR variants, which are retrospectively reported from 10 French diagnostic laboratories specializing in CFTR molecular testing. These variants were all identified in individuals with CF, CFTR-RDs, fetuses with echogenic bowel, newborns with pending or inconclusive diagnoses, and asymptomatic individuals with 2 CFTR variants in trans. CFTR-France categorizes variants as CF-causing, CFTR-RD–causing, non-disease–causing, variants of unknown clinical significance, and as variants of varying clinical consequence (VVCCs). VVCCs are either associated with CF or a CFTR-RD (when in trans with a known CF-causing variant), and this can vary within families and across populations.\n\n【6】**The Clinical and Functional Translation of CFTR (CFTR2) database**  currently includes a total of 485 CFTR variants with various annotations. This database includes phenotype and genotype information collected from approximately 89,000 individuals from national CF patient registries and large clinics from 43 different countries, and CFTR2 is actively trying to further increase the diversity of their collection. The CFTR2 website was established in 2012 and is generally updated on an annual basis. The disease liability of CFTR variants was evaluated using clinical, functional, and epidemiological data, using aggregate information on sweat chloride levels, lung function, pancreatic status, and Pseudomonas infection rates in patients harboring specific combinations of variants.

Palliation of symptoms throughout the disease course can be achieved with external-beam RT for distant metastases with localized symptoms, diffuse brain metastases, or bone metastases (bisphosphonate or denosumab therapy can be considered). For patients at risk of fracture in weight-bearing bone, orthopedic stabilization and palliative RT are recommended.\n\n【2】Denosumab or intravenous bisphosphonate therapy can be considered in patients with bone metastases to decrease bone complications (eg, decrease pain, delay skeletal-related events) based on clinical trial data.\n\n【3】For patients with recurrent and metastatic disease, the NCCN Guidelines recommend that histologic subtype should be determined before therapy so that the best treatment can be selected 删除9:<u>(see Systemic Therapy for Advanced or Metastatic Disease in the NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC)</u>. Biomarker testing for somatic, disease-associated variants/mutations (ie, oncogenic driver events) is recommended before starting therapy, if feasible, in eligible patients with metastatic NSCLC, because targeted therapy has been shown to decrease tumor burden, decrease symptoms, and dramatically improve the quality of life for patients with specific variants. If molecular testing results are pending and patients require an urgent start to therapy, clinicians can consider holding immunotherapy for one cycle (ie, just use platinum-based chemotherapy regimens). In the NCCN Guidelines, many targeted agents are recommended for first-line therapy in patients with specific actionable mutations such as afatinib, alectinib, brigatinib, capmatinib, ceritinib, crizotinib, dacomiitib (± trametinib), entrectinib, erlotinib, gefitinib, lorlatinib, osimertinib, pralsetinib, selpercatinib, and tepotinib 删除9:<u>(see Molecular and Biomarker-Driven Therapy for Advanced or Metastatic Disease in the algorithm)</u>.

In addition, emerging clinical data suggest the feasibility of definitive reirradiation of local recurrences within prior RT fields using highly conformal techniques, although this should be limited to highly selected cases in specialty centers with appropriate expertise because of the potential for severe toxicity with high cumulative radiation doses to critical structures.\n\n【6】In patients with NSCLC who have bone metastases, data suggest that denosumab increases median overall survival when compared with zoledronic acid (9.5 vs. 8 months).

Low or no heparin regimens are suggested for patients with significant adhesions and impaired coagulation status (COR: 2a, LOE: C-EO).\n\n【2】Although practice varies, most studies report a bolus of systemic unfractionated heparin ranging from 2000 to 5000 IU at cannulation, followed by maintenance of activated clotting time at 160 to 250 seconds or activated partial thromboplastin time at 1.5 to 2.0 times the control value. Because heparin-coated tubes are used uniformly, additional systemic applications of heparin can be omitted if clinically necessary, as shown in a prospective study reported by the Vienna group.\n\n【3】Going one step further, recent reports have described the intraoperative use of ECMO without therapeutic anticoagulation. This is a particular advantage for patients with adhesions and impaired coagulation status, although that advantage must be balanced against the risk of catastrophic support failure if the circuit clots. Using a circuit without anticoagulation should be considered only in highly selected circumstances, with a clear recovery plan in place should the system fail.\n\n【4】### 23. For patients bridged to lung transplantation with VV-ECMO, an intraoperative switch to VA-ECMO is preferred (COR: 2a, LOE: C-EO).\n\n【5】A special situation arises whenever patients are bridged with VV-ECMO to lung transplantation. Whereas in such cases VV-ECMO would guarantee sufficient intraoperative oxygenation, it has no effect on cardiac support or reperfusion injury of the first lung. VA-ECMO has the potential to reduce the cardiac output that otherwise goes through the first lung during implantation of the second lung, which provides optimal controlled reperfusion conditions. For this reason, conversion to VA-ECMO should be considered for patients who come bridged with VV-ECMO to transplantation.\n\n【6】### 24. Use of CPB is recommended for lung transplantation combined with intracardiac repair (COR: 1, LOE: B-NR).\n\n【7】The only absolute exception to the use of VA-ECMO is the need for any concomitant intracardiac procedures. In such a situation, CPB remains the recommended method of intraoperative support because of its additional possibility for use of a suction system with or without cardiac arrest. Another consideration is related to cases of anticipated massive blood loss. The potential benefit of CPB and the previously mentioned autotransfusion capacity must be weighed against the need for therapeutic anticoagulation and risk for coagulopathy.\n\n【8】### SECTION 3A: WHICH PATIENTS SHOULD BE MAINTAINED ON MCS AFTER LUNG TRANSPLANTATION?\n\n【9】Once lung transplantation is performed under mechanical support, the question of weaning from MCS (timing and the procedure itself) is raised. Indeed, the use of ECMO during lung transplantation has changed the approach of many institutions because it facilitates the opportunity to prolong support after the surgical procedure.\n\n【10】Maintaining support after lung transplantation with ECMO provides several advantages during the early postoperative period. It secures immediate hemodynamic and respiratory stability. It allows progressive initiation of reverse cardiac remodeling in patients with pulmonary hypertension. It also avoids deterioration of dysfunctional implanted lungs necessitating emergent secondary ECMO for severe graft failure. On the other hand, it carries additional risks of bleeding, vascular access complications, infection, venous and/or arterial thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism because of cannulation and anticoagulation. Finally, when CPB is used during the operation, the surgeon will need to transition to a different mode of support.\n\n【11】There are currently 2 situations in which MCS is maintained at the end of the lung transplantation procedure:\n\n【12】1. The MCS weaning attempt fails because of graft dysfunction as determined by objective criteria, including hemodynamic and respiratory factors.\n2. The patient is at high risk for severe PGD, and prophylactic MCS prolongation is chosen with the goal of improving the early postoperative phase.\n\n【13】ECMO has been proven efficient for the treatment of severe PGD. Continuing ECMO when dysfunction occurs during the procedure has been determined to achieve good results despite the morbidity of prolonged ECMO runs. The decision for prolonged ECMO rather than weaning has been evaluated for selected patients at risk for developing early graft dysfunction. These include patients with pulmonary hypertension, lobar lung transplantation, and interstitial lung disease with donor lung size discrepancy. In this population of patients, preemptive use of ECMO may achieve better survival results than on-demand emergent use.\n\n【14】### 25. When the indication for intraoperative ECMO is PGD, ECMO should be maintained post-transplantation until lung function recovers (COR: 1, LOE: B-NR).\n\n【15】The effectiveness of ECMO in supportive care for most cases of severe PGD has been demonstrated by several retrospective, single-center studies.

Rasburicase should be considered as initial treatment in patients with rapidly increasing blast counts, high uric acid, or evidence of impaired renal function.\n  - Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency should be checked when possible. However, it is not always feasible to do so rapidly. If there is high suspicion of G6PD deficiency, caution is necessary; rasburicase may be contraindicated.\n- Patients receiving HiDAC therapy (particularly those with impaired renal function), or intermediate-dose cytarabine in patients >60 years of age, are at risk for cerebellar toxicity. Neurologic assessment, including tests for nystagmus, slurred speech, and dysmetria, should be performed before each dose of cytarabine.\n  - In patients exhibiting rapidly rising creatinine due to tumor lysis, HiDAC should be discontinued until creatinine normalizes.\n  - In patients who develop cerebellar toxicity, cytarabine should be stopped. Rechallenge with HiDAC in future treatment cycles should not be attempted. [删除21:<u>^1</u>]\n  - Steroid (or equivalent) eye drops should be administered to both eyes 4 times daily for all patients undergoing HiDAC therapy until 24 hours post completion of cytarabine.\n- Growth factors may be considered as a part of supportive care for post-remission therapy. Note that such use may confound interpretation of the BM evaluation. Patients should be off granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or G-CSF for a minimum of 7 days before obtaining BM to document remission.\n- Decisions regarding use and choice of antibiotics should be made by the individual institutions based on the prevailing organisms and their drug resistance patterns. Posaconazole has been shown to significantly decrease fungal infections when compared to fluconazole and itraconazole.

Nasal Polyps  \nNasal polyps are benign growths of the nasal mucosa that are often associated with chronic rhinosinusitis. They can cause nasal obstruction, loss of smell, and secondary infections.\n\n【1】2. Etiology  \nThe etiology of nasal polyps is not fully understood, but they are thought to arise from chronic inflammation of the nasal and sinus mucosa. This inflammation can be triggered by various factors, including allergies, infections, and immune system disorders.\n\n【2】3. Pathophysiology  \nNasal polyps are characterized by an edematous stroma infiltrated with inflammatory cells, particularly eosinophils. The exact mechanism of polyp formation is complex and involves multiple pathways, including cytokine production, epithelial damage, and tissue remodeling.\n\n【3】4. Symptoms  \n- Nasal obstruction\n- Reduced or absent sense of smell (anosmia)\n- Rhinorrhea (runny nose)\n- Postnasal drip\n- Facial pain or pressure\n\n【4】5. Diagnosis  \nDiagnosis of nasal polyps is primarily based on clinical examination and history. Nasal endoscopy and imaging studies, such as CT scans, can help confirm the presence and extent of polyps.\n\n【5】6. Treatment  \nTreatment options for nasal polyps include:\n- **Medical Therapy**: Intranasal corticosteroids are the first-line treatment and can reduce the size of polyps and improve symptoms. Other medications, such as antihistamines and leukotriene inhibitors, may also be used.\n- **Surgical Treatment**: Endoscopic sinus surgery may be necessary for patients who do not respond to medical therapy. The goal of surgery is to remove the polyps and improve sinus drainage.\n\n【6】7. Prognosis  \nNasal polyps tend to recur, and ongoing medical therapy may be necessary to manage symptoms. Regular follow-up is important to monitor for recurrence and adjust treatment as needed.\n\n【7】8.

The presence of fluid, normal oedema or mature cartilaginous matrix can lead to these signal characteristics. Chondromas and intraosseous cysts often have a pathognomonic appearance on MR. The hyaline cartilage component of cartilaginous lesions is not evident on x-ray or CT, but on MR its high-water content will be low in signal on T1 and bright on T2W. Atypical, lipid poor haematomas will also demonstrate this signal pattern.\n\n【1】Low T1 Low T2  \nThese signal characteristics suggest calcification, fibrous tissue or blood products (hemosiderin).  \nOsteoblastic tumours include enostoses, osteoblastic metastatic disease, lymphoma, osteoblastic myeloma, osteoblastoma, osteoid osteoma and involuting non-osseifying fibroma. The calcified components of cartilaginous lesions (osteochondroma, chondrolastoma, chondrosarcoma and chordoma) will be low in signal on T1/T2.  \nFibrous dysplasia could demonstrate low signal on T1/T2, but it is often variable in signal. The ground glass appearance on CT is specific. Benign and malignant fibrous tumours may have components that are low in signal on T1/T2. Approximately 2/3 of giant cell tumours will demonstrate T2 hypo-intensity. The hemorrhagic component of any lesion (benign or malignant) will demonstrate low T1/T2 signal if it contains hemosiderin.\n\n【2】High T1 High T2  \nLipotamous lesions, methoglobinemic, proteinaceous fluid, melanin and haemangiomas are examples of entities in this category. Fatty lesions are discussed above. The majority of haemangiomas are lipid rich and will demonstrate T1 hyperintensity. Methoglobinemic and proteinaceous fluid are usually small components of other principal lesions. Although T1 hyperintensity is considered a classic finding, this pattern is present in only 24–47% of melanoma metastases.\n\n【3】Cartilage Lesions  \nThe imaging appearance of cartilage forming tumours depends on their composition.

Three distinct types of ABO incompatibility (ABOi) are described: major, minor, and bidirectional (i.e., both major and minor incompatibility present). Major ABO incompatibility refers to the presence of natural antibodies (isohemagglutinins) in the recipient against donor A and/or B blood group antigens, that may cause acute hemolysis of the red blood cells (RBCs) present in infused hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) products. HPC products collected by apheresis, HPC(A), contain a small volume of RBCs (2%-5% hematocrit), typically measuring <20 mL; therefore, acute hemolysis is uncommon and does not generally require intervention. By comparison, bone marrow HPC products, HPC(M), contain 25% to 35% RBCs by volume, leading to a higher risk of acute, clinically significant hemolysis. Cord blood HPC products typically contain insufficient amounts of intact RBCs to induce hemolysis. After major ABO incompatible transplant, RBC engraftment may be delayed in up to 20% to 30% of cases, and 8% to 26% of patients develop pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) due to persistence of isohemagglutinins against donor-type erythroid precursors. Pre-transplant isohemagglutinin reduction is typically considered when recipient isohemagglutinin titer exceeds 20 mL (adult recipient). An additional clinically significant risk with minor ABO incompatibility is the development of a delayed, severe, and potentially fatal alloimmune hemolysis, termed passenger lymphocyte syndrome (PLS). PLS typically occurs at 7 to 10 days post-transplant and is caused by donor B lymphocytes that mount an allo-antibody response against host A or B antigens.\n\n【6】## Current management/treatment\nIn major ABO incompatibility, acute hemolysis can be avoided by removing RBCs from the HPC product through automated RBC depletion, or by reducing recipient isohemagglutinin titers. RBC depletion, which may incur loss of HPCs, is based on institutional guidelines which usually limit the total infusion of fresh donor RBCs to 10-40 mL. Recipient isohemagglutinin reduction is performed largely by TPE. IA is also available in some centers. In some European transplant centers, isohemagglutinin titer reduction may be accomplished by slowly infusing donor-type RBCs to adsorb antibodies in vivo. Selective ABO immunoadsorption has also been reported, though with clear differences in clinical outcomes 删除19:<u>(Crysandt, 2021)</u>. Post-transplant PRCA in the setting of major ABO incompatibility usually resolves with early withdrawal of immunosuppression (cyclosporine) and supportive transfusion. Persistent cases may respond to exogenous erythropoietin, rituximab, donor lymphocyte infusions, eltrombopag 删除19:<u>(Busca, 2018)</u>, and/or TPE.\n\n【7】In minor ABO incompatible transplants with donor isoagglutinin titer >128 and HPC plasma volume >200 mL, product plasma reduction is performed to prevent acute recipient hemolysis. However, plasma reduction does not reduce the B lymphocyte content nor the incidence of PLS. PLS is unpredictable and managed expectantly with aggressive transfusions. Pre-transplant RBC exchange using group-O RBCs to reduce the volume of donor-antibody incompatible RBCs has been reported, with reduced severe hemolysis and transplant-related mortality compared to historical controls 删除19:<u>(Worel, 2007)</u>. A separate single-center study of day +4 RBC exchange in PLS found no study significant improved outcomes for select patients at higher risk of hemolysis 删除19:<u>(Cunrad, 2014)</u>. PLS has been anecdotally treated with TPE to rapidly reduce isoagglutinin titer.\n\n【8】## Rationale for therapeutic apheresis\nFor major ABO incompatible transplants, TPE is performed to reduce the recipient isohemagglutinin titer prior to HPC(A) product infusion and can be used as an alternative to RBC depletion of the product. TPE may also improve post-transplant PRCA by removing persistent recipient isohemagglutinins. ABO-specific immunoadsorption columns have also been used successfully in a small CS 删除19:<u>(Handisutya, 2020)</u>.\n\n【9】For minor ABO incompatible transplants, prophylactic RBC exchange can effectively reduce the number of host RBCs that would be the target of the PLS. The published experience suggests that a pretransplant residual recipient RBC population ≤35% can significantly mitigate delayed hemolysis in high-risk patients. Smaller studies, however, have not demonstrated clear benefit of RBC exchange in reducing hemolysis when performed following infusion of the HPC product.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 175, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/2023 ASFA指南：治疗性单采术的临床应用（第9版）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

In LMIC settings, there may be limited health system capacity to make maternal and newborn health services more men-friendly by investing in health worker training, changing service delivery, changing physical spaces, or offering new services. This may make men feel unwelcome and discouraged from participating.\n\n【1】Established gender norms that are supportive of women, and not men, being responsible for maternal and newborn health discourage some women and men from participating in interventions – either due to their own internalized norms, health workers’ norms and attitudes, or pressure from peers, family and community members.

When subgroup differences were identified, the results were reported separately according to the different levels of that factor.\n\n【1】The GRADE approach was used to assess the certainty (very low, low, moderate, and high) of the evidence. We also systematically reviewed the evidence about patient values and preferences, cost-effectiveness, health equity, acceptability, and feasibility.

The method involves the repeated administration of questionnaires, where each statement can be evaluated through a point Likert scale ranging from 1 to 5 (1, extremely disagree; 2, disagree; 3, agree; 4, mostly agree; and 5, extremely agree). Results are expressed as a percentage of respondents who scored each item as 2 or 1 (disagreement) or 3, 4 or 5 (agreement). As consensus is reached if the percentage of agreement is greater than 66%. No consensus is reached when the sum of the scores for a negative consensus (1 and 2) or a positive consensus (3, 4 and 5) is <66%.\n\n【3】### Delphi process\n\n【4】Eight European countries were involved in the project which took place between October 2020 and January 2021. The survey was developed by a board of movement disorders specialists, who represent expertise in the treatment of PD in their respective countries. After reviewing the published literature on safinamide, the Board met to discuss the main years of interest and identified six major topics: the role of glutamate in D, introduction to fluctuations, efficacy of safinamide on motor symptoms, motor complications and NMS, Quality of Life, safety of safinamide and Target Population. Each topic was subdivided in a variable number of statements corresponding to items where greater need of clarification and debate existed. The Board was also asked to identify 24 colleagues for each board member who served as external impartial validators and judged clarity and reliability of the statements. The survey was then distributed via an online platform to 119 panelists who met the following. PD/movement disorders specialists with at least five years’ experience and using safinamide in their clinical practice. The vote was anonymous, and no compensation was given to any of the identified voters.\n\n【5】The study does not report on, or involve the use of any human or animal data or tissue, and does contain data from any individual person, and thus, we no need for ethical approval, nor prior approval of the study protocol. Activities performed in the Delphi survey were refined into the study’s objectives and the possibility of publishing the results in a peer-reviewed article. The participants were voluntary. They expressed their consent to participate in the survey after logging into the secure online survey platform via credentials, by actively clicking on the appropriate box.\n\n【6】## Members of the validation panel\n\n【7】Valentina Leta (UK), Jasmin Rahimi (Austria), Katarina Rukavina (UK), Daniele Urso (UK)\n\n【8】### Panelists\n\n【9】- Araceli Alonso (Spain), Luca Batzu (UK), Anna Rita Bentivoglio (Italy), Fip Bergquist (Sweden), Maria Blazquez Estrada (Spain), Alexandra Boogers (Belgium), Christof Brücke Brücke (Austria), Nuria Caballol Pons (Spain), Paolo Calabresi (Italy), Camille Carli (UK), Burhaneddin Canan (Germany), Roberto Ciaravalos (Italy), Roberto Cilia (Italy), Carlo Colosimo (Italy), Badu Constantinsson (Sweden), Pietro Cortelli (Italy), David Crosiers (Belgium), Beatriz De La Casa Fages (Spain), Gino De La Villehuche (Belgium), Mieke De Beweire (Belgium), Woitalla Dirk (Germany), Athin Djamshidian (Austria), Laurens Dobbeleir (Belgium), Christian Drechsel (Germany), Jose Egberch (Germany), Karla Eggert (Germany), Reinhard Ehret (Germany), Roberto Eleopra (Italy), Roberto Erro (Italy), Francisco Escamilla Sevilla (Spain), Giovanni Fabiani (Italy), Thomas Falk (Austria), Pieter Francois (Germany), Rocio Garcia-Ramos (Spain), Ramsay Gehradi (Austria), Juan Carlos Gomez Estaen (Spain), Azo'e Nazuez Gonzalez Hernandez (Spain), Victoria Haunton (UK), Jorit Hoff (Netherlands), Jagdish Jamnar Jagdish (UK), Kobusah Jan Krammer (Austria), Johannes Kruse (Germany), Job Melgarion (UK), Alessio Landolini (Sweden), Miller Leson (Germany), Johanes Metta (UK), Ines Legarda (Spain), Johan Lukk (Sweden), Leonardo Lopianod (Italy), Michael Lorrian (Germany), Loukian (Spain), Martinie Manganos (Germany), Juan Carlos Martinez Castrillo (Spain), Pablo Mr (Spain), Thomas Miller (Germany), Nina Ed Kippel (Belgium), Susanna Norbert (Germany), Dag Nyholm (Sweden), May on (Belgium), Bernard Morens Patrick (Belgium), Manuelle Pfister (Italy), Andrea Piloto (Italy), Jonathan Potier-Gerger (Germany), Rocco Quadalte (Italy), Silvia Ramis Town, Paula Starr (UK), Heinz Rechmann (Germany), Roberto Scabeca (Italy), Pilar Schoeniker (Spain), Diego Santos Garcia (Spain), Klaus Segol (Austria), Angel Sear (Spain), Nishantha Silva (UK), Adolfo Sierra (UK), John Joseph Steff (Italy), Anastasopoul (Italy), Klonis Dray (Spain), Br betrugner Hernandez, Alessandro Tapias (Italy), Jose Tarragon Monti (Germany), Lars Tomen (Germany), Volker Trajer (Germany), Hidehiko Tsuda (Belgium), Pablo Untitti (Spain), Lars Verboken Koppn (Belgium), Lionel Wichtin (Austria), Perez Winicker (Spain), Vittorio Witter (Spain), Robin Volante (Germany), and Jose Maria Yabar Via.\n\n【10】## Reporting summary\n\n【11】Further information on research design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 7, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/欧洲沙芬酰胺在帕金森病治疗中的应用共识（2022）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Their primary mode of action is venous dilation resulting in decreased preload, and they affect afterload to a lesser extent. Nitroglycerin is used in emergencies to lower blood pressure and to relieve angina, whereas longer-acting agents are often used for hypertension and heart failure management.\n\n【4】There are limited studies to support continuing nitrates on the day of surgery. One study reported that continuation of nitrates may be protective. A second study suggested evidence of less ischemia with nitrate use. We were unable to identify any studies investigating potential negative consequences of withholding nitrates before noncardiac surgery or large randomized controlled studies informing preoperative nitridolator management. It seems reasonable to continue this class of medications in patients without significant hypotension given their role in patients with heart disease.\n\n【5】**Consensus recommendation for nitridolators:** Consensus was achieved that nitridolators should be CONTINUED on the morning of surgery.\n\n【6】**Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors**\n\n【7】Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors are nonadrenergic noncholinergic drugs with inotropic and vasodilatory actions. Their primary effect is to increase the local availability of endogenous NO. These drugs are used to treat PAH (sildenafil and tadalafil), erectile dysfunction, benign prostatic hyperplasia, peripheral arterial disease, and Raynaud phenomenon (off-label use). Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors have synergistic effects with many vasodilator drugs and are known to decrease blood pressure levels. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy has been reported with their use.\n\n【8】Given the overwhelming benefit of continuing PAH treatment preoperatively, continuation of PDE5 inhibitors in the perioperative period outweighs the risk of hypotension and possible anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. In contrast, when prescribed for erectile dysfunction, it is prudent to discontinue PDE5 inhibitors. Tadalafil has a long half-life, and therefore discontinuation before the day of surgery is necessary to decrease the effects on blood pressure levels.\n\n【9】**Consensus recommendation for PDE5 inhibitors:** Consensus was achieved that PDE5 inhibitors should be CONTINUED on the morning of surgery if prescribed for PAH. Consensus was achieved to HOLD PDE5 inhibitors used for erectile dysfunction at least 24 hours before surgery.\n\n【10】**Class III Antiarrhythmic Agents (Potassium-Channel Blockers)**\n\n【11】Class III antiarrhythmic agents bind to and block potassium channels that are responsible for phase 3 repolarization. This leads to an increase in action potential duration in the effective refractory period and prevents reentry tachycardias. These drugs are indicated for the treatment of atrial fibrillation and flutter (amiodarone, dronedarone, sotalol, ibutilide, and dofetilide) or ventricular tachycardia (sotalol, bretylium, and amiodarone). Ibutilide and bretylium are available only in intravenous formulations to acutely treat arrhythmias. Class III antiarrhythmic agents are both antiarrhythmogenic and proarrhythmogenic because of their potential to increase the corrected QT (QTc) interval and torsades de pointes.

These superficial LMS are distinct from LMS of the deep soft tissues. Leiomyosarcomas are typically localized at the lower extremities, trunk or capillitium, and present as painful, erythematous to brownish nodules. Diagnosis is made by histopathology. The treatment of choice for primary LMS is complete (R0) microscopically controlled excision, with safety margins of 1 cm in dermal LMS, and 2 cm in subcutaneous LMS, if possible. Non-resectable or metastatic LMS require individual treatment decisions. After R0 resection with 1 cm safety margin, the local recurrence rate of dermal LMS is very low, and metastasis is very rare. Subcutaneous LMS, very large, or incompletely excised LMS recur and metastasize more frequently. For this reason, clinical follow-up examinations are recommended every six months for cutaneous LMS, and every three months for subcutaneous LMS within the first two years (in subcutaneous LMS including locoregional lymph node sonography). Imaging such as CT/MRI is indicated only in primary tumors with special features, recurrences, or already metastasized tumors.\n\n【3】## EPIDEMIOLOGY, ETIOPATHOGENESIS, AND CLINICAL APPEARANCE\nPrimary superficial leiomyosarcoma (LMS) is a rare tumor.

Statements without grading were approved by consensus and considered as standard routine clinical practice by the experts.\n\n【5】### 1.4.7. Follow-up, long-term implications and survivorship\n\n【6】Follow-up of high-grade bone sarcomas should include clinical and radiological assessments primarily directed to the sites of potential relapse (lungs primarily, and bones) due to the higher risk of recurrence. A recent comparative follow-up scheme was published, showing different approaches in published guidelines. The recommended tests are generally based on clinical practice, as no high-level evidence is available. The imaging techniques (chest X-ray or CT scan) should be performed every 3 months for the first 2 years, every 6 months up to 5 years, and annually thereafter. For patients with metastases at diagnosis, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be part of follow-up to detect bone metastases. For primary pelvic sarcomas, because of the limited access of X-ray to soft tissues in the pelvic area, MRI is the preferred method of follow-up. In contrast, low-grade tumours have a reduced frequency of follow-up, but these usually require only clinical and local radiology assessment. Other imaging modalities such as PET-CT may be complementary to other techniques as MRI, CT scan or even bone scintigraphy. Results from metallic implants could bias ultrasound interpretations and could require specific MRI sequences or optimization of CT protocol. A recommended follow-up policy after treatment completion is different between low-grade and high-grade bone sarcoma. For high-grade tumours, follow-up every 3–4 months for the first 2–3 years, then every 6 months up to fifth year and then annually up to the tenth year are recommended. For low-grade tumours, visits every 6 months for 2-5 years and annually thereafter are recommended. In E5, bone scintigraphy can be used especially in addition to X-ray for a more complete bone assessment; PET/CT or whole-body MRI are other potential options. Investigations for late effects should be pursued beyond long-term (more than 10 years) after treatment completion (LVEF every 2 years for patients who received doxorubicin, creatinine level assessment on a yearly basis) 删除19:<u>(Henson et al., 2016)</u>.\n\n【7】### 2. Methodology\n\n【8】The Sarcoma European Latin American Network (SELNET), aims to improve clinical outcome in sarcoma care, with a special focus in Latin-American countries.\n\n【9】These Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) have been agreed by a multidisciplinary group of the SELNET consortium, with representatives of all partner entities and the patient’s advocacy groups (SPA). The CPG are methodically generated to offer the best standard approach, based on the highest levels of evidence for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up in bone sarcoma in the Latin-American context. The current SELNET consortium CPG should be ideally corroborated and endorsed at a national level.

Most will be asymptomatic, or one side will be symptomatic and the other asymptomatic. It is extremely rare for both stenoses to be simultaneously symptomatic. Some have suggested that synchronous bilateral CEAs should be considered, but the most dangerous complication is injury to both RLNs or hypoglossal nerves, which can be fatal.

IGTA is a form of “local therapy” or “local ablative therapy.”\n- IGTA is a lung parenchymal sparing technique with at most a temporary decrement in FEV1 and DLCO, which is statistically indistinguishable from baseline after recovery.\n\n【2】### Evaluation\n- IGTA may be considered for those patients who are deemed “high risk”—those with tumors that are for the most part surgically resectable but rendered medically inoperable due to comorbidities. In cases where IGTA is considered for high-risk or borderline operable patients, a multidisciplinary evaluation is recommended.\n- IGTA has been successfully accomplished in patients considered “high risk,” objectively defined with a single major and/or two or more minor criteria. Major criteria included an FEV1 or DLCO ≤50%, and minor criteria included a less depressed FEV1 or DLCO between 51%–60%, age ≥75 years, pulmonary hypertension, LVEF ≤40%, resting or exercise PaO2 ≤55 mmHg, and/or PCO2 >45 mmHg.\n- If an interventional radiologist or center is uncertain about the feasibility or safety of IGTA or the use of IGTA for radiation failure, consider obtaining an additional interventional radiology opinion from a high-volume specialized center.\n\n【3】### Ablation\n- Each energy modality has advantages and disadvantages. Determination of energy modality to be used for ablation should take into consideration the size and location of the target tumor, risk of complication, as well as local expertise and/or operator familiarity.\n\n【4】### Ablation for NSCLC\n- IGTA is an option for the management of NSCLC lesions ≤3 cm. Ablation for NSCLC lesions >3 cm may be associated with higher rates of local recurrence and complications.\n- There is evidence on the use of IGTA for selected patients with Stage I–IIA NSCLC, those who present with multiple lung cancers, or those who present with locoregional recurrence of symptomatic local thoracic disease.\n- Like surgery, pneumothorax may occur after IGTA, particularly if multiple lesions are treated in a single session. Pneumothorax has been reported in 18.7%–45.7% of IGTA cases. Self-limited pneumothorax, not requiring chest tube placement, is an expected event and not considered a complication unless escalation of care is required. In 20.7% of IGTA cases, chest tube insertion may be required.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 75, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/（2023.V3）NCCN临床实践指南：非小细胞肺癌-.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Introduction and epidemiology\n\n【1】Bone sarcomas constitute a heterogeneous group of rare neoplasms, representing less than 0.2% of all malignant tumours in Europe 删除19:<u>(Stiller et al., 2013)</u>, and approximately 10% of all sarcomas. The estimated incidence in Europe is of 0.2–0.3 new cases/100.000 inhabitants/year 删除19:<u>(Berner et al., 2015; Valery et al., 2015; Whelan et al., 2012)</u>, with a similar incidence in other regions 删除19:<u>(Mirabello et al., 2009; Moreno et al., 2017)</u>. Osteosarcoma (OS) and Ewing sarcoma (ES) have a higher incidence in adolescents and young adults, with male predominance 删除19:<u>(Jawad et al., 2009; Mirabello et al., 2009)</u>. In contrast, chondroma and chondrosarcoma are more frequent in older population 删除19:<u>(Valery et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2016)</u>.\n\n【2】## 1.1. General statements\n\n【3】- Management of bone sarcoma should be carried out within multidisciplinary reference centers for sarcoma or expert networks [III, A]. Multidisciplinary tumor boards (MDTB) should include at least the following specialties: medical oncology, paediatrics (if paediatric patients are discussed), radiology, surgery, pathology and radiation oncology.\n- An MDTB cannot be defined only by the volume of patients followed, but also by the periodicity of meeting (weekly MDTB is recommended), its contribution to clinical trials and scientific production, its participation in national or international guidelines. These MDTB ideally should be periodically audited, to ensure quality.\n- All diagnostic procedures and therapeutic decisions should be discussed within a MDTB 删除19:<u>(Andreou et al., 2011; Blay et al., 2017; Mankin et al., 1982)</u>.\n- The diagnosis procedures are identical for all bone sarcomas .\n- Discussion of fertility preservation strategies is strongly advised in younger patients when systemic treatment is considered for localized disease, in patients with osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma 删除19:<u>(Casali et al., 2018b)</u>.\n- Several reports indicate better clinical results and better cost-effectiveness if sarcoma or presumptive sarcoma patients are managed within MDTB [III, A] 删除19:<u>(Blay et al., 2019)</u>.\n\n【4】## 1.2. Diagnosis and pathology/molecular biology\n\n【5】The recommended imaging tests upon suspicion of bone tumour is x-ray of affected extremities and MRI of the entire compartment and nearby joints; a CT scan should be performed in case of a suspected bone sarcoma of the trunk and head and neck [III, A] 删除19:<u>(Meyer et al., 2008)</u>. Preoperative biopsy is strongly recommended. Core-needle is preferred to incisional biopsy, but both are valid when performed by an expert team [III, A] 删除19:<u>(Andreou et al., 2011; Blay et al., 2017; Casali et al., 2018)</u>, aiming to obtain enough material for a correct diagnosis. A fine needle aspirate is generally inadequate to make a sarcoma diagnosis, though it can be useful in confirming recurrence or metastasis. Central pathology review, with molecular characterization as appropriate according to pathologist and available resources (for example Ewing sarcoma is suspected), is strongly recommended [III, A] 删除19:<u>(Abdul-Karim et al., 2004; Board; Casali et al., 2018)</u>.\n\n【6】## 1.3. Staging and risk assessment\n\n【7】The initial staging to rule out distant metastasis requires chest CT scan ± abdominal and pelvic CT scan [III, A] 删除19:<u>(Picci et al., 2001)</u>. Whole-body FDG-PET or whole-body MRI may be useful for staging purposes if available [III, A] 删除19:<u>(Bajaj et al., 2020; Buchbender et al., 2012; Volker et al., 2007)</u>. As an alternative, for osteosarcoma and ES staging, bone scintigraphy is adequate, if PET/CT or whole-body MRI are not available to exclude bone involvement [III, A] 删除19:<u>(Hughes et al., 2016)</u>. Iliac bone marrow biopsy is not currently a universally accepted standard work-up in Ewing sarcoma, as the percentage of bone involvement exclusively detected by bone marrow biopsy is extremely low (< 0.5%) 删除19:<u>(Cesari et al., 2019)</u>.\n\n【8】Adverse prognostic factors for localized (conventional) osteosarcoma include: large tumour size (different cut-offs used by larger than one third of the whole dimension of bone; or 15 cm; or 150 ml if studies considering volume), tumor site (axial or proximal limbs was worse), elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (AP) or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and older age (older than 15 years, but also older than 40 years) 删除19:<u>(Basile et al., 2020; Bielack et al., 2002; Bramer et al., 2009; Picci et al., 1994)</u>. Another independent relevant prognostic factor is the poor histological response (≥10% viable tumour cells) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy 删除19:<u>(Picci et al., 1994)</u>. As expected, metastatic spread is a relevant prognostic factor in osteosarcoma.\n\n【9】Standard staging classification system is not widely accepted among physicians treating Ewing sarcoma 删除19:<u>(Finnemore et al., 1980; Hecht et al., 2006; JD and MK, 2016)</u>. A pragmatical risk-based approach to allocate different treatments in Ewing sarcoma is based on volume of primary tumour (< 200 ml vs ≥ 200 ml), localized vs metastatic disease (within this latter exclusive lung vs extrapulmonary metastasis) and good or poor histological response to induction chemotherapy (\\(\\geq\\) 10% viable tumor cells constituted poor response) (Bacci et al., 删除13:<u>2004, 2006</u>; Cotterill et al., 2000; Deleley et al., 2006; Leavey and Collier, 2008; Nesbit et al., 1990; Paulussen et al., 2008; Schuck et al., 2003; van et al., 2010).\n\n【10】![Fig. 1.

Clinicians can then review the food record to estimate the patients average daily caloric intake, macronutrient intake, and the quality of the diet (for example daily servings of fruits and vegetables). This information should be used to create individualized diet goals; for example, increasing fruit and vegetables intake from 3 to 4 servings per day, reducing the number of sugar sweetened beverages (juice, soda) consumed from 3 to 1 per day, reducing the consumption of fast food or highly processed foods to 1 time per week, or reducing overall energy (calorie) intake. Additionally, the dietary record can be used to identify food aversions and food selectivity, such as rejecting certain foods based on color or consuming only certain textures, which can lead to nutritional deficiencies 删除11:<u>(47)</u>.\n\n【2】Assessment of physical activity can be done with self-reported questionnaires when a patient comes into the clinic or having the youth with DS wear a physical activity tracker. There are pros and cons to each method. While the use of a questionnaires is easy, can be done in clinic, and is inexpensive, the accuracy of these questionnaires in youth with DS is unknown. Youth are less likely to make accurate self-report assessments due to developmental differences, especially in the ability to perform detailed recall and understand concepts regarding physical activity duration and intensity 删除11:<u>(48)</u>. This may be amplified in youth with DS who may have difficulties with cognitive functioning, memory, and attention. Recently, the American Academy of Pediatrics opted to not recommend a specific physical activity assessment tool because of limitations to existing questionnaires 删除11:<u>(49)</u>.\n\n【3】Conversely, physical activity trackers have grown in popularity; these include simple pedometers as well as wrist-worn physical activity trackers. Pedometers provide step-counts as a quantity of physical activity and can often be purchased at a low-cost; however, pedometers do not provide information regarding time or intensity of physical activity, and it may be difficult to obtain long-term data as most pedometers can only store 1–7 days of activity. Recently, wrist-worn physical activity trackers have become popular. These devices often combine an accelerometer to measure minutes of physical activity and steps as well as a heart rate monitor to measure physical activity intensity. These devices often sync with an app on a smart phone so the user can see physical activity data, including daily minutes of physical activity, steps, resting heart rate, and heart rate during exercise. These data can then be shared with the medical team of youth with DS. However, these trackers can be costly, and the heart rate and intensity data provided by the devices may not be", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 5, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/2023 专家建议：青少年唐氏综合征的体重管理.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

In a retrospective cohort study examining 528 individuals who met criteria for serrated polyposis, 82% had colorectal adenomas, 16% had a personal history of CRC, and 37% had a family history of CRC. Another retrospective analysis of 64 patients with serrated polyposis showed an SIR of 18.72 (95% CI, 6.87–40.74) for CRC. Several studies have also observed a link between patients previously treated for Hodgkin lymphoma and other childhood or young adult cancers and the development of SPS.\n\n【2】For the majority of patients with SPS, no causative gene is identifiable. A 2022 study including 173 patients diagnosed with SPS who underwent germline genetic testing with a hereditary CRC panel showed that a P/LP variant was detected in 9.6%. P/LP variants detected included MUTYH (n = 2), SMAD4 (n = 1), CHEK2 (n = 2), POLD1 (n = 1), and RNF43 (n = 1). Whole exome sequencing of 20 unrelated individuals with multiple sessile serrated adenomas (16 who fulfilled WHO criteria of SPS) led to the identification of nonsense variants in RNF43 in two individuals. The RNF43 variants were associated with multiple serrated polyps (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 0.9–8.9; P = .04). One study identified a germline RNF43 P/LP variant in 1 out of 4 families with serrated polyposis, but more research is needed to understand prevalence of RNF43 P/LP variants in patients with SPS. Notably, some patients with a diagnosis of MYH-associated polyposis may have a phenotype also meeting criteria for SPS. As such, patients meeting criteria with SPS and some adenomas may benefit from genetic evaluation to exclude presence of biallelic MYH P/LP variants, though data on yield of genetic testing for patients with SPS are still emerging 删除9:<u>(see POLYP-1 in the algorithm)</u>.\n\n【3】### Treatment of Serrated Polyposis (SPS-1)\nHigh-quality colonoscopy with polypectomy is recommended for all polyps ≥5 mm, every 1 to 3 years depending on size and number of polyps, consistent with recommendations by the American College of Gastroenterology.It may not always be possible to remove all polyps. Colonoscopic surveillance with consideration of surgical referral is recommended if colonoscopic treatment and/or surveillance is inadequate or if high-grade dysplasia occurs.\n\n【4】### Treatment of First-Degree Relatives (SPS-1)\nThe risk for CRC is elevated in first-degree relatives of individuals with SPS. One study that compared CRC incidence in 347 first-degree relatives of patients with SPS to that in the general population (Eindhoven Cancer Registry) found 27 cases compared to an expected 5 cases (rate ratio [RR], 5.4; 95% CI, 3.7–7.8; P < .001). In addition, this study found that four first-degree relatives satisfied the criteria for SPS (projected RR, 39; 95% CI, 13–121), suggesting a hereditary basis in some cases. Another multinational retrospective study found a similar increase in risk for CRC in both first- and second-degree relatives of patients with SPS. In addition, an increased risk for pancreatic cancer was observed. In a prospective study, 76% of first-degree relatives of patients with SPS were found to have SPS at colonoscopy.\n\n【5】The panel considers it reasonable to screen first-degree relatives at the youngest age of onset of SPS diagnosis, 10 years earlier than earliest diagnosis with CRC in the family, or by age 40 years, whichever is earliest. Subsequent screening is per colonoscopic findings or every 5 years if no polyps are found.\n\n【6】### Multi-Gene Testing (GENE-1)\nNGS allows for the sequencing of multiple genes simultaneously. This is referred to as multi-gene testing. The introduction of multi-gene testing for hereditary forms of cancer has rapidly altered the clinical approach to testing at-risk patients and their families. Multi-gene testing simultaneously analyzes a set of genes that are associated with a specific family cancer phenotype or multiple phenotypes.

These nociceptive nerve fibers are the presumptive primary pain generators, and histological images denote the proliferation of nerve fibers at the endplates in the presence of disc degeneration.\n\n【1】The highly innervated vertebral endplates can become susceptible to progressive degeneration from physiological aging, calcifications, traumatic injuries, intraosseous edema, and localized inflammation . Insults to the vertebral endplates result in the secretion of proinflammatory and neurogenic factors, causing proliferation of basivertebral nerves at the endplate, thus increasing sensitivity to pain from compressive forces. A protein arrays study has found increased levels of 20 inflammatory factors, with many having nociceptive effects within the damaged intravertebral discs. This induces neuronal plasticity and neo-innervation. These factors can then further proliferate endplate damage by increasing the diffusion between the vertebral body and disc leading to further degradation, hence worsening vertebrogenic pain.\n\n【2】Dr. Modic, a radiologist, was the first physician to publish a classification of the degenerative changes of the endplate based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with three types highlighting the evolutionary stages. Type 1 denotes acute degeneration commonly associated with pain as fibrovacular changes occur within the subchondral bone marrow resulting in edema and inflammation. On MRI, the endplates are hypointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2-weight images. Type 2 classifies subacute and chronic changes as fatty bone marrow infiltration occurs within the vertebral body with the MRI demonstrating hyperintense signals on both T1 and T2 weighted images. The progression of chronic changes may lead to bony sclerosis at the endplates, observed within the Type 3 Modic classification. These changes are visible on MRI as hypointense on T1/T2. A recently proposed scoring system (“Mo-di-disc”) including Modic changes, fatty infiltration in the paraspinal muscles and disc degeneration was found to be the most significant predictor for patients with more intensive low back pain. Yet, although Modic type 1 and 2 changes are highly specific for low back pain, MRI findings should always be correlated with clinical findings. Furthermore, the advent of MRI modalities with ultra high field T1/T2 may finally enhance the sensitivity of perceived Modic signal changes in intravertebral translation lines of the endplates, thus accurately identifying the vertebrogenic pathology . Recently, it has been proposed that changes in disc degeneration through decades of human life along with Modic changes have specific gear-up periods in human life associated with disc degeneration, particularly increasing at the end of the 2nd decade and at the beginning of the 3rd decade, while Modic changes are more common at the end of the 4th and at the beginning of the 5th decade. Furthermore, the onset of severe intervertebral disc degeneration has been documented to be ahead of endplate changes \n\n【3】删除图片描述:<u>![](1_0.png)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 2, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/2022+ASPN+最佳实践指南：椎基底神经消融治疗椎源性疼痛.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

It can improve pain relief and the ability to perform everyday activities (functional state), reduce sick leave and enable people to continue or return to work.\n\n【2】**Precautions**\nPatients can be advised to reduce, alter or modify certain painful activities (for example, lifting) for a few days, as certain activities may exacerbate back pain. Patients need to be reassured that an exacerbation of pain is not an indication of damage, and fluctuations in pain can be expected during recovery from acute low back pain. Patients should feel confident to continue or get back to their normal everyday activities in days to weeks.\n\n【3】**Description**\nStaying active means continuing with normal daily activities as much as possible, including going to work. It also means trying to reduce long periods of inactivity. No specific exercise(s) is needed at this stage.\n\n【4】People with low back pain who remain active, even when in pain, do better in the long term.

Also, the primary outcome of the open-label study was a safety endpoint and data on seizure-free days had not been collected. However, it acknowledged that the 3-year data from the extension study suggested ongoing seizure control in people who continued treatment. Clinical experts confirmed that, based on their experience of people with refractory epilepsy taking cannabidiol, the treatment effect did not wane over time. The committee recalled that both seizure freedom and reducing the number of seizures are important outcomes to patients and their families 删除9:<u>(see section 3.2)</u>. However, it noted that GWCARE6 did not show an association between reducing seizure frequency and improving quality of life (as assessed by the Quality of Life in Childhood Epilepsy [QOLCE] and Quality of Life in Epilepsy [QOLIE]-31-P questionnaires). However, the clinical experts suggested this was because the 16-week follow-up period in GWCARE6 was insufficient to fully capture the benefits of reducing or stopping seizures on daily activities and mental health. They explained that, in their experience, seizure reduction did align with improved quality of life. The committee remained concerned that, by pooling usual care treatments, cannabidiol had not been compared with individual antiseizure medications. However, it concluded cannabidiol plus usual care likely reduces seizure frequency and, at least in the short term, increases the number of seizure-free days compared with usual care alone.\n\n【1】### Adverse events\n\n【2】#### Cannabidiol is associated with adverse events that are manageable, but monitoring and adjustment of concurrent medications may be needed\n\n【3】3.6 GWPCare6 showed that a large proportion of patients having cannabidiol had adverse events.

The guideline committee concluded that several radiological features warrant reiteration in the current guideline for emphasis, and they reconsidered the categories of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) patterns.\n\n【3】#### Spectrum of HRCT Findings in IPF\nLung fibrosis is confidently recognized when traction bronchiectasis/bronchiolectasis  and/or honeycombing  are identified, although honeycombing must be distinguished from paraseptal emphysema  and airspace enlargement with fibrosis . Pathologic–computed tomography correlations have demonstrated that honeycombing and traction bronchiectasis are closely related. Honeycombing corresponds to bronchiolar cysts, developed after collapse of fibrotic alveolar septa and dilatation of terminal airways 删除11:<u>(8, 9)</u>. The cystic structures sometimes can be followed throughout the lobular core and seem to be connected with each other and are in continuity with the bronchial tree 删除11:<u>(10)</u>. Honeycombing cysts consist of both dilatation of peripheral airspaces due to surrounding alveolar septal fibrosis and tangentially viewed traction bronchiolectasis 删除11:<u>(11)</u>. HRCT findings typical of UIP and honeycombing on HRCT correlate best with bronchiolectasis histologically 删除11:<u>(12)</u>. Recent observations have underlined that in IPF, the remodeling process appears to be a continuum from traction bronchiectasis to honeycombing and that conceptual separation of the two processes may be misleading 删除11:<u>(13)</u>. Identification of traction bronchiectasis/ bronchiolectasis and honeycombing on computed tomography (CT) scans is associated with moderate interobserver agreement 删除11:<u>(14–16)</u>.\n\n【4】The UIP pattern is a hallmark of IPF (UIP-UIP), but it can also be seen in patients with fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HPF) , connective tissue disease (CTD) (CTD-UIP) , or exposure-related ILDs. HP-UIP and CTD-UIP may sometimes be suspected on the basis of imaging appearance but are often indistinguishable radiologically from IPF-UIP. Pleuropulmonary fibroelastosis may be seen in 6–10% of cases of IPF 删除11:<u>(删除13:<u>17, 18</u>)</u> ; it may be associated with more rapid decline in lung function, higher risk of pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum, and poorer survival 删除11:<u>(17)</u>.\n\n【5】#### Probable UIP Pattern in the Diagnostic Approach to IPF\nFour HRCT categories were defined in the 2018 guidelines for diagnosis of IPF: UIP pattern, probable UIP pattern, indeterminate for UIP pattern, and alternative diagnosis 删除11:<u>(2)</u> . Merger of the UIP and probable UIP patterns into a single category was considered; however, the guideline committee decided to retain the four categories with minor modifications for the purpose of clarity 删除9:<u>(Table 3)</u>.\n\n【6】There were several reasons that merging the UIP and probable UIP categories was considered: 1) there is increasing evidence that patients with the probable UIP pattern and UIP pattern on HRCT have similar disease behavior and clinical courses 删除11:<u>(19–21)</u>; 2) the likelihood of histologic confirmation of UIP in patients with the probable UIP pattern ranges from 80% to 85% 删除11:<u>(删除13:<u>19, 22, 23</u>)</u>; and 3) in the appropriate clinical context, the histopathological confirmation of the UIP pattern is not required to ascertain the diagnosis of IPF in patients with either the probable UIP pattern or the UIP pattern 删除11:<u>(2, 删除13:<u>24, 25</u>)</u>.\n\n【7】Despite these reasons, the guideline committee opted to maintain the differentiation between the two patterns for several reasons: 1) studies describing the correlation of probable UIP with\n\n【8】#### Summary of Methods\n\n|                                                             |       |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------|\n| Conflict-of-interest disclosure, vetting, and management prespecified | Y     |\n| Guideline committee multidisciplinary                       | Y     |\n| Guideline committee has patient representation              | Y     |\n| Literature search strategy prespecified                     | Y     |\n| Multiple databases searched for relevant studies            | Y     |\n| Titles and abstracts screened in duplicate                  | Y     |\n| Study selection criteria prespecified                       | Y     |\n| Study selection and data extraction performed in duplicate  | Y     |\n| Studies aggregated by meta-analysis when possible           | Y     |\n| GRADE approach used to formulate recommendations             | Y     |\n| GRADE approach used to rate the strength of recommendation and quality of evidence | Y     |\n| Public commentary period                                    | N     |\n| Process exists to periodically reassess for updating        | Y     |\n\n【10】Definition of abbreviations: GRADE = Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation; N = no; Y = yes.\n\n【11】删除图片描述:<u>![](2_0.png)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 3, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/ATS_ERS_JRS_ALAT：成人特发性肺纤维化和进行性肺纤维化的临床实践指南（2022）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

If the MRD status is positive and/or there are high-risk features such as ETP-phenotype or RAS/PTEN classifier, consolidation with allogeneic HCT should be considered. Continuation of multiagent therapy followed by maintenance therapy is another recommended consolidation option. For all other patients, continuation of multiagent therapy followed by maintenance therapy or consideration of consolidative allogeneic HCT are recommended. In all cases, the optimal timing of HCT is unclear. For patients who are fit, additional therapy is recommended to eliminate MRD prior to transplant.\n\n【2】For AYA patients experiencing less than a CR or CRi after initial induction therapy (ie, presence of primary refractory disease), the treatment approach would be similar to that for patients with R/R ALL 删除9:<u>(see Patients with Relapsed/Refractory Ph-Negative T-ALL)</u>.\n\n【3】## Adults with Ph-Negative T-ALL\n\n【4】For adults with T-ALL, the panel recommends treatment in a clinical trial, where possible. In the absence of an appropriate clinical trial, the recommended treatment approach would initially depend on the patient’s age and/or presence of comorbid conditions. Treatment regimens should include adequate CNS prophylaxis for all patients, and a given treatment protocol should be followed in its entirety, from induction therapy to consolidation/delayed intensification to maintenance therapy. Again, testing for TPMT gene polymorphism should be considered for patients receiving 6-MP as part of maintenance therapy, especially in those who develop severe bone marrow toxicities.\n\n【5】Although the age cutoff indicated in the guidelines has been set at 65 years, it should be noted that chronologic age alone is not a sufficient surrogate for defining fitness; patients should be evaluated on an individual basis to determine fitness for therapy based on factors such as performance status, end-organ function, and end-organ reserve.\n\n【6】For patients <65 years of age and without substantial comorbidities, the recommended treatment approach is similar to that for AYA patients. Induction therapy should comprise multiagent therapy such as those based on protocols from the CALGB 8811 study (Larson regimen), the Linker regimen, GRAALL-2005, GRAALL-2014, hyper-CVAD, or the MRC UKALL XII/ECOG E2993 regimen. The addition of nelarabine to GRAALL-2014 and hyperCVAD may be beneficial.

Dose modifications may be required for systemic therapy agents, as needed. MRD assessment and consolidation approach after initial treatment induction would be similar to that for AYA patients with T-ALL, with appropriate dose modifications 删除9:<u>(see AYA Patients with T-ALL)</u>.\n\n【8】## Patients with Relapsed/Refractory T-ALL\n\n【9】For patients with R/R T-ALL, the approach to second-line treatment may depend on the duration of the initial response. For late relapses (ie, relapses occurring ≥3 years from initial diagnosis), re-treatment with the same induction regimen is a reasonable option. For other patients, participation in a clinical trial is preferred, when possible. In the absence of an appropriate trial, the regimens listed for R/R Ph-negative B-ALL may be appropriate for R/R T-ALL; however, nelarabine in combination with etoposide and cyclophosphamide is the preferred treatment approach.

Standard utilization of daily imaging is not recommended. Radiation to the breast/chest wall and nodal regions is generally delivered with single-energy or mixed-energy photons with or without electrons. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) should be used to evaluate dose constraints, evaluate dose to normal tissues (ie, heart, lung), and ensure adequate coverage to the intended planning target volumes (PTVs), including the breast/chest wall, supraclavicular fossa, axillary levels I–III, and internal mammary nodes.\n\n【2】Whole Breast Radiation Therapy\nWBRT reduces the risk of local recurrence and has shown to have a beneficial effect on survival. Randomized trials have demonstrated decreased in-breast recurrences with an additional boost dose of radiation (by photons, brachytherapy, or electron beam) to the tumor bed. For greater homogeneity of target dose and to spare normal tissues using compensators such as tissue wedges, forward planning using segments and IMRT may be used.\n\n【3】Four randomized clinical trials have investigated hypofractionated WBRT schedules (39–42.9 Gy in single fractions of 2.6–3.3 Gy) compared to standard 50 Gy in single fractions of 2 Gy. The 10-year follow-up data from the START trials are consistent with the 10-year results of the Canadian trial, which reported that local tumor control and breast cosmesis were similar with a regimen of 42.5 Gy in 16 fractions over 3.2 weeks compared with the standard dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks. The START trials reported radiation-related effects to normal breast tissue such as breast shrinkage, telangiectasia, and breast edema as less common with the hypofractionated regimen.\n\n【4】Another randomized trial showed similar outcomes among patients receiving a hypofractionated schedule (40 Gy in 15 fractions) compared with standard fractionation (50 Gy in 25 fractions) in patients 删除19:<u>(n = 1854)</u> with node-negative breast cancer 删除19:<u>(n = 1608)</u> or DCIS (n = 246). The 9-year risk of locoregional recurrence was 3.3% in the 50-Gy group and 3.0% in the 40-Gy group. The 9-year OS was 93.4% in the 50-Gy group and 93.4% in the 40-Gy group. Radiation-associated cardiac and lung disease were comparable between the groups.\n\n【5】Other shorter schedules of delivering WBRT have also been studied with similar results. The FAST trial compared patients over 50 years of age with low-risk invasive breast carcinoma (pT1–2, pN0) randomly assigned to the standard schedule of 50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks or 30 Gy or 28.5 Gy in 5 fractions once weekly. After 10-year follow-up, there were no significant differences reported in normal tissue effects for the standard 50 Gy in 25 fractions schedule versus a once-weekly schedule for 5 weeks totaling 28.5 Gy, but normal tissue effects were higher with a weekly schedule for 5 weeks totaling 30 Gy.\n\n【6】The FAST Forward trial randomized patients with non-metastatic breast cancer 删除19:<u>(n = 4096)</u> after BCS or mastectomy to one of the following: 40 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks; 27 Gy in 5 fractions over 1 week; or 26 Gy in 5 fractions over 1 week to either whole beast or chest wall. The 5-year incidence of ipsilateral breast tumor relapse was 2.1% with the standard 40 Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks versus 1.7% with 27 Gy in 5 fractions over 1 week (5.4 Gy per fraction; HR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.51–1.44) and 1.4% with 26 Gy in 5 fractions over 1 week (5.2 Gy per fraction; HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.38–1.16). The moderate or marked tissue effects in the breast or chest wall were 15% with 27 Gy, 12% with 26 Gy, and 10% with 40 Gy, but differences between the 40 Gy and 26 Gy groups were not statistically different.\n\n【7】RT Boost to Tumor Bed: In patients with higher risk characteristics (such as age <50 years, high-grade disease, or patients with focally positive margins) an RT boost has been shown to reduce local relapse.

When the climate is suddenly cold, they should keep their shoulders warm and avoid exposing them during sleep (consensus recommendation).\n\n【1】9  DISCUSSION  \nThe development of this guideline was based on the best currently available direct evidence. The guidelines weakly recommended the use of manual therapy, acupuncture, needle knife, Cheezheng Xiaotong plaster, Gu Gong plaster, exercise therapy or integrative medicine, such as combined modalities and corticosteroid injections, for the treatment of the frozen shoulder.\n\n【2】There are some strengths in the development of this guideline. First, this is the first guideline for managing frozen shoulder using TCM and integrative medicine based on a systematic search of evidence and a rating of evidence certainty within the GRADE approach. Second, we recruited 20 multidisciplinary experts from traditional Chinese orthopedics and Western orthopedics, integrating Chinese medicine, clinical pharmacy, pharmacoeconomics, and nursing science to support the development of this guideline. Third, reviewers evaluated the quality of our guidelines based on AGREE II and RIGHT statements and found that scores for AGREE II were as follows: 76.19% for domain 1, 71.43% for domain 2, 85.71% for domain 3, 30.95% for domain 4, 78.57% for domain 5, and 100% for domain 6.\n\n【3】However, there are some limitations to this guideline. First, the evidence base generally rated as very low to low certainty, and reports of patient-important outcomes were rare. Consequently, most of our recommendations were weak or consensus based. Second, although classical famous prescriptions were recommended by many clinicians, we did not include them in this guideline because of the lack of direct evidence. Third, some Chinese medicines evaluated only in observational studies were not considered in the current guidelines but will be considered in the updated version. Fourth, large-sample qualitative interviews and cross-sectional surveys on patient preferences and values were not conducted.\n\n【4】Based on the current research status and clinical practice needs, we suggest that future research should focus on the following: 删除11:<u>(1)</u> continue to produce high-quality RCTs with efficacy and safety of TCM in treating frozen shoulder; 删除11:<u>(2)</u> in RCTs, pay attention to the differences in the effects of TCM treatment in different clinical stages and different syndrome differentiation types; 删除11:<u>(3)</u> observe and report patient-important outcomes in RCTs as much as possible; 删除11:<u>(4)</u> strictly follow the international standard of RCT design, implementation and reporting, and improve research quality regarding TCM in treating frozen shoulder; 删除11:<u>(5)</u> conduct multicenter large-sample cross-sectional studies and qualitative interviews to investigate the preferences and values of frozen shoulder patients with respect to treatment choices (such as influencing factors, trade-offs between advantages and disadvantages).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 11, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/中国循证指南：肩周炎的中药治疗.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

If required, based on the patient’s social situation and the local setup, a social worker may facilitate rehabilitation through helping to obtain financial support, especially in case of disability (e.g. visual impairment), and sometimes financial compensation for medical (iatrogenic) accident.\n\n【1】Skin sequelae are very frequent and include pigmentation disorders, hypertrophic scars, polymorphic nail changes and occasionally chronic skin pain. All of these issues can have a major impact on the patient’s quality of life. Consensus was obtained for prolonged sun protection and daily use of emollients. However, it is not possible to provide guidelines for the duration of these measures, which should be individualised for each patient, depending on his/her phototype and quality of healing. Consensus was also obtained for a consideration of laser procedures for disabling hypertrophic scars, and involvement of a neurologist in the exploration and management of chronic pain. The latter was shown to result from sensitization of both small-diameter (burning and itching sensations) and large-diameter nerve fibers (allodynia), and major affects on the patient’s daily activities. Nail changes are frequent and polymorphic and often disabling for the patient, but best management guidelines are still missing.\n\n【2】Dental sequelae and xerostomia are frequent. Consensus was obtained for a regular dental follow-up, for the necessary duration for each individual patient after the acute phase, and prescription of saliva substitutes or systemic or topical sialogogues such as pilocarpine or cevimeline, as have been described as effective in other xerostomia and hyposalivation syndromes.\n\n【3】Ocular sequelae are the main disabling sequela. Ocular changes of variable severity affect up to 75% of survivors with an impact on daily personal and professional life. Risk factors are the severity of the disease at the acute phase, including the severity of ocular involvement. Ocular change include dryness, ectropion, entropion, trichiasis, meibomian gland dysfunction, corneal erosions, ulcerations, neovascularisation, stromal scarring, and conjunctivalization of the corneal surface with loss of visual acuity. Consensus was obtained for the regular use of artificial tears without preservatives and topical vitamin A in xerophthalmia, together with a trial of an adjunctive topical immunosuppressant such as cyclosporine, that were demonstrated to be efficacious in a small study in EN as well as in other causes of dry eye, although may be poorly tolerated (pain, redness, and eyelid swelling). Topical tacrolimus is an alternative, with interesting results on ocular surface persistent inflammation. Scleral lens or tear-exchangeable, limbal, rigid contact lenses are used in the most disabling ocular surface sequela, with good results in term of dryness improvement, visual rehabilitation, and global ocular comfort. In contrast, the statement that corneal transplantation should not be recommended due to the risk of clinical exacerbation led to an ‘uncertain’ consensus result. Few studies were published on this topic, but outcome of keratoplasty in cicatrizing conjunctival diseases is poor, causing a further deterioration of vision and morbidity due to persistence of epithelial defects, stromal ulceration, perforation, and graft rejection.\n\n【4】In women, genital sequelae are not uncommon (about 20%) and include labial agglutination, introital stenosis, vaginal synechiae and stenosis, vaginal and vulval adenosis, hematocolpos, and hematometra, leading to dryness, dyspareunia and bleeding. Although urinary sequelae are rare in children, caution is needed in this population. In our DEPHI exercise, consensus was obtained for the use of emollients to reduce vulval and vaginal dryness, topical corticosteroids in case of lichenification and topical oestrogen in case of vaginal adhesion.\n\n【5】Psychological sequelae are frequent. Medicine avoidance is common, given that the disease is drug induced in the majority of cases. Other conditions include anxiety, depression, and nightmares. Of note, within the 6 months after the acute phase, 25% of patients develop post-traumatic stress disorder, especially in case of previous psychological fragility. Consensus was obtained for screening for psychological well-being at each follow-up appointment. This screening may be first conducted by the dermatologist, using standardized tools, such as the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS). HADS is reliable and easy to use self-assessment instrument developed 40 years ago for detecting states of depression (7 questions) and anxiety (7 questions) to guide the need for specialized intervention. Intervention involves care from both a psychologist and a psychiatrist to prescribe psychotropic drugs according to each patient’s needs. Additional measures such as hypnosis to reduce symptoms of anxiety or depression remained of ‘uncertain’ appropriateness. Indeed, whereas the efficacy of hypnosis and other techniques such as relaxation was suggested in burns, literature still lacks in psychological sequelae of EN.\n\n【6】Pulmonary sequelae are rare. A pulmonologist should be involved in case of severe initial lung involvement.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 6, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/2023+国际多学科共识：表皮坏死松解急性期后及后遗症的管理.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

It will be a trade-off between a reduction in CT requests against a potential increase in MRI requests. The committee also highlighted that any increase in MRI requests may be small because the decision to perform an MRI will not generally be affected by the results of a previous CT scan.\n\n【3】The committee recognised that if there was an increase in MRI requests, this could be a challenge because access to high-quality MRI scanners is limited in some trusts.

However, recent data have demonstrated an increased prevalence of HGD and adenocarcinoma on index endoscopy in patients with Barrett esophagus over the past 25 years. Endoscopic surveillance with multiple biopsies 删除11:<u>(6–8)</u> should be performed to evaluate the progression of Barrett esophagus from metaplasia to LGD, HGD, or adenocarcinoma. Larger forceps are recommended during surveillance endoscopy of Barrett esophagus for the detection of dysplasia.\n\n【3】The current clinical guidelines from the American College of Gastroenterology recommend endoscopic surveillance in patients with Barrett esophagus at intervals determined by the presence and grade of dysplasia. Given the low risk of progression of Barrett esophagus to esophageal adenocarcinoma, endoscopic surveillance at 3- to 5-year intervals is reasonable for patients without dysplasia. The presence of dysplasia of any grade should be confirmed by a second pathologist with expertise in GI pathology. Patients with confirmed LGD should receive endoscopic therapy. If endoscopic therapy is not performed, annual surveillance is recommended until two consecutive examinations are negative for dysplasia, after which time surveillance intervals for non-dysplastic Barrett esophagus can be followed (every 3–5 years). If HGD is confirmed, patients should be managed with endoscopic therapy unless they have life-limiting comorbidity. Typically, endoscopic surveillance should use four-quadrant biopsies at 2-cm intervals in patients without dysplasia and 1-cm intervals in patients with prior dysplasia. For patients with results indefinite for dysplasia, endoscopy should be repeated after treatment for 3 to 6 months with acid-suppressive medications. If the “indefinite for dysplasia” reading is confirmed on this examination, a surveillance interval of 12 months is recommended. A retrospective study found that Barrett esophagus indefinite for dysplasia was associated with a similar risk of progression to adenocarcinoma as Barrett esophagus with LGD. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis reached the same conclusion. Therefore, surveillance for these patients should follow the recommendations for LGD.\n\n【4】### Pathologic Review and Biomarker Testing\n\n【5】Pathologic review and biomarker testing play important roles in the diagnosis, classification, and molecular characterization of esophageal and EGJ cancers. Classification based on histologic subtype and molecular features helps to improve early diagnosis and has implications for therapy. An accumulation of genetic aberrations occurs during esophageal carcinogenesis, including overexpression of growth factors and/or receptors, alterations in DNA damage response, and loss of genomic stability. Characterization of these pathways has enabled the application of molecular pathology to aid in the management of esophageal and EGJ cancers.\n\n【6】#### Principles of Pathologic Review\n\n【7】A specific diagnosis of esophageal SCC or adenocarcinoma should be established for staging and treatment purposes. Mixed adenosquamous carcinomas and carcinomas not otherwise specified are staged using the TNM staging system for SCC. In addition to the histologic type, the pathology report (regardless of the specimen type) should include specifics about tumor invasion and pathologic grade, which are required for staging. The pathology report of a biopsy or endoscopic mucosal resection specimen should also document the presence or absence of Barrett esophagus. Biopsies showing Barrett esophagus with suspected dysplasia should be reviewed by a second expert GI pathologist for confirmation. Barrett esophagus with HGD is reported as intraepithelial neoplasia (dysplasia) (Tis) for staging purposes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 98, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/_（2023.V4）NCCN临床实践指南：食管和食管胃交界部癌.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

The report found that for single-fraction SRS for brain metastases, total irradiated volumes (normal brain plus target volumes) of 5 cm³, 10 cm³, or >15 cm³ receiving 1200 cGy ($V_{12Gy}$) were associated with risks of symptomatic radionecrosis of approximately 10%, 15%, and 20%, respectively. Thus, the report concludes that the Quantitative Analysis of Normal Tissue Effect in the Clinic (QUANTEC) recommendation to limit single-fraction $V_{12Gy}$ to 5 to 10 cm³ remains prudent.\n\n【4】For brain metastases treated with fractionated SRS, the HyTEC analysis found that if the total irradiated volumes (normal brain plus target volumes) receiving 2000 cGy ($V_{20Gy}$) in 3 fractions or 2400 cGy ($V_{25Gy}$) in 5 fractions is kept to <20 cm³, then the associated risk of any necrosis or edema is <10%, and risk of radionecrosis requiring resection is <4%.\n\n【5】For single-fraction SRS, one study suggested limiting the $V_{12Gy}$ of normal brain 删除19:<u>(volume of brain, excluding the target volume, receiving ≥1200 cGy)</u> to <8 cm³, and another study advised to keep the $V_{12Gy}$ total volume (includes both brain and target) to <8 cm³, implying that treatment with a $V_{12Gy} >8 cm³$ may be considered for fractionated SRS. For patients treated with 5-fraction fractionated SRS, these studies suggest keeping the $V_{30Gy}$ of normal brain (total brain minus target volume) to <10.5 cm³.\n\n【6】Although reports are limited and quality of evidence is mixed, there may be combinations of certain systemic therapy agents (TKIs, T-DM1) and SRS that are associated with a higher risk of radionecrosis (30%–40%) than those reported with SRS alone. With respect to combinations of immune checkpoint inhibition with SRS, reports are also mixed, some showing a higher incidence of radionecrosis with combination therapy. However, there are also several reports showing that the incidence of radionecrosis is low with combination of immune checkpoint inhibition and SRS and similar to rates reported for SRS alone. This continues to be an area of active investigation, and caution is advised in combining SRS with systemic therapy and immunotherapy, with close attention to radiation planning parameters previously discussed (recognizing that accurate planning parameters may not be known when combining SRS with certain systemic therapies, as there may be elevated risks).\n\n【7】删除图片描述:<u>Figures 1 and 2 are treatment algorithms based on the recommendations from all KQs.</u>\n\n【8】### Conclusions and Future Directions\n\n【9】In the decade since the previous ASTRO brain metastasis guideline, there has been a tremendous evolution in the management of this patient population. Novel RT techniques such as HA-WBRT have been developed that improve the therapeutic ratio, SRS has a more predominant role, and newer systemic agents have demonstrated unprecedented CNS activity. Treatment and management decisions depend on multiple factors (eg, number of brain metastases, brain metastasis size, and performance status). Many treatment decisions require multidisciplinary input, especially decisions to defer focal therapy (eg, SRS, surgery) for salvage, noting the numerous clinical trials that have established the safety and effectiveness of focal therapy for brain metastases. As these significant advances in brain metastasis management have been driven by clinical trials, there is an ongoing need for development of inclusive clinical trials, with broader eligibility criteria when appropriate, that assess different modalities (eg, RT, imaging, systemic therapy, surgical intervention, and their interactions) and incorporate clinically meaningful trial endpoints such as survival, cognitive outcomes, and QoL. Finally, clinics are encouraged to offer clinical trial participation where appropriate and available.\n\n【10】### Acknowledgments\n\n【11】We are grateful to the AHRQ evidence-based practice center that performed the systematic review of the", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 14, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/ASTRO：脑转移瘤放射治疗的临床实践指南（2022）(1).pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Nocturnal hypertension is common in children with sickle cell disease, CKD, obstructive sleep apnea, systemic lupus erythematosus, and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease and in recipients of solid-organ transplants. Some children with medical diagnoses often thought to have a more benign prognosis have significant abnormalities noted on ABPM: one-third of children with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome have ambulatory hypertension and 72% have nocturnal hypertension; 50% of children born prematurely have abnormal nocturnal BP, as do 82% of children with a solitary kidney. Nocturnal BP abnormalities have been associated with various measures of TOD in diverse patient populations, including type 1 diabetes.\n\n【4】### DETERMINANTS OF ABP\n\n【5】Systemic BP is a result of complex physiological processes that change in response to various factors, including position (supine, sitting, standing), level of physical activity, sleep, and stress. ABPM is designed to evaluate BP across many functional dimensions to provide a more complete view of an individual's BP during normal daily activities.\n\n【6】When establishing normal ABP values in pediatric patients, various characteristics that may affect SBP and DBP should be considered. In children and adolescents, age is an important determinant of both 24-hour SBP and BP variability. Sex is a predictor of higher ABP; male sex is associated with a greater prevalence of high ABP. Overweight and obesity status are also associated with increased ABP.\n\n【7】Activity increases BP; therefore, ABP values are higher than resting clinic BP measurements. One study found that increased physical activity as measured by actigraphy was positively correlated with increases in SBP, diastolic BP (DBP), and heart rate on 24-hour ABPM.\n\n【8】Sleep is another important determinant of BP. Under normal circumstances, BP drops by 10% to 20% during sleep, a phenomenon referred to as dipping. Nondipping (also referred to as blunted dipping) is when the decrease in BP during sleep is <10%, and reversed dipping refers to when the mean sleep BP is higher than the mean wake BP. Nondipping and reversed dipping are associated with increased risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in adulthood, but long-term follow-up in youth is lacking.\n\n【9】Other likely determinants of ABP include autonomic tone, vascular stiffness or passive arterial parameters, relative blood volume, and use of pharmacological agents such as stimulants prescribed for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.\n\n【10】### NORMATIVE DATA FOR ABPM\n\n【11】ABP is different from resting clinic BP, necessitating specific normative data. The most widely used data for this purpose are from Wühl et al., who analyzed ABPM measurements from 949 healthy Central European children 5 to 20 years of age by using the least mean squares method to provide both age–sex–specific and height–sex–specific reference values. Unfortunately, this dataset contains no reference values for children <120 cm in height, and the DBP values have minimal variability across height and age.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 3, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/AHA：儿童和青少年动态血压监测的科学声明（2022）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

In one study, 21% of isolates from persons with acute HIV infection demonstrated resistance to at least one ARV drug, most commonly non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Therefore, before initiating ART in a person with early HIV infection or low qualitative or quantitative plasma HIV RNA test result (<3,000 copies/mL), a blood specimen should be sent for drug-resistance testing, although treatment should not be delayed pending resistance-test results. The test results should be used to modify the ARV regimen if necessary. The Panel on Antiretroviral Guidelines for Adults and Adolescents does not currently recommend routine genotype testing for INSTI resistance in treatment-naive persons given the low rate of transmitted INSTI resistance and high barrier to resistance of dolutegravir (DTG) and bictegravir (BIC), unless transmitted INSTI resistance is a concern. However, the rate of transmitted INSTI resistance has increased from 0.8% to 1.1%, $P = 0.04$ with the increasing use of INSTIs, indicating a need for ongoing population monitoring.\n\n【2】### Considerations for Preventing HIV Transmission During Early HIV Infection\n\n【3】Persons with early HIV infection have a higher likelihood of sexual transmission of HIV to others. Prompt initiation of ART and sustained viral suppression to <200 copies/mL can prevent transmission of HIV to sexual partners. Individuals starting ART should use another form of prevention (e.g., condoms, PrEP for partners who are HIV negative, sexual abstinence) for at least the first 6 months of treatment and until they have a documented viral load of <200 copies/mL. Many experts would recommend confirming sustained viral suppression before assuming no risk of sexual transmission of HIV 删除9:<u>(see Antiretroviral Therapy to Prevent Sexual Transmission of HIV)</u>.\n\n【4】### Antiretroviral Regimens for Early HIV Infection\n\n【5】ART should be initiated with one of the combination regimens recommended for persons with chronic HIV infection 删除9:<u>(see What to Start)</u>. Providers should inform individuals starting ART of the importance of adherence to achieve and maintain viral suppression. If available, the results of ARV drug-resistance testing or the resistance pattern of the source person's virus should be used to guide selection of the regimen. All persons of childbearing potential should have a pregnancy test before initiating ART.\n\n【6】If ART is to be initiated before the results of drug-resistance and HLA-B*5701 tests are available, one of the following regimens is an appropriate option:\n\n【7】- DTG with (emtricitabine [FTC] or lamivudine [3TC]) plus (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [TDF] or tenofovir alafenamide [TAF])\n- BIC/TAF/FTC\n- Boosted darunavir (DRV) with (FTC or 3TC) plus (TAF or TDF)\n\n【8】DTG is a good treatment option because transmission of DTG-resistant HIV is rare, and DTG has a higher barrier to resistance than raltegravir and elvitegravir. Based on data from *in vitro* studies and clinical trials in ART-naive participants, it is anticipated that BIC also might have a high barrier to", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 193, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/HHS：HIV感染的成人及青少年应用抗逆转录病毒药物治疗指南（2022）.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

These benefits would improve the long-term cardiovascular health of children with heart disease.\n\n【1】### Assessment of physical activity\n\n【2】While deciding about the exercise recommendation in children with CHD, two questions need to be answered – one is the ability of the patient to perform the physical activity and second is the safety of the child for that physical activity, based on the understanding of the impact of that physical activity on the heart.\n\n【3】Conventionally, assessment of physical activity is done by asking questions to the child or parents, like “how long can you walk/how many flights of stairs can you climb?” We understand that in this manner we may not accurately understand their functional capacity. There also could be a discrepancy between what the patient is perceiving compared to what the parents are perceiving about the child’s physical capacity. For an objective analysis, the following tests are recommended. In general, dynamic exercise is preferred for testing as it can elicit maximal cardiovascular response, compared to static exercise where fatigue might limit further exercise.\n\n【4】1. 6-minute walk test (6MWT): It measures the distance a patient can walk quickly on a flat surface in a period of 6 minutes (6MWD).\n\n【5】2. Stress test: The child’s physiological response to exercise is measured by stress test and then interpreted against established standards. The stress test is used to assess exercise tolerance, to evaluate the safety of exercise for a child with CHD, and to elicit abnormalities that are not evident at rest. The normal stress test is done with BP, heart rate and ECG monitoring, and pulse oximeter using exercise protocols (Modified Bruce protocol) that increase with intervals, commonly with a treadmill. Exercise capacity is reported in metabolic equivalents (METs) of exercise. In stress test, a good exercise capacity is more than 10 METs. Exercise is terminated mainly when the heart rate reaches a percentage of predicted maximum heart rate and/or when the child has symptoms. The major limitations of stress test include the subjective nature of the self-reported symptoms by the child and baseline rhythm abnormalities such as sinus node dysfunction where monitoring of the heart rate may be unreliable. Children with pulmonary hypertension, cardiomyopathy with heart failure/arrhythmia, severe outflow obstruction, prolonged QTc, severe aortic dilation are at high risk for stress test, which should be avoided.\n\n【6】3. Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) can provide other parameters such as maximal oxygen consumption, anaerobic threshold. However, CPET is an expensive equipment and not easily available. Fortunately, the rate of perceived exertion (RPE) or Borg scale correlates well with the blood lactate levels and oxygen consumption. The fixed percentage of MHR correlates well with RPE of the Borg Scale删除9:<u>[Table 3]</u>. Hence, monitoring of both the heart rate and RPE can be used.\n\n【7】Based on Tables 2 and 3, the dynamic activity which is considered to be relative intensity is classified into\n\n【8】**Table 3: The relation between the rate of perceived exertion and % of maximal heart rate**\n\n【9】删除图片描述:<u>![](4_0.png)</u>\n\n【10】**Table 4: Assessment of dynamic activity based on the stress test parameters**\n\n【11】删除图片描述:<u>![](4_1.png)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"page_num": 5, "obj_key": "oss://inf-alpha/home/lipengfei/data/guidelines_ly/raw_pdf/2023 心脏病儿童体育活动指南.pdf"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_ly_gptpdf", "batch_name": "20240729", "version": "version0"}

Therefore, our ability to assess the role of exercise as an ACT is currently limited. Future work with a wider definition for ACTs and good control of potential confounders should investigate the role of NIV and exercise in airway clearance for bronchiectasis. Moreover, the role of other potential devices for ACTs in bronchiectasis, such as Simeox, free aspire advanced, mechanical insufflation-exsufflation and intermittent positive pressure breathing should be also evaluated in future studies.\n\n【1】### Conclusion\n\n【2】The current evidence supports that ACTs is an effective treatment and has a crucial part in the usual care of adults with bronchiectasis. Accessibility to ACTs should be facilitated and ideally delivered by a specialist respiratory physiotherapist. However, there is limited evidence establishing the physiological effect of these techniques and current clinical practice based on geographical regions, remains largely unclear. The use of data from large patient registries could help to better understand the ACTs practice globally. Randomised clinical trials indicate that ACTs increase the expectorated sputum, improve disease symptoms and HRQoL and reduce the risk of exacerbations, although they often have an unclear risk of bias or a poor description of their techniques.

In the T1, N0 population, a small but significant decrease in OS was also noted in the local excision group. Interestingly, limited data suggest that TEM might have superior oncologic outcomes in patients with stage I rectal cancer compared with radical resection, although not all studies have seen such results.\n\n【2】Thus, careful patient selection for local excision of T1, N0 rectal cancer is important, as is the careful examination of the resection specimen with subsequent transabdominal resection in patients found to have T2 disease or high-risk features, as described above.\n\n【3】## Transabdominal Resection\n\n【4】Patients with rectal cancer who do not meet requirements for local surgery should be treated with a transabdominal resection. Organ-preserving procedures that maintain sphincter function are preferable, but not possible in all cases. Preoperative chemoRT or TNT may result in tumor downsizing and a decrease in tumor bulk 删除9:<u>(see section on Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant Therapy for Resectable Nonmetastatic Disease, below)</u>; sphincter preservation may become possible in cases where initial tumor bulk prevented consideration of such surgery and exposure to the tumor is improved by neoadjuvant treatment.\n\n【5】In transabdominal resections, TME is recommended. A TME involves an en bloc removal of the mesorectum, including associated vascular and lymphatic structures, fatty tissue, and mesorectal fascia as a \"tumor package\" through sharp dissection and is designed to spare the autonomic nerves. The lymphatic drainage regions of rectal tumors are influenced by their position in the rectum. More distal tumors are more likely to be characterized by both upward and lateral lymphatic drainage, whereas the likelihood of only upward mesorectal drainage is much higher for more proximal tumors. The TME approach is designed to radically remove lymphatic drainage regions of tumors located above the level of the levator muscles. The panel does not recommend extension of nodal dissection beyond the field of resection (eg, into the distribution of iliac lymph nodes) unless these nodes are clinically suspicious. In cases where anal function is intact and distal clearance is adequate, the TME may be followed by creation of a coloanal anastomosis.\n\n【6】For lesions in the mid to upper rectum, an LAR extended 4 to 5 cm below the distal edge of the tumor using TME, followed by creation of a colorectal anastomosis, is the treatment of choice. Where creation of an anastomosis is not possible, colostomy is required. Wide TME is recommended in order to facilitate adequate lymphadenectomy and improve the probability of achieving negative circumferential margins.\n\n【7】An APR with TME should be performed when the tumor directly involves the anal sphincter or the levator muscles. An APR is also necessary in cases where a margin-negative resection of the tumor would result in loss of anal sphincter function and incontinence. An APR involves en bloc resection of the rectosigmoid, the rectum, and the anus, as well as the surrounding mesentery, mesorectum (TME), and perianal soft tissue, and it necessitates creation of a colostomy. In the NSABP R-04 trial, patients who had an APR reported worse body image, worse nutrition symptoms, and less sexual enjoyment at 1-year post surgery than those who had sphincter-sparing surgery. An extralevator APR may have benefits over a conventional APR approach, including lower rates of intraoperative perforation, CRM involvement, and local recurrence, although inconsistencies are seen between studies.\n\n【8】Pathologists play a key role in evaluating the surgical specimen, including a macroscopic assessment of both its external appearance/completeness and the CRM. The panel defines an involved or threatened CRM as tumor within 1 mm from the resected margin 删除9:<u>(see Pathology, above)</u>.
