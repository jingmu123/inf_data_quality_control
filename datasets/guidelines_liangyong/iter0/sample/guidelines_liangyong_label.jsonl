This consensus is the result of a number of discussions on the technique of visceral arterial branch reconstruction in TAAA by experts with extensive experience in the treatment of TAAA in China, based on thorough summary of clinical trial experience, systematic review and analysis of the relevant domestic and international literature. The consensus systematically discusses the prevention and treatment of oost-operative complications of open surgery repair (OSR), endovascular and hybrid surgery for TAAA repair, and makes ecommendations on the treatment of complex TAAA involving the reconstruction of visceral arterial branches, in order to facilitate the formulation of optimal decisions for the reconstruction of visceral arterial blood flow while repairing TAAA.

括腹腔干、肠系膜上动脉、肾动脉、肠系膜下动脉等。目\n\n【10】前，临床普遍采用的TAAA分型方法是Crawford分型!： I型，累及左锁骨下动脉至腹主动脉上段；Ⅱ型，累及范围 最广，从左锁骨下动脉至主动脉分叉部；Ⅲ型，累及远端胸 主动脉（第6肋以下）并延伸至主动脉分叉；IV型，上至膈水 平的胸主动脉，下至腹主动脉分叉；V型，从远端胸主动脉\n\n【11】（第6肋以下）延伸至肾动脉上方。TAAA的治疗方式主要为 传统开放手术修复（open surgery repair,OSR）、腔内修复术 (endovascular aorticrepair,EVAR）和杂交手术，但如何重建 重要内脏动脉分支是治疗TAAA的关键，并且内脏动脉分 支重建技术使腔内修复累及内脏动脉分支的TAAA成为现 实。传统OSR和EVAR各有优缺点，其中，传统OSR的难度 较大，并且围手术期并发症发生率高，而EVAR存在内脏动 脉远期通畅率低等问题，因此，需要进行完善的术前检查、 精确的术前测量，并结合患者自身及各中心的具体情况评 估风险与收益，进而制定TAAA的治疗方案。由中国微循环 学会周围血管疾病专业委员会发起并组织专业委员会专家 组拟定关键问题，经多次讨论、总结专家临床经验，并结合

血管外科领域最复杂的手术之一。OSR旨在替换病变远端 主动脉全长的同时保护脊髓和内脏器官，从而避免缺血相 关并发症的发生。内脏动脉分支的重建是TAAA外科修复 的关键，TAAA常累及上肢和内脏动脉，手术入路、手术方 式的选择均复杂，传统的手术方式主要包括DeBakey术式、 Crawford改良术式及片状吻合修复肋间动脉。\n\n【17】2.1DeBakey术式\n\n【18】该术式近端采用人工血管进行降主动脉端侧的吻合， 其主要优点是没有阻断主动脉，并且在不阻断内脏动脉供 血的情况下直接进行内脏动脉吻合术，\n\n【19】2.2Crawford改良术式\n\n【20】采用补片吻合内脏动脉分支，单次阻断，依次完成主 动脉和内脏动脉分支补片吻合后恢复主动脉及内脏血运， 根据解剖情况，通常将腹腔干、肠系膜上动脉、右肾动脉 司时吻合，将左肾动脉单独吻合。术中内脏缺血时间相对 较短。不切除主动脉，直接在瘤腔内采用人工血管进行动 脉吻合，操作相对简单，不仅缩短了手术时间，还减少了 术中出血等并发症的发生。\n\n【21】2.3片状吻合修复肋间动脉\n\n【22】在TAAA的OSR中，肋间动脉和内脏动脉的重建是 关键的技术步骤。重建肋间动脉最简单的一种方式是将带 有肋间动脉开口的主动脉壁片状吻合至人工血管上，主 要优势在于减少吻合口数量。然而，在动脉瘤较大的情况 下，特别是当肋间动脉开口相互间移位明显时，必须分别 移植每个肋间动脉开口。另外，为了方便分支重建而保留 的主动脉壁可能会出现远期瘤样扩张，特别是马方综合征 患者。关于内脏动脉的重建问题，有研究在深低温下修 复TAAA运用预先缝制好的四分支人工血管重建内脏动脉 技术，通过人工血管分别灌注内脏动脉，从而实现对内脏 的保护\\[。然而，深低温也有潜在的问题，如更长的体外循 环（cardiopulmonarybypass，CPB）时间、更高的凝血功能 异常和肺功能异常发生率等。重建内脏动脉时，需特别注 意避免将内脏向右旋转，因为内脏动脉，特别是左肾动脉， 在内脏复位后容易出现扭曲。 推荐意见1：尽管腔内技术发展突飞猛进，但OSR仍 是治疗TAAA的金标准，Crawford改良术式采用补片吻合 内脏动脉分支，操作相对简单，是目前常用的术式。（证据 等级：C；推荐强度：Ⅱa） 推荐意见2：对带有肋间动脉开口的主动脉壁进行片 状吻合修复肋间动脉，但保留的主动脉壁可能出现远期瘤\n\n【23】样扩张。（证据等级：B；推荐强度：Ⅱ） 推荐意见3：重建内脏动脉时注意避免将内脏向右旋 转，特别是左肾动脉。（证据等级：C；推荐强度：Ⅱa）\n\n【24】3 EVAR\n\n【25】EVAR具有创伤小、围手术期恢复快等特点，已逐渐成 为治疗TAAA的主要手段，但EVAR的实施需要腹主动脉 留的解剖结构适合，并不适用于瘤颈短或者扭曲、累及内 脏动脉分支等存在复杂情况的TAAA。随着技术和材料的 不断更新，腔内修复TAAA的技术不断增多，包括开窗支 架主动脉瘤腔内修复术（fenestratedendovascular aneurysm repair,FEVAR）、平行支架移植物（parallel grafting，PG）技 术、分支支架主动脉瘤腔内修复术（branchedendovascular aneurysmrepair，BEVAR）等，其可以在重建内脏动脉分 支的同时隔绝TAAA，采用开窗或分支支架技术腔内修复 TAAA并重建内脏动脉分支血流，不需要进行长段主动脉 的暴露及主动脉的钳夹，避免了内脏缺血情况的发生，可 有效降低肾功能衰竭、心肺系统并发症的发生率和患者病 死率。2001年，Anderson等”进行了应用开窗支架治疗主动 脉疾病的首次报道。目前，采用开窗或分支支架技术对复 杂主动脉瘤进行EVAR并重建内脏动脉分支的方式已经被 广泛认可并应用，治疗范围已经从平肾腹主动脉瘤扩展到 TAAA、主动脉弓动脉瘤及慢性夹层动脉瘤。对于解剖条件 适合、无明确禁忌的患者，开窗或分支支架EVAR成为复杂 腹主动脉瘤的首选治疗方案。\n\n【26】AAA腔内修复中内脏动脉分支重建的术前影像学评估\n\n【27】进行复杂TAAA的EVAR前，无论采用何种方式重 建内脏动脉分支，均必须通过高质量的影像学检查对病 变进行详细的评估和测量。目前，对于进行TAAA腔内 修复及内脏动脉分支重建的患者，计算机体层血管成像 《computed tomographyangiography，CTA）是常规的术前 影像学检查方法。术前需要对全主动脉进行薄层CTA检 查，并通过专业的软件来建立高质量的3D重建图像，从而 获得主动脉直径、病变直径、病变长度、病变形态、内脏动 脉发出位置、走向及治疗入路等重要参数，由专业人员进 行仔细的测量和评估后确定内脏动脉分支的重建方式，如 当采用定制开窗或分支支架对内脏动脉分支进行重建时， 需由专业人员通过CTA图像测量主体支架的直径和长度， 从而确定选用支架的类型、大小、位置、朝向等参数，并决 定是否需要采取束径、预置导丝、预置导管等方法，并反 溃给临床医师，双方达成共识后开始制作支架。成品支架 无需根据病变的解剖形态和参数专门进行设计和制作，也\n\n【28】无需医师对支架进行改制，但其临床应用对病变的解剖条 件有一定的要求，术前同样需要对病变的CTA图像进行专 业评估，确定是否符合其应用条件。改制支架则需要有经 验的临床医师采用专业软件对CTA图像中的病变参数进 行测量，从而确定改制支架的相关参数。对于慢性夹层动 脉瘤，还需要通过对真假腔累及的范围、血流动力学情况 及内脏动脉的供血来源进行仔细评估后再制定手术计划。\n\n【29】3.2FEVAR\n\n【30】通过在主动脉覆膜支架上开孔来达到重建内脏血管和 增加支架近端锚定区域的目的，但其运用受到解剖结构的 限制。 国内的FEVAR仍以医师改制支架（physician-modified endograft，PMEG）为主，包括体内原位开窗技术和体外开 窗技术，其中，体外开窗技术在直视下开窗，具有以下优 势：（1）可避开支架骨架，选择恰当的开窗位置和大小。 （2）避免了原位开窗破膜所致动脉栓塞的发生。（3）体外 开窗后可对窗口进行缝合加固，也便于术中释放支架时窗 口的定位。（4）减少了体内开窗时对靶血管造成的损伤。 体外开窗技术也存在局限性，如预开窗技术的难度较高， 需要将窗口与靶血管精准对合，否则将造成靶器官缺血， 并且体外开窗后可能会有支架回装困难的风险。体内原位 开窗技术则是在展开的主动脉支架织物上精准破膜，从而 达到重建内脏血管的目的，具有迅速隔离动脉瘤、开窗位 置准确、避免支架体外释放后体内释放困难的优点，但会 使患者处于短时间的脏器缺血状态，因此，应选择合适的 开窗顺序，将再灌注损伤降至最低。另外，与预开窗一样， 体内原位开窗技术也存在发生内漏的风险。 FEVAR还可使用公司制备的支架，Wang等对100例 使用公司制备的开窗支架的患者的临床资料进行了回顾性 分析，结果显示，手术成功率为98%，术后30d的死亡率为 2%，15%的患者出现内漏，以Ⅱ型内漏为主，表明采用公司 制备支架仍然是安全有效的。Oderich等\\[通过随访时间长 达5年的前瞻性、多中心研究评估了公司制备支架在近肾腹 主动脉瘤（juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm，JRAAA）治 疗中的应用效果，结果显示，术后全因死亡率为11.2%，动 脉瘤相关病死率为3.2%，IA型内漏、IB型内漏患者各1 例，支架移位患者2例，动脉瘤囊扩大患者4例。 Nordon等的研究比较了FEVAR与OSR对JRAAA 的疗效，结果显示，与FEVAR相比，OSR术后30d，患 者的病死率升高了2%。Gouveia等l²的研究系统回顾了 PMEG治疗复杂腹主动脉瘤的效果，成功率为96.1%，择期 手术患者术后30d死亡率为3.0%，急诊患者术后30d死亡 率为97%：PMEG术后成功率和死亡率均在可接受的范围\n\n【31】内。有研究发现，与PG技术相比，PMEG对TAAA的治疗 效果更好，术后Ia型内漏的发生率低，尤其是在TAAAIV 型中（TAAAI~IⅢI型：2.2%PMEG vs 10.0%PG;TAAA IV 型：1.2%PMEGvs21.6%PG）；1年生存率更高，尤其是 在TAAAI～Ⅲ型中（TAAAI~Ⅲ型：PMEG85.0%vs PG 74.0%;TAAAIV型:PMEG 84.0% vs PG 78.0%）\\[13\\]。 推荐意见4：PMEG是目前国内使用较多的一种开窗 方式，分为体内开窗与体外开窗，尽管存在局限性，但仍 可在技术相对成熟的中心开展。（证据等级：C；推荐强度： Ⅱa)\n\n【32】3.3PG技术\n\n【33】平行支架技术将主体支架覆盖重要内脏动脉后，在主 动脉及支架主体之间植入与主体支架平行的覆膜支架，远 端定位于内脏动脉内。平行支架技术分为烟囱支架技术、 潜望镜技术和八爪鱼技术等类型4。 烟囱支架技术是指在腹主动脉支架主体与血管之间， 利用支架建立一个与主体平行的烟图状管道，开口于近 心端，用于重建重要内脏动脉。2019年欧洲血管外科学会 (EuropeanSocietyforVascularSurgery，ESVS）发布的指南 推荐，当近端锚定区大于15mm、主体支架放大率达30%、 烟肉支架重建数目不超过2支内脏动脉时，可获得最佳的 治疗效果，在进行EVAR的过程中，意外覆盖重要内脏 动脉分支后也可使用烟窗状移植物进行补救。大部分烟窗 伏移植物被更大的主动脉支架移植物紧紧包围，具有良好 的近端封闭性，然而相对较大的烟囱状移植物会在周围产 生大的缝隙，导致近端I型内漏的发生。潜望镜技术与烟 肉技术类似，区别在于通过潜望镜支架在主体远端锚定区 逆行性供给内脏动脉分支。烟肉支架与潜望镜支架的优势 在于操作相对简单，手术时间较短，材料获取容易，适合 般情况不佳、无法耐受长时间手术的危重及急诊患者。 Taneva等\\[5的研究回顾了2008一2014年伯克利注册记录 中使用3个烟卤支架和4个烟肉支架腔内修复肾上型腹主 动脉瘤（suprarenal abdominalaortic aneurysm，SRAAA）的 病例，植入成功率为97.1%，2年内无烟卤支架相关死亡病 例。Cherfan等\\[的研究回顾了1997—2020年58例接受烟 图或潜望镜支架治疗患者的临床资料，发现术后即刻和随 访期间的并发症发生率高，手术结束时，有16例患者出现 内漏；住院期间，有12例患者需返回手术室再次进行手术 治疗；在随访过程中，58例患者中，有14例患者出现一处 或多处内漏。Taneva等\\[5和Cherfan等\\[的研究结论有所 矛盾的原因可能是因为采用2个以上烟肉支架治疗方案的 中心通常操作经验较为丰富，并且后者的急诊手术患者数 量较多（16.5%Vs36.2%）。\n\n【34】推荐意见5：平行支架技术与主体支架技术之间存在 的缝隙是造成内漏的重要因素，但仍是一种安全、有效且 现成的治疗手段，也可用于复杂的内脏主动脉瘤修复。（证 据等级：B；推荐强度：I） 推荐意见6：烟肉支架与潜望镜支架技术简单，易操 作，不仅可运用于危重及急诊患者，还可作为EVAR过程 中意外覆盖重要内脏动脉后的补救措施。（证据等级：B； 推荐强度：I）\n\n【35】3.4 BEVAR\n\n【36】BEVAR是一种在主体支架上附加额外覆膜示支架的 技术，起到重建内脏动脉分支的作用。分支支架分为外分 支支架和内分支支架。在使用外分支支架时，分支开口水 平需要较实际靶分支血管高出1~2cm，同时内脏动脉分支 水平的主动脉直径也要大于主体支架直径，从而保证一定 的操作空间，但是，当主动脉支架主体与动脉瘤壁之间的 空间相对较小时，外分支支架可能被动脉瘤壁压迫或者扭 转，从而使导管无法通过，此时，内分支支架可以解决这 问题，但内分支支架会缩减支架主体内的空间，尤其是 在需要进行多条内脏动脉分支重建的情况下，故也存在局 限性，因此，临床上通常采取内分支支架与外分支支架相 结合的方式重建TAAA的内脏动脉分支。 目前，一款定制分支支架胸腹主动脉覆膜支架系统 FIM研究的中期随访结果较好，受试者状态良好，未发生 内漏、支架移位及分支血管狭窄或闭塞，并且于2021年11 月正式开启临床试验。Cook公司的另一款定制分支支架 适用于复杂腹主动脉瘤（abdominalaortic aneurysm，AAA） 及TAAA的修复，已在临床应用多年。Chuter等\\[7于2001 年首次应用该定制分支支架成功治疗TAAA并进行内脏动 脉分支的重建。Greenberg等\\[\\]于2009年首次报道了该定 制分支支架治疗复杂AAA的多中心临床研究结果。其他 类似的临床研究同样证实了该定制分支支架在复杂AAA、 TAAA治疗及内脏动脉分支重建中的良好应用效果\\[19-2\\]。 定制支架的设计、制作和运输通常需要6~8个星期，不适 用于需要急诊手术的患者，包括需要急诊手术的TAAA患 者，如症状性TAAA或破裂性TAAA，对于这些病例，成 品分支支架是更加合适的选择。大部分采用定制支架进行 TAAA的患者，其解剖条件也同样适用于成品分支支架的 修复，研究表明，采用定制支架进行腔内修复的TAAA患 者中，有49%~88%的患者同时符合成品分支支架的适用 修复指征\\[22-24。同样，有研究表明，对于解剖条件合适的患 者，成品分支支架与定制支架在治疗的安全性、有效性及 持久性方面无明显差别\\[25-26。目前，临床上，已有一款外分 支支架是已经获批用于TAAA腔内修复的成品分支支架，\n\n【37】临床应用广泛，相关的临床应用数据大部分来自于此支 架，但该支架对管腔有一定的要求，较为狭窄的管腔可能 会导致分支压迫、折叠等不良事件发生。对于慢性夹层动 脉瘤的治疗，外分支支架还有可能通过真假腔之间的内膜 破口延伸至假腔，导致治疗的失败\\[2”。Bosiers等\\[2的研究 对该款支架的安全性进行了短期评估，结果显示，治疗后 30d和1年病死率均较低，分别是1.3%、8.8%，1年内主体 通畅率为100%。一篇纳入7篇文献（197例患者）的系统性 回顾及Meta分析发现，对于择期或急诊进行的主动脉瘤修 复，该款分支支架均是安全、有效的治疗选择”，部分其 他分支支架亦表现出可接受的安全性和有效性30-3\\]。\n\n【38】推荐意见7：外分支支架适用于瘤腔腹主动脉瘤或可\n\n【39】以使用内分支支架与外分支支架相结合的方式重建TAAA 的内脏动脉分支。（证据等级：C；推荐强度：Ⅱa） 推荐意见8：大部分的分支支架表现出可接受的短期 安全性和有效性，但仍需在样本量更大的人群中进行长期 的研究。（证据等级：B；推荐强度：Ⅱ）\n\n【40】3.5定制和成品支架相对于PMEG的优缺点\n\n【41】PMEG存在如下缺点：（1）支架的改制缺乏质量控制， 支架的选择、改制及释放等完全取决于操作医师的经验。 改制支架可能会导致支架的整体结构被破坏，增加相关并 发症的发生风险。（2）手术过程中，医师进行支架改制的 时间通常需要1~2个小时，增加了手术本身的耗时。（3）若 未经批准进行临床试验，PMEG的应用还存在潜在的法律 纠纷。相对于PMEG，定制支架的整体结构不会被破坏，主 体支架可以根据血管解剖特点设计为正向或倒向锥形，而 开窗或分支的位置、方向和数量也是针对每个患者的解剖 形态而个性化设计的。目前，定制支架里面可以放置预置 导丝和预置导管来协助重建分支，简化了手术操作的步骤， 降低了手术操作的难度。有些定制支架输送系统从22F降 低到了18F或者20F，减少了入路相关并发症的发生\\[\"。 由于定制支架和成品支架相对于PMEG有许多优势， 定制支架和成品支架在欧美国家应用的比例逐年提高。 2007一2016年美国梅奥医院单中心应用CMD和PMEG 治疗316例复杂主动脉瘤患者，PMEG的应用比例从2007 年的100%下降至2011—2013年的66%，再下降至2014一 2016年的4%，在该中心，PMEG仅应用于包裹性动脉瘤破 裂、症状性动脉瘤及不适用于开窗或成品分支支架治疗的 患者32。目前，PMEG在中国实际临床应用中占据了主流。 因此，虽然定制支架相对于PMEG有许多优点，但现阶段 尚不能完全取代PMEG。 推荐意见9：在中国，PMEG目前在实际临床应用中占 据了主流。虽然定制支架相对于PMEG有许多优点，但现\n\n【42】阶段还不能完全取代PMEG的应用。（证据等级：C；推荐 强度：Ⅱa）\n\n【43】4TAAA的杂交手术修复\n\n【44】4.1手术适应证\n\n【45】1999年，Quinones-Baldrich等\\[33\\]首次描述了肾下主动 脉置换术与支架植入术相结合治疗胸腹主动脉病变的效 果，这种血管内治疗和手术杂交的治疗方法降低了发病率 和病死率，中期疗效良好3-34。与OSR相比，杂交手术具有 更小的手术切口和更短的手术时间，无需开胸术、单肺通 气、主动脉血流阻断及体外循环，从理论上讲，它不仅可以 降低肺部并发症和脊髓缺血的发生率35\\]，还部分解决了血 管内治疗的速度、可行性和成本问题。杂交手术结合了OSR 和血管内修复的优点，为一般情况较差、合并症较多、不能 耐受传统OSR、病变范围太广、解剖学复杂而无法进行血管 内修复治疗的患者提供了一种新的治疗选择。有研究发现， 美国麻醉医师协会（AmericanSocietyofAnesthesiologists， ASA）评分≥3分、合并夹层动脉瘤及术前肾功能不全的 TAAA患者可能更加适合采用去分支杂交手术\\[3\\]。 推荐意见10：杂交手术主要适用于一般情况较差、合 并症较多、不能耐受传统OSR、病变范围太广且解剖学复 杂而无法进行血管内修复治疗的TAAA患者。（证据等级： A；推荐强度：I）\n\n【46】4.2手术方式\n\n【47】杂交手术作为TAAA开放修复术高风险患者的替代 方法，具有以下优点：（1）避免了开胸手术；（2）避免了 主动脉交叉钳夹，缩短了内脏缺血时间；（3）降低了血流 动力学稳定条件下神经系统并发症的发生风险，如截瘫、 下肢轻瘫。杂交手术的原理将TAAA治疗分为两部分\\[3\\]， 第一部分是重建内脏血管，为支架植入提供合适的锚定区 域，第二部分是通过股动脉采用介入的方式进行TAAA腔 内隔绝术。通常以肾下腹主动脉或一侧骼总动脉作为供血 动脉进行逆行内脏动脉分支重建，需要注意的是，内脏动 脉吻合后需在起始处结扎，以防术后Ⅱ型内漏的发生，杂 交手术无需重建肋间动脉。\n\n【48】5TAAA术后并发症的预防及治疗\n\n【49】5.1脊髓缺血\n\n【50】脊髓缺血（spinalcordischemia，SCI）和截瘫是TAAA 血管内修复术的严重并发症之一，虽然截瘫的发生率低于 开放修复术后的截瘫率，但SCI仍然是一个重大问题。SCI\n\n【51】的危险因素包括动脉瘤范围、是否进行过OSR修复、是否 有远端主动脉手术史和是否存在围手术期低血压。此外， 肋间动脉和侧支血管的缺失、手术时间也被认为是SCI的 潜在影响因素。目前，预防TAAA修复术后SCI的措施包 括脑脊液引流、避免围手术期低血压、分期修复以及建立 短期且可控的内漏，以保证动脉瘤和脊髓灌注。此外，围 手术期降低体温和鞘内药物剂量可能会成为辅助保护措 施。尽管术中神经监测不一定是预防措施，但可以通过早 期识别脊髓灌注不良情况，从而迅速采取措施改善脊髓灌 注，降低术后SCI的发生率。\n\n【52】5.1.1脑脊液引流\n\n【53】脑脊液引流在OSR及腔内修复术中均得到广泛应用， 作为有创性治疗手段，其会引发一定的并发症，考虑到大 部分TAAA患者长期口服抗凝药物和抗血小板药物，脑 脊液引流的概率更高。建议对有主动脉手术史、骼内动脉 严重病变等高危患者预防性进行脑脊液引流；对低危（如 无主动脉手术史或单纯CrawfordIV型）患者则不进行预 防性脑脊液引流。进行脑脊液引流前，必须纠正患者合 并的凝血障碍，并维持脑脊液压力<10mmHg（1mmHg= 0.133kPa），引流量控制在12~15ml/h，尽可能降低相关风险。 推荐意见11：建议对有主动脉手术史、骼内动脉严重 病变等高危患者预防性进行脑脊液引流；对低危（如无主 动脉手术史或单纯CrawfordIV型）患者不预防性进行脑脊 液引流。（证据等级：C；推荐强度：Ⅱa）\n\n【54】5.1.2全身低温及主动脉远端灌注\n\n【55】在常温下，人的中枢神经系统对缺血的耐受能力有限， 心脏停搏或停止循环后5分钟内即出现神经元功能障碍。 脊髓中的灰质代谢率高，对缺血较敏感\\[3。全身低温不仅 可减少新陈代谢和耗氧量，还可减轻再灌注过程中的炎症 和兴奋毒性反应，从而在停止循环期间有效保护中枢神经 系统。在TAAA的OSR中，主动脉交叉夹闭时间的长短是 导致SCI发生的主要原因之一。左心搭桥（left heart bypass， LHB)和CPB可有效保证顺序主动脉交叉夹闭期间脊髓、 内脏器官和肾脏的血供，是减少脊髓缺血的重要保障。 推荐意见12：全身低温可在心脏停搏期间有效保护中 枢神经系统。（证据等级：A；推荐强度：I）

NRP uses in situ perfusion with oxygenated blood using an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit or cardiopulmonary bypass circuit.1 In 2020,Vanderbilt University and New York University became the first US programs to use NRP for DCD heart donors.12 Reports of heart, liver, and kidney transplant recipient outcomes in the United States showed excellent early results.13- Despite the promising clinical outcomes for recipients of NRP donors, ethical uncertainty surround- ing the procedure has been voiced by several groups.6.7\n\n【11】UNITEDKINGDOMPERSPECTIVEONNRP\n\n【12】CHRISTOPHERWATSON)\n\n【13】Both Spain and the United Kingdom have used NRP or decades.8-10 The first UK TA-NRP case occurred\n\n【14】onNovember 5,2006,which was followed by several years offunding and researchbutwas paused because of ethical concerns about possible brain perfusion through collateral flow. In Spain, the use of TA-NRP for heart transplantation has continued with a protocol requir- ing mandatory ligation of the3 aortic archvessels and venting of the cephalad ends to the atmosphere before the initiation of NRP.l1 The first UK A-NRP case was performed in 2010,and the first liver transplant from an NRP donor in the United Kingdom was performed in 2011.By 2018,43 NRP liver transplants had been performed in the United Kingdom, with improved early graft function, graft survival, and recipient renal func- tioncomparedwithliver transplantrecipients from rapid recovery DCD donors.1 Moreover, no ischemic cholangiopathy was associated with NRP, whereas it was observed in 27% with rapid recovery and static cold storage. Because of this early success, A-NRP has been widely adopted in the United Kingdom and a national program has been developed for mentoring, protocoli zation of technique, and review of outcomes. The UK protocol for A-NRP uses femoral vascular cannulation orintra-abdominal aorta and vena cava cannulation with occlusion of the thoracic aorta and venting of the ascending aortato air.A standard NRP data collection\n\n【15】Future directions in NRP\n\n【16】Statementofneeds\n\n| Standardization of NRPproceduresQualitative research  | The following elements of the NRP process for both TA- and A-NRP need to be systematically implemented across the Unites States to standardize the procedure:· Communication: prerecovery phone discussion, on-site preprocedure team briefing, intraoperative time out to ensureexclusion of cerebral circulation· Case event recording: time of death, time of incision, start of agonal time (with agreement on the criteria for agonaltime), time of NRP initiation.· Technical standards: damping or venting location and confirmation techniques, cannulation techniques· Certification of procurement surgeons who perform NRP proceduresThe following avenues of qualitative research need to be developed for further assessment of perceptions and experienceswith NRP DCD organ donation:· Public perceptions of NRP donation procedures· Donor family experiences and perceptions of NRP donation  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Quantitative research  | · Donor hospital staff experiences and perceptions of NRP donationThe following quantitative research topics need to be addressed to further understand the impact of NRP organ donationprocedures· Recipient outcomes for all solid organ transplant types· Donor characteristics and functional warm ischemic times associated with acceptable and unacceptable recipient outcomesOrgan utilization rates were standard rapid recovery with and without ex situ machine perfusion  |\n\n【18】sheet is used by all centers and made available to receiv- ingcentersforreview.12 Because TA-NRP is on pause in the United Kingdom, techniques havebeen developed for the direct procure- ment and perfusion (DPP) of thoracic organs using ex situ machine perfusion.13.14 Although thoracic DPP is possible in combination with A-NRP, the competing needs of the abdominal and thoracic teams and the different technolo- gies that arenotcomplementarymakewidespreadutiliza- tion of this complex procurement procedure challenging. Because TA-NRP can perfuse abdominaland thoracic organs simultaneously with a single machine and a uni- fied procurement technique, it has the greatest potential for more effcient utilization of all organs for transplanta- tion. As a result, there are efforts underway in the United Kingdom to bring TA-NRP back into practice following legalandethicalguidelines\n\n【19】USLEGALCONSIDERATIONSINNRPORGAN\n\n【20】Thelegalparametersthat govern the determination of death are central to debates about NRP organprocure- ment.Notably,until the1960s,death was determined solely by cardiopulmonary criteria.This changed with the intro- duction of new technologies including mechanical ventila- tion and defibrillation.In1967,the Ad Hoc Committee of Harvard introduced the concept of death by neurologic criteria as defined by irreversible coma,1 and this became a legal construct of death in the United States in 1968. In 1981, the Uniform Determination of Death Act (UDDA)16 was introduced to develop consistent criteria for death throughout the United States.According to the UDDA eitherset of criteria for thedetermination of death(neuro- logic or cardiopulmonary) is sufficient for both the declara- tion of death and proceeding with organ procurement. Much of the legal debate around NRP centers was on the term irreversibility,which isused for both the\n\n【21】neurologic andcardiopulmonarydeterminations of death under the UDDA.Irreversibility is, in this context, defined as cessation of function that cannot be restarted.However, given the advancement of technology, it is now possible to restore or replace organ function with aggressive inter vention. Therefore,the concept of irreversible has been replaced with the concept of permanent,which means that once function has ceased,it cannot resume spontaneously. From a legal standpoint,there is debate about whether NRP procurement techniques meet the criteria for the determination of death.The UDDA codifies the egaldefinition of deathby eithercirculatory/respiratory or neurologic criteria and specifies that“the determina tionof deathmust bemadein accordancewith accepted medical standards.” Notably, prefatory notes to the UDDA state that“the common law standard for deter- mining death is the cessation of all vital functions, tra- ditionallydemonstratedby an absence of spontaneous respiratory and cardiac functions.16 The central legal question that TA-NRP highlights is if the perfusion of organs, including the heart which restarts, negates the circulatory determination of death.The exact meaning of irreversibility is central to the answer to this ques- tion.In terms of common law, spontaneity was part of the intended definition of irreversibility. If that is the case,many have argued that permanence is a better term than irreversible because permanence means that spontaneous circulatory and respiratory functions have stopped and will not be restarted.17 Having an exact time of death is essential not onlyfor the purposes of organ donation but also for the transfer of property rights, estate taxation, and the determination of when healthcare decisions can be made.Based on current US law, combining accepted medical standards and intent regarding withdraw life-sustaining interventions, the irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory func- tions can be consistent with TA-NRP techniques if we greethatthecommonlawint 1oftheabsen\n\n【22】ofspontaneousrespiratoryandcirculatoryfunctionsis met and that the intent of the process (to allow for death to happen and not to resuscitate the person after death has been declared) leads to permanent cessation of cir- culatory and respiratory function to the entire body. including the brain. In other words,if regional perfusion does not resume spontaneous, full body, circulatory, and respiratory functions, then TA-NRP meets legal stand- ards for the determination of death.Opening theUDDA to revision would likely result in more restrictive inter- pretations of death rather than more clarity in the ter- minology. Fortunately, the Uniform Law Commission leadership recently decided to pause the revision of the UDDA indefinitely (Judge Samuel Thumma, Chair of theUniformLawCommission'sDetermination of Death Committee,e-mail communication,September 22,2023).\n\n【23】ETHICALCONSIDERATIONSINNRPORGAN\n\n【24】From an ethical standpoint,the first objection to NRPdonation is that the procedure negates circulatory Heath ethically, even if it does not violate legal norms, oecause it “restarts circulation.\"As noted previously, NRP does not meet the strict irreversibility standard that states that circulatory and respiratory functions nave stopped and cannot be restarted because most other organ functions can be restarted with or replaced by mechanical assistance. NRP does meet the perma- nence standard that states circulatory and respiratory functions have stopped and cannot resume spontane- ously.NRP does not restore circulatory and respiratory Functions but rather provides in situ perfusion to the organs intended for transplantation. Because the DCD Honor is observedfor atleast 5min of no cardiopulmo- nary activity before the confirmation of death to ensure n0 autoresuscitation, the donor is dead at the initia- tion of the NRP procedure.18 Simply restoring organ Function with mechanical assistance does not restore life-defining, spontaneous circulatory and respiratory function. A second ethical objection to NRPis that the ligation ofbloodvesselstothebrainbeforeinitiationofNRP causes the death of the donor and, therefore, makes NRP inconsistent with the Dead Donor Rule, which states that organ procurement must not cause death. In response to this objection, we must be clear on the NRP procedure and the terminology used to describe t.The donor has been declared dead by circulatory cri- reria. The NRP procedure that follows entails regional perfusion and preservation of the organs intended for ransplantation.NRP does not result in the reanima- tion or resuscitation of the person because it limits perfusion to the organs being assessed for transplanta- ion.Very clearly, ligation of blood vessels to the brain cannot cause death because the donor is already dead. Another ethicalobjection toNRPis that there may be a risk that the donor could have an “experience” of donation via NRP (eg, a level of conscious awareness). This must be addressed with research on brain func- tion during NRP.\n\n【25】NEUROPHYSIOLOGYANDTHENRPDONOR\n\n【26】Onecentral focusof thismeetingwason theneurophys- iology of brain blood flow and how this can be interpreted in NRP DCD organ donation.A concern with NRP DCD donation is that there is not sufficient evidence to demon- strate that clamping is adequate to maintain the state of absence of brainfunction throughminimization of flow. From a neurological perspective, brain blood flow has been extensivelystudied in terms of normal function and stroke physiology.19-21Normal brain blood flow is approximately 50mL/100g/min, or 800mL/min,which is 15% to 20% of the body's cardiac output. Electrical activity ceases at a blood flow at <16 to 18 mL/100 g/min, membrane integrity is disrupted at ≤10 to 12mL/100g/min, and a stroke core has a flow of 4 to 8mL/100g/min.20,21 The oft-cited arti- cle by Manera et al (2019)²² that demonstrated collateral blood flow to the brain after clamping in a TA-NRP donor estimated the flow rate to be 3.9mL/100 mg/min, which is below the flow rate compatible with life, or more specifi- cally, with a resumption of neuronal activity. One area of research in need of clarification on the ethi- cal objection to NRP that there could be sufficient flow to the brain after clamping the brachiocephlic vessels to result in neuronal function is real-time flow studies in NRP donors. In a study of TA-NRP donors at New York University, transcranial Doppler of the anterior and poste rior circulation was conducted before the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment and after TA-NRP initiation.3 In this protocol, after the sternotomy,the brachiocephalic,left common carotid, and left subclavian arteries were ligated before initiating TA-NRP.In the 2 cases for which this study was conducted, neither donor had flow evident by transcranial Doppler after the initiation of TA-NRP, and both had no brainstem reflexes, no spontaneous respira- tory effort, and no spontaneous movement, confirming the absence of brain function.A second study onbrainblood flow in NRP donors from University Hospital Marqués de Valdecilla used intracerebral arterial blood pressure (ICBP) monitoring during NRP procedures.2 This study included 8 A-NRP donors and 2 TA-NRP donors. A All A-NRP donors had normalization of abdominal aortic blood pressure, whereas ICBP and thoracic aortic blood pressure remained static at the level observed after circu latory arrest. In the TA-NRP donors, the blood pressure in the thoracic and abdominal aorta normalized on NRP whereasICBP remained static at the level observed after circulatory arrest.\n\n【27】DONATION(ANJIWALL)\n\n【28】Beyond askingwhetherNRPmeets the baseline ethical standards for the acceptability of DCD organ donation, we should also consider a broader conceptualization of the ethical framework for DCD donation. Historically, concerns about harm to the donor, such as the poten- tial to hasten death and conflict with the Dead Donor Rule, have been the driving forces for the assessment of the acceptability of DCD organ donation.7 In the 1997 report on Non-Heart-Beating Organ Transplantation, theInstitute of Medicine namedavoidingharm On\n\n【29】potential harm to the donor patient as thefirst underly- ing ethical consideration for DCD donation.2 The other ethical considerations included supporting donor and Family choice and avoiding conflicts ofinterestbetween organ procurement and donor patient care.The Institute of Medicine did not present extensive empirical data in their report but did interview2families whowanted to pursue DCD donation and were unable because of poli- cies that would not allow it. The report notes that “in ooth cases, the loss of the option to donate organs was a source of deep regret to the families and compounded their feelings of loss25 This concept has been termed the“harm of no donation.\" If a family authorizes and intends for organ donation to occur and it does not, this produces a second hit to an already tragic situation oecause one good thing\\_that could have resulted from deathdoesnothappen. Three donor family narratives were presented in the meetingthat helpedcontextualizethepersonalmeaning of organ donation for families of decedents.2 27,28A1l3 family representatives described the immense pain of losing a loved one and how organ donation positively impacted their grieving process.In-person donor fam- ilymembers had childrenwhowere donors after the neurologic declaration of death. When asked if they would have been accepting of DCD, and specifically NRP DCD donation,both were concerned that provid- ing too much complex information to donor families would be overwhelming and that they would not have oeen able to process the information in their own cir- cumstances. They would have proceeded with donation based on their perception that this is what their loved onewould have wanted and that the procurement team would only perform medically and ethically acceptable procedures. Based on these discussions and centering on the fam- ily experiences with organ donation, we suggest that the obligation to respect the donation decision should be the ethical lens through which DCD processes and protocols are assessed. If we stay within the ethical guardrails off DCD donation by avoiding harm to the potential donor, then we should strive to make donation possible. Organ recovery procedures that increase the opportunity for organ utilization are associated with better recipient out- comes and are not just ethically acceptable but ethically obligatory.\n\n【30】TICALCAREPERSPECTIVE(LEWISKAPLAI\n\n【31】ANDCHERYLEE CHANGI\n\n【32】ANDCHERYLEECHANGI\n\n【33】The critical care perspective on NRP DCD donation focuses on how this procedure integrates into end-of-life care.The concept of goal-concordant care is central to end-of-life decision-making in the intensive care unit and means that the care provided has a reasonable chance of achieving the goal of the treatment. DCD organ donation within goal-concordant care for a nonsurvivable illness or injury when the decision has been made to transition to comfort care and organ donation is an option. NRP is consistent with goal-concordant care when a decision has been made to transition to comfort care because it allows for donation to occur after death, just as with standard DCDdonation.\n\n【34】POSITIONOFASTSANDAMERICAN\n\n【35】SOCIETYOFTRANSPLANTATIONONNRP\n\n【36】The ASTS recognizes that there are ethical considera- tions regarding NRP procedures but feels strongly that NRP saves lives and offers an ethically sound donation modality that does not violate essential moral, philosophi- cal, or bioethical principles. NRP must be implemented in a way that maximizes the number of patient life years saved and follows the highest ethical standards. To do this, several committeeswill be formed to provide guidelines for the standard of care and ethical boundaries for the con- duct of TA- and A-NRP. The American Society of Transplantation supports the use of NRP29 From a scientific perspective, NRP will increase organ use, reduce organ injury, and improve out- comes. To preserve public trust in organ donation, ethi- cal issues need tobe investigated,navigated,and discussed but are not insurmountable.NRP must be conducted within the confines of the UDDA.Finally, communication with donor families is paramount to ensure transparency. Further research is needed to assess families’information needs and communication strategies in a family-centered approach.\n\n【37】FUTUREDIRECTIONS:PROTOCOLIZATIONOFTA-\n\n【38】Currently,DCD protocols are developed by individual donor hospitals and procurement techniques are center specific. The variability in both protocols and techniques can lead to confusion, concerns about ethical acceptabil- ity, and lower organ utilization. Standards for both TA- and A-NRP procedures need to be developed and include communication expectations, recording of times and intraoperative events, technical steps, and organ viability assessment. In addition, certification standards for pro- curement surgeons should be developed likethatfor other deceasedorgandonationprocedures.\n\n【39】FUTUREDIRECTIONS:RESEARCH(ALEAH\n\n【40】Both qualitativeresearch,which addresses stakeholders perceptions and experiences with NRP, and quantitative research,which assesses outcomes and other metrics, are essential for the advancement of NRPDCD organ dona- tion.Qualitative research can be used tounderstand and describe phenomena and human behaviors from an indi- vidual's point of view, examining how context (eg, social, cultural, political, economic, historical) shapes processes and events.Through the conduct of interviews,focus groups, direct observations,and case studies, investigators can ascertain the meaning of events or experiences that drive human behaviors to develop and test theories. There is a paucity of qualitative research that has examined attitudes toward NRP DCDdonation in the United States. Two Canadian studies, one on public per- ceptions and other one on healthcare provider percep- tions,assessed cardiac DCD donation with both DPP and NRP through closed-ended surveys with few open-ended\n\n【41】response questions. Public perceptions generally sup- ported the implementation of cardiac DCD protocols,but respondents expressed concerns about\\_the possibility of consciousness during NRP procedures.30 Healthcare pro- viders expressed concerns that the public would not under- stand or accept cardiac DCD donation and that restarting cardiac activity after death would be confusing to the lay public.31 In the United States, research should assess stakeholder perceptions of NRP DCD, focusing specif- cally on ethnic and racial minorities and religious groups with historically and currently low rates of deceased organ donation. Knowledge gaps with respect to public percep- tions include perceptions of DCD donation, perceptions of different procurement techniques, information needs, and the impact of utilization of NRP on public trust in organ donation. Quantitative research is also necessary for the continued development of NRP in the United States.Current data from the ScientificRegistry of Transplant Recipients are limited in collection of recovery and storage modalities, time to initiation of recovery modality, type, and duration of NRP when used and intraoperative laboratory trends for NRP donors.Because national data are lacking, deter- mination of best practices for point of care testing, dura- tion of NRP, thresholds, and definitions of functional warm ischemic time cannot be developed.A dedicated database that collects data on these variables and donor variables (eg, age,body mass index, infectious hepatitis, other risk factors) is necessary for the data-driven expansion of DCD donation that maintains excellent recipient outcomes while simultaneouslyexpandingthede eddonorpool.\n\n【42】CONCLUSIONS\n\n【43】The ASTS is fully cognizant of ethical concerns raised regarding NRP, which mostly focuses on TA-NRP, yet supports the ongoing utilization of both A and TA-NRP. Our society strongly feels that NRP not only saves lives but also offers a donation modality that does notviolate essential moral,philosophical, and bioethical medical pre- cepts.Finally, donor and donor family autonomy need to be considered in the ethical assessment of current or future technologies used to expand the donor pool, focusing on defining information needs, ensuring comprehension and yoluntariness in decision-making, and minimizing the harms of no donation.\n\n【44】ACHIEVEMENTS,CHALLENGES,ANDNEXT\n\n【45】This conference achieved a consensus opinion on the legal and ethical aspects of NRP by bringing together a multi- disciplinary team of experts and laid out an agenda for research and national standard development for NRP in the United States.

The goal of these docu ments is to provide practical answers to common clinical questions based on the best evidence avail- able. They address focused topics for which the levels of evidence guiding care may not be strong and/or practice is controversial, and are based on expert consensus and review of the literature. This issue focuses on the diagnosis and management of rhabdomyolysis in the critically ill surgical/trauma patient.\n\n【6】METHODS\n\n【7】skeletal muscle injury, resulting in cell death and release of potentially toxic substances into circu- lation. Management often centers on prevention or treatment of the primary complication of the condition, acute kidney injury (AKI). Here we briefly review the causes, diagnosis, management, and outcomesof rhabdomyolysis.\n\n【8】In what patient populations should\n\n【9】Recommendation Rhabdomyolysis should be suspected in patients with a large burden of traumatic injury involving muscular tissue, especially patients with crush inju- ries involving the extremities or mangled extrem- ities. Patients with vascular injuries or muscle ischemia with subsequent reperfusion are also at higherriskforrhabdomyolysis.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Rhabdomyolysis is the result of skeletal muscle breakdown with release of potentially toxic substances such as electrolytes, myoglobin, and sarcoplasmic proteins into the bloodstream.1 The pathophysiology underlying all cases of rhabdomy- olysis is disruption of the myocyte cell membrane and leakage of cell contents into circulation.2 This may result from direct myocyte injury related to trauma or from metabolic disturbances affecting supply of ATP within the myocyte.H \\\\ Traumatic injuries are a common cause of rhab- domyolysis. One study has shown some degree of biochemical evidence of rhabdomyolysis (abnormal creatine kinase (CK)） among 85% of critically injured patients admitted to a trauma intensive care unit setting, although only 10% developed renal failure and only 5% required renal replacement therapy (RRT).4 Patients with multisystem trauma, crush injuries involving the extremities or torso, and those with compartment syndrome of one or more extremities are at highest risk.s Other inde- pendent risk factors for rhabdomyolysis among trauma patients include age older than 55 years, Injury Severity Score greater than 16, penetrating trauma with vascular injury, severe extremity injury, male sex, and body mass index greater than 30kg/ m2.4 6 Patients who fall with subsequent prolonged immobilization are also at higher risk for rhabdo- myolysis, particularly if their limbs are compressed by their head or torso for a significant period of\n\n【12】The topic for this document was chosen through discussion by the AAST Critical Care Committee.A subgroup was formed composed of the document's authors.The subgroup formulated the clinical ques- tions to be addressed and assigned research and writing tasks.Authors were tasked with researching their clinical questions through literature review and writing their\\_ section. Literature review was performed by the individual authors pertaining to their clinical questions. Recommendations, refer- ences,and content were then reviewed by the subgroup and revised based on feedback to achieve consensus.

Alcohol abuse or dependence may actually be the most common risk factor for rhabdomyolysis; ethanol has direct adverse effects on muscle tissue metabolism and cellular integrity including inhibition of active transport pumps.3 Otherillicit substances such as cocaine, heroin, and phencyclidine may also be implicated in cases of rhabdomyolysis. Lipid-lowering agents, especially statins, are a common cause of rhabdomyolysis,particularly in patients with concomitant renal or liver insufficiency.10 Infections such as influenza,Epstein-Barr virus, Streptococcus pyogenes, or Staph- ylococcus aureus may rarely lead to rhabdomyolysis.1 Genetic diseases including disorders of glycolysis or glycogenolysis lipid metabolism defects, or mitochondrial disorders are rare causes of rhabdomyolysis.1 Finally, rhabdomyolysis may be seen in patients with extreme alterations in body temperature due to conditions such as malignant hyperthermia,heat stroke, or neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Metabolic etiology for rhab- domyolysis is very broad and a number of different risk factors may need to be considered in this population.\n\n【19】CLINICALMANIFESTATION\n\n【20】Whatclinicalfindingsareexpectedwithrhabdomyolys\n\n【21】Rhabdomyolysis presentation may vary from asymptomatic to commonly implicated clinical features, including acute muscle weakness, pain/tenderness, and swelling (dolor, tumor) of the affected extremity or body region.1² Darkened (tea-colored) urine may be an additional common finding. A low threshold of clinical suspicion in the proper laboratory and historical context is warranted toinitiate appropriate therapy.\n\n【22】Discussion Rhabdomyolysis is a clinical syndrome consequent to skeletal muscle cell death with release of intracellular contents (described\n\n【23】in next section) into the circulation.12 Resultant organ dysfunc tion may include renal (AKI), cardiac (arrhythmia), and coag ulopathy. Despite this cluster of findings, there is no formally held definition for rhabdomyolysis and clinical presentations may vary greatly. Commonly implicated muscle groups are the extremities and the lower back. Superficial pressure ulceration or blistering may suggest the diagnosis, but is not a reliable finding. At the extremes of pathology, compartment syndromes of affected muscle groups ead to increased morbidity and poten- tial need for decompression.13\n\n【24】What laboratoryfindings aid inthe diagnosisof\n\n【25】The most commonly implicated variables include elevated serum concentrations of CK (>5× the upper limit of normal or >10ooIU/L), myoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), potassium, creatinine, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Elevated urine myoglobin provides additional evidence. A low threshold of suspicion in the proper clinical context is warranted to initiate appropriate therapy. A strategy for disease monitoring with serial CK measurement should be additionally undertaken. Interval CK values should be followed until a peak concentra- tion is identified (typically at 24-72 hours), discontinued once the CK is reliably downtrending.\n\n【26】Discussior\n\n【27】Traumatic or non-traumatic injury to the skeletal muscle cellular membrane leads to an influx of calcium into the cytoplasm, disrupting celular homeostasis and leading to cell death. Injury may be exacerbated by the generation of reactive oxygen species after restoration of blood flood to the affected tissue (reper- fusion injury). The resulting effect is the accumulation of CK, myoglobin, LDH, and potassium in the circulation.2 In a recent systematic review, the laboratory definition of rhabdomyolysis varied to include an elevated CK level >5x the upper limit of normal or >1000 IU/L, with the CK-MM subtype being the most reflective of skeletal muscle injury.12 CK values may become elevated within 12hours of injury, peak at 24 to 72 hours, and return to normal in roughly 5 days, depending on the degree of injury and appropriate therapy. 八 格 Myoglobin becomes elevated in the circulation once intrinsic binding proteins are overwhelmed. Given a shorter half-life (1-3hours) versus CK, myoglobin may elevate and resolve prior to CK depreciating its clinical utility. Myoglobin may also be evident in the urine and, although the sensitivity has been reported up to 100%, the specificity varies widely from 15% to 88%.5 Although a causal relationship may exist between rhabdo- myolysis and elevations in hepatic aminotransferases (AST, ALT: alanine transaminase), this is of unclear value as both enzymes exist within skeletal muscle and may become elevated as a result of primary muscle injury.78 14 15\n\n【28】MANAGEMENT\n\n【29】What is the optimal crystalloid type, rate of administration, and urine output goalstopreventAKl in rhabdomyolysis? Recommendation Either lactated Ringer's solution or saline (0.9% or 0.45%) is an acceptable fluid for resuscitation in rhabdomyolysis A starting rate of 400 mL/hour can be initiated, with goal-directed therapy of urine output of 1 mL/kg/hour to 3 mL/kg/hour, and up to 300cc/hour.\n\n【30】Discussionun Although early-volume resuscitation in rhabdomyolysis is well accepted as a mainstay of promoting renal tubule flow, diluting nephrotoxins such as myoglobin, and supplying adequate renal perfusion to prevent AKI, the best type of crystalloid for this purpose remains controversial.1 16-18 The two most commonly cited fluids used for this resuscitation are lactated Ringer's solu- tion and saline (0.9% or 0.45%). Saline is promoted due to its lack of potassium; in rhabdomyolysis, crush injury can lead to hyperkalemia and there is a theoretic concern for worsening this issue by using a potassium-containing fluid for resuscita- tion. Conversely, receiving large amounts of resuscitation with normal saline can lead to metabolic acidosis, which can be counterproductive if urine alkalinization is desired.16 The only randomized controlled trial comparing these crystalloid fluid types evaluated patients with doxylamine-induced rhabdomy- olysis.19 Of note, in this study, urine pH was a targeted end goal. with a goal pH >6.5. In patients who received lactated Ringer's solution, urine and serum pH were significantly higher after 12 hours of aggressive resuscitation with significantly less need fon bicarbonate administration to achieve goal urine pH, and there was no difference between groups in serum potassium level. However, there was also no difference in median time to serum CK less than 200 IU/L, which arguably is the most clinically rele- vant outcome in the study. There have been no other random- ized controlled trials comparing lactated Ringer's solution and normal saline or 0.45% saline and therefore no clear recommen- dation as to which fluid type is better. It does appear that use of either type of fluid is safe in the treatment of rhabdomyolysis, so although this area certainly requires further study, at this time the type of fluid used for management of rhabdomyolysis may be at the discretion of the treating physician. The rate of administration of intravenous fluids in rhabdo- myolysis should be targeted to the patient as there is significant risk of volume overload should an excessive amount of fluid be given without goal-directed therapy. A starting rate of 400 cc/ hour with a range of 200 cc/hour to 1000 c/hour is considered reasonable but should be titrated to urine output, ensuring the patient is receiving adequate resuscitation without suffering from fluid creep.119 Urine output is the traditional method by which one can deter- mine the adequacy of resuscitation in rhabdomyolysis. The most commonly cited urine output goals for intravenous fluid rehy- dration are 1 mL/kg/hour to 3 mL/kg/hour, and up to 300 mL/ hour1820-22Howevershould the patientremainanuricdespit escalating rates of intravenous fluid administration, the need fon RRT may be necessary as ongoing aggressive fluid resuscita- tion without renal clearance could lead to significant and life- threateningvolume overload.\n\n【31】Arediureticsand/orbicarbonateadministrationbeneficial? Recommendation 小狗 Clinical studies evaluating the efficacy of sodium bicarbonate and/or diuretic use (mannitol, loop diuretics) for prevention of rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI are limited by a lack of appropriate control groups, standardized definitions, retrospective design, and low statistical power. Given these significant limitations, the use of sodium bicarbonate or diuretics for prevention of AKI in rhabdomyolysisis not recommended.\n\n【32】The precise mechanism of AKI in rhabdomyolysis is controver sial and likelymultifactorial. The two important factors in the\n\n【33】lemia and aciduria.23 Ferrihemate, which is a breakdown product of myoglobin, in the presence of a low pH can generate free radicals which can lead to direct renal cell injury. Furthermore, heme proteins can potentiate renal vasoconstriction, which may have been initiated by hypovolemia and can activate the cyto- kine cascade.23-25 Pigmented casts, which are the hallmark of rhabdomyolysis-associated AKI, have been sugested to arise as a result of an interaction between the Tamm-Horsfall protein and myoglobin in an acidic environment. Other mechanisms that have been suggested propose that the precipitation of heme protein and its ability to generate free radicals at a low pH with resultant toxicity to the tubules is what may give way to cast formation.2324 Ultimately, AKI is the result of the combination of vasoconstriction, oxidant injury, and tubular obstruction, which leads to decreased glomerular filtration. For the aforementioned reasons, it has been suggested that alkalinization of the urine may minimize renal injury in rhab- domyolysis and may ameliorate or prevent AKI. Furthermore, mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, is a potentially attractive thera- peutic option in this setting, given its capacity for renal vaso- dilation, free radical scavenging, and potential for reduction of muscle compartment pressures.1 26 There is no strong clinical evidence supporting the use of sodium bicarbonate adminis- tration and/or mannitol to prevent AKI in rhabdomyolysis.26-28 Randomized controlled studies are lacking and the literature is composed mainly of retrospective studies or small case series. Many of these studies also lack a therapeutic endpoint such as measurement of urinary pH, and furthermore most of the studies couple mannitol use along with sodium bicarbonate.18 One of the larger studies from Brown et alt reviewed 382 patients with rhabdomyolysis, composed of a subset of 1771 patients with CK >5000U/L; 154 (40%) received bicarbonate and mannitol and 228 (60%) did not receive either bicarbonate or mannitol. There was no difference between groups in the rate of AKI or the need for RRT.4 Similarly, Homsi et al,29 in a study of 24 patients, retrospectively compared saline versus a combination of saline/mannitol/bicarbonate resuscitation for rhabdomyolysis (CK >50oIU/L) and found no difference in the incidence of renal failure between groups.29 Nielsen et al30 retrospectively evaluated normal saline with mannitol and bicarbonate versus normal saline alone in patients with traumatic rhabdomyolysis. They used a predefined protocol at their institution for patients with rhabdomyolysis with CK >10000U/L.Only 46 of 56 patients who would have qualified for the protocol had received it. When comparing these 46 with the 10 patients who did not receive the protocol, they recognized a significant decrease in the development of AKI in those patients receiving the protocol (26%) versus those who did not (70%).30 The question as to which particular component of the protocol was beneficial and the impact of a standardized approach was not answered in this study. Furthermore this study also highlights the fact that the majority of the studies are fairly small and underpowered to demonstrate a clear benefit. A recent comprehensive review of the role of bicarbonate and mannitol in rhabdomyolysis demon- strates that aggressive early-volume therapy with normal saline should be the primary management and that bicarbonate and mannitol utilization should be discouraged.26 The clinical evidence supporting the use of loop diuretics in this seting is sparse and composed primarily of case reports.31-34 As such, it cannot be interpreted with any confidence. Although loop diuretics have been shown to reduce metabolic demand and oxygen consumption by the proximal tubular cells, they have also been shown to worsen renal afferent arteriole\n\n【34】vasoconstriction, acidify urine, and promote aggregation of the Tamm-Horsfall protein within the tubular lumen. Taken together, the pathophysiologic consequences of loop diuretics may potentiate precipitation of myoglobin and worsen the distal tubular obstruction.35 36 Additionally, hypokalemia due to loop diuretic use has been reported to result in hypokalemic myop- athy andrhabdomyolysis.37 2?\n\n【35】Whatelectrolyteabnormalitiesshouldbe expected andwhat\n\n【36】Hyperkalemia,hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia are electrolyte abnormalities most commonly encountered when treating rhabdomyolysis.Correcting biochemical equilibrium and electrolytes during rhabdomyolysis should proceed metic- ulously to avoid complications from treatment. Hyperkalemia is the electrolyte abnormality that requires timely correction to reduceriskofcardiacarrhythmia.\n\n【37】Discussion\n\n【38】Discussion\n\n【39】In rhabdomyolysis, electrolyte abnormalities occur as a result of cellular component release associated with induced AKI. Electrolyte abnormalities that occur due to rhabdomyolysis are hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia. AKI in rhabdomyolysis is often associated with excessive potassium levels and correlates with the volume of muscle destruction. Baseline levels of potassium and all pertinent elec- trolytes should be evaluated when the possibility of rhabdo- myolysis development is present. Hyperkalemia that occurs in rhabdomyolysis-induced AKI occurs early in the course of the disease process and should be monitored closely. Potassium levels should be serially evaluated. Patients with high potassium levels (>6 mmol/L) should have cardiac monitoring. ECG should be obtained and assessed for manifestations of severe hyperka- lemia (QRS widening, small p waves, and severe arrhythmias). Hypocalcemia aggravates the electrical effects of hyperkalemia and should be aggressively treated with calcium chloride or calcium gluconate in this scenario. Elevated potassium levels should be treated with insulin and glucose infusions. Consider administration of a β-2 adrenergic agent such as albuterol via aerosol inhalation.Lastly, consider potassium removal via cation exchange resin or dialysis as indicated.1 2 38 39 Similar to hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia occurs as a result of phosphate release from damaged muscle cells. High levels of phosphate may be problematic because phosphate binds to calcium and this complex deposits in the soft tissues. Addition- ally, by inhibiting 1α-hydroxylase, hyperphosphatemia inhibits calcitriol formation and thus limits formation of the active form of vitamin D. Treatment of hyperphosphatemia should be done with caution since treatment involves administration of a calcium chelator which can increase precipitation of calcium phosphate in injured muscle. Early hyperphosphatemia typically decreases as phosphate is excreted in the urine.12 Hypocalcemia occurs early in rhabdomyolysis due to calcium entry into damaged cells and calcium phosphate deposition in necrotic muscle. Early hypocalcemia treatment in rhabdomy- olysis should be avoided unless patients are symptomatic or severe hyperkalemia is present. Correction of hypocalcemia with calcium chloride or gluconate should be avoided since calcium deposition may occur in injured muscle. During the recovery phase, serum calcium levels return to normal and may rebound, causing hypercalcemia due to release of calcium from injured\n\n【40】muscle and mild secondary hyperparathyroidism secondary t( AKI.1240 41 Hypermagnesemia seen with rhabdomyolysis is infrequent but when it occurs is typically in association with AKI and should be treated accordingly withhemodialysis.\n\n【41】WhatistheroleofRRTinrhabdomyolysis?\n\n【42】There is no role for RRT (either continuous (CRRT) or intermit- tent) in rhabdomyolysis to prevent AKI. The utilization of RRT in patients with rhabdomyolysis should be based on traditional indications for AKI and the degree of renal impairment. In patients with rhabdomyolysis who develop AKI and need RRT, either CRRT or intermittent RRT should be used based on the degree of renal impairment and the clinical status of the patient. There are no recommendations regarding RRT modal- ities (filtration vs. diffusion), filter type (low vs. high cut-off membranes), or high-flow versus low-flow dialysis.\n\n【43】Discussion\n\n【44】Since AKI in rhabdomyolysis is associated with myoglobinuria, it has been proposed that extracorporeal removal of myoglobin may be an effective preventative strategy.142 Despite case reports using plasmapheresis,43 it has not been shown to have an effect on outcome or myoglobim clearance.44 Furthermore, there is insuf- ficient evidence to recommend RRT in the prevention of AKI in rhabdomyolysis.38 45 Indeed, a Cochrane review evaluated CRRT for rhabdomyolysis. It sought to assess the efficacy of CRRT in myoglobin reversal, the influence of CRRT on mortality and kidney-related outcomes, and to evaluate the safety of CRRT for treatment in patients with rhabdomyolysis.39 46-48 There was no significant difference in mortality compared with conventional therapy. The review concluded that overall the studies had poor quality and there was insufficient evidence to determine any benefits of CRRT over conventional therapy for rhabdomyolysis and prevention of AKI in rhabdomyolysis. There have been several studies investigating myoglobin clearance using different dialysis modalities, filters, and flow types. The RRT techniques in these studies were initiated based on traditional indications for AKI and sought to deter- mine if any of these different modalities, filter, and flow types facilitate myoglobin clearance and hence affect kidney-related outcomes. Since myoglobin has a molecular weight of 17KDa and is thought to be poorly cleared by diffusion (dialysis), inves- tigators have studied whether the technique of RRT (continuous vs. intermittent), hemodiafiltration versus hemofiltration, use of special high cut-off membrane filters (which enhance clearance of larger molecules), as well as high-flow versus low-flow dial- ysis improve overall or kidney-related outcomes.49-53 The overal studies are small in number and seem to lack sufficient evidence to make any recommendations. The utilization of RRT in patients with rhabdomyolysis should be based on traditional indications for AKI and the degree of renal impairment, such as severe acid/base disturbances, electro- lyte abnormalities, and hypervolemia, all of which are refractory tomedical management.\n\n【45】OUTCOMES What complications should be suspected by clinicians treatingrhabdomyolysis? $ 狗私\n\n【46】matcompncatonssouiubesuspecte treating rhabdomyolysis? 狗科研 Recommendation ?

Morbidity can present early or late, including hyperkalemia, hepatic dysfunction, cardiac dysfunc- tion, AKI, acute renal failure (ARF), disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and compartment syndrome. AKI is the most common systemic complication of rhabdomyolysis and is responsible for most of the morbidity and mortality associated withrhabdomyolysis.\n\n【49】Discussion\n\n【50】In rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia is the most significant electro- lyte abnormality.54 Hepatic dysfunction occurs in approximately 25% of patients with rhabdomyolysis. Proteases released from injured muscle may be implicated in hepatic inflammation. Cardiac symptoms may be secondary to electrolyte abnormali- ties, such as severe hyperkalemia, and range from dysrhythmia to cardiac arrest.册 The overall mortality among inpatients with CK >5000 IU/L is approximately 14%.22 ARF develops in up to 15% of patients. Among those requiring RRT, mortality may be as high as 59%.54 Additionally, the release of intracellular products may activate the clotting cascade, leading to DIC in patients with rhabdomy- olysis.2254 This presentation is often subclinical with prolonged coagulation studies, thrombocytopenia, and elevated fibrin degradation studies without significant bleeding or thrombosis.54 Compartment syndrome may be an early or late complication, resulting from direct muscle injury or vigorous muscle activity. This complication occurs primarily due to limited muscle expan- sion from enveloping tight fascia.A delay of more than 6hours in diagnosing this complication can lead to irreversible muscle damage or death.s3\n\n【51】Canpredictionscoringbeusedinrhabdomyolysis?\n\n【52】Recommendatior\n\n【53】The risk of AKI, RRT, and/or in-hospital mortality in patients with rhabdomyolysis can be estimated using admission demo graphic, clinical, and laboratory variables.Risk prediction scores may not directly influence treatment; however, they may be useful in estimating prognosis and setting expectations. As no single laboratory value is sufficient to predict the course of rhabdomyolysis, a combined index of metrics, the McMahon Score (table 1), may be calculated at admission for\n\n【54】Table1McMahonScore\n\n【55】prognostication.3 A score greater than or equal to 6 is predictive\n\n【56】Rhabdomyolysis is a syndrome characterized by deposition of muscle protein that can be life-threatening, and identifi- cation of severity biomarkers is key. CK is usually taken as a reference to estimate prognosis; however, this is not the most effective parameter.2 McMahon et als performed a retrospec- tive cohort study to develop a risk prediction tool to identify patients at greatest risk of RRT or in-hospital mortality. In total, these outcomes occurred in 19.0% of patients with rhabdomy- olysis.55 The independent predictors identified were age, female sex, cause of rhabdomyolysis, and values of initial creatinine, creatine phosphokinase, phosphate, calcium, and bicarbonate. In the validation cohort, among patients with the lowest risk score (<5), 2.3% died or needed RRT. Among patients with the highest risk score (>10), 61.2% died or needed RRT.54 Rodri- guez et al56 conducted a retrospective observational cohort study to assess the risk factors for AKI and to develop a risk score for early prediction. The variables of peak CK, hypoalbuminemia, metabolic acidosis, and decreased prothrombin time were inde- pendently associated with AKI. A risk score for AKI was calcu- lated for each patient, with an OR of 1.72 (95% CI 1.45 to 2.04).36 公开识 Several other retrospective studies brought forth other predic- tion variables for AKI, ARF, and need for RRT. Baeza-Trinidad et al7 found initial creatinine levels associated with progression to AKI and mortality at 30 days. The cut-off point of creati- nine of 1.15 mg/dL had the best ratio of sensitivity (74.6%) and specificity (67.4%) to predict mortality.57 Chen et al58 1ooked at predictive factors for ARF including dark urine, initial and peak serum myoglobin level, rhabdomyolysis caused by body temperature change, and elevated serum potassium.Risk factors for RRT initiation were peak BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen)/creat- inine levels and CK level on the third day as rhabdomyolysis developed. The initial serum myoglobin threshold associated with development of ARF is 600 ng/mL.s8 In ambiguous cases, clinical suspicion of rhabdomyolysis is confirmed by a positive urine or serum test for myoglobin. There is a loose correlation between CK levels and the development of ARF, with levels higher than 16 000IU/L more likely to be associated with renal failure.22 狗科码 The McMahon Score is a prospectively validated risk predic- tion tool to identify patients at high risk of RRT or in-hospital. mortality (table 1). When calculated at admission from demo- graphic and blood chemistry data, a score ≥6 is 86% sensitive and 68% specific for patients who will require RRT. In this setting, the authors recommend the initiation of renal protective therapy with a target urine output of 1 mL/kg/hour to 3 mL/kg/ hour, and up to 300 cc/hour.1-4 i8 20-22\n\n【57】CONCLUSION\n\n【58】Rhabdomyolysis is a relatively uncommon but important condi- tion seen in critically ill and injured patients. Surgical critical care providers should be familiar with the less frequently encountered metabolic etiologies of rhabdomyolysis, in addition to the well- known traumatic causes.The diagnosis is made with a combina tion of clinical and laboratory findings and should lead to prompt intervention to halt any processes causing muscle damage and to prevent or treat known complications of the disease.A consensus summary for the diagnosis and management of rhabdomyolysis is provided in (table 2).

All patients undergoing breast cancertreatmentshouldbeeducated aboutbreastreconstructiveoptionsasadapted totheirindividualclinicalsituation.However,breast reconstruction should not interfere with the appropriate surgical management of the cancer or the scope of appropriate surgical treatment for this disease. Coordinating consultation and surgical treatment with a reconstructive surgeon should be executed within a reasonable time frame. The process of breast reconstruction should not govern the timing or the scope of appropriate surgical treatment for this disease. The availability of or the practicality of breast reconstruction should not result in the delay or refusal of appropriate surgical intervention. ·Some patients may choose not to have reconstruction after mastectomy. The option to undergo mastectomy alone with a surgically optimized closure should beoffered to all patients aspart of a comprehensive discussion of reconstructiveoptions.Achieving the optimal result in this scenario may require additional procedures beyond the initial mastectomy. See BINV-H (6) for patient factors influencing choid ofreconstruction. ·Selection of reconstruction option is based on an assessment of cancer treatment, patient body habits, obesity, smoking history, comorbidities, and patient concerns. Smoking and obesity (WHo Class 2 and 3) increase the risk of preoperative complications for all types of breast reconstruction,whether with implant or flap prosthetic or autologous. Patients with these risk factors should be counseled about their increased risk for complications following breast reconstruction, including donor site complications/hernias and bulges of the abdominal wall, delayed healing, mastectomy skin flap necrosis, total flap failure (obesity), and implant failure (smoking). Nipple areolar reconstruction should be offered to patients if the nipple-areolar complex (NAc) has been removed as part of their cancer treatment. Various techniques are available for nipple reconstruction. Three-dimensional (3-D) tattooing can be offered to patients as an optionforNACreconstruction. Additionally, patients who are not satisfied with the cosmetic outcome following completion of breast cancer treatment should be offered reconstructive surgery consultation. · Patients known to harbor genetic mutations that increase the risk of breast cancer may opt to undergo bilateral prophylactic mastectomies with reconstruction. Reconstruction can be performed with prosthetic, autologous tissue, or a combination of implant with autologous tissue. ·Skin-sparingmastectomyshouldbeperformedbyanexperiencedbreastsurgeryteamthatworksinacoordinated,multidisciplinaryfashic toguideproperpatientselectionforskin-sparingmastectomy,determineoptimalsequencingofthereconstructiveprocedure(s) inrelation to adjuvant therapies, and perform a resection that achieves appropriate surgical margins. ·Revisional surgery may be necessary after breast reconstruction.This may include procedures such as fat grafting, mastopexy, direct excision/suction-assistedlipectomy,contralateralprocedures(incasesofunilateralreconstruction),andothers.Patientsshouldbeinforme beforereconstructionthatrevisionsurgerymaybenecessary\n\n【160】Comprehensive\n\n【161】NCIPLESOFBREASTRECONSTRUCTIONFOLLOWIN\n\n【162】NcCN Guidelines Version 4.2023\n\n【163】Special Cases\n\n【164】PLESOFBREASTRECONSTRUCTIONFOLLOWINGS\n\n【165】Nipple-sparing mastectomy > NAC-sparing procedures may be an option in cancer patients who are carefully selected by experienced multidisciplinary teams.

Few males have beenincluded inbreast cancer trials.1 Therefore,recommendations regarding management of breast cancer in males are generallyextrapolatedfromfindingsofclinicaltrialsfocusingonbreastcancerinfemales. Although there are some biologic and clinical differences between breast cancer in males and females, management of breast cancer in males is similar overall to management of breast cancer in females, with the following special considerations pertinent to male patients:^ Genetics:TheNccNPanel recommends consideration of genetictesting for all maleswithbreastcancer(See NcCN Guidelinesfor Genetic/FamilialHigh-RiskAssessment:Breast,Ovarian,andPancreatic) Breastsurgery:Historically,maleswithbreastcancerhaveundergonemastectomymoreoftenthanBcS.However,breast-conservation therapy is increasingly being performed in males and evolving data indicate that breast conservation in males is associated with equivalent outcomes to mastectomy and that it is safe and feasible. Decisions about breast conservation versus mastectomy in males should be made according to similar criteria as for females.2-9 Axillary,lymph node surgery: As in females, SLNB should be performed in the setting of male breast cancer with a clinically node-negative axilla.2,4 >RT: Indications for radiation after breast surgery in males with breast cancer are the same as for females with breast cancer.25,10,11 Use of molecular assays: Data are limited regarding the use of molecular assays to assess prognosis and to predict benefit from chemotherapy in males with,breast cancer.2 Available data suggest the 21-gene assay recurrence score provides prognostic information inmaleswithbreastcancer.12,13 Preoperative/adjuvant systemic therapy: Chemotherapywith/without HER2-targeted therapy should be recommendedfor maleswith breastcanceraccordingtoguidelinesforfemaleswithbreastcancer.Optionsforadjuvantendocrinetherapyformaleswithbreast cancer include tamoxifen for 5-10 years or, if tamoxifen is contraindicated, a GnRH analog plus an aromatase inhibitor. In males, single- agentadjuvanttreatmentwithanaromataseinhibitorhasbeenassociatedwithinferioroutcomescomparedtotamoxifenalone,likelydue to inadequate estradiol suppression,and isnot recommended.2,14-17 Follow-up after treatment for early-stage disease: There are only limited data to support screening for breast cancer in males.2 The NccN Panel recommends that bone density be assessed at baseline and every 2 years.in maleswith breast cancer who receive adjuvant GnRH analogtherapy.Lowbonedensityshouldbemanagedaccordingtostandardguidelines. Systemictherapyforadvanceddisease:Managementofadvancedbreastcancerinmalesissimilartothatinfemales;however,itis preferred that when an aromatase inhibitor is used, a GnRH analog should be given concurrently.2Available data suggest single-agent fulvestrant has similar efficacy inmales asinfemales.1Newer agents such asCDK4/6 inhibitors incombinationwith an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant,mToRinhibitors,andPlK3cA inhibitors have not been systematically evaluated in clinical trials in males with breast cancer.

Preoperative endocrine therapy alone may be considered for patients with ER-positive disease based on comorbidities or low-risk lumin biologybased on clinical characteristics and/or genomic signatures. ·Patients with HER2-positive tumors should be treated with preoperative systemic therapy incorporating trastuzumab.d A pertuzumab- containing regimen may be administered preoperatively to patients with ≥ pT2 or ≥ pN1, HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer. See Preoperative/AdjuvantTherapy Regimens (BINv-L). Some studies suggest an increased risk of locoregional recurrence following use of preoperative chemotherapy.e These trials delivered chemotherapyregimens that are nolonger standard,did notinclude targeted therapies, did not use modern imaging techniques, and/or used non-standard locoregional management. Care should be taken to follow the procedures outlined in BINV-12 and BINV-14 to assure appropriate locoregional management. Not all patients are appropriate candidates for preoperative systemic therapy. Accurate clinical staging at baseline prior to initiation of preoperative systemic therapy is critical.SeePotentially OperableDisease:Breast and Axillary EvaluationPriortoPreoperativeSystemicTherapy(BlNV-12) Tumor response should be routinely assessed by clinical exam and imaging studies (see footnote uu on BINV-13) during delivery of preoperative therapy. It is preferred that the standard regimen is completed prior to surgery. If all intended treatment is not completed pri to surgery,the remainder maybe given in the adjuvant setting.Patientswith operable breast cancer experiencing progression of disease during preoperative systemic therapy may be given an alternate systemic regimen or proceed to surgery if deemed resectable. Locoregid therapy principles should be applied in the same manner as in patients treated with adjuvant systemic therapy.\n\n【224】a Rastogi P,AndersonSJ,Bear HD,et al.Preoperative chemotherapy:Updates of NationalSurgicalAdjuvantBreastandBowelProjectProtocolsB-18andB-27.J ClinOncol2008;26:778-785. bvonMinckwitzG,UntchM,BlohmerJU,etal.Definitionand impactofpathologid completeresponseonprognosisafterneoadjuvantchemotherapyinvarious intrinsicbreastcancersubtypes.JClinOncol2012;30:1796-1804\n\n【225】CCortazarP,ZhangL,UntchM,et al.Pathological completeresponseandlong- term clinical benefit in breast cancer: the CTNeoBC pooled analysis.

Clinical trials in breast cancer have utilized a variety of definitions of menopause.Reasonable criteria for determining menopause in patients with breast cancer include any o thefollowing: Prior bilateral oophorectomy Age≥60years Age <60 with amenorrhea for ≥12 months in the absence of prior chemotherapy, receipt of tamoxifen,toremifene, or ovarian suppression and estradiol and FsH in thepost-menopausal range Age <60 years: chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea for ≥12 months with FsH and estradiol in post-menopausal range on serial assessments Age<60years:ontamoxifenwithFSHandestradiollevel inpost-menopausalrange ·Menopausal status cannot be determined in those receiving ovarian function suppression\n\n【245】Comprehensive\n\n【246】SYSTEMICTHERAPYFORER-AND/ORPR-POSITIVE RECURRENTUNRESECTABLE(LOCALORREGIONAL)ORSTAGEIV(M1)DISEASEa\n\n| HER2-Negative and Postmenopausal or  | HER2-Negative and Postmenopausal or  | HER2-Positive and Postmenopausalm,n or Premenopausal Receiving Ovarian Ablation or Suppression  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Premenopausal Receiving Ovarian Ablation or Suppression  | Premenopausal Receiving Ovarian Ablation or Suppression  | HER2-Positive and Postmenopausalm,n or Premenopausal Receiving Ovarian Ablation or Suppression  |\n| Preferred Regimens  | Other Recommended Regimens  |  |\n| First-Line Therapy  | First- and/or Subsequent-Line Therapy  |  |\n| • Aromatase inhibitor + CDK4/6 inhibitor b  | • Selective ER donor-regulator  | • Aromatase inhibitor ± trastuzumab  |\n| • Aromatase inhibitor + ribociclib (category 1) c  | • Furulestrian b  | • Aromatase inhibitor ± lapatinib  |\n| • Aromatase inhibitor + abemaciclib  | • For E5R d mutated tumors, see BIN/V-Q (6)  | • Aromatase inhibitor ± lapatinib + trastuzumab  |\n| • Aromatase inhibitor + pathoccipity  | • Selective ER donor-regulator (fulvestrant,  | • Furulestrant ± trastuzumab  |\n| • Furulestrant + CDK4/6 inhibitor b  | category 1) + non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (anastrozole, letrozole) (category 1) c  | • Tamoxiferin ± trastuzumab  |\n| • Furulestrant + ribociclib (category 1) g  | • Non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor  |  |\n| • Furulestrant + adenocacib (category 1) h  | • Anastrozole  |  |\n| • Furulestrant + pathoccilib  | • Letrozole  |  |\n| Second- and Subsequent-Line Therapy  | • Selective ER modulator  |  |\n| • Furulestrant + CDK4/6 inhibitor (abemaciclib,  | • Tamoxiferin  |  |\n| pathoccilib, or ribocidib) if C5D4/6 inhibitor not previously used (category 1) f  | • Steroid aromatase inactivator  |  |\n| • For PIK3CA -mutated tumors, see additional targeted therapy options, see BIN/V-Q (6) h  | Useful in Certain Circumstances  |  |\n| • Everolimus + endocrine therapy (exemestane,  | • Mesensor inducer  |  |\n| • fulvestrant, tamoxiferin) h,j  | • Estradiol  |  |\n|  | • Abemaciclib h  |  |\n|  | • Additional targeted therapy options, see BIN/V-Q (6)  |  |\n\n| a Baseline assessment of bone density recommended for patients receiving an aromatase inhibitor who are at risk of osteoporosis (eg, age >65, family history, chronic steroids).  | a Baseline assessment of bone density recommended for patients receiving an aromatase inhibitor who are at risk of osteoporosis (eg, age >65, family history, chronic steroids).  |\n| --- | --- |\n| I'three is controversy on the choice of CDK4β inhibitor as there are no head to head components between the agents and there are differences in the study populations in the phase 3 randomized studies.  | I' if there is disease progression while on an everolimus-containing regimen, there are no data to support an additional line of therapy with another everolimus regimen.  |\n| c In phase 3 randomized controlled trials, ribociclib + endocrine therapy has shown OS benefit in the first-line setting.  | i A combination of exemestane with everolimus can be considered for patients who meet the eligibility criteria for BOLERO-2 (progressed within 12 mo or on non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor).  |\n| d Consider for disease progression on adjuvant endocrine therapy or with early disease relapse within 12 months of adjuvant endocrine therapy completion  | i A single study (SG225) in patients with HR-positive breast cancer and no prior chemotherapy, biological therapy, or endocrine therapy for metastatic disease demonstrated that the addition of tuhexarant to anastrozole resulted in prolongation of time to progression and OS.

Results of monitoring are classified as response/continued response to treatment, stable disease,uncertainty regarding disease status,or progression of disease.The clinician typicallymust assess and balancemultiple different forms of information to make a determination regarding whether disease is being controlled and the toxicity of treatment is acceptable. Sometimes, this information may be contradictory. Clinicians should take into account patient preferences through a shared decision-making process, DefinitionofDiseaseProgression Unequivocal evidence of progression of disease by one or more of these factors is required to establish progression of disease, either because of ineffective therapy or acquired resistance of disease to an applied therapy.Progression of disease may be identified through evidence of growth or worsening of disease at previously known sites of disease and/or of the occurrence of new sites of metastatic disease ·Findings concerning for progression of disease include: Worseningsymptomssuchaspainor dyspnea Evidence ofworsening or new disease onphysical examination Declining performance status Unexplained weight loss Increasing alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AsT), or bilirubin Hypercalcemia New radiographic abnormality or increase in the size of pre-existing radiographic abnormality Newareasofabnormalityonfunctionalimaging(eg,bonescan,PET/CT) Increasingtumormarkers(eg,carcinoembryonicantigen\\[CEA\\],CA15-3,CA27.29)a\n\n【302】Rising tumor markers (eg, CEA, CA 15-3, CA 27.29) are concerning for tumor progression, but may also be seen in the setting of responding disease. An isolated increase in tumor markers should rarely be used to declare progression of disease.

Generally, the same method of assessment should be used over time (eg, an abnormality found on chest CT should generally be monitoredwithrepeatchestCT). Some non-clinically important variation in measurement of abnormalities by all serial studies is common and expected. Therefore, the use of objective and widely accepted criteria for response, stability, and progression of disease are encouraged. Such systems include the ResponseEvaluationCriteriaInSolid Tumors(RECiST)guidelines\\[EisenhauerEA,TherasseP,BogaertsJ,etal.Newresponseevaluation criteria in solid tumours: revised RECiST guideline (version 1.1).

Studies of functional imaging, such as radionuclide bone scans and PET imaging, are particularly challenging when used to assess response.

The clinical size of a primary tumor (T) can be measure oased onclinical findings(physical examination and imaging modalities,such as mammography,ultrasound,andMR imaging)andpathological findings(gross and microscopic measurements).

This is in accordance with the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/CAP guidelines,4whichrecommendthatERtestingofnewlydiagnosedDClStd determine potential benefit of endocrine therapies for breast cancer risk reduction and progesterone receptor (PR) testing be considered optional. Although the tumor HER2 status is of prognostic significance in invasive cancer, its importance in DCiS has not been established. To date, studies haveeitherfound unclearorweakevidenceof HER2statusasa prognostic indicator in DCiS,5-8 and no statistically significant benefit to the use of trastuzumab concurrently with radiation in HER2-amplified DCIS.9 TheNCCNPanelhasconcludedthatHER2statusforDCISdoesnotalter the management strategy and therefore is not recommended for DciS.

If MRI findings suggest more extensive disease than is seen on mammography such that a markedly larger resection is required for complete excision, the findings should be verified histologically through MRl-guided biopsy of the more extensive enhancement. Studies performed to determine whether the use of MRl reduces re-excision rates and decreases local recurrence in patients with DciS show conflicting results. While several studies suggest no reduction in re-excision rates in patients with pure DCIS undergoing breast-conserving surgery (BCS) following MRl compared with those who did not undergo preoperative MRI,12.13 some have demonstrated a reduction in re-excision rate with use of preoperative MRI for DCIS.14,15 One study showed an additional cancer detection rate of 6.2% with preoperative MRl15 Therefore, the use of preoperative MRI remains controversial. The NCCN Panel recommends only performing breast MRI for DCiS in select circumstances where additional informationiswarranted during theinitialworkup,notingthat the useofMRlhasnotbeenshowntoincreaselikelihoodofnegativemargins ordecreaseconversiontomastectomyforDcis.\n\n【403】TutTOTTO\n\n【404】Primary Treatment for DCiS\n\n【405】Primary Treatment for DCiS\n\n【406】The goal of primary therapy for DCiS is to prevent progression to invasive breast carcinoma. Management strategies for DciS treatment include surgery (mastectomy or BCS), and/or radiation therapy (RT), followed by adjuvant endocrine therapy in eligible patients to reduce risk of recurrence Thechoiceoflocaltreatmentdoesnotimpactoveralldisease-related survival; therefore, the individual's preferences for risk-reduction must be considered. SeveralprospectiverandomizedtrialsofpureDciShaveshownthatthe addition of whole breast radiation therapy (WBRT) after BCS decreases the rate of in-breast disease recurrence,16-23 but not distant metastasis-free survival.24 A meta-analysis of four large multicenter randomized trials confirmed the results of the individual trials, demonstrating that the addition of WBRT after BCS for DCIS provides a statistically and clinically significant reduction in ipsilateral breast events (hazard ratio \\[HR\\], 0.49; 95% confidence interval \\[Cl\\]; 0.41-0.58, P <.00001).25 However, these trialsdidnotshowthattheadditionofRThasanoverallsurvival(OS) benefit. The long-term follow-up of the NSABP B-17 showed that at 15 years, RT resulted in a 52% reduction of ipsilateral invasive recurrence compared with excision alone (HR, 0.48; 95% Cl,0.33-0.69, P<.001).22 TheOSandcumulativeall-causemortalityratesthrough15yearswere similar between the two groups (HR for death, 1.08; 95% Cl, 0.79-1.48).22 SimilarfindingswerereportedbyalargeobservationalstudyoftheSEER database that included 108,196 patients with DCIS.26 In a subgroup analysis at 10 years, of 60,000 patients treated with BCS, with or without WBRT,a50%reductionintheriskofipsilateral recurrence(adjusted HR, 0.47 \\[95% Cl, 0.42-0.53\\]; P<.001) was associated with the addition of WBRT. However, in this study, breast cancer-specific mortality was found to be similar (HR,0.86 \\[95% Cl,0.67-1.10\\];P=.22).26\n\n【407】Incontrast,severalpopulation-basedstudiessuggestbeneficialeffectsof WBRTforDCISafterBCS,forexample,theuseofWBRTinpatientswith higher-risk DclS (eg, higher nuclear grade, younger age, larger tumor size)wasdemonstratedtobeassociatedwithamodestbutstatistically significantimprovementinOs.27Inanotherobservationalstudyofthe SEERdatabaseincluding140,366patientswithDCIS,the15-yearbreast cancer mortality rate was 1.7% for those treated with breast-conserving therapy (BCT) versus 2.3% for patients treated with BCS alone (HR, 0.77; 95% Cl, 0.67-0.88; P< .001), demonstrating a small but significant reduction in breast cancer mortality with BCS and WBRT compared with BCSalone.28 1 RT Boost: The use of RT boost has been demonstrated to provide a small but statistically significant reduction in ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) risk (4% at 20 years) in all age groups for invasive breast cancers.29-32 一D Apooledanalysisofpatient-leveldatafrom10academicinstitutions evaluated outcomes of pure DClS patients, all treated with BCS and WBRT (n = 4131) who either received RT boost with a median dose of 14 Gy (n = 2661) or received no boost (n = 1470). The median follow-up of patients was 9 years. A decrease in IBTR was seen in patients who received aboost comparedwiththosewhodidnot at5years(97.1%vs. 96.3%), 10 years (94.1% vs. 92.5%), and 15 years (91.6% vs. 88.0%) (P .0389 for all). The use of RT boost was associated with significantly decreased IBTR across the entire cohort of patients (HR, 0.73; 95% Cl, 0.57-0.94;P =.01).33 In a multivariate analysis that took into account factorsassociatedwithlowerIBTR,includinggrade,ERpositivestatus, use of adjuvant tamoxifen, margin status, and age, the benefit of RT boos still remained statistically significant (HR, 0.69; 95% Cl, 0.53-0.91; P < .010).33 Even in patients considered very low risk based on negative marginsstatus(defined as noink on tumor asper National Surgical\n\n【408】utTOTTC\n\n【409】AdjuvantBreastandBowelProject(NSABP)definition,ormargins>2mm as per Society of Surgical Oncology\\[SSO\\]/American Society for Radiation Oncology\\[ASTRO\\]/ASCOdefinition),theRTboostremainedstatistically significantfordecreasingtherateoflocalrelapse\n\n【410】Similar to invasive cancers, though RT boost was beneficial in all age groups studied, the magnitude of the absolute benefit of theboost was greatest in younger patients.

These trials have completed accrual and are now in active follow-up. A recent publication on the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients enrolled in the BIG 3-07/TROG 07.01 phase III trial (NCT00470236) showed that after 2 years, the cosmetic status was impacted negatively with the boost versus no boost, suggesting the importance of informed shared decision-making regarding addition of boost until data related to impact on local recurrence and OS are published.34 According to the 5- yeardatafrom this trial,presented at the2021annualSanAntonioBreast CancerSymposium(SABCS)meeting,93%ofpatientsinthegroupwho didnotreceiveaboostwerefreefromlocalrecurrencecomparedwith 97% in the group who received an RT boost (HR, 0.47; 95% Cl, 0.31- 0.72;P<.001).35Thepeer-reviewedpublicationofthesedataisawaited. 1?

Protocol specifications included excision of the DCIS tumor with a minimum negative margin width of at least 3 mm. Only 30% of the patients received tamoxifen. Of note, margins were substantially wider than the 3-mm protocol requirement in manypatients (ie, the low-/intermediate-risk patient group margins were ≥5 mm in 62% d patients and >10 mm or no tumor on re-excision in 48% of patients).40 Although the rate of IBTR was acceptably low for the low-/intermediate- gradegroupat5years,atamedianfollow-upof12.3years,theratesof developing an IBTR were 14.4% for low-/intermediate-grade and 24.6% for high-grade DCIS (P = .003). This suggests that IBTR events may be delayed but not prevented in the seemingly low-risk population. TheRTOG9804trialinvestigatedoutcomesofRTomissioninthesetting of low-risk DCiS, randomizing 636 patients with low-risk disease to either RT or observation after surgery.23 In this study, low risk consisted of low- tointermediate-gradeDCISmeasuringlessthan2.5cm,withnegative margins of greater than or equal to 3 mm.With a median follow-up of 7\n\n【413】TutTOTTO\n\n【414】years,areducedriskoflocalrecurrencewasseenwithuseofRT compared with observation (0.9% vs. 6.7%; HR, 0.11; 95% Cl, 0.03-0.47).

Per the ASTRO guideline for APBl, patients with screen-detected DCIS measuring less than 2.5 cm,with grade I or ll disease, and with negative margins of 3 mm or more are“suitable'candidatesfor APBl.46 M OM Margin Status After Breast-Conserving Therapy: Prospective randomized trials have not been carried out to analyze whether wider margins can replacetheneedforRTforDCIS.Resultsfromaretrospectivestudyof 445patientswithpureDClStreatedbyexcisionaloneindicatedthat marginwidthwasthemost importantindependent predictor of local recurrence,although the trend for decreasing local recurrence risk with increasing margin width was most apparent with margins less than 1 mm compared to greater than or equal to 10 mm.47 In a meta-analysis of 4660 patientswithDCiStreatedwithBCSandradiation,asurgicalmarginof essthan2mmwasassociatedwithincreasedratesofIBTRcompared with margins of 2 mm, although no significant differences were observed when margins of greater than 2 mm to 5 mm or greater than 5 mm were compared with 2-mmmargins.48\n\n【415】Astudyretrospectivelyreviewedadatabaseof2996patientswithDClS whounderwentBCStoinvestigatetheassociationbetweenmarginwidth andrecurrence,controllingallothercharacteristics.49Widermarginswere significantlyassociatedwithalowerrateofrecurrenceonlyinpatientswh did not receive RT(P<.0o01),but notin those treated withradiation(P： .95).49 According to the DCiS Consensus Guideline on Margins by SSO/ASTRO/ASCO, the use of at least a 2-mm margin in DCIS treated with WBRT is associated with low rates of IBTR.46 Additional factors to considerinassessingadequacyofexcisionforDciSincludepresenceof residualcalcifications,whichmarginisclose(anterioragainstskinor posterior against muscle versus medial, superior, inferior, or lateral), and life expectancy of the patient.Notably, in situations where DCiS is admixed with invasivecarcinoma,theSSO/ASTRO/ASCOConsensus Guideline on Margins for invasive breast cancer should be utilized, which supports “no tumor on ink\" as an adequate margin applying to both the invasive and noninvasive components in this mixed tumor scenario. Mastectomy:PatientswithDCiSandevidenceofwidespreaddisease(ie disease involving two or more quadrants) on diagnostic mammography or other imaging, physical examination, or biopsy may require mastectomy. ? For DCIS patients undergoing mastectomy, or for local excision in an anatomic location that could compromise the lymphatic drainage pattern t the axilla (eg, tail of the breast), a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) procedure should strongly be considered at the time of definitive surgery toavoidnecessitatingafullaxillarylymphnode(ALN)dissectionfor evaluation of the axilla.50-53Since only a small proportion of patients(abou 25%) with seemingly pure DCiS on initial biopsy will have invasive breast canceratthetimeofthedefinitivesurgicalprocedure54andwillultimately requireALNstaging,ALNdissection(ALND)isnotrecommendedunless\n\n【416】utTOTTO\n\n【417】there is pathologically documented invasive cancer or ALN metastatic diseaseinpatients(byeitherbiopsyorSNLB) NCCNRecommendationsforPrimaryTreatmentofDciS\n\n【418】Trialsareongoingtodetermineiftheremightbeaselectedfavorable biologyDCiSsubgroupwheresurgicalexcisionisnotrequired.Until such timethatdefinitiveevidenceregardingthesafetyofthisnon-surgical approach is demonstrated, the NCCN Panel continues to recommend surgicalexcisionforallDcis According to the NCCN Panel, primary treatment options for patients with DCIS along with their respective categories of consensus are: 1) BCS plus WBRT with or without boost (category 1). While considering RTboostforDCiS,theNCCNPanel recommends anindividualized approach based on patient preference and other factors such as longevity. The NCCN Panel notes that WBRT following BCS reduces IBTR rates in DCIS by about 50% to 70%. For DCIS patients treated with BCS alone (without radiation), irrespective of margin width, the risk of IBTR is substantially higher than treatment with excision followed by WBRT (even forpredefinedlow-risksubsets ofDClSpatients). 2)Totalmastectomy,withorwithoutSLNBwithoptionalreconstruction ?

For patients with pure DCIS treated by BCS and WBRT, a quantitative description of any tumor close to margin is helpful as a resection width of atleast2mmisassociatedwithareducedriskofIBTRrelativeto narrower negative margin widths. The routine practice of obtaining margins greater than 2 mm to further improve outcomes is not supported by the evidence. When there is only minimal or focal DCiS involvement nearthemargin,clinicaljudgmentshouldbeutilizedtoweightherisksof re-excision with risk of recurrence for an individual patient.

In that study,patientswith DCISwho were treated with BCT were randomized to receive placebo or tamoxifen. At a median follow-up of 13.6 years, patientswhoreceivedtamoxifenhada3.4%absolutereductionin psilateral in-breast tumor recurrence risk(HR,0.30;95%Cl,0.21-0.42;P <.001)anda3.2%absolutereductionincontralateralbreastcancers(HR 0.68; 95% Cl, 0.48-0.95; P = .023).22 The patients receiving tamoxifen had a 10-year cumulative rate of 4.6% for invasive and 5.6% for noninvasive\n\n【428】breastcancers intheipsilateralbreast,comparedwith7.3%invasiveand 7.2%noninvasiverecurrencesforthosetreatedwithplacebo.The cumulative10-yearfrequencyofinvasiveandnoninvasivebreastcancerir thecontralateralbreastwas6.9%and 4.7%intheplaceboand tamoxifen groups, respectively. No differences in OS were noted. A retrospective analysis of ER expression in NSABP B-24 suggests that increased levels of ER expression predict for tamoxifen benefit in terms of risk reduction for ipsilateral and contralateral breast cancer development following BCT.59 A phase Ill trial randomized patients with excised DCIS to receive WBRT or no WBRT and tamoxifen versus no tamoxifen.21 The randomization was independent for each of the two treatments (RT and tamoxifen). With 12.7 years of median follow-up, the use of tamoxifen decreased all new breast events (HR, 0.71; 95% Cl, 0.58-0.88; P = .002). The use of tamoxifen decreased ipsilateral and contralateral breast events in the subjects not given WBRT (ipsilateral HR, 0.77; 95% Cl, 0.59-0.98; contralateral HR, 0.27; 95% Cl, 0.12-0.59), but not in those receiving WBRT (ipsilateral HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.50-1.75; P = .80; contralateral HR, 0.99; 95% Cl, 0.39- 2.49; P = 1.0). 12 The standard dose of tamoxifen is 20 mg/day for 5 years. The phase Ill TAM-01 trial studied a lower dose of tamoxifen (5 mg for 3 years) in 501 patientswithbreastintraepithelialneoplasiaincludingDCiS,lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), and ADH. The rate of recurrence of either intraepithelialneoplasiaorinvasivebreastcancerwas5.7%amongthose receiving tamoxifen 5 mg daily versus 11.9% for those receiving placebo (HR, 0.48; 95% Cl, 0.25-0.89) at a median follow-up of 5.1 years.60 The relativerisk(RR)reductionwithlow-dosetamoxifenseenintheTAM-01 trials is consistent with that seen in trials that used a higher dose of tamoxifen,buttherateofseveretoxicitycomparedwithplacebowasless Anastrozole:InpatientswithER-positiveand/orPR-positiveDCIStreated bywidelocalexcisionwithorwithoutRT,alarge,randomized\n\n【429】utTOTTC\n\n【430】double-blind,placebo-controlledtrial(IBIS-Il)comparedanastrozole(n= 1471)with tamoxifen(n= 1509).Theresults demonstrated non-inferiority of anastrozole to tamoxifen.61 After a median follow-up of 7.2 years, 67 recurrences were reported with anastrozole versus 77 for tamoxifen(HR, 0.89;95%Cl,0.64-1.23).A totalof33deaths wererecordedfor anastrozole and 36 for tamoxifen(HR,0.9393;95%Cl,0.58-1.50;P= .78).61 Although the number of patients reporting any adverse event was similar between anastrozole (n = 1323, 91%) and tamoxifen (n = 1379, 93%), the side-effect profiles of the two drugs were different. There were more fractures, musculoskeletal events, hypercholesterolemia, and strokes reported with anastrozole and more muscle spasms, gynecologic cancersandsymptoms,vasomotorsymptoms,anddeepveinthromboses reportedwithtamoxifen.TheNSABPB-35studyrandomlyassigned3104 postmenopausal patients with hormone-positive DCiS treated with lumpectomy and radiation to either tamoxifen or anastrozole for 5 years.

The benefit of endocrine therapy for ER-negative DCIS is not known. Low-dose tamoxifen (5 mg/day for 3 years) is an option only if the 20-mg standard dose of tamoxifen is not tolerated (see DCiS-2). Follow-up of patients with DClS includes interval history and physical examinationevery6to12monthsfor5yearsandthenannually,aswel asyearlydiagnostic mammography.

Imaging: Imaging with bilateral diagnostic mammography is recommended; breast ultrasonography is recommended only if necessary. The use of MRl in the workup remains controversial. Breast MRI advocates note its high sensitivity for evaluation of extent of disease, particularlyforinvasivecancer and indensebreastswhere mammographically occult disease is more likely to elude preoperative detection.

Breast MRl may be use for staging evaluation to define extent of cancer, in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting, to detect the presence of multifocal or multicentric cancer in the ipsilateral breast,or as screening of the contralateral breas cancerattimeofinitialdiagnosis.Additional indicationsforbreastMRl include: clinical axillary metastasis with an occult primary cancer; Paget diseaseofthenipplewithbreastprimarynotidentifiedbyotherbreast imaging modalities or physical examination; follow-up screening of patientswithpriormammographicallyundetectedbreastcancers;and thosewhoselifetimeriskofasecondprimarybreastcancerisgreaterth 20% (based on models largely dependent on family history).

The routine use of FDG PET/CT scanning is not recommended inthestaging of clinical stage I,Il,oroperableIll (T3,N1) breast cancer, due to its high false-negative rate for the detection of lesions that are small (<1 cm) and/or low-grade disease, the high rate of false-positive scans in patients without locally advanced disease, the low sensitivity for detection of axillary nodal metastases, and the low probability of these patients having detectable metastatic disease.108-111 Locoregional Treatment of cT1-3,cN0 or cN+,M0 Disease Surgery Patientswithearly-stageoperablebreastcancerinitiallyundergoupfront definitive surgery (BCS or mastectomy), and adjuvant systemic therapy, if indicated,basedonprimarytumorcharacteristics,suchastumorsize, grade, lymph node involvement, ER/PR status, expression of HER2 receptor,andtumorgenomics.Somepatientswithearly-stageoperable HER2-positive or triple-negative disease may be treated with preoperative systemic therapy first, followed by surgery.

SC 一 Mastectomy Mastectomy is indicated for patients who are not candidates for BCS or those who choose to undergo this procedure over BCS. Only limited data are available on the survival impact of risk-reducing contralateral mastectomy in patients with a unilateral breast cancer.128 Analysis of patients included in the SEER database treated with mastectomyforaunilateralbreastcancerfrom1998to2003showedthat contralateral risk-reducing mastectomy performed at the time of treatment of a unilateral cancer was associated with a reduction in breast cancer-specific mortality only in the population of young patients (18-49 years of age) with stage I/ll, ER-negative breast cancer(HR, 0.68; 95% Cl, 0.53-0.88; P = .004).129 The 5-year breast cancer survival for this group was only slightly improved with contralateral risk-reducing mastectomy versus without (88.5% vs. 83.7%, difference = 4.8%).129 These differences observed in retrospective analysis could be due to selection bias among patients who chose risk-reducing contralateral mastectomy.130Astatisticalsimulationofsurvivaloutcomesafterrisk- reducing contralateral mastectomy among patients with stage I or ll breast cancer with no BRCA mutationfound that the absolute 20-year survival benefitfromrisk-reducingcontralateralmastectomywaslessthan1%\n\n【461】among all age,ER status,and cancer stage groups.131Data from another meta-analysisfoundnoabsolutereductioninriskofdistantmetastases with risk-reducing mastectomy.132 Furthermore, among patients with unilateralbreastcancerwhohaveanincreasedfamilial/geneticrisk,a decreaseinmetastaticcontralateralbreastcancerincidencewas observed in those who received risk-reducing contralateral mastectomy, although no improvement was seen in OS of these patients.132 The panel recommends that patients with breast cancer who are less than or equal to 35 years or premenopausal and carriers of a known BRCA1/2 mutation consider additional risk reduction strategies following appropriate riskassessmentandcounseling(seeNCCNGuidelinesforBreastRisk Reduction and NCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic). This process should involve multidisciplinary consultations prior to surgery, and should include a discussion of the risks associated with development of a contralateral breast cancer as compared with the risks associated with recurrent diseasefromtheprimarycancer.ExceptasspecificallyoutlinedinNCCN Guidelines for Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic), risk reduction mastectomy of the contralateral breast to a known unilateral breast cancer treated with mastectomy or BCT is discouraged bythepanel. The NCCN Panel recommends referring to the NCCN Guidelines for Olde Adult Oncology for special considerations for this population.

Marking the tumor bed with clips facilitates accurate planning of the radiation boost field, where appropriate. orc For invasive breast cancers that have a component of Dcis, the negative margin definition of “\"no ink on tumor” should be utilized based on the SSO/ASTRO Consensus Guideline on Margins unless it is DCIS with microinvasion, which behaves more like pure DCiS and 2-mm margins are recommended.

Surgical Axillary Staging Axillary status is important for planning systemic adjuvant treatment and RT. The lymphatic pathways from the breast go to the ALNs, internal mammary, infraclavicular, and/or supraclavicular lymph nodes. Traditional level I and level Il ALNDs require that at least 10 lymph nodes be provided for pathologic evaluation to accurately stage the axila.134.135 ALND should be extended to include level Ill nodes only if gross disease is apparent in the level ll and I nodes. In the absence of gross disease in level ll nodes, lymph node dissection should include tissue inferior to the axillary vein from the latissimus dorsi muscle laterally to themedial border of the pectoralis minor muscle (level I and I) AOd 77 Historically,ALND has been the standard of care for axillary staging.136 However, ALND is associated with lymphedema and other significant morbidities.137-139 This has been largely replaced with SLNB. SLN mapping injections may be peritumoral, subareolar, or subdermal. SLNscanbeassessedforthepresenceofmetastasesbyboth hematoxylinandeosin(H&E)stainingandcytokeratin immunohistochemistry (IHC).

Inthisstudy,therewas nodifferenceinlocalrecurrence,DFS,orOS betweenpatientswithpositiveSLN undergoing a completionALNDversus no ALND. Only ER-negative status, age less than 50, and lack of adjuvant systemic therapy were associated with decreased Os.149At a median follow-up of 6.3 years, locoregional recurrences were noted in 4.1% of patients in the ALND group and 2.8% of patients in the SLNB group (P = 11). Median OS was approximately 92% in each group.150 Long-term follow-up (median 9.25 years) results of the ACOSOG Z0011 study showed no statistically significant difference in local recurrence-free survival (RFS) between trial arms (P = .13).151 The cumulative incidence of ipsilateral axillary recurrences at 10 years was 0.5% (2 patients) in those who underwent ALND and 1.5% (5 patients) in those who underwent SLNB alone (P = .28).151 The 10-year cumulative incidence of locoregional recurrenceswas6.2%withALNDand 5.3%withSLNBalone(P=.36).151 SSS The results of the ACOSOG Z0011 trial demonstrate that there is no benefit toALND in patients with early-stage breast cancer who have only oneortwoSLNmetastases(minimal nodalburden)onSLNBafter receiving WBRT as part of BCT.

Both arms will receive regional nodal radiation. The SLNB alone arm will include axillary RT to the undissected axilla (levels I-lll), whereas theALNDarmwill not includeRT tolevelsIorllaxillae. NCCN Recommendations for Surgical AxillaryStaging:If ALNs are clinically negative (no palpable nodes) at the time of diagnosis, 2 or fewer suspicious lymph nodes are found on imaging, or 2 or fewer positive lymph nodes are confirmed by needle biopsy, the panel recommends SLN mapping. C If SLN is negative, no further surgery is needed in these patients. If SLN is positive, based on the ACOSOG Z 0011 data, no further surgery is recommended only if all of the following criteria are met: the patients have cT1-2, N0 tumors, have not received preoperative systemic therapy, only have 1 or 2 positive SLNs, and will undergo BCT (BCS + WBRT).

CT-based treatment planning is encouraged to delineate target volumes and adjacentorgansatrisk.Greatertargetdosehomogeneityandsparingof normal tissues can be accomplished using compensators such as wedges,forwardplanningusingsegments,and intensity-modulatedRT (IMRT).Respiratorycontroltechniquesincludingdeepinspiration breath-hold and prone positioning may be used to try to further reduce dose to adjacent normal tissues, particularly the heart and lung.163 Verification of treatment setup consistency is done with weekly imaging When using certain techniques (ie, prone breast), more frequent imaging may be appropriate. Standard utlization of daily imaging is not recommended. Radiation to the breast/chest wall and nodal regions is generally delivered with single-energy or mixed-energy photons with or without electrons. Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) should be used to evaluate dose constraints, evaluate dose to normal tissues (ie, heart, lung), and ensure adequate coverage to the intended planning target volumes (PTVs), including the breast/chest wall, supraclavicular fossa, axillary levels I-Ill, and internal mammary nodes.

The NCCN Panel therefore recommends contouring the individual nodal basins that are at-risk using one of the various breast atlases, to ensure adequate RT coverage. 183.84 The recommended dose for RNl is 45 to 50.4 Gy in 25 to 28 fractions to the regional nodal fields. A supplemental RT boost can be delivered to grossly involved or enlarged lymph nodes (ie, internal mammary or clavicular) that have not been surgically addressed. M AcceleratedPartialBreastIrradiation Several large, randomized trials have been published using various forms of APBl rather thanWBRT after BCS. Most of these studies have found that rates of local control in selected low-risk patients with early-stage breast cancer are equal to those treated with WBRT.43,45,185-187 In the NSABPB-39trial,10-yearcumulativeincidenceofIBTRwithAPBIwas 4.6% compared with 3.9% with WBRT, yielding an absolute difference of 0.7%with an HR of 1.22 (90%Cl,0.94-1.58) that did not meet the prespecified criteria for equivalence.42 However, given the small magnitudeinIBTRdifferencesbetweenWBRTandAPBl,itisnotlikelyto be of clinical significance in appropriately selected patients.

NCCN Recommendation for APBl: The panel accepts the updated ASTRQ APBI consensus statement for guidance on APBI use.19o The NCCN Pane recommends APBI for any BRCA-negative patient who meets the ASTRO 2016 “suitable” criteria defined as over age 50 years, ER-positive invasive ductalcarcinomameasuringlessthanorequalto2cm(pT1disease)with negative margin widths of greater than or equal to 2 mm, and no lymphovascular invasion (LVl), and also permits APBl in patients over the age of 50 with screen-detected low- or intermediate-grade DCIS measuring less than or equal to 2.5 cm, resected with greater than or equal to3mmmargins.ThepanelpreferstheAPBlregimenandmethod followedinthetrialbyUniversityofFlorence(30Gy/5fractionsQOD delivered using IMRT).186 The panel encourages participation in clinical trials for patients who do not meet the above criteria.

DISCU RegionalNodalIrradiationAfterBCS The reduction in the risk of locoregional and distant recurrence and improvement in DFS seen in the MA.20 and EORTC 22922/10925 trials,180,181 and the reduction in breast cancer mortality with 15-year follow- up of the EORTC 22922 patients,182 support the importance of RNI after BCS. As mentioned previously, routine inclusion of the internal mammary nodes as a component of RNl remains somewhat controversial due to the associatedcardiacandlungtoxicities.AKoreantrialKROG08-06studied independenteffectonDFSofRTtointernalmammarynodesafterBCSor mastectomy for node-positive disease,191 randomizing patients to RNl with internal mammaryRTversusRNlwithoutinternalmammary RT.Radiation to the internal mammary nodes did not significantly improve the DFS in patientswithnode-positivebreastcancer.However,therewasa statisticallysignificantbenefitinoutcomeswithinternalmammarynodal RT for patients with medially or centrally located tumors.191 Conflicting data have arisen from the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group that recentlyreported15-yearfollow-upoftheirstudyonRTtointernal\n\n【509】RegionalNodalIrradiationAfterBCS\n\n【510】mammary nodes in patients (n = 3089) with positive nodes and early- stage breast cancer.192 In this study, RT to the internal mammary nodes wasdelivered toright-sidedpatients(n=1,491),whilenoRT tointernal mammary nodes was delivered to left-sided patients (n = 1,598). The studyreporteda15-yearimprovedOSrateof60.1%withRT tointernal mammary nodes compared to 55.4% with no RT to internal mammary nodes. Improvements were also seen with respect to risk of developing distant recurrence and breast cancer-specific mortality favoring RT to internal mammary nodes.192 Clinicaljudgmentisneededwhendetermininginclusionoftheinternal mammary nodes during RNI. Therefore, the NCCN Panel no longer specifies the fields that should be included for RNl and refers to it as comprehensive RNl. According to the panel, patient selection should consider risks versus benefits including long-term organ(cardiac and lung) toxicities,comorbiditiesofthepatient,age,andlifeexpectancy.In including RT to the internal mammary nodes, meticulous treatment planning with normal tissue dose constraints is mandatory. RNIAfterBCSforNode-NegativeDisease:TheNCCNPanel recommends consideration of comprehensive RNl in patients with central/medial tumors (in accordance with EORTC 22922 trial criteria) and in accordance with the MA.20 criteria: 3 tumors, as well as those with T2 tumors who have undergone limited axillary dissection (<10 lymph nodes) and also have other risk factors, including high-grade histology, ER- negativedisease,or LVl.180 RNIAfterBCSforNode-PositiveDisease:Forthosewith1to3positive nodes, if a patient meets all of the following criteria—has cT1-T2, cNO; did not receive preoperative chemotherapy; and has 1 to 2 positive SLNs-the useofcomprehensiveRNlwithorwithouttheintentionalinclusionofthe axillaisatthediscretionof theradiationoncologist.If thepatientsdonot meetallthecriterialisted,theNCCNPanelrecommendsWBRTwith\n\n【511】TutTOTTO\n\n【512】inclusionofanyportionoftheundissectedaxillaatrisk(category1)with strongconsiderationofcomprehensiveRNi\n\n【513】For thosewith4ormorepositivenodes,theNCCNPanel recommends comprehensive RNl with inclusion of any portion of the undissected axilla atrisk(category1).\n\n【514】atrisk(category1).

Locoregional recurrence rates were 1% in the BCS, radiation, and tamoxifen arm and 4% in the BCS plus tamoxifen arm! There were no differences in OS, DFS, or need for mastectomy.193 These results were confirmed in an updated analysis of this study with a median follow-up of 12.6 years.14 At 10 years, a statistically significant reduction in IBTR was seen with RT with 90% of patients in the BCS and tamoxifen arm compared with 98% in the BCS plus radiation and tamoxifen arm.194 Concordant results have been demonstrated in other studies of similar design.195.196 Whether the increase in local relapse without RT is relevant foranindividualpatientshouldbeindividualizedafteradiscussionofthe risksandbenefitsofRTandpatientcommitmentto5yearsofendocrine therapyif RTomissionisbeingconsidered.

Those undergoing mastectomy should be offered consultation regarding options and timing of breast reconstruction. Manyfactorsmustbeconsideredinthedecision-making aboutbreast reconstruction. There are several different types of breast reconstruction that include the use of implants, autogenous tissues, or both.223-225 Reconstruction with implants can be performed either by immediate placementof apermanentsubpectoral implantorinitialplacementofa subpectoral expander implant followed by gradual expansion of the implant envelope with stretching of the pectoralis major muscle and overlying skin followed by replacement of the expander with a permanent implant. A wide variety of implants are available that contain saline, silicone gel, or a combination of saline and silicone gel inside a solid siliconeenvelope. Autogenous tissue methods of reconstruction use various combinations o fat, muscle, skin,and vasculature from donor sites (i.e.,abdomen,buttocl back)that maybebrought tothechestwall withtheiroriginalbloodsuppl (pedicle flap) or as free flaps with microvascular anastomoses to supply blood from the chest wall/thorax.226 Several procedures using autologous tissue are available including transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap, latissimus dorsi flap, and gluteus maximus myocutaneous flap reconstruction\n\n【538】utTOTTC\n\n【539】Compositereconstruction techniquesuse implants incombinationwith staged approac autogenous tissue reconstruction to provide volume and symmetry. implant placem Patientswith underlying diabetes or who smoke tobaccohave increased requiringpostop ratesofcomplicationsfollowingautogenoustissuebreastcancer contracture, ma reconstruction,presumablybecauseofunderlyingmicrovasculardisease. exchangethetis performedprior Reconstructioncanbeperformedeitheratthetimeofthemastectomy knownas“immediatebreastreconstruction”andunderthesame In a previously anesthetic orin a delayed fashion any time,knownas“delayed breast relativelycontra reconstruction.\"Inmanycases,breastreconstructioninvolves astaged in a significantly approachrequiringmorethanoneproceduresuchassurgeryonthe cosmesis,impla contralateralbreasttoimprovesymmetry,revisionsurgeryinvolvingthe has previously r breast and/or donor site, and/or nipple and areola reconstruction and reconstructionis tattoopigmentation.

In a previously radiated patient, the use of tissue expanders/implants is relatively contraindicated.230 Tissue expansion of irradiated skin can result in a significantly increased risk of capsular contracture, malposition, poor cosmesis, implant exposure, and failed reconstruction.231,232lf a patient has previouslyreceived radiation therapy tothebreast, autologous tissue reconstruction is the preferred method of breast reconstruction.\n\n【543】Skin-sparingMastectomy Skin-sparing mastectomy procedures are appropriate for some patients and involve removal of the breast parenchyma including the NAC while preserving the majority of the original skin envelope, and are followed by immediate reconstruction with autogenous tissue, a prosthetic implant, or a composite of autogenous tissue and an implant. Skin-sparing mastectomy involving preservation of the skin of the NAC has become th subject of increased attention.Possible advantages of this procedure include improvements in breast cosmesis, body image, and nipple sensation following mastectomy, although the impact of thisprocedure or these quality-of-life issues has not been well-studied.233-235 There are limited data from surgical series, with short follow-up, that suggest that performance of NAC-sparing mastectomy in selected patients is associatedwithlowratesofoccultinvolvementoftheNACwithbreast cancer and local disease recurrence.234.236,237 NAC-sparing procedures maybeanoptioninpatientswhoarecarefullyselectedbyexperienced multidisciplinary teams.According to the NCCNPanel,whenconsidering NAC-sparingprocedure,assessmentofnipplemarginsismandatory.\n\n【544】utTOTTC\n\n【545】RetrospectivedatasupporttheuseofNAC-sparingproceduresfor patientswithbreastcancerwithlowratesofnippleinvolvementandlow ratesoflocalrecurrenceduetoearly-stage,biologicallyfavorable(i.e., Nottingham grade I or 2, node-negative, HER2-negative, no lymphovascularinvasion)invasivecancersand/orDciSthatare peripherally located in the breast (>2 cm from nipple).238.239 Contraindicationsfornipplepreservationincludeevidenceofnipple involvement such as Paget's disease or other nipple discharge associated with malignancy and/or imaging findings suggesting malignant nvolvementofnippleandsubareolartissues.Severalprospectivetrials areunderwaytoevaluateNAC-sparingmastectomyinthesettingof cancer and enrollmenf in such frials is encouraaed\n\n【546】RetrospectivedatasupporttheuseofNAC-sparingproceduresfor patientswithbreastcancerwithlowratesofnippleinvolvementandlow ratesoflocalrecurrenceduetoearly-stage,biologicallyfavorable(i.e., NottinghamgradeIor2,node-negative,HER2-negative,no lymphovascularinvasion)invasivecancersand/orDciSthatare peripherally located in the breast (>2 cm from nipple).238.239 Contraindications for nipple preservation include evidence of nipple involvement such as Paget's disease or other nipple discharge associated with malignancy and/or imaging findings suggesting malignant involvement of nipple and subareolar tissues.Several prospective trials are underway to evaluate NAC-sparing mastectomy in the setting of cancer and enrollment in such trials is encouraged. 6P Advantages of a skin-sparing mastectomy procedure include an improved cosmetic outcome resulting in a reduction in the size of the mastectomy scar and a more natural breast shape, especially when autologous tissue is used in reconstruction,240 and the ability to perform immediate 2 reconstruction. Although no randomized studies have been performed, resultsofseveralmostlyretrospectivestudieshaveindicatedthattherisk of local recurrence is not increased when patients receiving skin-sparing mastectomies are compared with those undergoing non-skin-sparing procedures. However, strong selection biases almost certainly exist in the identification of patients appropriate for skin-sparing procedures.241-245 Reconstruction of the NAC may also be performed in a delayed fashion if desired by the patient. Reconstructed nipples are devoid of sensation. According to the NCCN Panel, skin-sparing mastectomy should be performedbyanexperiencedbreastsurgeryteamthatworksina coordinated,multidisciplinaryfashiontoguideproperpatientselectionfor skin- sparing mastectomy, determine optimal sequencing of the reconstructive procedure(s) in relation to adjuvant therapies, and perform a resection that achieves appropriate surgical margins.

Oncoplastic techniques for breast conservatior can extend breast-conserving surgical options in situations where the resectionbyitselfwouldlikelyyieldanunacceptablecosmeticoutcome.24 The evolving field of oncoplastic surgery includes the use of \"volume displacement\" techniques performed in conjunction with a large partial mastectomy.247 Oncoplastic volume displacement procedures combine the removal of generous regions of breast tissue (typically designed to conform to the segmentally distributed cancer in the breast) with \"mastopexy” techniques in which remaining breast tissues are shifted togetherwithin the breast envelope to filltheresulting surgical defect and thereby avoid the creation of significant breast deformity. Volume displacement techniques are generally performed during the same operative setting as the breast-conserving lumpectomy by the same surgeon who is performing the cancer resection.247,248 Advantagesofoncoplasticvolumedisplacementtechniquesarethatthey permit the removal of larger regions of breast tissue, thereby achieving wider surgical margins around the cancer, and at the same time better preserve the natural shape and appearance of the breast than do standar hreasf\n\n【550】Limitations of oncoplastic volume displacement techniques include lack of standardization among centers, performance at only a limited number of sitesintheUnitedStates,andthepossiblenecessityforsubsequent mastectomyifpathologicmarginsarepositivewhenfurther\n\n【551】utTOTTO\n\n【552】SystemicTherapies(PreoperativeandAdjuvant)\n\n【553】Chemotherapy:Anumberofchemotherapyregimenshaveactivityinthe preoperative setting.

In both settings, the underlying aim remains the same:eradicationorcontrolofundiscovereddistantmetastases. Endocrine Therapy: Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy alone may be offered to those with strongly HR-positive tumors.250-257 According to the NCCN Panel, the endocrine therapy options include an aromatase inhibitor (with ovarian suppression for premenopausal patiets) or tamoxifen The preferred endocrine therapy option for postmenopausal patients is an aromataseinhibitor. HER2 Targeted Therapy: For patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, that are candidates for preoperative systemic therapy, chemotherapy and trastuzumab-based therapy is recommended.258 Chemotherapy and dual anti-HER2 blockade associated with trastuzumab plus pertuzumab has shown significant improvements in the pCR rate when compared with chemotherapy and one anti-HER2 agent in the preoperative setting.259-261 In the Neosphere trial, the addition of pertuzumab to trastuzumab and docetaxel preoperatively led to a statistically significant increase in pCR in the breast (16.8% increase; 95% Cl, 3.5-30.1; P= .0141).261 In the TRYPHAENA trial, preoperative therapy with pertuzumab and trastuzumab given along with anthracycline-containing or anthracycline-free standard chemotherapy regimens to patients with operable,locallyadvanced,orinflammatoryHER2-positivebreastcancer showed pCR rates in all treatment arms ranging from 57% to 66%.262 The mean change in left ventricular ejection fraction was similar in all treatment arms.262 The NCCN Panel supports the FDA-approved indication that a pertuzumab-containing regimen may be administered preoperatively to\n\n【554】patients with greater than or equal to T2, or greater than or equal to N1\n\n【555】patients with greater than or equal to T2, or greater than or equal to N1 HER2-positive,early-stagebreastcancer\n\n【556】reoperativeSystemictherapy\n\n【557】PrinciplesofPreoperativeSystemicTherapy The NCCN Panel has outlined the rationale, appropriate patient selection, andresponseassessmentforpreoperativesystemictherapyinanew section titled, Principles of Preoperative Chemotherapy. RationaleforPreoperativeChemotherapy Randomized clinical trials have found no significant differences in long-term outcomes when systemic chemotherapy is given before or after surgery.263264 Historically, a primary advantage of administering preoperative systemic therapy has been to improve surgical outcomes. Preoperative systemic therapy can render inoperable tumors resectable and also downstage patientswith operable breast cancer desiringbreast conservation.265 Resultsfromlargeclinical trials and retrospectivereviews indicatethatbreastconservationratesareimprovedwithpreoperative systemic therapy.264.266 Clinicians need to carefully consider the extent of disease in the breast and likelihood of adequate tumor response before recommending preoperative systemic therapy to improve the likelihood of successfulbreastconservation. In addition, use of preoperative systemic therapy may provide important prognostic information based on response to therapy. Achieving a pathologiccompleteresponse(pCR)toneoadjuvanttherapyisassociatec withfavorabledisease-freeandOSinearly-stagebreastcancer.The correlation between pathologic response and long-term outcomes in patients with early-stage breast cancer is strongest for patients with triple-negativebreastcancer,lesssoforHER2-positivedisease,andleas for hormone-positive disease.267-269\n\n【558】utTOTTO\n\n【559】Otherbenefitsofpreoperativesystemictherapyincludeallowingtimefor appropriategenetictestingandforplanningbreastreconstructionin patientsproceedingwithmastectomy.Forthosewithsignificantresidual disease after standard preoperative systemic therapy, it may provide an opportunity to identify patients who are candidates for clinical trials of novel agents in the adjuvant setting. To date, the tailoring of therapy based on poor response to standard preoperative chemotherapy has not yet demonstrated improved outcomes. In addition, preoperative systemic therapy alsoserves as an excellent research platform totest novel therapies and predictive biomarkers by providing tumor specimens and blood samples prior to and during systemic treatment. OisCl SelectionofPatientsforPreoperativeTherapy Not all patients are appropriate candidates for preoperative systemic therapy. According to the NCCN Panel, among those with inoperable breast tumors, preoperative systemic therapy is indicated in patients with locally advanced or inoperable breast cancer including those with inflammatorybreastcancer;thosewithN2andN3regional lymphnode nodal disease; and T4 tumors. In patients with operable breast cancer who are clear candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy, preoperative systemic 3 therapy may be considered if a patient desires breast-conserving surgery but the surgery is not possible due to the size of the tumor relative to that of the breast, with the hope that this will help obtain clear surgical margins atfinalresection.Preoperativesystemictherapymayalsobeadministered in patients with operable tumors if the patient's breast cancer subtype is one associated with a high likelihood of response. When preoperative systemic therapy is used to improve the likelihood of successful breast conservation, the surgical plan should consider the possibility that clear surgical margins may not always be obtained, and a follow-up mastectomy may be required, with or without breast reconstruction. This consideration isespeciallyimportantwhenoncoplasticbreastreductiontechniquesor\n\n【560】contralateral breastsymmetryprocedures are added tothe breast-conservingsurgerytoachieveoptimalcosmeticoutcomes\n\n【561】TheNCCNPanel cautionsthatpreoperativesystemictherapyisnot appropriate for certain patients.

The decision to utilize preoperative therapy should be made in the context of a coordinated and collaborative multi-disciplinaryteam. ■ Response Assessment During Preoperative Chemotherapy The NcCN panel recommends that tumor response should be routinely assessed by clinical exam during the delivery of preoperative systemic therapy.Patientswithoperablebreastcancerexperiencingprogressiond disease while undergoing preoperative systemic therapy should be taken promptly to surgery.

The strongest prognostic factors are patient age, comorbidity,tumorsize,tumorgrade,numberofinvolvedALNs,and possibly HER2 tumor status. Algorithms have been published estimating rates of recurrence,270 and a validated, computer-based model (Adjuvant! Online; www.adjuvantonline.com) is available to estimate 10-year DFS and Os that incorporates all of the above prognostic factors except for HER2 tumor status.271,272 These tools aid the clinician in objectively estimatingoutcomewithlocaltreatmentonly,andalsoassistinestimating the absolute benefits expected from systemic adjuvant endocrine therapy and chemotherapy. These estimates may be utilized by the clinician and\n\n【566】batient in theirshared decision-making regarding thetoxicitid penefits of systemic adjuvant therapy.273\n\n【567】benefits of systemic adjuvant therapy.273 AdjuvantSystemictherapyforhormonereceptor-positive, HER2-negativetumors Patients with HR positive, HER2-negative tumors, receive adjuvant endocrinetherapytoreducetheriskofrecurrenceandthosedeemedat high risk for distant recurrence despite adjuvant endocrine therapy, receive adjuvant chemotherapy. The incremental benefit of adding adjuvant chemotherapy to endocrine therapy in patients with low clinical riskofrecurrencesuchasthosewithverysmall,lowgrade,lymph node-negative tumors is relatively small.274 The decision whether or not td administer adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative tumors is based on many factors including lymph node status, size, grade, lymphovascular invasion, age, comorbid conditions and/or the results of a gene expression profile test using multigene\n\n【568】assays. MultigeneAssays Severalcommercially-availablegene-basedassaysareusefulin determining prognosis by predicting distant recurrence, local recurrence, or survival. Of these, only one, the 21-gene assay (Oncotype Dx) has been clinically validated for predicting the benefit of adding adjuvant chemotherapytofurtherreducetheriskofrecurrence. 21-gene assay (Oncotype DX) in Node-negative, HR-positive, HER2-negative disease: The 21-gene recurrence score (RS) is one of the most validated multigene assays. The RS is helpful in determining the prognosis inpatients with HR-positive, HER2-negative tumors treated with endocrinetherapyalonebypredictinglocoregionalanddistant recurrence.275-277 This assay has also been validated to predict the benefit fromaddingadjuvantchemotherapytoadjuvantendocrinetherapyfor\n\n【569】utTOTTO\n\n【570】patients with HR-positive,HER2-negative,node-negative breast cancer.278-280\n\n【571】AmongpatientswithT1b/c and T2,lymphnode-negative,HR-positive HER2-negativetumorswithRSbetween0-10,theriskofdistant recurrenceislowandthesepatientsderivenoincrementalbenefitfrom the addition of adjuvant chemotherapy to endocrine therapy.279.281 At the other end of the spectrum, patients with lymph node-negative, HR-positive,HER2-negativecancerswithhighRS(>31)haveahigher risk of distant recurrence and secondary analyses of prospective studies demonstrate a clear benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.279.281 For those with intermediate RS (11-25), the recently reported TAILORx trial of postmenopausal patients (n= 6711) with lymph node-negative, HR-positive,HER-2negativebreastcancer,showedsimilardisease-free survival rates at 9-years in those who received adjuvant chemotherapy followed by endocrine therapy compared with endocrine therapy alone.281 However, in a subset analysis, patients 50 years of age or younger with RS 16-25 had significantly lower rates of distance recurrence with the addition of adjuvant chemotherapy to endocrine therapy.281 The cutoff fo low, intermediate, and high RS was different in TAILORx versus NSABP B-20.TheNSABP-B20wasthefirsttrialtovalidatethe21-geneassay both as a prognostic as well as a predictive tool and identified RS cut-offs to predict the magnitude of chemotherapy benefit in patients with node-negative,HR-positivebreastcancer. 21-gene assay (Oncotype DX) in Node-positive, HR-positive, HER2-negativedisease:IntheWestGermanPlanBstudy,patients(n= 110) with lymph node-positive, HR-positive, HER2-negative tumors, and aRSof≤11,werefoundtohavea5-yeardisease-freesurvivalwas 94.4% when treated with endocrine therapy alone.282 In a secondary analysisofaprospectiveregistryofpatientswithHR-positive, HER2-negative,lymph node-positive tumors,the 5-year risk of distant\n\n【572】recurrenceinpatientswithaRSof<18,treatedwithendocrinetherapy alone was 2.7%.283 These results suggest that in patients with limited nodal disease (1-3 positive lymph nodes) and a low RS, the absolute benefit fromchemotherapy is likely tobevery small.283.284\n\n【573】There is a clear benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with node positive, HR-positive, HER2-negative tumors, if the RS is high (≥ 31). In a secondary analysis of the SWOG 8814 trial of patients with HR-positive, lymphnode-positivetumors,highRS(≥31)waspredictiveof chemotherapy benefit. This study evaluated breast cancer specimens fron node-positive, HR-positive postmenopausal patients (n= 367) randomized to endocrine therapy with tamoxifen alone or chemotherapy with CAF followed by tamoxifen.278 Compared with tamoxifen alone, treatment with CAF among patients with a high RS (≥31) resulted in improved 10-year DFS(55%vs.43%;HR 0.59,95%CI0.35-1.01)and OS(73%vs.54%;\n\n【574】The absolute benefit of chemotherapy in patients with limited lymph node involvement and a RS ≤25 remains to be determined. The ongoing SouthwestOncologyGroup(SWOG)S1007RxPONDERtrial,285assigneo patients with 1-3 lymph node-positive nodes, HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer and a RS≤ 25 to standard endocrine therapywith or withou adjuvant chemotherapy. The results of this trial are expected to determine the benefit (if any) for chemotherapy in this group of patients. 70-gene assay (MammaPrint): Results from the randomized MINDACT trial,286 demonstrated that the 70-gene assay can identify a subset of patientswhohavealowlikelihoodofdistantrecurrencedespitehigh-risk clinical features (based on tumor size, grade, nodal status).

The primary outcome of the study was met with the demonstration that among those with high clinical risk/low genomic risk, the 5-year rate of survival without distantmetastasisinthosedidnotreceiveadjuvantchemotherapywas 94.7% (95% Cl, 92.5 to 96.2).286 DH In the intention-to-treat population, among patients at high clinical risk/low genomic risk by the 70-gene assay, the 5-year rate of survival with no distant metastasis in those who received chemotherapy was 95.9% (95% Cl,94.0 to 97.2) versus 94.4%(95% Cl,92.3 to 95.9) in those who did not receive chemotherapy (adjusted HR for distant metastasis or death with chemotherapy vs.no chemotherapy 0.78; 95% Cl, 0.50 to 1.21)286 Among patients at low clinical risk/ high genomic risk, 5-year survival with no distant metastasis was 95.8% with chemotherapy (95% Cl, 92.9 to 97.6), compared with a rate of 95.0% (95% Cl, 91.8 to 97.0%) without chemotherapy (adjusted HR for distant metastasis or death with ? chemotherapy vs.no chemotherapy,1.17;95% Cl, 0.59 to 2.28).These data suggest that the results of the 70-gene signature do not provide evidence for making recommendations regarding chemotherapy for patients at low clinical risk.286 Ina subgroupanalysisbynodal status,amongnode-negativepatients with high clinical risk/low genomic risk, the 5-year rate of survival with no distant metastasis was 95.7% (95% Cl, 93.0 to 97.4) in those who received adjuvant chemotherapy compared with 93.2% (95% Cl, 90.1 to 05 4)in thoco who did not roooivo ohomothorony 286 Amona potionto uith\n\n【577】Ina subgroupanalysisbynodal status,amongnode-negativepatients with high clinical risk/low genomic risk, the 5-year rate of survival with no distant metastasis was 95.7% (95% Cl, 93.0 to 97.4) in those who receivedadjuvantchemotherapycomparedwith93.2%(95%Cl,90.1to 95.4) in those who did not receive chemotherapy.286 Among patients with\n\n【578】1-3positivelymphnodes,theratesofsurvivalwithoutdistantmetastases were96.3%(95%Cl,93.1to98.1) in thosewhoreceivedadjuvant chemotherapyversus95.6(95%Cl,92.7to97.4)inthosewhodidnot receive adjuvant chemotherapy.286 These data suggest that the additional benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with high-clinical risk/low genomic risk is likely to be small. 50-gene assay (PAM50): The 50-gene assay (PAM-50) risk of recurrence (ROR)scorestratifiespatientswithHR-positivediseaseintohigh, medium, and low risk groups. Several studies have demonstrated the prognosticvalueofRORscoreinestimatingriskofdiseaserecurrence.287 289 一 ssIion In a study from the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group database, patients with lymph node node-negative tumors and low ROR had a distant recurrence risk of 5.0% (95% Cl, 2.9% to 8.0%) whereas tumors with high ROR had a distant recurrence risk of 17.8% (95% Cl, 14.0% to 22.0%).288 Based on these analyses, patients with T1 and T2, HR-positive, HER2-negative, lymph node-negative tumors,a ROR score in the low range, regardless of tumor size, places the individual into the same prognostic category as those with T1a-T1b, N0, M0 tumors.288 C Inpatientswith1-3lymph-nodepositive,HR-positive,HER2-negative disease with low-risk of recurrence score, the distant recurrence risk was less than 3.5% at 10 years with endocrine therapy alone. 288 In TransATAC study, no distant recurrence was seen at 10 years in a similal group.289 12-geneassay(EndoPredict):Thisassayutilizes12-genestocalculatea prognosticscore.Thisassayappearstobeusefulinidentifyinga subgroup of patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative tumors with very lowriskofrecurrencewithoutadjuvantchemotherapyandhelpfulin identifyingpatientsatlowriskforalaterecurrence.29oBasedonresultsof\n\n【579】utTOTTO\n\n【580】twoAustrianBreastCancerStudyGrouptrials-ABCSG-6andABCSG-8, patientswithHR-positive,HER-2negative,andlymph-nodenode-negative diseasewithalow-riskscorebythe12-geneassayhadriskofdistant recurrence of 4% at 10 years.290 The prognostic value of the risk score rom the 12-gene assay was found to be independent of conventional clinicopathological factors.

According to the NCCN Panel, adjuvant endocrine therapy maybe considered in this group of patients to reduce the risk for a second contralateral breast cancer, as well as the small benefit in reducing the risk of local/regional and distant recurrence.(Category 2B) 60 ? For patients with invasive ductal or lobular tumors greater than 0.5 cm in diameter and no lymph node involvement (lymph node node-negative), the NCCN panel recommends strongly considering the 21-gene RT-PCF assay to help estimate likelihood of recurrence and benefit from chemotherapy (category 1). The panel has noted that on an exploratory analysis from the TAILORx study,281 adjuvant chemotherapy may be considered in patients 50 years of age or younger with a 21-gene RS of 16-25. Also, patients with T1b tumors with low grade histology should be considered for endocrine monotherapy, as the TAILORx study281 did not include patients with such tumors. he panel notes that other prognostic multigene assays may be onsidered to help estimate risk of recurrence but these assays have not eenvalidatedtopredictthebenefitofsystemicchemotherapy.Also, mongst the other assays, the panel has listed the 70-gene assay as a ategory 1 option based on the results of the prospective MINDACT286 tria lemonstrating the ability of the 70-gene assay to identify a good genomic isk population despite a high clinical risk, in whom chemotherapy may be mittedwithoutadetrimentaleffect.HighclinicalriskintheMiNDACTtria\n\n【585】utTOTTO\n\n【586】was defined for grade 1 tumors as >3 cmN0 or T2N1,for grade 2 tumors T2N0-1,andforgrade3tumorsT1c-2N0-1\n\n【587】urthermore,givennodifferenceinoutcomeswithorwithoutchemothera in the discordant low clinical risk/high genomic risk group, the MiNDAC1 study suggests that the 70-gene panel is not useful guiding systemic chemotherapy decisions in this subgroup of patients.

In the MINDACT trial, among patients with 1-3 positive nodes who had a high clinical risk of recurrence but low risk by the 70-gene assay, the rates of survival were similar between those who received adjuvant chemotherapy in addition to adjuvant endocrine therapy versus those received adjuvant endocrine therapy alone, suggesting that chemotherapy could be omitted in this group.286 Other multigene assays have not proven to be predictive of benefit from chemotherapy. For those who are candidates for systemic adjuvant chemotherapy based on clinical characteristics, tumor stage, and pathology, if multigene assay is not available, the panel recommends systemic adjuvant chemotherapy followedbyendocrine therapy(category 1). AdjuvantEndocrineTherapy TheNCCNGuidelinescallforthedeterminationofERandPRcontentin all primary invasive breast cancers.294 Patients with invasive breast cancers that are ER-or PR-positive should be considered for adjuvant endocrinetherapyregardlessofpatientage,lymphnodestatus,or whetheradjuvantchemotherapyistobeadministered.295Selectedstudies suggest that HER2-positive breast cancers may be less sensitive to some endocrinetherapies,althoughotherstudieshavefailedtoconfirmthis\n\n【591】utTOTTO\n\n【592】finding.96-3u4Aretrospective analysis of tumor blockscollected in the ATACtrialindicatedthatHER2amplificationisamarkerofrelative endocrine resistance independent of type of endocrine therapy.305 However,giventhefavorabletoxicityprofileoftheavailableendocrine therapies, the panel recommends the use of adjuvant endocrine therapy in themajorityofpatientswithHR-positivebreastcancerregardlessof menopausalstatus,age,orHER2statusofthetumor. Tamoxifen: The most firmly established adjuvant endocrine therapy is tamoxifen for both premenopausal and postmenopausal patients.58 In patientswithER-positivebreastcancer,adjuvanttamoxifendecreasesthe annualoddsofrecurrenceby39%andtheannualoddsofdeathby31% irrespectiveoftheuseofchemotherapy,patientage,menopausalstatus, or ALN status.58 In patients receiving both tamoxifen and chemotherapy, chemotherapy should be given first, followed by sequential tamoxifen.306 Prospectiverandomizedtrialshavedemonstratedthat5yearsof tamoxifen is more effective than 1 to 2 years of tamoxifen.307,308 1M 11 The ATLAS trial randomly allocated pre- and postmenopausal patients to 5 or 10years(extended therapy)of tamoxifen.Theoutcome analysesof 6846 patients with ER-positive disease showed that by extending adjuvant treatment to 10 years, the risk of relapse and breast cancer-related ? mortality was reduced.309 The risk of recurrence during years 5 to 14 was 21.4% for patients receiving tamoxifen versus 25.1% for controls (absolute recurrence reduction 3.7%). Patients who received tamoxifen for 10 years had a greater reduction in risk of progression, possibly due to a “carryover effect.\" The reduction in risk of recurrence was 0.90 (95% Cl, 0.79-1.02) during5 to9years of tamoxifen treatment and 0.75(0.62-0.90) after 10 yearsoftreatment.Thereweredecreasesintheincidenceofcontralateral breast cancer as well. Furthermore, reduced mortality was also apparent after completionof 10years of treatment with tamoxifen.Withregards to toxicity. the most important adverse effects noted in all patients in the\n\n【593】ATLAStrialafterwith10yearsoftamoxifentreatmentwereanincreased risk for endometrial cancer and pulmonary embolism.309 The results of the aTTom trial confirm thesignificant reduction in recurrence and deathfrom breastcancerseenintheATLAStrialwith10versus5yearsoftamoxifen\n\n【594】In patients who are premenopausal at diagnosis, the NccN Panel recommends tamoxifen treatment with or without ovarian suppression/ablation. Ovarian ablation may be accomplished by surgical oophorectomy or by ovarian irradiation. Ovarian suppression utilizes luteinizinghormone-releasinghormone(LHRH)agoniststhatresult in suppression of luteinizing hormone (LH) and release of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the pituitary and reduction in ovarian estrogen production. Available LHRH agonists in the United States include goserelin and leuprolide dosed monthly or every 3 months. 2 The EBCTCG performed a meta-analysis of randomized studies of ovariar ablation or suppression aloneversus no additional systemic adjuvant therapyforearly-stagebreast cancer.Analysisofovariansuppression versusnoadjuvant therapydidnotdemonstratesignificantreductionin recurrence (HR 0.72; 95% CI, 0.49-1.04) or death (HR 0.82; 95% Cl, 0.47-1.43).311 In addition, data on ovarian suppression with tamoxifen, chemotherapy,orbothshowednosignificantreductioninrecurrence or death. Studies in premenopausal patients of ovarian ablation or suppression aloneversusCMF(cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/fluorouracil) chemotherapy alone generally demonstrate similar antitumor efficacy in patients with HR-positive tumors and superior outcomes with CMF in patients with HR-negative tumors.311-319 There is also the suggestion that the benefits of ovarian suppression/ablation may be greater in the younge premenopausalgroup.Studiesinpremenopausalpatientsofovarian\n\n【595】TutTOTTO\n\n【596】ablation/suppressionplustamoxifenversuschemotherapy alonegenerally demonstrate no difference in rates of recurrence or survival. 32-32\n\n【597】A large intergroup study in premenopausal patients with HR-positive, node-positivebreastcancerstudiedadjuvantCAF (cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/5-fluorouracil) chemotherapy versus CAF plusovariansuppressionwithgoserelin(CAF-Z)versusCAF-Zplus tamoxifen (CAF-ZT).312 The results demonstrated no improvement in time torecurrenceorOScomparingCAFwithCAF-Z.Therewasimprovement in time to recurrence (HR, 0.73; 95% Cl, 0.59-0.90; P < .01) but not OS with CAF-Z compared with CAF-ZT (HR, 0.91; 95% Cl, 0.71-1.15; P = 21).

S? In two randomized trials (TEXT and SOFT), premenopausal patients with HR-positiveearly-stagebreastcancerwereassignedtoreceive exemestane plus ovarian suppression or tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression for a period of 5 years.323 Suppression of ovarian estrogen production was achieved with the use of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist triptorelin, oophorectomy, or ovarian irradiation.

BasedontheresultsoftheSOFTandTEXTtrials,theNCCNPanelhas included ovarian suppression plus an aromatase inhibitor for 5 years as ar adjuvant endocrine therapy option for premenopausal patients with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer at higher risk of recurrence (eg, young age, high-grade tumor, lymph-node involvement).

Aromatase inhibitors are more commonly associated with musculoskeletal symptoms, osteoporosis, and increased rate of bone fracture, while tamoxifen is associated with an increased risk for uterine cancer and deep venous thrombosis 1 Twostudieshaveexaminedinitialadjuvantendocrinetreatmentwitheithe tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor. The ATAC trial demonstrated that anastrozole is superior to tamoxifen or the combination of tamoxifen and anastrozole in the adjuvant endocrine therapy of postmenopausal patients with HR-positive breast cancer.331,332 With a median of 100 months follow-up,resultsin5216postmenopausalpatientswithHR-positive, early-stage breast cancer enrolled in the ATAC trial demonstrated fewer recurrences (HR for DFS, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.76-0.94; P= .003) with anastrozole compared with tamoxifen.329 No difference in survival has been observed (HR. 0.90: 95% Cl. 0.75-1.07: P = .2).

In postmenopausal patients, the use of tamoxifen alone for 5 years (category 1) or up to 10 years is limited to those who decline or who have a 1 ? contraindicationtoaromataseinhibitors. P S NCCNRecommendationsforAdjuvantEndocrineTherapyfor Premenopausal Patients: If premenopausal at diagnosis, the NCCN Guidelines for Breast Cancer recommend 5 years of tamoxifen (category 1) with or without ovarian suppression (category 1) or ovarian suppression plus an aromatase inhibitor for 5 years (category 1). Patients who are premenopausal at diagnosis and who become amenorrheic with chemotherapy may have continued estrogen production from the ovaries without menses. Serial assessment of circulating LH, FSH, and estradiol toassureatruepostmenopausalstatusismandatoryif thissubset of patients is to be considered for therapy with an aromatase inhibitor.358.359 After5yearsofinitialendocrinetherapy,forpatientswhoare postmenopausal at that time (including those who have become postmenopausal during the 5 years of tamoxifen therapy), the NCCN Panel recommends considering extended therapy with an aromatase inhibitor for up to 5 years (category 1) or based on the data from the ATLAS trial considering tamoxifenfor an additional 5years.For thosewhd\n\n【615】remainpremenopausalaftertheinitial5yearsoftamoxifen,thepanel recommendsconsideringcontinuing upto10years of tamoxifen therapy\n\n【616】ranmoxertiierapy ResponsetoAdjuvantEndocrineTherapy:Themeasurementofthe nuclearantigen,Ki-67byIHC,givesanestimateofthetumorcellsinthe proliferativephase(G1,G2,andMphases)ofthecellcycle.Studieshave demonstratedtheprognosticvalueofKi-67asabiomarkerandits usefulness in predicting response and clinical outcome.360 One small study suggests that measurement of Ki-67 after short-term exposure to endocrine treatment may be useful to select patients with tumors resistant toendocrinetherapyandthosewhomaybenefitfromadditional interventions.361 However, these data require larger analytic and clinical validation. In addition, standardization of tissue handling and processing is required to improve the reliability and value of Ki-67 testing. At this time, there is no conclusive evidence that Ki-67 alone, especially baseline Ki-67 as an individual biomarker, helps to select the type of endocrine therapy for an individual patient. Therefore, the NCCN Breast Cancer Panel does not currently recommend assessment of Ki-67. The cytochrome P-450 (CYP450) enzyme, CYP2D6, is involved in the conversion of tamoxifen to endoxifen. Individuals with wild-type CYP2D6 alleles are classified as extensive metabolizers of tamoxifen. Thosewith one or twovariant alleleswith eitherreduced orno activity aredesignatedasintermediatemetabolizersandpoormetabolizers, respectively.Alargeretrospectivestudyof1325patientsfoundthattime todiseaserecurrencewassignificantlyshortenedinpoormetabolizersof tamoxifen.362 However, the BIG 1-98 trial reported on the outcome based on CYP2D6 genotype in a subset of postmenopausal patients with endocrine-responsive,early invasive breast cancer.363 The study found no correlationbetweenCYP2D6allelicstatusanddiseaseoutcomeor between CYP2D6 allelic status and tamoxifen-related adverse effects.363 geneticanalysisoftheATACtrialfoundnoassociationbetweenCYP2D6\n\n【617】utTOTTO\n\n【618】genotype and clinical outcomes.364Giventhe limited and conflicting evidenceatthistime,365theNCCNBreastCancerPaneldoesnot recommendCYP2D6testingasatooltodeterminetheoptimaladjuvant endocrine strategy.

O Bisphosphonates: In the Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group trial-12 (ABCSG-12) trial, for patients over 40 years, zoledronic acid) significantly reduced the risk of recurrence by 34% (HR, 0.66; P=.014) and the risk of death by 49% (HR, 0.51; P=.020). However, no improvement was seen in either DFS or OS in this post hoc analysis among patients under 40 years.367 In a planned subgroup analysis of the AZURE trial, zoledronic acid improved DFS in patients who were more than 5 years since menopause at trial entry.368 A meta-analysis of data from seven adjuvantbisphosphonatetrials(AZURE,ABCSG-12,ZO-FAST,Z-FAST, EZO-FAST,NSABP-B34,GAIN),includingonlythoseknowntobeover50 years, postmenopausal, or with ovarian suppression, showed a significant benefit for the use of adjuvant bisphosphonates in patients with a low-estrogenstateandearly-stagebreastcancer.369Morerecently,the EarlyBreastCancer Trialists'Collaborative Group(EBTCG)conducted a meta-analysisofallrandomizedadjuvantbisphosphonatestudies(26 studies)andreported convincingevidence thatadjuvantbisphosphonates providebenefits topostmenopausal(naturalorinduced)patientswith\n\n【621】breast cancer.370Withbisphosphonate therapy,thegreatest improvement wasseeninbonerecurrence(RR=0.83,P=.004)andbonefractures (RR=0.85,P = .02).No effect was seen on distant recurrence outside bone (RR=0.98,P=0.69).370 In premenopausal patients,bisphosphonate therapy did not seem to have a significant effect on bone recurrence. However,inpostmenopausal patients,zoledronic acid significantly reduced bone recurrence (3.4% vs. 4.5%, RR=0.73, 99% Cl 0.53 to 1.00) the difference in breast cancer mortality was not statistically significant (7.1% vs. 7.9%, RR=0.88, 99% CI 0.69 to 1.11).370 Denosumab:Intheadjuvantsetting,theABCSG-18trialstudiedtheeffect ofdenosumabinpostmenopausalpatientstreatedwith adjuvantAls and showed a reduction in clinical fractures (HR 0.5, P < .0001), which was the primary endpoint of this study.371 Subsequently in an interim analysis, an improvement in DFS, a secondary end point of the trial was reported.372 HoweverunlikethebisphosphonateswhichhavedemonstratedanOS benefit when used as adjuvant therapy, there is no available data showing an OS benefit with denosumab.

These analyses suggest that the benefits of chemotherapy are significantly greater in patients with ER-negative disease. For example, the results of Berry et al demonstrated that 22.8% morepatientswithER-negativetumorssurvivedwithoutdiseasefor5 years if they received chemotherapy; this benefit was only 7% for patients with ER-positive tumors receiving chemotherapy.274 Forpatientsgreaterthan70yearsofage,theconsensusof thepanel is that there are insufficient data to make definitive chemotherapy recommendations.AlthoughACorCMFhasbeenshowntobesuperiort capecitabine in a randomized trial of patients aged greater than or equal t 65 years with early-stage breast cancer,403 the enrollment in that study was discontinued early.403Therefore, there is also a possibility that AC/CMFisnotsuperiortoanychemotherapyinthiscohort.Thepanel\n\n【641】TutTOTTO\n\n【642】recommendsthattreatmentshouldbeindividualizedforpatientsinthis age group,with consideration given to comorbid conditions.

Furthermore, concerns have been raised regarding the long-term cardiac risks associated with trastuzumab therapy based on results of follow-up evaluations of cardiac function in patients enrolled in some of these trials.416.417 A third trial (HERA) (N = 5081) tested trastuzumab for 1 or 2 years compared to none following all local therapy and a variety of standard chemotherapy regimens in patients with node-positive disease or node-negative disease with tumor greater than or equal to 1 cm.407 At a median follow-up of one year, a 46% reduction in the risk of recurrence was reported in those who received trastuzumab compared with those who did not (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.43-0.67; P < .0001), there was no difference in OS, and acceptable cardiac toxicity was reported. The 2-ye data indicate that 1 year of trastuzumab therapy is associated with an OS benefitwhencomparedwithobservation(HRforriskofdeath=0.66;95 Cl, 0.47-0.91; P = .0115).418 After this initial analysis, patients randomize to chemotherapy alone were allowed to cross over to receive trastuzuma Intent-to-treat analysis including a crossover patient was reported at 4-year median follow-up.413 The primary endpoint of DFS continued to be significantlyhigherinthetrastuzumab-treatedgroup(78.6%)versus the observation group (72.2; HR, 0.76; 95% Cl, 0.66-0.87; P < .0001).

No statistically significant difference intheHRforDFSwasobserved between thetwo trastuzumab-containing arms. An OS advantage was reported for patients in both trastuzumab-containing arms relative to the control arm (HR for AC-TH vs. AC-T = 0.63; P = .001; HR for TCH vs. AC-T = 0.77; P = .04). Cardiac toxicity was significantly lower in the TCH arm (9.4% patients with) >10% relative decline in left ventricular ejection fraction) compared with the AC-TH arm (18.6%; P < .0001). CHF was also more frequent with AC-TH than TCH (2% vs. 0.4%; P < .001). Analysis of this trial by critical clinical event revealed more distant breast cancer recurrences with TCH (144vs.124)butfewercardiaceventswithTCHcomparedwithAC-TH(4 vs. 21).411 In the FinHer trial, 1010 patients were randomized to 9 weeks ofl vinorelbine followed by 3 cycles of FEC chemotherapy versus docetaxel for 3 cycles followed by 3 cycles of FEC chemotherapy.405 Patients (n = 232)withHER2-positive cancers that were either node-positive or node-negativeandgreaterthanorequalto2cmandPR-negativewere furtherrandomizedtoreceiveornotreceivetrastuzumabfor9weeks during the vinorelbine or docetaxel portions of the chemotherapy only.

Therefore, regimens from each of these trials are included as trastuzumab-containing adjuvant regimen choices in the guideline. The benefits of trastuzumab are independent of ER status.409.41 In the FNCLCC-PACS-04 trial, 528 patients with HER2-positive, node-positive breast cancer were randomly assigned to receivetrastuzumaborobservationaftercompletionofadjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy with or without docetaxel.419 No statistically significant DFS or OS benefit was observed with the addition of trastuzumab.

Some support for this recommendation comesfromstudiesshowingahigherriskofrecurrenceforpatientswith HER2-positive,node-negativetumorslessthanorequalto1cm compared to those with HER2-negative tumors of the same size.422 Ten-year breast cancer-specific survival and 10-year recurrence-free survival were 85% and 75%, respectively, in patients with tumors characterized as HER2-positive, ER-positive tumors, and 70% and 61% respectively, in patients with HER2-positive, ER-negative tumors. Two more retrospective studies have also investigated recurrence-free survival in this patient population. None of the patients in these two retrospective studies received trastuzumab. In the first study, 5-year recurrence-free survival rates of 77.1% and 93.7% (P < .001) were observed for patients with HER2-positive and HER2-negative T1a-bNOM0 breast tumors, respectively, with no recurrence-free survival differences seen in the HER2-positive group when hormonal receptor status was considered.423 Ir the other retrospective study of patients with small HER2-positive tumors, the risk of recurrence at 5 years was low (99% \\[95% Cl; 96%-100%\\] for HER2-negativediseaseand92%\\[95%Cl;86%-99%\\]forHER2-positive disease).428 Subgroup analyses from several of the randomized trials have shown consistent benefit of trastuzumab irrespective of tumor size or nodal status.411,429.430 NCCN-RecommendedHER-TargetedRegimens ThepanelrecommendsACfollowedbypaclitaxelwithtrastuzumabfor1 year commencing with the first dose of paclitaxel as a preferred HER2-targeting adjuvant regimen.

Considering the unprecedented improvement in Os in the metastatic setting431 and the significant improvement in pCR seen in the neoadjuvant setting,260.262 the NCCN Panel considers it reasonable to incorporate pertuzumab into the above adjuvant regimens, if the patient did not receive pertuzumab as a part of neoadjuvant therapy. An ongoing study is evaluating pertuzumab and trastuzumab with standard chemotherapy regimens in the adjuvant setting.432.433 Tno The NCCN Panel has included paclitaxel and trastuzumab as an option for patients with low-risk, HER2-positive, stage 1 tumors.

It may be considered as an option in patients with high lifetime risk (greater than 20% based on models largely dependent on family history) of developing a second primary breast cancer. Rates of contralateral breast cancer after either breast-conserving therapy or mastectomy have been reported to be increased in patients with BRCA1/2 mutations when compared with patients with sporadic breast cancer.440-442 The panel recommends that patients with intact uteri who are taking adjuvant tamoxifen should have yearly gynecologic assessments and rapid evaluation of any vaginal spotting that might occur because of the riskoftamoxifen-associatedendometrialcarcinomainpostmenopausal patients.443 The performance of routine endometrial biopsy or V ultrasonography in the asymptomatic woman is not recommended.

In one retrospective study of local recurrence patterns in patients with breast cancer who had undergone mastectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy without radiation therapy, the most common sites of local recurrence were at the chest wall and the supraclavicular lymph nodes.478 The recommendations for treatment of the population of patients experiencing a local recurrence only are supported by analyses of a combined database of patients from the EORTC 10801 and Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group 82TM trials. The analyses compared breast-conserving therapy with mastectomy in patientswith stage I and stage Il disease. The 133 (approximately 8%) patients experiencing a local recurrence as an initial event were approximately equally divided between those who had undergone mastectomy and those who had received breast-conserving therapy as initial treatment for breast cancer. Of those in the former group, 51 (76%) were able to undergo radiation therapy with or without surgery as treatment for local disease recurrence. No difference insurvivalemergedbetweenpatientsreceivingtreatmentafterinitial treatment withmastectomyor breast-conserving therapy; approximately 50% of both groups were alive at 10-year follow-up.479 According totheNCCNPanel,mastectomy-treatedpatientsshould undergo surgical resection of the local recurrence (if it can be accomplished with limited morbidity) and involved-field radiation therapy to the chest wall and supraclavicular area (if the chest wall was not\n\n【685】previouslytreatedorifadditionalradiationtherapymaybesafely administered).Theuseofsurgicalresectioninthissettingimpliestheuse of limited excision of diseasewith the goal of obtaining clear margins of resection.Unresectablechestwallrecurrentdiseaseshouldbetreated withradiationtherapyifnopriorradiationhasbeengiven\n\n【686】In patients with a local breast recurrence after breast-conserving surgery and radiation therapy who had a prior sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy, a repeat SLN biopsy may be considered although the accuracy of repeat SNB is unproven, and the prognostic significance of repeat SNB after mastectomy is unknown and its use is discouraged.480.481 On the other hand, the prognostic significance of repeat SLN biopsy after mastectomy is unknown and its use is discouraged.

One mechanism of resistance to endocrine therapy is activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signal transduction pathway. 口 A randomized phase ll study estimated the efficacy of tamoxifen alone versus tamoxifen combined with everolimus, an oral inhibitor of mTOR, in patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer previously treated with an aromatase inhibitor.545 After a median follow-up of 13 months,anintent-to-treat analysisshowed thattheclinical benefit was 42.1%(95%Cl,29.1-55.9)with tamoxifen alone and 61.1%(95%Cl, 46.9-74.1) with tamoxifen plus everolimus. An improvement in median time to progression was seen when everolimus was combined with tamoxifen compared with tamoxifen alone. Median time to progression\n\n【739】was 4.5months(95%Cl,3.7-8.7)with tamoxifen aloneversus8.5months (95%Cl. 6.01-13.9) with everolimus and tamoxifen.545\n\n【740】AphaseIll trial inpostmenopausalpatientswithadvanced,HR-positive breast cancer with no prior endocrine therapy for advanced disease, randomizedsubjectstoletrozolewithorwithoutthemTORinhibitor temsirolimus has been reported.546 In this study, PFS was not different between the treatment arms (HR, 0.89; 95% Cl, 0.75-1.05; log-rank P = 18). TheresultsofthistrialdifferfromthatoftheBOLERO-2trial(described below). The reasons for the differences in the outcomes of these two randomized phase Ill studies546.547 is uncertain, but may be related to the issues of patient selection and extent of prior endocrine therapy. A phase Ill study (BOLERO-2) randomized postmenopausal patients with HR-positive advanced breast cancer that had disease progression or recurrance during treatment with a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor to exemestane with or without the mTOR inhibitor everolimus.548Final result reported after median 18-month follow-up show that median PFS (by central review) remained significantly longer with everolimus plus exemestane versus placebo plus exemestane at 11.0 versus 4.1 months, respectively; (HR, 0.38; 95% Cl, 0.31-0.48; P< .0001).547 The adverse events (all grades) that occurred more frequently in those receiving everolimusincludedstomatitis,infections,rash,pneumonitis,and hyperglycemia.547.548 Analysis of safety and efficacy in the elderly patients enrolled in this trial showed that elderly patients treated with an everolimus-containingregimenhadsimilarincidencesoftheseadverse events, but the younger patients had more on-treatment deaths.549 Based. ontheevidencefromtheBOLERO-2trial,theNCCNPanelhasincluded everolimusplusexemestaneasanoptionforpatientswhofulfilltheentry criteriaforBOLERO-2.Tamoxifenorfulvestrantincombinationwith everolimushavealsobeen included asoptions.TheNCCNpanelalso\n\n【741】utTOTTC\n\n【742】notesthatifthereisdiseaseprogressionwhileonan everolimus-containing regimen, there are no data to support an additionall lineof therapywith anothereverolimusregimen\n\n【743】Aromatase inhibitors:Aromatase Inhibitors as monotherapy are options as subsequent-line therapy.

Estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) activating mutations are frequently detected in patients with prior exposure to Als. Tumors with these mutations are generally resistant to both Als and tamoxifen. Certain tumorswiththesemutationsretainsensitivitytofulvestrant.All maybenefit by adding one of the following to fulvestrant - a CDK 4/6-inhibitor, or an mTOR-inhibitor,oralpelisib,ifthetumorhasPlK3CAmutation.\n\n【744】RegimensUsefulinCertainCircumstancesforTherapyforHR-Positive, HER2-NegativeBreastCancer\n\n【745】Megestrol acetate,527,55355 estradiol556 androgens such as fluoxymesterone, and single agent abemaciclibhave been listed as optionsuseful incertaincircumstances.\n\n【746】The phase lIl MONARCH 1 trial, evaluated the activity of abemaciclib as a single agent in patients (n =132) with refractory HR-positive, HER2-negative metastaticbreast cancer who had disease progression while on endocrine therapy and already received multiple systemic therapies (average of three prior systemic regimens).557 Ninety percent of patientshadvisceraldiseaseand50.8%hadmorethanthreesitesof metastases.557 Single-agent abemaciclib induced partial response in 26 (19.7%) and demonstrated an ORR of 19.7% (95% Cl: 13.3-27.5).557 Median PFS was 6 months (95% Cl: 4.2-7.5). At the final analysis, at 18 months, median OS was 22.3 months (95% Cl: 17.7-not reached).557 Diarrhea was the most frequent adverse event reported in 90.2% patients Other common adverse events were fatigue (65.2%), nausea (64.4%) and decreased appetite (45.5%). Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia occurred in 26.9% of patients.557 The NCCN panel has included single agent abemaciclib as an option for those with disease progression on prior endocrine therapy and prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting. 1 1O7 SystemicTherapy for Stage IV or Recurrent HR-Negative,HER2-Positive BreastCancer ForpatientswithHER2-positive,HR-negativerecurrent/stageIVbreast cancer, the treatment approach is HER2-targeted therapy in combination with systemic chemotherapy. The NCCN panel notes that an FDA-approved biosimilar is an appropriate substitute for trastuzumab. Also,trastuzumabandhyaluronidase-oyskinjectionforsubcutaneoususe maybesubstitutedfortrastuzumab.Thissubcutaneousoptionhas different dosage and administration instructions compared to intravenous trastuzumab.Doses and schedules of representativeregimensforuse in HER2-positivemetastaticbreast cancer are also included inNCCN Guidelines.\n\n【747】utTOTTO\n\n【748】PatientswithdiseaseprogressionwhilebeingtreatedwithHER2-targeted therapyshouldbeofferedadditional lineoftreatmentwitha HER2-targeted therapy since it is beneficial to continue suppression of the HER2 pathway.The choice of theHER2-targeted therapy will depend on previously administered therapy, relapse-free interval, and patients' preferenceandaccess. The optimal sequence of available HER2-targeted therapies and the optimal duration of HER2-targeted therapy for recurrent/stage IV is currently unknown. The NCCN panel recommends continuing HER2-targtedtherapyuntilprogression/unacceptabletoxicity. 1一 PreferredRegimensforStageIV/RecurrentHER2-PositiveBreastCancer A randomized, double-blind, phase Ill study (CLEOPATRA) compared the efficacy and safety of pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab and docetaxel versus trastuzumab and docetaxel as first-line treatment for 808 patients (n=808) with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.58 This trial included patients (about 10%) who had previously received trastuzumab in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting. At a median follow-up of 19 months, the addition of pertuzumab to docetaxel plus trastuzumab resulted in improvement in PFS compared with placebo (median, 18.5 versus 12.4 months; hazard ratio \\[HR\\] 0.62, 95% CI 0.51-0.75, P < .001).558 At a median follow-up of 30 months the results showed a statistically significant improvement in Os in favor of the pertuzumab-containing regimen, with a 34% reduction in the risk of death(HR,0.66;95%Cl,0.52-0.84;P= .0008).431 The most common adverse reactions reported in the pertuzumab group compared to the control group were diarrhea (67% vs. 46%), rash(34% vs. 24%), mucosal inflammation (27% vs. 20%), febrile neutropenia(14%vs.8%),and dryskin(10%vs.4%).Peripheraledema and constipation were greater in the control group.558 Cardiac adverse eventsor left ventricular systolicdysfunctionwerereported slightlymore frequentlyinthecontrolqroup.559Health-relatedQOLwasnotdifferentin\n\n【749】thetwo treatmentgroups.560In thePERUSEstudy,patients(n=1436)with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer and no prior systemic therapy (exceptendocrinetherapy)receiveddocetaxel,paclitaxelornab-paclitaxe with trastuzumab and pertuzumab until disease progression or unacceptabletoxicity.Thepreliminaryresultsafter52monthsmedian follow-up, show that median PFS was comparable between docetaxel, paclitaxel and nab-paclitaxel (median PFS reported was19.6, 23.0 and 18.1 months with docetaxel, paclitaxel and nab-paclitaxel, respectively).56 Compared with docetaxel-containing therapy, paclitaxel-containing therap was associated with more neuropathy (31% vs. 16%), but less febrile neutropenia (1% vs. 11%) and mucositis (14% vs. 25%). Phase ll trials have also found activity and tolerability for pertuzumab, pertuzumab with trastuzumab, and for other regimens combining pertuzumab and trastuzumab together with other active cytotoxic agents (i.e., paclitaxl, vinrelbine)562563,564 Phase Il rias f peruzumab ps chemotherapy without trastuzumabhave not been reported. R The NCCN Panel recommends pertuzumab plus trastuzumab in combination with a taxane as a preferred option for first-line treatment of patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.

PFS (assessed by independent review) was significantly improved with T-DM1 with median PFS of 9.6 months vs. 6.4 months with lapatinib plus capecitabine; HR for progression or death from any cause was 0.65 (95% Cl, 0.55-0.77; P< .001). At the first interim analysis, T-DM1 also demonstrated significant improvement in OS. The stratified HR for death from any cause with T-DM1 versus lapatinib plus capecitabine was 0.62 (95% Cl, 0.48-0.81; P = .0005).578 Rates of grade 3 or 4 adverse events were higher with lapatinibpluscapecitabine thanwithT-DM1(57%vs.41%).The incidences of thrombocytopenia and increased serum aminotransferase levels were higher with T-DM1 (frequency >25%), whereas the incidences of diarrhea,nausea,vomiting, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia were higherwithlapatinibplus capecitabine.578\n\n【759】Aphasellsingle-armstudyevaluatedfam-trastuzumabderuxtecan-nxki, HER2antibodyconjugatedwithatopoisomeraseIinhibitor,inadults (n=184)withpathologicallydocumentedHER2-positivemetastaticbreast cancerwhohadreceivedmultipleprevioustreatmentsincludingtreatment with T-DM1.579 After a median duration of follow-up of 11.1 months (rang 0.7-to 19.9), the medianresponse duration withfam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxkiwas14.8months(95%Cl,13.8to16.9),and themedian PFS was 16.4 months (95% Cl, 12.7 to not reached).579 Most commonly reported adverse events (grade3 or higher)were a decreased neutrophil count (20.7%), anemia (in 8.7%), nausea (in 7.6%), and fatigue (6%).579 Interstitial lung disease (ILD) was reported in 13.6% of the patients (grade 1 or 2 - 10.9%; grade 3 or 4 - 0.5%; and grade 5 - 2.2%).

A variety of chemotherapy regimens are felt to be appropriate, as outlined in the treatment algorithm. Combination chemotherapy generally provides higher rates of objective response and longer time to progression, in comparisontosingle-agentchemotherapy.Combinationchemotherapyis, however, associated with an increase in toxicity and is of little survival benefit.600-604 Furthermore, administering single agents sequentially decreases the likelihood that dose reductions will be needed. Thus, the NCCN Panel finds no compelling evidence that combination chemotherapy is superior to sequential single agents. Therefore, sequential monotherapy is the preferred and combination therapy is useful in patients with rapid clinical progression or need for rapid symptom and/or diseasecontrol. Usually the first-line regimens are given until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Considering what is unacceptable toxicity and considering no further cytotoxic therapy should be decided together with the patient.

Among preferred single agents, the NCCN Panel has included taxanes (paclitaxel),anthracyclines(doxorubicinand liposomal doxorubicin), anti-metabolites (capecitabine and gemcitabine), microtubule inhibitors (eribulin and vinorelbine), platinum agents for patients with triple negative tumors and germline BRCA 1/2 mutations. Paclitaxel can be administered weekly (80 mg/m2)612 or every three weeks (175 mg/m2).613 A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that compared weekly and every three weeks taxanes regimens in advanced breast cancer showed that compared with every three-week treatment, weekly administration of paclitaxel resulted in an improvement in Os (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.67-0.89).614 Doxorubicin (60 to 75 mg/m2) every three weeks, or 20 mg/m2 weekly has shown an ORR between 30 to 47%.615-618 Liposomal doxorubicin (50 mg/m2 every 4 weeks) has been shown to have efficacy similar to doxorubicin(60mg/m²every3weeks).619Ithasalsobeenshowntohave efficacy in the second-line setting for patients with metastatic breast cancer.619Comparedwithdoxorubicin,theliposomaldoxorubicinhas a lessfrequentdosingscheduleanddecreasedriskofcardiotoxicity7%vs. 26%,HR 3.16;95%CI1.58-6.31),decreased rate of nausea(37%vs. 53%) and vomiting (19% vs. 31%), lower rates of alopecia (20% vs. 66%), and neutropenia (4% vs. 10%).619 However, compared with doxorubicin it was associatedwith a higherrateof palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (48% vs. 2%), stomatitis (22% vs. 15%), and mucositis (23% vs 13%).619\n\n【788】utTOTTC\n\n【789】Thebenefitofcapecitabine asa treatmentoptionforpatientswith metastaticbreastcancerhasbeendemonstratedinmultiplephaselltrials.

There is an associated cancer elsewhere in the breast in up to about 80% to 90% of cases.667-669 The associated cancers are not necessarily located adjacent to the NAC and may be either DCIS or invasive cancer. Patients with clinical signs that raise suspicion for Paget's disease require a complete history and physical examination and diagnostic breast imaging. Any breast lesion identified by imaging or examination should be evaluated according to the NCCN Guidelines for Breast Screening and Diagnosis. The skin of the NAC should undergo surgical biopsy, including the full thickness of the epidermis including at least a portion of any clinically involved NAC. When biopsy of the NAC is positive for Paget's disease, breast MRl is recommended to define the extent of disease and identifyadditionaldisease.669.670 OO There are no category 1 data that specifically address local management of Paget's disease. Systemic therapy is based on the stage and biological characteristics of any underlying cancer, and is supported by the evidence cited in the relevant stage-specific breast cancer treatment guidelines. Management of Paget's disease has traditionally been total mastectomy withaxillarydissection.Totalmastectomyremainsareasonableoptionfor patientsregardlessoftheabsenceorpresenceofanassociatedbreast cancer.68 Data demonstrate that satisfactory local control may be achieved with breast-conserving surgery including the excision with negativemarginsofanyunderlyingbreastcanceralongwithresectionof\n\n【807】the NAC followed bywhole breast radiation therapy.671-675The risk of ipsilateralbreastrecurrenceafterbreast-conservingNACresectionand radiationtherapywithorwithoutanassociatedcancerissimilartothat with breast-conserving surgery and radiation therapy with the typical invasiveorinsitucancer\n\n【808】For Paget's disease without an associated cancer (ie, no palpable mass o imaging abnormality), it is recommended that breast-conserving surgery consist of removal of the entire NAC with a negative margin of underlying breast tissue.

In the presence of an underlying invasive breast cancer treated with breast-conserving surgery axillary surgery should be performed according to the Surgical Axillary Staging outlined in the NCCN Guidelines. In cases treated by total mastectomy, axillary staging is recommended for patients with invasive disease and should alsobe considered for patients with underlying DCIS without evidence of invasive disease. This is because the final pathology mayrevealaninvasivecancerinthemastectomyspecimenand the mastectomy precludes subsequent sentinel node biopsy.

In a California registry study, there were 1.3 breast cancers diagnosed per 10,000 live births.686 Unfortunately, breast cancer during pregnancy is most often ALN-positive and with larger primary tumor size. Histologically the tumors are poorly differentiated, are more frequently ER/PR-negative, and approximately 30% are HER2-positive.687,688 The diagnosisisoftendelayedbecauseneitherthepatientnorthephysician suspectsmalignancy. Evaluationofthepregnantpatientwithsuspectedbreastcancershould include a physical examination with particular attention to the breast and regional lymph nodes. Mammogram of the breast with shielding can be done safely and the accuracy is reported to be greater than 80%.689 Ultrasound of the breast and regional lymph nodes can be used to assess the extent of disease and also to guide biopsy. Ultrasound has been reported to be abnormal in up to 100% of breast cancers occurring during pregnancy.689 Biopsies for cytologic evaluation of a suspicious breast massmaybedonewithFNAofthebreastandsuspiciouslymphnodes However, the preferred technique is core needle biopsy.

Estimation of the date of the delivery will help with systemic chemotherapy planning. In addition, maternal fetal medicine consultation should include counseling regarding maintaining or terminating pregnancy. Counseling o the pregnant patient with breast cancer should include a review of the treatment options, which include mastectomy or breast-conserving surger as well as the use of systemic therapy. The most common surgical procedure has been modified radical mastectomy. However, breast-conserving surgery is possible if radiation therapy can be delayed to the postpartum period,690 and breast-conserving therapy during pregnancy does not appear to have a negative impact on survival.690.691 When surgery is performed at 25 weeks of gestation or later, obstetrical andprenatalspecialistsmustbeonsiteandimmediatelyavailableinthe eventofprecipitousdeliveryofaviablefetus. SSS Although there are a limited number of isolated case reports and small retrospective studies evaluating use of SLN biopsy in pregnant patients,692.693 the sensitivity and specificity of the procedure has not been established in this setting. Thus, there are insufficient data on which to base recommendations for its use in pregnant patients. Decisions related to use of SLN biopsy in pregnancy should be individualized. A review of the relative and absolute contraindications to sentinel node biopsy concluded that sentinel node biopsy should not be offered to pregnant patientsunder30weeksgestation.694Therearelimiteddatawithonly case reports and estimations of fetal radiation dose regarding use of radioactive tracer(eg, technetium 99m sulfur colloid).695-697 Isosulfan blue\n\n【820】TutTOTTO\n\n【821】or methyleneblue dyefor sentinel node biopsyprocedures is discouraged duringpregnancy.\n\n【822】Theindicationsforsystemicchemotherapyarethesameinthepregnant patient as in the non-pregnant breast cancer patient, although chemotherapy should not be administered at any point during the first trimester of pregnancy. The largest experience in pregnancy has been with anthracycline and alkylating agent chemotherapy.698.699 Collected data of chemotherapy exposure in utero indicate that the first trimester has the greatest risk of fetal malformation.700.701 Fetal malformation risks in the second and third trimester are approximately 1.3%, not different than that of fetuses not exposed to chemotherapy during pregnancy. If systemic therapy is initiated, fetal monitoring prior to each chemotherapy cycle is appropriate. Chemotherapy during pregnancy should not be given after week 35 of pregnancy or within 3 weeks of planned delivery in order to avoid the potential for hematologic complications during delivery. Data from a single-institution prospective study indicate that FAC chemotherapy (5-FU 500 mg/m2 IV days 1 and 4, doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 by IV infusion over 72 hours, and cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 IV day 1) may be given with relative safety during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.699 As reported by Gwyn et al, the median gestational age at delivery was 38 weeks, more than 50% of the patients had a vaginal delivery, and there were no fetal deaths.687 An update of this experience reported on 57 patients treated with FAC in the adjuvant or neoadjuvant setting.

IBC is usually HR-negative and is more frequently HER2-positive than the usual ductal breast cancers. Studies on gene expression profiling of IBC have demonstrated that all the subtypes of IBC exist, but basal and HER2 overexpressed are more frequent.718-721 According to the 7th edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, IBC is classified as stage IlIB, stage IllIC, or stage IV breast cancer, depending on the degree of nodal involvement and whether distant metastases are present. The primary tumor of IBC is classifiedasT4dbydefinition,evenwhennomassisspecificallyapparent in the breast. On radiographic imaging, findings of skin thickening and, in some cases, an underlying mass are observed. Despite use of the term “inflammatory,” the characteristic clinical features of IBC are due to 2 blockageofdermal lymphaticsbytumoremboli.Althoughabiopsyis required to evaluate for the presence of cancer in breast tissue and the dermal lymphatics, a diagnosis of IBC is based on clinical findings, and M dermal lymphatic involvement is neither required, nor sufficient by itself, to assign a diagnosis of IBC.722723 The differential diagnosis includes cellulitis of thebreastandmastitis In thepast,IBC hasoftenbeenplaced under the general heading of locally advanced breast cancer. There is a growing body of evidence that IBC patients, when compared with noninflammatory forms of locally advanced breast cancer, are more likely to have a less favorable prognosis724-726 and to be younger at the time of disease presentation.727 TheNCCNPanelacknowledgesthatstudiesfocusingongenetic characterization of IBC are needed to more clearlv define IBC as a\n\n【829】diseaseentityand tooptimizetreatment.728.729Nevertheless,current evidenceprovidesjustificationforaseparateguidelinefortheworkupand treatmentofpatientsdiagnosedwithIBC\n\n【830】StageT4d,N0-N3,M0 Workup Patientswithaclinical/pathologicdiagnosisofIBCwithoutdistant metastasis (stage T4d, N0-N3, M0) should undergo a thorough staging evaluation by a multidisciplinary team.

The NCCN Panel endorses the CAP protocol for pathology reporting (www.cap.org) and endorses the AscO CAP recommendations forqualitycontrolperformanceofHER2testingandinterpretationofIHC and ISH results.730 PSS Imaging studies help facilitate image-guided biopsy, delineate locoregiona disease, and identify distant metastases. Evaluation of all patients suspected with IBC must include diagnostic bilateral mammogram, with the addition of ultrasound as necessary. A breast MRl scan is optional. Evaluations for the presence of distant metastasis in the asymptomatic patient include LFTs, bone scan or sodium fluoride PET/CT (category 2B) and diagnostic CTimaging of the chest, abdomen,andpelvis(category 2B; category 2A for diagnostic CT imaging of the chest when pulmonary symptomsarepresent).\n\n【831】TutTOTTO\n\n【832】FDGPET/CT maybemost helpful in situationswherestandard imaging resultsareequivocalorsuspicious.However,thereislimitedevidence suggestingthatPET/CTmaybeauseful adjunct tostandard imagingof IBC due to the increased risk of regional lymph node involvement and distant spread of disease in this group of patients.109,110.731.732 Nevertheless, equivocal or suspicious sites identified by FDG PET/CT scanningorotherimagingmethodsshouldbebiopsiedforconfirmationof stage IV disease whenever possible.

Optimization of immune function and avoidance of additional immunosuppression are critical to prevention of additional Ks lesions and maintenance of response to therapy. For AiDS-related KS, reconstitution of immune function and maintenance of viral suppression are important. Also, it is important to work with an HiV specialist to optimize suppression of HIV and reconstitution of immune function with ART. Important examples of iatrogenic immunosuppression,which may promote Ks, include not only systemic but local glucocorticoids (ie, inhaled, topical, intra-articular).Note thatKS mayflareina remote locationfrom the site of localglucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids in any formulation should be avoided due to their association with KS progression. However, in cases of life-threatening conditions,theirusemaybeconsidered. Patients requiring rituximab for treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with coexisting KS or MCD may develop flares of KS or incident KS. This may be mitigated by use of concurrent chemotherapy active against both KS and disease for which rituximab is prescribed (ie, doxorubicin). Persons with AiDs-related KS, especially those with advanced immunosuppression, are at increased risk of Ols marrow suppression with neutropenic fever, or thrombocytopenic bleeding and should be monitored closely. It is important to collaborate with an HiV specialist to ensure adequate Ol prophylaxis appropriate to CD4+ T-cell count (which may temporarily decrease with cytotoxic chemotherapy). Growth factor support may be needed to facilitate systemic therapy. Lymphedemaandsofttissueinfections:Ksisoftencomplicatedbylymphedemawithincreasedriskofcellulitisanddeeptissueinfections in affected limbs. Risk of severe lymphedema and delayed wound healing may be increased after radiation. Refer to a lymphedema specialist In the setting of advanced cutaneous disease, radiation should be reserved for circumstances when systemic therapy is not feasible with the goal of palliation or short-term disease management until systemic therapy may be delivered. Note that treatment responses may be delayed inthecontextofsignificantlymphedema.\n\n【37】·PWHwith limited cutaneousdiseasethat isasymptomaticandcosmeticallyacceptablemaybeobservedwhilestartingorcontinuing ART with optimization of immune function and HiV viral suppression as above. Remissions or stable disease may occur with ART and optimizationofimmunefunctionandHiVviralsuppressionalone. · Patients with symptomatic or cosmetically unacceptable disease should use minimally invasive and the least toxic therapy to control disease.When necessary, a limited number of cycles of systemic therapy (eg, 3-6) may be sufficient for those initiating or re-initiating ART. Patientswithadvancedsymptomaticcutaneous,visceral,nodal,ororaldiseaseshouldbetreatedwithsystemictherapywiththegoalof reducing orreversing symptoms, lymphedema, or threat to organfunction.Complete remissions are rare. Treatment is typically continued until unacceptable toxicity or plateau in response; maintenance therapy beyond 2 cycles of systemic therapy after determination of plateau is not recommended. If response is then clinically acceptable, patients may be observed (while continuingART,inPWH).Otherwise,alternativetherapyshouldbeinitiated.\n\n【38】Comprehensive\n\n【39】$OFIMMUNERECONSTITUTIONINFLAMMATORYSY\n\n【40】CLINICALPRESENTATION/DEFINITION IRiSischaracterizedbyfirstpresentationorparadoxicalworseningofpre-existingKSinfectionfollowingARTinitiation. ·Typically occurswithin3months of ART initiation,but possible to occur any time afterstarting ART. ·The risk of IRiS is higher in patientswith baselinelow CD4 T-cell counts and highHiVviral loads.2 ·Clinical manifestations may include development of newlesions or enlargement of existing lesions,worsening lymphadenopathy, or worseningedema.TheclinicalpresentationofIRlSmaybechallengingtodistinguishfromthenaturalhistoryofprogressivedisease. ·IfIRiSissuspected,consultwithanHiVspecialist.

This Discussion section provides an overview of the literature supporting the recommendations included in the guidelines. The panel also publishes separateNCCNGuidelinesforCancerinPeoplewithHIV(availableat www.NCCN.org), which give recommendations regarding HIV management during cancer therapy, drug-drug interactions (DDls) with antiretrovirals and cancer therapies, radiation therapy,and supportive care for people with HIV (PwH).

In fact, CD4+ T- cellcountsandHlVviral loadcorrelatewiththeriskofKaposisarcomain PWH, and effective ART lowers the risk of Kaposi sarcoma development.19 Evidence also suggests that ART improves prognosis of Kaposi sarcoma in PWH. However, AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma can occurinPWHwithnormal CD4+T-cellcountsandundetectableHIVviral load. HIV management during treatment of Kaposi sarcoma in PWH is critical. Co-managementbyoncologistandHiVclinicianisrecommendedforthe durationof therapy.OncologyandHiVclinicians,alongwithboth an oncology pharmacist and HiV pharmacist if available, should review proposed cancer therapy, supportive care medications, and ART for possible DDls and overlapping toxicities prior to initiation of therapy for PWH.TheNCCNGuidelinesforCancerinPeoplewithHIV(availableat www.NCCN.org) provide additional recommendations on HIV screening, linkage to HIV care, prevention of opportunistic infections, DDls between antiretrovirals and cancer therapies, radiation therapy, and supportive care forPWH.\n\n【79】ClassicKaposi Sarcoma\n\n【80】ClassicKaposisarcomagenerallyinvolvesindolentcutaneouslesions, often of the lower extremities, that may wax and wane or slowly progress overyearstodecades.ItismostcommoninpeopleofMediterranean, EasternEuropean,MiddleEastern,and/orJewishorigins,withamean ageof74yearsatdiagnosis.1.3It isreportedtobe7to15timesmore commoninmalesthanfemales.1.3Separatemalignanciesmaybefairly common in patients with classic Kaposi sarcoma, and are more likely to be the cause of death in these patients.3\n\n【81】When Kaposi sarcoma occurs in the context of immunosuppressive therapy (for organ transplant or other reasons), it is called iatrogenic or transplant-associated Kaposi sarcoma.1 Lesions often appear 2 to 8 months after initiation of immunosuppression, and occur 2 to 3 times more often in males.1 Although this form of Kaposi sarcoma can be aggressive and involve lymph nodes, mucosa, and/or visceral organs, it frequently respondstoareductionorcessationofimmunosuppression.\n\n【82】EndemicKaposiSarcoma\n\n【83】Endemic Kaposi sarcoma occurs in children and younger adults (<40 years of age) of equatorial Africa.

StagingofKaposiSarcoma As delineated in the guidelines above, Kaposi sarcoma is staged using a TIS system in which aspects of the tumor (T), immune system (l), and systemic disease(S) are assessed with a 0 for good risk and 1 forpoor risk.32However,morerecentdatahaveshownthattheIstagehasless prognostic value than the T or S stages for PWH in the presence of ART.17 Kaposi sarcoma staged as T1S1 appears to have the worst prognosis. In a study of 211 patients with AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma, those staged as T1S1 had a 3-year survival rate of 53%, whereas for those staged as T0S0, T1S0, or T0S1, the 3-year survival rates were 88%, 80%, and 81%, respectively (P = .0001).17 Assessing Response of Kaposi Sarcoma ResponseofKaposisarcomatotherapyhasbeenformallydefinedbythe AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) Oncology Committee as follows32: Complete response (CR) is defined as the absence of any detectableresidualdisease,includingtumor-associated(local) edema,persistingfor atleast4weeks.Patientsknowntohavehad visceral disease should have restaging with appropriate\n\n【96】Staging ofKaposi Sarcoma\n\n【97】Assessing Response of Kaposi Sarcoma\n\n【98】endoscopicorradiographicproceduresrelevanttositesinvolved at baseline.

Stable disease (SD) is defined as any response that does not meet the criteria for progressive disease (PD) or PR.

Over time, many lesions will graduallyfade,dependingonmanyfactors,including chronicityand sizeo the lesion as well as degree to which extravasation occurred. 一 Initial Management of Kaposi Sarcoma PWH with limited cutaneous disease that is asymptomatic and cosmetically acceptable to the patient maybe treated with ART alone(see below).PatientswithoutHiVcanbeobserved until thediseasebecomes symptomatic and/or cosmetically unacceptable. 一 PWH with symptomatic and/or cosmetically unacceptable limited cutaneousdiseaseshouldbetreatedwithARTandwiththemost minimally invasive and least toxic therapy possible. When necessary, a limited number of cycles of systemic therapy (eg, 3-6; options discussed below) may be sufficient for those initiating or re-initiating ART. Other options include radiation, and for small lesions (ie, ≤1 cm), topical treatment,intralesionalchemotherapy,cryotherapy,andlocalexcision(all discussed below). Intralesional chemotherapy and radiation to plantar and palmarsurfacesmaybeusefulinselectedcases,butshouldbe approached with caution because of toxicity or functional adverse events. Increased risk of long-term wound healing, particularly in the setting of coexisting lymphedema, is a concern. 2 The same treatment options,without ART, are recommended for patients without HiVwhohavelimited cutaneous disease that is symptomatic and/orcosmeticallyunacceptable. If disease progresses on therapy in PWH, inadequate HIV control/ART failure should be considered as a contributing factor to inadequate Kaposi sarcoma control.

Preferredinitialtreatmentforpatientswithadvancedcutaneous,oral, visceral, or nodal Kaposi sarcoma is systemic therapy,with ART for PWH. For those not eligible for systemic therapy,radiation canbe used,with ART for PwH. The data supporting these treatment options are described below.Well-designedclinicaltrialswithagentspreviouslydemonstratedto nave significant activity in relapsed/refractoryKaposi sarcoma may also be considered for frontline therapy. 1 Iit is important to note that individual Kaposi sarcoma lesions may be distinct clones that arise because of the common risk factors of immunosuppression and persistent KSHV infection as opposed to metastases.Furthermore,persistence of KSHV infection results in ongoing risk of recurrence/disease progression. Currently, eradication of KSHV is not possible. Therefore, treatment of existing disease may not prevent occurrence of future lesions. Given this and the fact that many presentations of Kaposi sarcoma are not life-threatening, the goals of therapv are focused on disease control.\n\n【104】AntiretroviralTherapyforPWH\n\n【105】Reconstitutionofimmunefunction,maintenanceofviralsuppression,and avoidanceof additional immunosuppression arecritical toprevent additional Kaposi sarcoma lesions and maintain response to therapy in PWH. In fact, in the setting of limited cutaneous disease, remissions or stable disease may occur with optimization of immune function and HIV viral suppression alone.3339Therefore, co-management with an HIV\n\n【106】utTOTTC\n\n【107】specialisttooptimizesuppressionofHIVandreconstitutionof immune functionwithARTisimportantforpatientswithAiDS-relatedKaposi sarcoma(seetheNCCNGuidelinesforPeoplewithHIV,availableat www.NCCN.org)\n\n【108】ImmuneReconstitutionInflammatorySyndrome(IRiS)\n\n【109】InitiationofARTmayresult inimmunereconstitutioninflammatory syndrome (IRlS) within 3 to 6 months in a reported 6% to 39% of patients with AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma.40-44 Kaposi sarcoma-associated IRIS is characterized by marked lesional swelling, increased tenderness, and peripheral edema.Individuals with pulmonary involvement, concurrent or recent use of glucocorticoids,and/or advanced immunosuppression may be at increased risk.40.41.43 In contrast with management of IRIS for some opportunistic infections, glucocorticoids are generally contraindicated in Kaposi sarcoma, as well as in Kaposi sarcoma-associated IRiS, because of thepotential for life-threateningKaposi sarcoma exacerbation resulting from stimulatory effects of glucocorticoids on Kaposi sarcoma spindle cells and association of glucocorticoid use with increased mortality.41,45,46 Management of Kaposi sarcoma-associated IRiS will often require systemicKaposisarcomatherapyandshouldinvolvecoordinationwithan HIV specialist. ART should not be delayed or discontinued unless life- threatening IRiS develops. Whereas there are no prospective trials using thalidomidefor Kaposi sarcoma-associated IRiS, successful control of steroid-refractoryIRlSwiththalidomidehasbeenreported,and 一 thalidomide is an active agent in Kaposi sarcoma.47\n\n【110】TopicalTherapies\n\n【111】TopicalTherapies\n\n【112】Topicaltherapiesareanoptionforpatientswithlimitedcutaneousdisease that is symptomatic and/or cosmetically unacceptable.Alitretinoin gel, a retinoid, was studied in a phase Ill vehicle-controlled, double-blind, multi- centeredstudy,inwhich134patientswithAiDS-relatedKaposisarcoma receivedeither0.1%alitretinoingelorvehiclegeltwicedailyfor12\n\n【113】weeks.4Thecutaneoustumorresponserateswere37%inthealitretinoin groupcomparedwith7%inthecontrolgroup.Anotherverysimilar randomized,multicenter,double-blind,vehicle-controlledstudyalso comparedtumorresponseratesinpatientswithAlDS-relatedKaposi sarcomabetweenanalitretinoingroupandacontrolgroup.49Response rates in the 268 patients were 35% for those receiving 0.1% alitretinoin gel compared with 18% for those who received the vehicle gel.

Most patients in both arms experienced greater than or equal to 1 grade 3/4 adverse event, with leukopenia, nausea/vomiting, anemia, and peripheral neuropathy as the most common adverse events in the liposomal doxorubicin group. Pegylated-liposomal doxorubicin was also compared with bleomycin/vincristine (BV) in another randomized trial of patients with AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma (n = 241).92 As in the other trial, response rates were superior in the liposomal doxorubicin group compared with the BV group (59% vs. 23%; P < .001). Pegylated-liposomal doxorubicin resulted in an increased risk of neutropenia, but was less likely to result in earlytreatmentcessation.Liposomaldoxorubicinhasalsobeenshowntd have activity in classic and transplant-associated Kaposi sarcoma.60.93 Liposomal doxorubicin is associated with risk of cardiotoxicity.94-96 Therefore,abaselinemultigatedacquisition(MUGA)orechocardiogram shouldbeperformedpriortoinitialandrepeatcoursesofliposomal doxorubicin,97 and the lifetime dose should be limited to 400 to 450 mg/m An alternative option for first-line systemic therapy for limited cutaneous andadvanceddiseaseispaclitaxel.Earlystudiesshowedthatithas\n\n【128】significantactivityintheadvanceddiseasesetting,withneutropeniaasthe most frequent dose-limiting toxicity.60.98.99 Onetrialrandomized73patientswithadvancedAiDS-relatedKaposi sarcoma to paclitaxel or pegylated-liposomal doxorubicin.1oo The two arms were statistically equivalent with regard to response rates, median progression-free survival,and 2-year survival.A trend toward increase in grade3tograde5toxicitywasseeninthepaclitaxelarm(84%vs.66%;F = .077), with 1 lethal, grade 5 pulmonary embolism in a patient treated with paclitaxel.

SystemicTherapy of Relapsed/RefractoryDisease Atfirstprogression,thesamesystemictherapyoptionsasinfirst line (liposomaldoxorubicinandpaclitaxel,discussedabove)maybe consideredasfollows: ·If first-line therapy was tolerated and a durable response (>3 months) was seen, then a repeat of the therapy used in first line shouldbeconsidered. If there was no response to first-line systemic therapy, then an ? alternative first-line therapy option should be given. Following subsequent progressions, liposomal doxorubicin or paclitaxel, whichever has not yet been administered, is recommended.104.105 Following treatment with liposomal doxorubicin and paclitaxel, the panel recommendspomalidomideasthepreferredregimen.Pomalidomidewas studied in a phase I/ll trial of 7 people without HIV and 15 PWH who had Kaposisarcoma.106PWHwererequired tohaveviremiacontrolledand\n\n【134】eitherprogressiveorstableKaposisarcomaonART.Mostofthe participants (17 of 22; 77%) had previous therapy for Kaposi sarcoma, exclusive of ART.107 The response rate was 60% in the PWH group (95% Cl, 32%-84%).

Patients can continuethroughalltreatmentoptionslisted,andtreatmentscanbe repeated if they were tolerated and the responsewas durable(≥3 months). In select cases, best supportive care may be an appropriate option. 加 Bortezomibwasstudiedinthedose-escalation,pilotAMC-063trial,which included 17 patients with relapsed/refractory AiDS-related Kaposi sarcoma on ART.108 The maximum tolerated dose was not reached.

If oral etoposide is used, the panel recommends the dose escalation used in this trial, as indicated in the guidelines. Etoposide also has activity in classic Kaposi sarcoma.60,120 ForKaposi sarcoma associatedwith immunosuppressionfromsolid organ transplant,switchingtosirolimusforimmunosuppressionmaybesufficient forKaposisarcomacontrol and treatment. In astudy of 15patientswho underwent kidney transplants and developed Kaposi sarcoma, Cyclosporine therapy was stopped and sirolimus was initiated.121 At 3 months after the start of sirolimus therapy, all cutaneous lesions had disappeared in all patients, all with confirmed histologic remission at 6 months. No acute episodes of rejection or changes in kidney-graft function wereseen. Imatinib has activity in AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma.122,123 The strongest evidence comes from a multicenter phase ll trial in which 30 patients were treated with imatinib.124 Eighteen patients (60%) had received prior therapy. Partial response occurred in 33% and 20% had stable disease.

PWH with limited cutaneous disease that is asymptomatic and cosmetically acceptable to the patient may be treated with ART alone. Remissions or stable disease may occur with optimization of immune function and HiVviral suppression alone. Thosewithsymptomaticand/orcosmetically unacceptable limited cutaneous disease should be treated with therapy that isminimally invasivewiththeleasttoxicitypossible,andwithART,ifHIV-positive. Options include a limited number of cycles of systemic therapy, topical treatment, intralesional chemotherapy, radiation, cryotherapy, and local excision. 二 Preferred initial treatment for patients with significant lymphedema and advanced cutaneous, oral, visceral, or nodal AIDS-related Kaposi sarcon is ART with systemic therapy or systemic therapy for those without HIV. Alternatively, a well-designed clinical trial of an agent previously demonstratedtohaveactivityisanappropriateoption.Forthosenot eligibleforsystemictherapy,radiationcanbeused(withARTforPWH).

Furthermore,becauseindividualKaposisarcomalesionsareoftendistinc clones as opposed to metastases, treatment of existing disease does not preventoccurrenceofnewlesions. For relapsed/refractory disease, a typical systemic therapy sequence would be first-line liposomal doxorubicin, followed by second-line paclitaxel, followed by pomalidomide in the third line of treatment. Additional lines of other therapies can be given, and any systemic therapy thatwastoleratedwithadurableresponsecanberepeated. Glucocorticoidsinanyformulationshouldbeavoided inpatientswith active or prior Kaposi sarcoma, or other KSHV-associated conditions, given the potential to cause significant flares or relapses of Kaposi sarcoma. The use of glucocorticoids should be limited to life-threatening conditions for which glucocorticoids are otherwise indicated (ie, anaphylaxis).OthertherapiesassociatedwithflaresofKaposisarcoma include those suppressing B- and T-cell numbers and/or function such as rituximab and cyclosporine,respectively.127.128 Of note,patientswith AIDS related lymphomas who have concurrent Kaposi sarcoma are often able t receivemultiagent chemotherapyregimens includingglucocorticoids and rituximab without flare of Kaposi sarcoma if the regimen also includes agents active against Kaposi sarcoma such as anthracyclines. Overall,thesurvivalofpatientswithKaposisarcomahasgreatlyimproved andlong-termsurvivalcanbethegoalformanypatients.Thegoalsof therapy for patients with advanced disease are namely reducing or reversing symptoms and mitigating end organ damage.

治疗过程中常见的毒副反应之一，发生率为21%～ 66%\\[1-3\\]。随着CAR-T细胞治疗的不断开展，国内外 对于治疗相关神经系统毒副反应的诊断和处理有 了更深人的了解，中华医学会血液学分会白血病淋\n\n【5】月第43卷第2期ChinJHematol 1.43,No.\n\n【6】学杂志2022年2月第43卷第2期ChinJHematol，February2022，\n\n【7】·标准与讨论?\n\n【8】巴瘤学组和中国抗癌协会血液肿瘤专业委员会造 血干细胞移植与细胞免疫治疗学组组织相关专家 编写此共识，旨在帮助临床医务工作者对CAR-T细 胞治疗过程中神经系统毒副反应的发生发展有更 系统的认识，从而做到有效预防和治疗，提高CAR-T 细胞治疗的安全性。 一、定义及发生机制 2017年Neelapu团队首先提出“CAR-T细胞相\n\n【9】杂志2022年2月第43卷第2期ChinJHem\n\n【10】关性脑病综合征（CRES）”的概念，是指在CAR-T细 胞治疗过程中，部分患者出现的头痛、妄、震颤、 精神状态改变、注意力下降、语言障碍等神经系统 异常表现\\[48\\]。2019年美国移植和细胞治疗学会 （ASTCT）进一步提出了“免疫效应细胞相关神经毒 性综合征（ICANS）”的概念”，即包括CAR-T细胞 在内的免疫治疗后，患者内源性或外源性T细胞和 (或)其他免疫效应细胞激活或参与而引起的一系 列神经系统异常的临床表现。ICANS的定义较 CRES更为准确地反映了神经系统病变的病理生理 学特征，在目前临床诊断和治疗中获得了更广泛的 认可和应用。本文使用ICANS命名CAR-T细胞治 疗相关神经系统毒副反应。 ICANS的发生机制尚未完全明确。目前认为 与CAR-T细胞治疗过程中单核/巨噬细胞活化介导 的大量炎症因子释放有关，而内皮细胞激活导致 血管通透性增加、血脑屏障的完整性被破坏,ⅡL-6、 IFN-v和TNF-α等多种细胞因子选择性通过血脑 屏障，进人中枢神经系统，促进了ICANS的发 展\\[-2\\]。在发生严重ICANS患者的尸检病理中发现 脑组织水肿，血管周围间隙扩大、液体外渗，皮质和 白质星形胶质细胞损伤，小胶质细胞激活等，证实 炎症和血脑屏障破坏参与了ICANS的发生发展 过程\\[13-14\\] MFD 目前已上市的针对CD19、BCMACAR-T细胞 产品\\[15-19治疗相关ICANS发生率为28%～87%。 在两项套细胞淋巴瘤患者接受CAR-T细胞治疗的真 实世界研究中,ICANS 发生率均在60%左右\\[20-21\\]。 最近研究报道供者来源CD19CAR-T细胞治疗急性 B淋巴细胞白血病异基因造血干细胞移植后复发患 者的ICANS发生率为21%\\[22\\]。ICANS发生率差异 较大，与患者原发病、疾病状态、CAR-T细胞类型和 输注剂量等因素有关。目前认为CAR-T细胞治疗 前肿瘤负荷高、既往存在中枢神经系统损伤或肿瘤 累及、输注高剂量CAR-T细胞，以及CAR分子结构 包含鼠源单链可变片段（scFv）、使用CD28共刺激 分子等，与ICANS发生率高有关(23-4\\]。 二、临床表现 ICANS临床表现多样，早期症状常表现为注意 力减弱、语言障碍、书写能力减退等，可进一步发展 为定向力障碍、情绪异常、失语、嗜睡、意识模糊和 震颤等\\[3.1225\\],大多数患者ICANS临床症状呈可逆 性\\[2\"。少数患者可出现严重的临床症状，表现为癫 痫发作、精神错乱、颅内压增高等。最严重的\n\n【11】ICANS临床表现是急性脑水肿，患者可在数小时内 从轻度的嗜睡进展为神志不清，进一步发展导致 死亡\\[11,13.27\\] ICANS的症状和体征通常在CAR-T细胞输注 后第3～6天出现，第7～8天达到高峰，后随着时间 推移而逐渐改善，持续2～3周症状消失。早期发 生细胞因子释放综合征(CRS)的患者常合并严重 ICANS\\[\"。大约10%的患者在CAR-T细胞治疗后 第3～4周发生癫痫或妄等延迟性神经毒副反应。 鉴于ICANS临床表现复杂性和多样性，可运用 量表对其进行分级”，指导疾病治疗。国际评分量 表包括通用不良事件术语标准5.0（CTCAE5.0）、 CAR-T细胞治疗相关毒性评分(CARTOX)和对 CARTOX改良后的免疫效应细胞相关脑病评分量 表（ICE）。临床工作中通常应用CARTOX-10和 ICE评分系统，将ICANS分为四个等级。 三、辅助检查 在ICANS的诊断过程中，全面的神经系统检查 非常重要，尤其是在疾病早期神经系统毒性症状表 现不典型时。因此，对于既往有中枢神经系统疾病 病史，或肿瘤累及中枢的患者，在CAR-T细胞输注 前，需接受全面的神经系统评估，必要时请神经专 科医师会诊。对于CAR-T细胞输注后所有患者，建 议运用CARTOX-10或ICE评分量表，进行每天2次 神经系统评估。当患者出现ICANS的临床表现时， 应及时增加评估次数。除密切监测患者血常规、血 生化、凝血功能、铁蛋白、细胞因子水平等指标，还 需要进行以下几个方面检测。 1.脑脊液检查：排除禁忌证后，可行腰椎穿刺 和脑脊液(CSF)检查。发生ICANS时，常表现为颅 内压升高，CSF检查可出现蛋白异常升高，偶尔可 超过10g/L，过高的CSF蛋白水平与预后不良相 关\\[\\]。CSF细胞计数通常轻度升高\\[2\\],以淋巴细胞 为主，部分患者CSF中通过流式细胞术可检测到 CAR-T细胞。大部分CAR-T细胞治疗后患者因 骨髓抑制而并发血小板减少，腰椎穿刺术前应认真 评估穿刺风险，必要时输注血小板后再行穿刺术。 2.头颅CT/磁共振(MRI)：头颅CT有助于发现 脑出血、脑梗死和脑水肿。头颅MRI表现多样，无 特异性。T2WI或者FLAIR显示脑室旁、丘脑、延髓 出现高信号，有时病变累及双侧，部分患者弥散加 权成像(DWI)发现皮层高信号，提示出现细胞毒性 水肿。小脑弥漫性水肿也有个例报道。大部分患 者的影像学异常在症状缓解后可消失。及时的影\n\n【12】像学检查有助于排除其他疾病，同时也有利于动态 观察患者的神经系统毒副反应\\[10.14.28。 3.脑电图：常见的表现是弥漫性的慢波伴/不伴 1-2Hz的三相波,部分患者出现纺锤波或癫痫波。 大多数情况下，脑电图变化与临床症状发生具有一 致性，脑电图异常与神经系统毒副反应的严重程度 相关\\[2，对高危患者，推荐脑电图动态监测。 四、诊断及鉴别诊断 鉴于ICANS的临床表现多样，推荐多学科联合 诊疗(MDT)模式进行临床诊疗。ICANS的诊断依 据包括： 1.患者在CAR-T细胞治疗后出现神经和(或) 精神症状及相应体征。 2.经CSF、头颅MRI、脑电图等检查，符合 ICANS表现。 EX 3.排除其他神经系统疾病，主要包括：①颅内 感染：可有精神症状，如妄、嗜睡等，常伴有发热 等感染表现，推荐头颅增强CT或MRI评估颅内情 况，可进行CSF常规、培养、病原学宏基因组二代测 序等检查进一步明确病原学依据。②颅内出血：根 据出血部位和出血量不同，临床表现有差异，多发 生在患者骨髓抑制期严重血小板减少时；常起病较 急，神经系统症状和体征在短时间内加重，伴有严 重血小板减少时应警惕颅内出血发生可能，头颅CT 平扫可进一步明确是否存在颅内出血。③原发病 中枢累及：对于治疗前已有中枢累及或可能发生中 枢累及的高危患者，应注意鉴别原发病的进展， 必要时可进行CSF流式细胞术检测、头颅MRI等 检查。 1 W 五、治疗 1 中 ICANS临床处理主要根据评分量表进行分层 治疗(图1)。对已经出现神经系统症状的患者，应 依据量表进行动态监测，根据患者病情变化，随时 调整治疗策略。对于评分达到3～4级ICANS患 者，建议转入重症监护病房，必要时予机械通气支 持。在处置ICANS过程中，建议多学科联合治疗。 1.对症支持治疗：无论ICNAS等级如何，CAR-T 细胞治疗后患者均应注意休息，可选择头部抬高体 位(通常与床面呈30度），以增加静脉回流，防止误 吸。吸氧补液，暂禁食禁饮，评估吞咽功能；加强营 养支持，注意水、电解质平衡。积极控制体温，出现 发热时可予物理降温措施和布洛芬等非留体类药 物，高热持续不退患者可使用冰毯辅助降温。 2.糖皮质激素：在临床实践中，糖皮质激素常\n\n【13】22年2月第43卷第2其\n\n【14】作为ICANS的一线治疗手段3\"。糖皮质激素的使 用是否会影响CAR-T细胞的疗效，目前尚无统一意 见\\[3-32\\]。因此在密切监测患者病情变化的前提下， 可遵循最低治疗剂量、最短治疗时间、快速减量的 原则使用糖皮质激素，对于≥2级ICANS患者，可予 地塞米松10mg每6h1次或甲泼尼龙1mg/kg每 12h1次方案治疗，直到ICANS等级降为1级后，开 始减量，3d内减停\\[33-34\\]。病情特别严重者可予甲泼 尼龙每天1g的方案冲击治疗2～3d34。 3.抗IL-6治疗：目前没有证据表明抗IL-6治疗 可以降低ICANS的发生和延缓进展，建议对所有 等级的ICANS患者评估有无合并CRS。对于 ICANS并发CRS的患者，可使用抗IL-6的治疗，建 议ⅡL-6受体拮抗剂托珠单抗（tocilizumab）每次8 mg/kg，单次最大剂量800mg，必要时每8h可以重 复1次，最多使用4次。对于没有合并CRS的 ICANS患者，不推荐使用托珠单抗治疗，因其有可 能会导致IL-6浓度升高，诱发严重ICANS\\[35-36\\]。国 外有研究报告使用L-6抗体司妥昔单抗 (siltuximab)每次11mg/kg治疗,可直接结合IL-6， 不会引起外周血或CSF中IL-6浓度升高。 4.抗癫痫治疗：对于接受CAR-T细胞治疗的 患者，尤其是既往有癫痫发作史、肿瘤累及中枢神 经系统或头颅MRI、脑电图有异常的患者，在开始 进行CAR-T细胞治疗时，可常规使用左乙拉西坦 750mg每12h1次口服预防癫痫的发生\\[²”。若出现 癫痫发作，可选用经典的抗癫痫药物口服（卡马西 平、丙戊酸钠、苯妥英纳等）,或选用新型抗癫痫药 物(拉莫三嗪、加巴喷丁、左乙拉西坦、奥卡西平和 托吡酯等）。 对于惊厥性癫痫持续状态，初始治疗首选静脉 地西泮10mg，10～20min内可酌情重复1次，或肌 肉注射10 mg咪达唑仑。如果治疗效果不佳,可选 择丙戊酸钠15～45mg/kg（<6mg·kg'·h-)静脉推 注5min后，续以1～2mg·kg\"·h-静脉泵注。若出 现难治性癫痫持续状态，可选择静脉输注麻醉药物 (丙泊酚、戊巴比妥、硫喷妥钠与咪达唑仑等)3\\]。 对于非惊厥性癫痫持续状态，通常静脉给予地 西泮10mg，如治疗10min后癫痫持续状态仍未终 止，可相同剂量重复1次。如发作仍未控制，则静脉 注射丙戊酸钠。如患者癫痫发作持续>60min,建 议开始应用麻醉药物，包括丙泊酚、戊巴比妥、硫喷 妥钠与咪达唑仑等\\[3\\]。抗癫痫治疗过程中，需要密 切关注患者呼吸循环系统，防止发生呼吸抑制。\n\n【15】I液学杂志2022年2月第43卷第2期Chin』Her\n\n【16】5.降颅内压治疗：对于存在1级或2级视乳头 水肿，CSF压力<20mmHg（272mmHO），且无脑水 肿的患者：①床头抬高30度；②控制躁动，维持颅内 压稳定；③尽可能缩短患者胸部物理护理（气管内吸 痰、震动排痰、体位引流、叩背)时间（<30min），以避 免颅内压进一步增高。 对于存在3～5级视乳头水肿，伴影像学任何脑 水肿征象，或CSF压力≥20mmHg（272mmHO)的 患者，应给予积极治疗\\[83，包括：①过度通气， PaCO2维持28～30mmHg，不超过24h。②脱水治 疗：首先推荐使用20%甘露醇，初始剂量为0.25～ 1 g/kg；维持剂量每3～6h0.25～0.5g/kg，同时每 6h监测电解质、内环境、容量状态及血浆渗透压 等，治疗目标一般为维持血浆渗透压在300～ 320mOsm/L，对于老年患者及肾功能容易受损的患 者，治疗目标可为290～300mOsm/L。脱水治疗 也可考虑使用高渗盐水（建议3%），推荐初始剂量 3%高渗盐水250ml,维持剂量每小时50～75ml，同 时每4h1次监测电解质，如果血清钠离子水平≥ 155mmol/L，则停用高渗盐水。呋塞米联合甘露醇 有助于提高降颅压疗效，可用于甘露醇单用疗效不 佳患者。若肾功能不全，也可选用甘油果糖，但甘 油果糖存在短时间颅压反弹现象，使用时需警惕。\n\n【17】脱水治疗过程中，需严密监测患者生命体征，防止 发生肾功能衰竭、电解质紊乱、血容量不足和低血 压等，并需警惕脑水肿复发。③如果装有ommaya 囊，可直接抽取CSF，直至CSF压力<20mmHg 272mmHO）。④如上述治疗效果不佳，可请神经 外科医师评估是否可行手术治疗。 六、预后 通常情况下ICANS预后良好，但少部分患者可 进展为急性脑水肿等重症。在靶向CD19的CAR-T 细胞治疗时，致命性神经系统毒副反应发生率约 3%\"，不容忽视。总之，目前ICANS的治疗方法有 限，早诊断、早预防是管理ICANS的重要手段。

Authorshipincludesamultidisciplinarygroupofthyroidcancerexperts 小狗科 小狗科研公开课 INTRODUCTIONX Between 2013 and 2015, a number of multikinase inhibitors (MKls) targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) were approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of advanced/metastatic differentiated thyroid cancers (DTCs) (i.e. 公开课 lenvatinib and sorafenib) and medullary thyroid cancers (MTCs) (i.e. cabozantinib 小猪 and vandetanib), thus becoming the standard first-line systemic therapy in this setting.1 Head-to-head comparisons between the two pairs of drugs (i.e. lenvatinib versus sorafenib, and cabozantinib versus vandetanib) have never been undertaken, thus not allowing a hierarchy to be established between them. The use of these agents in a real-world setting is mainly influenced by the regulatory heterogeneity across countries. If all available, an individualised cost-effectiveness analysis that considers the differences in terms of effectiveness and safety profile helps to decide the order in which they should be used. After these MKls entered the market, several 公开课 studies emerged to verify and describe the drugs' benefit.2-4 Data on real-life produce data on safety profiles that mimic those reported by the randomised clinical trials (RCTs). Substantial differences, however, emerge among studies in the magnitude of MKI effects and the incidence of some adverse events. This can 名 largelybeexplainedbytheheterogeneityacrossthestudiesininclusioncriteria sample size (small series are more prone to be influenced by outliers), drug doses, lengths of follow-up, assessment of disease progression and analysis of the outcome measures. Given the toxicities associated with MKls, clinicians sometimes prefer to 可寸 starttreatmentatalowerthanapproveddose.ArecentRCTcomparedtheefficacy +口升\n\n【9】Systemictherapyandpersonalisedmedicine\n\n【10】Cabozantinib.InSeptember2021,theFDAapprovedcabozantinibtabletfor treating adults and adolescents aged ≥12 years with radioactive iodine (RAl)- refractory DTC who progressed during previous treatment with MKls targeting the VEGFR (i.e. sorafenib or lenvatinib).

It is worth noting that cabozantinib capsule is also formulations are not bioequivalent and should not be used interchangeably.

The decision should be individualised foreach patient considering the likelihood of response and safety profile of the drug.The selective RET inhibitors seipercatinb and praisetinib. In 2020, twoselective RET inhibitors were approved by the EMA and the FDA in different settingsfor the treatment of advanced/metastatic DTC harbouring a RET fusion gene.Sepercatinib. Sepercatinib is a novel, small-molecule RET inhibitor. The  |\n|  | Aygommended dose is 120 mg twice daily for patients weighing <50 kg or 160 mgtwice dailyfor those weighing ±50 kg.  |\n|  | In May of 2020, the FDA granted accelerated approval to selpectalinib for treatingpatients aged ±12 years who required systemic therapy for advanced/metastatic  |\n|  | RET fusion-positive DTCs and were refractory-tiyGirmelgible for RAI therapy. Eightmonths later (December 2020), selpectaliniva was also granted/conditional marketing  |\n|  | authorisation by the EMA for the treatment of advanced/metastatic RET fusion-positive DTCs. The drug was approved only for use in adults and only after previoustreatment with an approved MN (i.e., sorafenib, lenvatinib or both).The EMA and FDA approvals were based on the results of a multicentre, open-label,  |\n|  | multicohort clinical trial (\\[LBR-E\\].\\].00, NCT03157128) in patients with advancedRET-altered tumours ofvarioustypes.Efficacy for the treatment of RET fusion-positive thyroid cancers (TCs) was evaluated in a small cohort of 27 individuals aged  |\n|  | ±12 years or older with follicular cell-derived carcinomas (pagliary) in 13 patients,poorly differentiated in three, anaplastic in two and Hürthle cell in one/-leg/fusionpartners varied but CCDC6 was the most common. RAI therapy had beenadministered in all cases in which it was considered appropriate, but the disease had  |\n|  | apyglyatrably proved to be RAI-refractory. Nineteen of the 27 patients had received oneor more approved systemic drug therapies (i.e. lenvatinib, sorafenib and/ordoxorubicin).  |\n|  | The main efficacy endpoints in this study:wge an objective response (complete orpartial, as defined by the Response Evaluation??????)  |\n|  | v.1.1) and the duration of the response.9 Both were assessed by a blindedindependent review committee. The ORR for the 19 who had already receivedysystemic drug therapy was 79% (95% CI 54%-94%), and 87% of the responding  |\n\n【12】not received prior treatment (other than RAl, when appropriate), the ORR was 100% (95% Cl 63%-100%), and six (75%) of the eight patients had responses lasting ≥6 months.89 Selpercatinib displayed activity across all histologic types of TC represented in the cohort (including one ATC) and regardless of the RET fusion partner (CCDC186, ERC1, KTN1 or RUFY3).9 Safety was assessed in the 702 patients who received selpercatinib for any type of 小狗科 7RET-altered solid tumour in the LIBRETTO study. Ninety-five percent had received at least one dose of the drug at the recommended dosage of 160 mg twice a day. 十力 Sixty-five percent of the enrolled subjects were exposed to the drug for ≥6 months and 34% were exposed for >1 year.8 小狗科 The most common grade ≥3 TRAEs were hypertension (18%), increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels (9%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels(8%).Selpercatinibwaspermanently discontinued in 2%of patients owing to a TRAE (increased ALT in 0.4%, sepsis in 0.4%, increased AST in 0.3%, 小折 drug hypersensitivity in 0.3%, fatigue in 0.3% and thrombocytopaenia in 0.3%). In 42% of the patients, dosage interruptions were necessary due to a TRAE, the most common of which were increased ALT and/or AST levels. Overall, the most common TRAEs (those occurring in ≥25% of the patients) were increases in AST or ALT, increased glucose, decreased leukocytes, decreased albumin, decreased calcium, dry mouth, diarrhoea, increased creatinine, increased alkaline phosphatase, hypertension, fatigue, oedema, decreased platelets, increased total cholesterol, 河料研公开保 rash, decreased sodium and constipation.9 开说 Pralsetinib.Pralsetinib is the second selectiveRET kinase inhibitor thathas been authorised for treating advanced or metastatic RETfusion-positive DTCs. The recommended dose in adults and paediatric patients 12 years and older is 400 mg orally once daily on an empty stomach (i.e. no food intake for at least 2 hours before and at least 1 hour after taking the drug).10 公开课 InDecemberof2020,theFDAgrantedpralsetinibacceleratedapprovalforthe treatment of RETfusion-positive DTCs with the same age and prior treatment status requirements speified for selpercatinib (see earlie Selpercatinib section).

题，使耳内镜手术正在向中耳乳突部、岩尖方向拓 展。中耳介于外耳与内耳之间，是位于颞骨中的不 规则含气腔和通道，分为咽鼓管、鼓室、鼓窦、乳突 气房4个部分，其中鼓窦、乳突气房合称为中耳乳 突部\\[8。耳内镜中耳乳突部手术是指通过耳内镜 来提供视野，治疗中耳乳突部疾病的外科手术 方法\n\n【7】手术适应证与禁忌证\n\n【8】手术前应明确病变性质和范围，中耳乳突部病 变包含而不限于：胆脂瘤、胆固醇肉芽肿、炎性组 织、中耳良恶性肿瘤等，炎性组织和胆脂瘤病变较\n\n【9】为多见911。如胆脂瘤、胆固醇肉芽肿、中耳良恶 性肿瘤等病变具有破坏性和易复发性，术中应彻底 清除，而中耳炎性组织如瘢痕组织、钙化灶等不阻 塞引流通道和不影响听觉功能则可考虑不处理。 CT检查是中耳乳突病变的常用影像学检查方 法，能够清晰地显示耳部骨性细微结构，可对乳突 气房、鼓窦内有无病变组织及病变周围是否存在骨 质破坏做出明确判断\\[12-14\\]。MRI检查具有较高的 软组织分辨率，较好地鉴别病变性质，弥补了CT 检查的不足\\[1416\\]。纯音测听、声导抗、电生理等合 理完善的听力学检查在术前评估中耳生理功能状 态和听觉功能，这些功能对中耳乳突部的开放、充 填和含气腔重建的选择产生重要影响。组织病理 学检查对明确病变性质和切除范围极其重要。依 据影像学、听力学和组织病理学综合评估，中耳乳 突部病变可划分为孤立性、局限性和侵袭性。不同\n\n【10】的病变性质和范围决定了手术方式，而手术方式的 选择与耳内镜在术中的应用程度密切相关。 孤立性病变通常见于先天性胆脂瘤或后天性 胆固醇肉芽肿等，病变范围局限，CT扫描显示听骨 链侵蚀或乳突部任意部位的孤立性肿块\\[17-19\\]。对 于孤立性病变，耳内镜可经外耳道或乳突外侧壁开 放较小范围的骨质到达病变部位，相对于显微镜手 术而言具有微创、精准的优势。 局限性病变通常见于慢性炎症、获得性胆脂瘤 和中耳良性肿瘤病等，病变多起于中耳鼓室部，沿 含气腔通道向周围侵袭至鼓窦和部分乳突气房，可 能合并乳突气房内阻塞性炎症，出现中耳乳突部积 液或肉芽组织增生等病理改变\\[2\\]。耳内镜经外耳 道沿上鼓室入路进行外科手术切除，可保留乳突气 房和部分鼓窦正常黏膜，利于中耳功能的恢 复\\[21-23\\]。 侵袭性病变多因恶性肿瘤生长特性或随急性 炎症而快速向周围扩散。手术时需广泛切除中耳 乳突部病变及其相邻组织，出血较多，故选择耳内 镜时需谨慎评估。 综上所述，耳内镜中耳乳突部手术可以更精 准、更微创地处理孤立性、局限性病变，但在处理侵 袭性病变时·需考虑病变的性质与范围\\[22.24\\]\n\n【11】设备和修复材料选择\n\n【12】设备和修复材料选择\n\n【13】设备和修复材料选择\n\n【14】2.1磨骨\n\n【15】最基本配置的设备是耳显微动力系统。在持 续灌流模式的推广中，配备膨宫泵和内镜鞘或自制 灌流系统，能减少耳内镜进出术腔和吸出骨粉等耗 时操作\n\n【16】2\n\n【17】在持续灌流模式下，少量出血并不影响视野 如果骨缝或软组织出血较多，配备纤细能量设备如 等离子、针状双极等设备，能精准止血。\n\n【18】2.3术腔修复\n\n【19】术腔修复材料主要分为自体材料和生物材料。 自体材料可取软骨软骨膜复合物、颞肌筋膜、肌 瓣、乳突皮质骨片等，生物材料包括人工听骨、脱细 胞真皮基质、人工脑膜及羟基磷灰石粉等材料\n\n【20】3\n\n【21】耳内镜中耳乳突部手术主要经外耳道入路和 经乳突外侧壁筛区入路实现\\[25\\]。前者经外耳道后 上壁经上鼓室方可到达后上方的鼓窦，破坏外耳道 后上壁，多用于乳突开放式手术\\[26；后者经筛区经 乳突气房到达鼓窦，破坏乳突外侧壁，开放部分乳 突气房，多用于乳突闭合式手术。二者均与显微镜 下乳突闭合式、开放式手术相似，但创伤更小2\\]。 虽然耳内镜的特点使其在经乳突外侧壁或经 外耳道手术中通过破坏较少的正常解剖结构即可\n\n【22】获取良好视野28，但中耳乳突部手术仍需依据患 者病变性质、范围、术者的熟练程度来选择耳内镜 在手术中的应用程度\\[2\\]。依据耳内镜在手术中的 应用程度，耳内镜中耳乳突部手术也可分为全耳内 镜中耳乳突部手术、耳内镜联合或辅助显微镜中耳 乳突部手术\\[30-37\\]。\n\n【23】3.1全耳内镜中耳乳突部手才\n\n【24】全耳内镜下开放式中耳乳突部手术多经自然 外耳道或扩大外耳道入路，通过开放外耳道后上壁 到达中耳乳突部，属于开放式乳突手术的改良\\[38\\]； 也可经筛区鼓窦入路，通过开放乳突外侧骨质到达 中耳乳突部，归为闭合式乳突手术。\n\n【25】3.1.\n\n【26】经外耳道上鼓室入\n\n【27】路是经典的前入路，由经典的上鼓室切开术开始， 沿鼓切迹由前向后、由下向上依次切开上鼓室、鼓 窦、乳突气房。此径路可逐步处理上鼓室、鼓窦病 变，优势在于磨骨量少、创伤小，避免显微镜下的 蝶形术腔”或视野不良的影响；劣势在于依次切开 上鼓室、鼓窦、乳突气房，费时较长。\n\n【28】3.1.2\n\n【29】道锁孔技术\\[39\\]，并逐步完善为经外耳道鼓窦入路， 推荐操作顺序：先扩大外耳道后、上壁，同步削薄上 鼓室、鼓窦外侧壁骨质，定位并打开鼓窦，再依据病 变情况决定是否进一步开放上鼓室或乳突气 房\\[4\\]。上述改良术式的优势在于一开始可用较大 钻头扩大外耳道上后壁，提供较大的操作空间，缩 短到达鼓窦的手术时间，并可根据鼓窦病变情况灵 活变化手术方式。其优势还在于磨骨量少，外耳道 后壁缺损小，保留更多乳突外侧壁，相对于显微镜 开放式手术而言更易于重建外耳道壁。该术式要 求对鼓窦准确定位，术者须具备较好的耳内镜解剖 基础。 全耳内镜下经外耳道入路直达鼓窦，无外耳道 外切口，磨骨量少，符合大多数中耳胆脂瘤病变发 展途径，避免过多切除正常组织\\[29\\]。由于尽可能 地保留了乳突外侧骨质中的乳突气房，对保留中耳 含气腔体积和黏膜的通气功能具有积极的作 用\\[\\]。重建外耳道壁和中耳含气腔可以获取远期 良好的手术效果，全耳内镜下开放式中耳乳突部手 术保留了乳突外侧壁，此时重建外耳道后壁远较显 微镜下开放术式简捷易行\n\n【30】3.1.3经筛区经鼓窦入路全耳内镜下闭合式中\n\n【31】耳乳突手术经筛区经鼓窦入路，多用于探查和处理 鼓窦、乳突气房中孤立性或局限性病变\\[\\]。手术 经筛区开放部分鼓窦外侧气房进入鼓窦，仍然保留 了较多的乳突外侧壁骨质及乳突气房，保持外耳道 完整性，可经鼓窦开放上鼓室并同期进行听骨链重 建及鼓膜成形术，维持中耳正常的通气引流系统， 无需定期清理皮。此入路对于儿童中耳乳突部\n\n【32】手术尤为重要，为儿童中耳乳突气房术后再气化提 供了有利条件\\[43\\]。 全耳内镜中耳乳突部手术这3种入路，经外耳 道入路位于耳廓前，可称为前入路；经筛区入路位 于耳廓后，可称为后入路。前入路视野狭小、切口 隐蔽，有利于发挥耳内镜优势，可一并处理中耳鼓 室部病变，尽可能地保留了乳突气房及其黏膜。后 入路通过筛区进入鼓窦，可一并处理上鼓室、甚至 后鼓室病变，且一旦发现病变范围广泛，可及时更 改为显微镜下操作，对于术前难以明确中耳乳突部 病变时优势明显。后入路也适合于儿童患者，保持 了外耳道壁完整性，为乳突再气化提供了基础。 全耳内镜手术注重正常结构的保留，由于其微 创性使分期手术更易为患者所接受。通过合理的 分期手术可进一步拓展耳内镜手术应用范围，保留 更多的正常组织，以期获取良好的手术效果。\n\n【33】3.2\n\n【34】由于目前耳内镜手术技术的限制仍无法完全 替代传统显微镜手术，但在显微镜手术中，联合耳 内镜可解决显微镜因光路长而导致的精细结构侧 方视野“盲区”的问题，可更快更微创地处理病 变\\[44\\]。耳内镜联合或辅助显微镜中耳乳突部手术 通常用于侵袭性病变中范围广泛者，以耳内镜高清 广角的优势可以极大地减少病变残留，降低复发 率，在清除病变的基础下保留更多正常结构。\n\n【35】耳内镜开放式乳突术腔的处理\n\n【36】乳突气房的气化程度影响乳突通气量，乳突通 气量对调节中耳压力有重要作用\\[45\\]。目前中耳气 体来源主要是中耳乳突气房黏膜层的跨膜气体交 换\\[6\\]，咽鼓管功能仅为代偿机制\\[47\\]，中耳乳突部的 正常黏膜或可逆病变黏膜的保留是中耳功能性手 术重要基础之一。中耳乳突部与中耳气压有以下 两点关系：①中耳乳突部容积越大，系统顺应性越 好，引起的中耳乳突压力变化越小；②中耳乳突部 表面积越大，中耳气体交换速率越高。气房的蜂窝 状结构与乳突表面积正相关，可增加黏膜跨膜气体 交换效率。尤其在鼓窦和鼓窦周围乳突的黏膜是 调节气体交换和维持中耳稳态的基础\\[48\\]。当中耳 腔的压力下降时，小的乳突腔不能很好地缓冲，会 出现其他补偿缓冲机制，如通过鼓膜内陷或中耳积 液来提高中耳腔压力\\[49-52\\]。但当中耳乳突部黏膜 跨膜气体交换功能缺失时，过大的含气腔体积虽然 有利于调节中耳压力变化，但单一的咽鼓管气体来 源可能会加重咽鼓管的负担，出现长期负压状态而 致鼓膜内陷的可能。中耳乳突腔的处理需对咽鼓 管功能、乳突气房黏膜跨膜气体交换功能与中耳含 气腔体积的匹配性进行谨慎评估，以保障远期手术 效果53\\]\n\n【37】4.1开放中耳乳突部术胶\n\n【38】保留开放的中耳乳突术腔通向外耳道，不重建 外耳道上壁或后壁，可用外耳道皮瓣、筋膜或生物 材料覆盖上鼓室和鼓窦内侧骨壁，仅中鼓室形成含 气空腔。与显微镜开放式手术比较，其术腔较小， 创面小，术后恢复快，常用于胆脂瘤、中耳良恶性肿 瘤病变，其优点是利于术腔引流和观察术腔，可及 时处理复发的病变组织\n\n【39】4.2充填中耳乳突部术\n\n【40】取软骨、游离骨组织和生物材料进行乳突腔充 填，以缩窄或消除术腔，恢复外耳道自我清洁功能， 避免外耳道代谢产物的堆积和胆脂瘤形成。充填 的范围可包括乳突腔、鼓窦及上鼓室。 处理硬化型乳突或乳突气房黏膜合并不可逆 病变丧失正常跨膜气体交换功能时，确保彻底清除 病变，在合适中耳含气腔体积的前提下，用软骨、游 离骨组织和生物材料充填乳突部术腔。其优点是 形成近似正常的外耳道，提高干耳率，减少术后术 腔的清理\\[54\\]。大鼓室Ⅲ型含气腔也已有大量文献 证明其远期疗效令人满意\\[55\\]\n\n【41】4.3重建中耳乳突含气腔\n\n【42】当乳突气房无病变或为可逆性病变时，重建外 耳道后壁，保留乳突气房及其黏膜通过跨膜气体交 换来维持中耳的稳态及通气，具有积极的意义， 当咽鼓管功能正常、乳突气房气化较好、中耳 通气通路通畅、中耳乳突部内正常或病变可逆的黏 膜保留较多时，可利用软骨组织、乳突皮质骨片或 生物材料重建外耳道壁。由于保留了乳突外侧骨 质、外耳道后壁磨骨量少，重建外耳道壁所需的材 料较少，嵌顿稳固56。其优点是不仅保持了外耳 道形态，而且还保留了较大的中耳含气腔和中耳通 气功能。\n\n【43】耳内镜中耳乳突部手术培训和展望\n\n【44】由于耳内镜下“持续灌流模式”理念的引入， 其他学者将该理念进一步完善并推广，极大地解决 了既往耳内镜操作中磨骨和渗血问题？。随着能 量外科的发展，针状双极和耳科等离子等纤细能量 设备可以经狭窄通道到达深部术腔、精准止血、去 除组织絮状物和残留的病变组织。另外，耳内镜动 力系统的出现，也有效地解决了经狭窄通道去除深 部骨质的难题。这些技术和方法明显地缩短了手 术时间，使手术过程变得更加清晰和流畅。 耳内镜手术与传统显微镜手术理念一致，但在 手术视野和对手术器械的应用上存在差异。系统 地进行耳内镜中耳乳突部解剖以及手术操作训练 尤为重要，可降低手术风险，提高手术效率及成功 率。耳内镜观察和处理中耳的广角视野明显优于 额镜、显微镜提供的直视野，已被广泛应用于门诊 临床，耳内镜围手术期的熟练处理，也有助于快速\n\n【45】提高耳内镜操作技术。 相对于目前开展的耳内镜手术而言，依据手术 难度和技术要求具体归纳分类如下：1类：a.外耳 手术；b.鼓膜手术；c.中鼓室和（或）前鼓室手术； Ⅱ类：a.后鼓室和（或）下鼓室手术；b.上鼓室手术； Ⅲ类：a.鼓窦手术；b.乳突手术；Ⅳ类：a.内耳手术； b.岩尖和颞骨外等侧颅底手术\\[24\\]。在上述分类中， 1类手术操作技术的难度不大且较为安全，对显微 镜下操作经验的要求也不高，可迅速普及；Ⅱ、Ⅲ类 手术是耳科常见的手术，术者需深厚的操作经验和 耳科理论知识，建议在耳科技术较为成熟的单位开 展；ⅣV类手术，术者需要具备丰富的内耳和侧颅底 手术经验和理论知识，风险较高，目前在手术中耳 内镜主要起辅助显微镜的作用。初学者培训过程 先易后难，开展耳内镜中耳乳突部手术应建立在具 有良好的中耳鼓室部手术的基础上，评估自身的技 术、设备条件和病变的性质、范围，以避免严重并发 症的发生 耳内镜手术在单手操作、曲向操作、清晰术野 和去除组织等方面仍有一定的局限性，尽管如此， 耳内镜中耳乳突部手术理念更符合微创技术的要 求，随着人工智能医疗操作系统、精准控制的能量 平台等设备的研发，内镜技术取代显微镜技术已成 为可能，耳内镜手术应用范围将会进一步拓展。 参与讨论专家（按姓氏汉语拼音排序）： 崔勇（广东省人民医院耳鼻咽喉科)；陈正侬（上海 交通大学医学院附属第六人民医院耳鼻咽喉头颈 外科）；邓安春（陆军军医大学第二附属医院耳鼻咽

Introduction\n\n【12】Fabry disease (FD) is a rare, X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by pathogenic variants in the GLA gene encoding the enzyme Q-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) \\[1\\]. Deficient or absent α-Gal A and thesubsequent accumulationofglycosphingolipids suchas globotriaosylceramide (GL3) and globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-GL3) in various tissues and cells cause progressive damage to affected organs. life-threatening complications, and increased risk of premature death \\[2\\]. FD can be classified into two phenotypes: classic and later-onset. MaleswithclassicFDhaveseverelyreducedor absento-Galactivity and generally experience signs and symptoms from early childhood on- wards, including progressive cardiac, cerebral, and renal involvement 2,3\\]. Diagnosis of males with classic FD is confirmed if the activity of x-Gal is not detectable or is <1% of the expected value \\[2\\]. Lyso-GL3 evels in individuals with classic FD are usually higher than in patients with later-onset FD, and these levels are higher in males than females with classic FD. Individuals with a later-onset phenotype have higher residual α-Gal activity and canbe more challenging to diagnose because disease manifestations may be limited to a single organ and there may be a lack of early clinical symptoms including neuropathic pain, sweat- ing abnormalities, and angiokeratoma \\[2,3\\]. GLA gene analysis is re- quired for a definitive diagnosis in females and is advisable in all patients to assist in prediction of the phenotype.Female carriers of path- ogenic GLA variants displayvariable clinical penetrance,which is in part due to the process of lyonization \\[4\\]. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with human α-Gal has been the mainstay of FD-specific treatment to delay or prevent progressive organ damage and improve disease symptoms. There are two forms of intra- 1 venous ERT available: agalsidase alfa(Replagal?, Takeda）and agalsidase beta (Fabrazyme?,Sanofi）\\[5\\], both approved in the European Union (EU) in 2001. Oral chaperone therapy, migalastat Galafold?, Amicus), was approved for the treatment of patients with FD in the EU in 2016 \\[6\\] and in the US in 2018 \\[7\\]. Migalastat reversibly binds to the active site and stabilizes mutant forms of α-Gal, thereby promoting trafficking to lysosomes and substrate catabolism. Chaper- one therapy is only approved and suitable for patients carrying amena- ble GLA variants. which is defined as α-Gal A activity in the presence ofl\n\n【13】10 μmol/L migalastat that is ≥1.2-fold over baseline with an absolute in- crease of ≥3.0% wild-type α-Gal A activity \\[6,8\\]. Owing to the clinical heterogeneity of FD,the effect of disease-specific therapies varies ac- cording to disease severity,point of treatment initiation, the presence or absence of anti-drug antibodies in males, and patient adherence \\[9\\]. Therefore, therapeutic goals need to be individualized \\[10,11\\]. Early diagnosis of FD is essential for the timely initiation of FD- specific treatment \\[2,12\\], to delay or stop disease progression, reduce disease-associated morbidity, prolong survival, and improve patient quality of life (QoL) \\[13\\]. The identification of reliable and validated bio- markers for diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression and organ- specific pathology is crucial to improving patient outcomes because they can inform decisions on when to initiate or switch therapy and help in predicting events that may require organ-specific therapy \\[14,15\\]. The National Institutes of Health Biomarkers Definitions Working Group defines a biomarker as “a characteristic that is objectively mea- sured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic in- tervention\" \\[16\\]. Broader definitions of biomarkers include imaging\\] studies to diagnose and assess the severity of a disease and determine prognosis \\[17\\]. Characteristics of an ideal biomarker depend on its intended use (Fig. 1). Prognostic biomarkers assess the likely course off a disease with or without therapy and predictive biomarkers identify in- dividuals who are likely to respond to a given specific or targeted ther- apy. Pharmacodynamic biomarkers measure the effect of a drug on the disease state itself \\[18\\]. The complexity of lysosomal storage disorders, including FD, and their multi-system impacts mean that multiple bio- markers may be valuable in assessing disease course and response to therapy(Fig.2). GL3 and lyso-GL3 have been used extensively as biomarkers of FD for diagnostic purposes and to assess treatment outcomes in clinical studies; however, their use in monitoring disease progression and treat- ment response outside of clinical trials of ERT has only been employed in a small number of longitudinal studies \\[19,20\\]. Kidney biopsies have shown increasing GL3 accumulation with age \\[21\\], and clinicall studies have shown GL3 clearing of multiple kidney cell types in pa- tients receiving ERT or chaperone therapy\\[22-24\\].However, some\n\n【14】patients show diseaseprogression andpersistently elevated levels of plasma GL3 and lyso-GL3 despite ERT. This may be due to the pheno- typic heterogeneity of FD, type or dose of ERT, point of treatment ini- tiation,or the inhibitory effect of anti-agalsidase antibodies \\[3,25-29\\].Other biomarkers relating to changes in organ architec- ture or function have been identified, but few have been studied to evaluate theresponse toERT\\[14\\].Furthermore,thereislittle evi- dencerelating to the effect of chaperone therapy on disease-and organ-specific biomarkers \\[30\\]. As our understanding of FD improves and more treatment options become available, it is important to regularly re-evaluate and appraise published evidence relating to disease-specific biomarkers, treatment outcomes, and therapeutic goals for patients with FD.At present, the in- terpretation of published evidence of disease-specific therapies and bio- markers of FD is hindered by the relative lack of robust randomized clinical trials and the heterogeneity of patients included in different studies\\[31\\]\n\n【15】2.Objectives\n\n【16】In 2019, a European panel of experts collaborated to develop a set of organ-specific therapeutic goals for FD based on outcomes identified in a structured literature review of published evidence from adult male, adult female, and pediatric patients, and consensus opinion \\[13,32-34\\]. We now present the results of an updated structured litera- ture review that explored the effect of FD-specific treatments on FD- and organ-specific biomarkers in male and female patients with classic and later-onset disease. The objective of this article is to provide clinical recommendations for the use of FD- and organ-specific biomarkers in various tissues and body fluids, including blood and urine, as indicators of disease severity,progression, and response to FD-specific therapies, based on thatupdatedstructuredliteraturereview.\n\n【17】3\\. Methods\n\n【18】Thefull methodology for the structured literature searches that were performed for the first analysis have been described previously,to- gether with the expert consensus recommendations \\[13\\]. In this up- dated analysis, an extensive literature search, for articles published between February 2017 and July 2020 (inclusive), was conducted using the EMBASE and PubMed databases that included outcome data for approved dose regimens of agalsidase alfa 0.2 mg/kg every other week (EOW), agalsidase beta 1.0 mg/kg EOW, or oral migalastat 123 mg once every other day(EOD).Evidence from studies of adult male,fe- male, or mixed-sex (male and female) patient populations was graded on the basis of study type: randomized clinical trials (grade 1 evidence). comparative and switch studies (grade 1), prospective and retrospec- tive observational studies (grades 2 and 3 respectively), case series (grade 4), and case reports (grade 5) \\[35\\]. The findings from clinical trial and observational studies in this updated analysis are listed in Sup- plementary Table 1.Specific note has been made of altered dose regi- mens due to the temporary shortage of agalsidase beta to examine the efficacy of reduced-dose ERT \\[36\\]. Since the cut-off date for the original literature search, several studies of interest have been published. Al- though these were not incorporated in the original analysis, they war- rant inclusion for discussion in this article. Outcomes that were selected for analysis included plasma and urine GL3 and lyso-GL3 levels, biomarkers associated with kidney. heart, and central nervous system (CNS) function, and immunogeni- city or seroconversion. GL3 and lyso-GL3 levels were described as normalized’if they were higher than reference values at baseline (pre-treatment) and decreased to within reference value ranges during treatment, and if they were described as normalized in the publication; note that the reference values varied among studies. Biomarkers associated with the peripheral nervous system were ex- Cluded from this report due to limited data identified during the\n\n【19】literature search.Kidney, skin, and heart biopsy outcomes were cluded because the procedure isinvasive,and this review focuse onnon-invasivebiomarkersofFD. To our knowledge, this is the first time that this most recent evi- dence on FD biomarkers has been comprehensively reviewed. Most publications focused on the effect of disease-specific therapies on plasma lyso-GL3,highlighting the growing interest in the utility of this biomarker in early diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring. Our findings also reflect the need to identify disease- and organ-specific biomarkers that reflect early pathological changes associated with FD, before the manifestation of significant organ damage.\n\n【20】pactoftreatmentoutcomesonbiomarkersofFabrydisease\n\n【21】A total of 119 publications were identified for inclusion.Thekey rec ommendations for the practical application of FD-and organ-specifid biomarkers in clinical practice are provided in Table 1.\n\n【22】4.1.GL3andlyso-GL\n\n【23】FD results in the accumulation of glycosphingolipids, GL3 and its deacylated form, lyso-GL3.Therefore, these biomarkers have been stud- ied extensively for the diagnosis,treatment, and monitoring of FD,par- ticularly in the context of clinical studies \\[14\\]. Evidence from the literature, as well as this analysis, suggests that the measurement of lyso-GL3 in plasma and/or in dried blood spots (DBS) \\[37,38\\] is widely used in the biochemical confirmation of the diagnosis of FD, assessment of the phenotype and monitoring the response to ERT, as well as re- sponse following specific treatment modifications, including switching therapies \\[27.39\\]\n\n【24】4.1.1.Plasma GL3\n\n【25】A reduction in the levels of plasma GL3 with agalsidase beta was ob- served in one study\\[23\\] identified in the timeframe of this literature search, spanning from February 2017 to July 2020. Studies with data on the effects of agalsidase alfa or migalastat were not identified, but since this review, additional studies have been reported. Many centers have replaced measurements of plasma GL3 with lyso-GL3 as the fluctu- ation of lvso-GL3 seems to correlate better with disease activity \\[40\\].\n\n【26】4.1.2.Plasma,serum,and driedblood spotlyso-GL3 Lyso-GL3 can be measured directly in plasma and/or in DBS so the methodology applied should be considered when comparing lyso-GL3 outcomes \\[37\\]. Nowak et al. showed a good correlation between lyso- GL3 concentrations in DBS and sera \\[27,38\\]. The lyso-GL3 level in sera can be estimated from theDBS concentration bymultiplying the DBS value by 1.5. Another group showed good correlation between lyso- GL3 concentrations in plasma and DBS \\[37\\]. In a recent study by Maruyama et al, plasma lyso-GL3 was found to be an effective selective screening marker for classic and later-onset male and female patients with FD, thus identifying unrecognized FD cases \\[41\\]. Moreover, the demonstration of normal lyso-GL3 levels in plasma and/or DBS is crucial for the phenotypic characterization of individuals with GLA variants of unknown significance (VUS), as also demonstrated by newborn screen- ing studies in which lyso-GL3 was used as a second tier test \\[42,43\\]. However, it should be noted that plasma lyso-GL3 levels may also be el- evated in patients with Gaucher disease \\[37,44\\]. Generally, plasma lyso-GL3 levels decrease during the first 3 months of ERT \\[45\\]. It is still unclear whether a reduction in lyso-GL3 correlates with a reduction in clinical events in patients with FD \\[46\\]. Overall, stud- ies demonstrate that both agalsidase alfa and agalsidase beta signifi- cantly reduce plasma lyso-GL3 in male patients with a classic FD phenotype who have very high baseline levels.Conversely,reduction of lyso-GL3 levels in males with a later-onset phenotype and in all fe- males is likely to be minimal because baseline lyso-GL3 levels are only slightly elevated in this cohort of patients \\[27,30.47-50\\].\n\n【27】AVLE\n\n【28】In the diagnosis and follov\n\n【29】Brain MR\n\n【30】CKD, chronic kidney disease; CKD-EPl, Chronic Kidney Disease - Epidemiology Collaboration; DBS, dried blood spot; ECG, electrocardiogram; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate ERT, enzyme replacement therapy: FD, Fabry disease; GL3, globotriaosylceramide; hs-CTnT, high-sensitivity troponin T; lyso-GL3, globotriaosylsphingosine; MRI, magnetic resonanc imaging:; NT-proBNP, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide.\n\n【31】Evidenceidentified in this literature search suggeststhat ERTswitch from agalsidase alfa to agalsidase beta was associated with further re- ductions in plasma lyso-GL3 \\[25,51\\]. Evidence of the effect of migalastat on plasma lyso-GL3 identified in this literature review is still unclear. Switching treatment from ERT to migalastat sometimes results in a novel increase of lyso-GL3 levels in plasma, particularly in patients with very low residual enzyme activity and low increase of enzymatic activity after incubation with migalastat \\[52,53\\]. Findings from this analysis and the wider literature do not indicate a clear correlation between lyso-GL3, measures of FD progression and chaperone therapy responses. Post hoc analysis of treatment-naive and ERT-experienced patients from the FACETS and ATTRACT studies (with subsequent open-label extensions) found no significant correla- tions between changes in lyso-GL3 and changes in other FD parameters such as left ventricular mass (LVM) index, estimated glomerular filtra- tion rate (eGFR), or manifestations such as pain. However, a longitudi- nal correlation was identified between lyso-GL3 and worst pain in 24 h in the overall treatment group (N = 97), and between lyso-GL3 and LVM index in patients aged >40 years \\[30\\]. Lyso-GL3 may not always be a suitable biomarker for monitoring treatment response in patients with FD because the reversal of dysregulated cellular mechanisms in FD may not be possible with ERT after a certain point \\[54\\], at least in podocytes. In addition, neither baseline lyso-GL3 nor the rate of change in lyso-GL3 during treatment predicted the occurrence of Fabry- associated clinical events in all patients or those receiving migalastat for ≥24 months \\[30\\]. In addition to its usefulness as a diagnostic biomarker of FD, plasma lyso-GL3 may be useful in the assessment of disease severity, as it has been shown to correlate with Mainz Severity Score Index and DS3 scores \\[48,55,56\\]. However, although lyso-GL3 has been used exten- sively to evaluate treatment outcomes with respect to clinical studies of ERT, its utility in assessing clinical response outside this setting has not been validated, and few longitudinal studies have investigated\n\n【32】lyso-GL3for FD progression and clinical response to therapy for the guidance of treatment decisions \\[19,20\\]. Evidence relating to the prog- nostic value of lyso-GL3 is mixed. An explanation for this could be the different statistical method used in these studies,for example,some studies adjusted for factors that are closely correlated with lyso-GL3 e.g., age,sex,and/or phenotype or there maybe other factors which are more closely associated with prognosis. A study by Arends et al. ad- justed the hazard ratio for age at the start of ERT, sex, and phenotype and showed that neither the lyso-GL3 concentration at baseline, lyso- GL3 concentration during treatment, absolute decrease of lyso-GL3, nor the relative decrease of lyso-GL3 predicted the risk of clinical events in patients receiving ERT \\[19\\].A study by Nowak et al. adjusted for male sex, age, and classic phenotype and found higher baseline serum lyso- GL3 levels were associated with significant composite clinical events such as new onset of stroke, atrial fibrillation, kidney failure requiring kidney replacement therapy, and death. This finding suggests that lyso-GL3 may be a useful biomarker for risk stratification in patients with FD \\[57\\]. In line with this, another study found that higher plasma\\] lyso-GL3 levels were associated with increased prevalence of cardiomy- opathy, nephropathy, and cerebrovascular disease, but that levels of lyso-GL3 remained unaltered over 6-18 months of repeat testing, and were independent of sex, GLA mutation, or treatment status \\[58\\]. Fur- thermore, a study by Rombach et al. identified the importance of plasma lyso-GL3 as a screening tool for female patients with left ventricular hy- pertrophy (LVH) but found no apparent correlation between plasma lyso-GL3 concentrations and kidney failure, microalbuminuria, and pro- teinuria in their female cohort \\[48\\]. In contrast, a study by Nowak et al. found serum lyso-GL3 to be independently associated with Fabry ne- phropathy, cardiomyopathy, and history of stroke or transient ischemic attack\\[27\\]. In summary, lyso-GL3 is an easy-to-measure circulating compound in patients with FD, with utility in diagnosis and assessment of pharma- codynamic effect of treatments.The evidence on lyso-GL3 as a measure\n\n【33】of clinical severity and as a prognostic indicator is mixed, as docu- mented in the studies cited above.Further exploration of the correlation between lyso-GL3 and the degree of target organ involvement is war- ranted. Nonetheless, plasma lyso-GL3 has wider clinical applications than more invasive but definitive assessments of histological accumula- tion of tissue GL3 that require biopsies of the kidneys or heart and are notpart of routine clinical practice.\n\n【34】4.1.3.Urinary GL3\n\n【35】4.1.3.UrinaryGL3\n\n【36】Little evidence on urinary GL3 outcomes was identified in this liter- ature search.One publication reported no significant difference from baseline in 15 male hemizygotic patients treated with agalsidase alfa during a follow-up period of up to 16 years \\[59\\]. Regular measurements of urinary GL3 for diagnosis and monitoring are not recommended and further studies are required to investigate the potential use of urinary GL3 in the diagnosis and monitoring of FD.\n\n【37】4.1.4. Urinary lyso-GL3\n\n【38】Twostudiesreportedreductions inurinarylyso-GL3inpatients treated with agalsidase beta, one in a mixed-sex and -phenotype cohort that was switched from agalsidase alfa to agalsidase beta, and the other in male pediatric patients with classic FD \\[23,60\\]. Some evidence identi- fied in this literature review suggests that agalsidase beta may reduce urinary lyso-GL3 in male and female patients with classic and later- onset FD, and that treatment switch may be an effective strategy \\[23,60\\]. Data on the effects of agalsidase alfa or migalastat were not identifiedbythisliteraturesearch.\n\n【39】3dndlySo-GL\n\n【40】Plasma lyso-GL3, and more recently serum and DBS Iyso-GL3, have been established as a diagnostic biomarker in patients with FD and may assist with the stratification of phenotypes associated with FD \\[27,39\\]. Given that lyso-GL3 levels are shown to be reduced in response to ERT, particularly within the first 3 months after initiation and in all patients with a classic phenotype and male patients, they may be useful in monitoring FD treatment effect in these groups of patients \\[27,39\\]. We recommend measuring lyso-GL3 levels at baseline (before treat- ment initiation) then every 6-12 months thereafter to evaluate longitu- dinal changes. However, it is important to note that there is still uncertainty about whether reduction in lyso-GL3 levels correlates with reduced incidence of clinical events, as it may take at least 6 months to observe an improvement in any clinical events in patients with FD and it is not clear if any correlation is specific to modality of therapy \\[46\\]. The use of complementary organ-specific biomarkers is recommended in monitoring patients with FD and there is a need to fur- ther explore how and whether lyso-GL3 correlates with surrogate dis- ease markers such as LVM index, LVH, eGFR, or clinical events such as stroke,orindices of diseaseseverity.\n\n【41】4.2.Heartbiomarkers\n\n【42】Cardiac involvement is the main cause of poor QoL and death in pa- tients with FD \\[2\\]. In males with classic FD, involvement begins early in life, progressing sub-clinically before overt symptoms occur and usually manifesting as LVH mimicking hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), in addition to other multi-systemic symptoms \\[61,62\\]. However, a large number of patients have a later-onset FD phenotype that pre- dominantly affects the heart (particularly with cardiac variant p. Asn215Ser) and manifests mostly as LVH or HCM \\[63-66\\]. Early diagnosis remains essential to maximizing the benefits of disease- specific therapies,including theimprovement of cardiac manifesta- tions. Studies have shown that the benefits of ERT are limited when initiated in patients with advanced disease with considerable LVH or cardiac fibrosis \\[67-69\\]. The use of cardiac biomarkers and imag- ing tools to accurately stage cardiac involvement therefore has importantclinicalimplications\n\n【43】A comprehensive cardiologicalwork-upshouldincludeassessmen with electrocardiogram (ECG) and imaging by both echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) in patients with FD \\[70\\]. Subtle electrocardiographic changes precede LVH and may occur early in life \\[71,72\\], meaning ECG may also be a useful imaging biomarker to assess cardliac involvement before the onset of HCM \\[73\\]. One of the first signs, and sometimes the only sign, of cardiac involvement is shorter PR inter- vals owing to progressive infiltration of GL3 in the heart. As the disease progresses, conduction time may increase, and ECG may show atrioven- tricular block \\[70\\]. In addition to ECG, CMR imaging (CMRi) in conjunction with bio- marker testing may also facilitate the early detection of cardiac involve ment in FD. Recent evidence indicates a correlation between plasma lyso-GL3 and LVH \\[71,74-76\\]. In addition to GL3 accumulation, inflam- mation and immune dysfunction are key secondary mechanisms of car- diac damage in FD \\[77-79\\]. Preliminary findings suggest a correlation\\] between lyso-GL3, inflammatory, and cardiac remodeling biomarkers and disease progression, indicating a potential role for plasma levels of inflammatory biomarkers in the earlier diagnosis of FD and staging of cardiac disease before significant cardiac damage has occurred \\[80\\]\\] CMRi has become central to the early differential diagnosis and staging of cardiac FD, with CMR studies utilizing T1 and T2 mapping to assess myocardial lipid content and inflammation at different disease stages \\[81,82\\]. In the pre-hypertrophic stage of FD low values of T1 correlate with ECG, morphological cardiac changes,and global disease severity as measured by the FAbry STabilization indEX (FASTEX) score\\[74\\]\n\n【44】4.2.1.Troponin,high-sensitivitytroponin-T(hs-cInT),B-typenatriuretic peptide(BNP),and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide(NT- proBNP)\n\n【45】proBNP) Troponin, hs-cTnT, BNP, and NT-proBNP are important for cardiac disease staging in FD \\[83-85\\]. Plasma NT-proBNP is elevated in patients with cardiac manifestations and correlates with symptom class and echocardiographic changes including left atrial size and E/e' (indicating elevated filling pressure) and LVM. Although the highest values are en- countered in patients with LVH, diastolic dysfunction, reduced T1 relax- ation times on CMRi mapping, and myocardial fibrosis, NT-proBNP concentrations may be raised in patients without echocardiographic ev- idence of LVH, suggesting that NT-proBNP may be used to assist in deci- sions on treatment initiation \\[81,83,86\\]. Elevated hs-cTnT indicates advanced disease and a poor prognosis \\[87\\]. The evidence weidentified does not suggest a consistent effect of ERT on hs-cTnT and NT-proBNP in male and female patients with FD, and it is uncertain whether there is any phenotype-specific effect. In one study, 14 patients with normal BNP levels at baseline remained within the same range during treatment with agalsidase alfa, whereas 22 patients with abnormally high BNP levels (≥19.5 pg/mL) had gradu- ally decreasing levels after agalsidase alfa initiation \\[88\\]. Another study demonstrated no change in NT-proBNP levels after 1 year of ERT. This study also reported a significant temporal increase in troponin in male and female patients with FD (phenotype not reported) who had been established on agalsidase alfa or agalsidase beta for 1 year \\[82\\]. Data on the effects of migalastat on these markers were not identified in the literature search. Although troponin, hs-cTnT, BNP, and NT-proBNP are organ-specific biomarkers and therefore can be valuable in the follow-up of organ in- volvement in patients with FD, they are not disease-specific and should not be used to support a diagnosis of FD. Disease-specific biomarkers such as lyso-GL3, which may be elevated in childhood and long before cardiac symptoms manifest, may be useful in predicting a FD diagnosis \\[43,89\\]. The combination of hs-cTnT and BNP may be more useful in de- tecting myocardial fibrosis in patients with HCM. It has been demon- strated that hs-cTnT is a direct marker of ongoing myocardial fibrosis and that BNP is a marker of left ventricular overload partially associated with myocardial fibrosis \\[90,91\\]. It is noteworthy that two publications lidentified elevated trononin in both males and females with ED I82l and\n\n【46】serum vascular endothelialgrowth factor(VEGF)\\[92\\]despite ERT, and one publication did not identify any change in NT-proBNP in newly treated patients or those established on ERT\\[82\\],which suggests that cardiac pathology could progress, or that ERT may have been initiated too late in the disease course to mitigate damage to the heart.\n\n【47】4.2.2.Summary of keyrecommendationsforcardiacbiomarkers Cardiac assessments of patients with FD can assist in the staging of cardiac involvement and can therefore influence treatment and moni- toring decisions. ECG and cardiac imaging tools may assist with the early identification of cardiac involvement in FD \\[70\\], meaning these are important biomarkers to measure in patients with suspected FD. Non-specific cardiac biomarkers of FD can also be used in the diagnosis of patients with FD; however, these are less reliable than other disease- specific biomarkers such as lyso-GL3, which may be elevated in infancy/ childhood before the onset of cardiac involvement \\[89\\]. Therefore, as noted previously, biomarkers should be used in conjunction to support the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring outcomes of patients with FD\n\n【48】4.3.Kidneybiomarkers\n\n【49】Nephropathyis a prominent feature of FD and presents with a wide spectrum of severity in male and female patients.Non-invasive bio- markers of kidney injury are found in urine and blood, and the bio- marker excretion in urine reflects abnormal nephron function secondary to FD. Most of the publications identified in this structured literature review examined the effect of ERT on kidney outcomes, whereas there were relatively few publications reporting studies that assessed the effect of chaperone therapy on kidney outcomes. This may have been due to the treatment choice based on mutations pre- sented by patients in the studies conducted. When interpreting kidney outcomes in patients with FD, it is impor- tant to consider whether adjunctive therapies such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)have been used because these can alter kidney outcomes\n\n【50】4.3.1.Proteinuria and albuminurio\n\n【51】Proteinuria,specificallyalbuminuria,is the currentgold-standard biomarker for Fabry nephropathy. In patients with classic FD, albumin- uria usually emerges in the second or third decade of life \\[1,93\\]. ERT ini- tiation is often delayed until significant albuminuria or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline occurs,a point where the reversibility of kidney damage is more difficult to achieve and prognosis is poorer \\[94\\], highlighting the importance of starting treatment early.Albu- minuria, an important glomerular marker for proteinuria, is a sensi- tive biomarker to identify the early kidney complication ofl glomerular damage in FD, hence assessment of proteinuria levels without considering albuminuria levels could lead to a delayed diag- nosis of Fabry nephropathy. Therefore, it is recommended to closely monitor albuminuria levels \\[95\\]. Evidence on whether there is a consistent effect of agalsidase alfa or agalsidasebetaonalbuminuria and proteinuria ismixed.Similarly,little evidence on the effect of migalastat on albuminuria was identified by thisliterature search, and cautionis therefore warranted when inter- preting the available data in regard to any modality of Fabry-specific treatment. One publication, reporting the effect of agalsidase alfa on proteinuria over 10 years, described stablelevels in male patients (unre- ported phenotype) ≤30 years of age, but significant annual deterioration was observed in male patients above this age \\[96\\]. In this study, 38.4% of patients received at least one ACE inhibitor,so the stable proteinuria levels may be in part due to the use of this adjunctive therapy. An- other publication reported the effect of different doses of ERT on al- buminuria for up to 14 years in 20 patients with classic FD. The lower fixed dose group received agalsidase alfa or agalsidase beta 0.2 mg/kg EoW and the higher dose group received 0.2-1.0 mg/kg EOW.Podocyte GL3 reduction correlated with cumulative agalsidase\n\n【52】dose (r =0.69; P =0.001), but no statistical difference in albumin uria from baseline was observed between the lower and higher dose groups. Of the 20 patients included in the study,12 received a renin- angiotensin-aldosterone system blocker during some or all the follow-up period \\[97\\]. Two studies reported numerical increases of proteinuria levels; one study was in male and female patients (mixed phenotype) treated with either of the ERT preparations com- pared with migalastat \\[98\\], while the other study showed protein- uria levels were increased in male patients, correlated with reduced eGFR, but independent of receiving ERT \\[99,100\\]. One study reported a significant correlation between agalsidase beta and urinary excretion of urokinase-type plasminogen activator re- ceptor in podocytes and urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) \\[101\\]. One study on migalastat suggested greater increases in 24-h urinary protein levels in male patients with classic versus later- onset FD and compared with all female patients \\[100\\]. Evidence identified in this literature search suggests that ERT may have a beneficial effect on kidney function in terms of reduced albumin- uria. However, as mentioned above, it is important to consider the effect of adjunctive therapies on kidney outcomes. A phase 3b trial identified a non-significant reduction in mean urine albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) (mean change from baseline: —1.0 mg/g; P = 0.0761) in pediatric male patients with classic FD who were treated with agalsidase beta without the use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs, where no significant glomerulosclerosis was observed in kidney biopsies after 5 years \\[23\\]. Another study reported a direct correlation between urinary miR-21, belonging to the family of microRNAs, and degree of albuminuria in pa- tients treated with ERT, suggesting both biomarkers are associated with kidney fibrosis and should be analyzed in a greater number of patients showing signs of pathological albuminuria. Although this publication did not report patient sex or FD phenotype, it did mention that the ap- pearance of urinary microRNAs is a typical clinical manifestation of pa- tients with classic FD \\[102\\]. Evidence identified in this study did not suggest that migalastat affected albuminuria levels in male or female patients with FD, although a phenotype-specific effect cannot be ex- cluded because FD phenotypes were not reported \\[103\\]. Although proteinuria is frequently used as a kidney biomarker of FD, it has a relatively low sensitivity for the identification of early-stage nephropathy compared with low range albuminuria (ACR in microalbuminuria levels) and is limited as a predictor of kidney disease in female patients \\[21,104-106\\]. Therefore, the identification and vali- dation of other markers of kidney impairment are important. One study compared albuminuria with other urinary biomarkers of glomer- ular and tubular dysfunction for the identification of early FD nephrop- athy. There was a significant increase in all biomarkers, even in the subgroup of patients with no evidence of nephropathy,overcoming the limitations of albuminuria as a sensitive marker of early kidney dysfunction\\[94,107\\]\n\n【53】4.3.2.Glomerularfiltrationrate\n\n【54】GFR, a marker of loss of kidney function due to advanced kidney in- jury\\[25\\],is one of the most important determinants of clinical outcome in patients with FD. The natural history of Fabry nephropathy in un- treated patients varies substantially, with male sex, increased baseline proteinuria and reduced GFR all associated with more rapid decline in GFR. In patients with later-onset FD, or female patients with FD, GFR de- cline is generally slower and less predictable \\[108,109\\]. The gold-standard evaluation for GFR assessment is measurement by injection of an external marker (e.g., inulin, iohexol, chromEDTA, or iothalamate) followed by multiple blood samples, a procedure that is time consuming. Estimation of GFR by eGFR formulas based on serum creatinine and/or cystatin-C provides a more practical assessment of GFR in clinical practice. Creatinine is the parameter most used to evalu- ate for GFR estimation,but has limitations,including dependence on pa tient muscle mass. Cystatin-C is less subject to bias but is not available in all centers in part due to its higher cost \\[110-112\\]. Serum levels of\n\n【55】cystatin-C have been shown to be more sensitive than serum creatinine in detecting early kidney dysfunction and small reductions in GFR in both male and female patients \\[112\\], especially important in patients where muscle mass may vary due to different reasons such as pain inFD Consistent with previously published evidence, findings identified by this literature review show that ERT reduces the rate of decline in eGFR but the extent of the reduction can vary \\[19,25,39,51,96,98,100,113116\\]. Most studies reporting an effect of ERT on eGFR were conducted in patients with classic FD,most of whom were male. Two studies found that eGFR decline was exacer- bated in patients who had been switched from agalsidase beta to agalsidase alfa \\[25,51\\]. However, eGFR decline was attenuated in pa- tients who had been switched from agalsidase alfa to agalsidase beta compared with those who had been switched from agalsidase alfa to agalsidase beta and then re-switched to agalsidase alfa \\[51\\]. This finding Suggests that the extent of attenuated eGFR decline may be dose- and regimen-dependent. In another two studies \\[55,96\\], eGFR was quanti- fied by using the Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation on the basis of serum creatinine (eGFRcreat), cystatin-C levels (eGFRcys), and a combination of creatinine and cystatin-C (eGFRcreat-cys). Findings from one of these studies sug- gested that agalsidase alfa slowed the rate of eGFR in male patients <30 years of age but not above this age \\[96\\]. The other study demon- strated a loss of eGFR in ERT-naive females with FD after 12 months (112.3 vs 94.6 mL/min/1.73 m² for eGFRcys values at baseline and follow-up, respectively, and 92.2 vs 84.1 mL/min/1.73 m2 for eGFRcreat values at baseline and follow-up, respectively) but not in ERT-naive males. Out of 62 patients, only 5 (8%) patients presented with a mild (n = 2 \\[1 female\\]), or later-onset (n = 3 \\[1 female\\]) phenotype. The baseline characteristics were not different between ERT-naive patients and those treated with ERT \\[55\\]. In the Lenders et al., study, it is likely that patients with an unstable FASTEX score had a significant loss of kidney function\\[55\\]. Evidence identified by this literature review indicates comparable effectiveness of migalastat to ERT, in the patients with amenable muta- tions \\[98,116\\]. In one study of 14 patients, increase in enzymatic activity associated with reduced lyso-GL3levels correlated with improvements in myocardial mass but not renal function \\[39\\]. Results from a recent post hoc analysis of 97 treatment-naive and ERT-experienced patients with migalastat amenable GLA variants found no significant correlation between lyso-GL3 and eGFR in the overall patient group or subgroups stratified by prior ERT treatment status and sex \\[117\\]. As mentioned earlier, animportant consideration when interpretingkidney outcomes in patients with FD is the use of adjunctive therapies such as ACE inhib- itors and ARBs. These drugs can alter kidney outcomes and interpreta- tion of eGFR because there may be a functional decrease of eGFR (as a result of reduced intraglomerular pressure due to vasodilation of the vas efferens),rather than structural damage to the kidney,and therefore therapeutic goals should be individualized.\n\n【56】4.3.3.Podocyturid\n\n【57】Kidney biopsies of children and adolescentswithFDwho had not been treated with ERT showed severe accumulation of granular lesions in podocytes, confirming that depositions of GL3 start in early child- hood, long before overt clinical kidney disease \\[118\\]. Podocytes, which are a major target cell in Fabry nephropathy, accumulate α-Gal sub- strates, with morphological and functional alterations that may occur before the clinical evidence of proteinuria \\[104,105,119,120\\]. One study reported a significant positive correlation between agalsidase beta treatment and urinary excretion of urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor in podocytes and UPCR in male and female patients although FD phenotype was not specified \\[101\\]. Urinary loss of podocytes or podocyturia correlates with glomerular injury. It has been shown that podocyturia is inversely related to GFR in male patients and correlated with clinical severity in FD nephropathy.\n\n【58】suggesting it could be a diagnostic tool and supporting its potentia prognostic value in male patients with classic FD \\[104,105\\]. Despite podocyturia showing promise as an early indicator of kidney injury and use in diagnostic testing to assess kidney involvement, it is not gen- erally assessed in routine clinical practice because the methods used to assess it are not yet standardized or widely available \\[110\\]. Longitudinal studies to further explore the effect of ERT or chaperone therapy on podocyturia, and other novel biomarkers of Fabry nephropathy, are warranted.\n\n【59】4.3.4.Summaryofkeyrecommendationsforkidneybiomarkers Proteinuria, and specifically albuminuria, are biomarkers to support the diagnosis and assessment of patients with FD nephropathy \\[1,93\\]\\] Albuminuria is an important glomerular marker and a sensitive bio- marker toidentify the early kidney complication of glomerular damage in FD. GFR, a marker of advanced kidney injury, is useful in assessing treatment response and clinical outcomes in patients with FD \\[25\\]. ERT reduces the rate of decline in GFR,but the extent of the reduction varies among studies. Use of cystatin-C might improve measurement of kidney outcomes in patients with FD by providing a muscle-mass- independent criterion for early-stage FD nephropathy and guiding timely initiation of disease-specific treatment. Podocyturia could poten- tially support the diagnosis of FD and guide treatment strategies \\[104\\], and kidney biopsies may be helpful in clarifying the extent of GL3 accumulation and tissue damage,as well as supporting differential diagnoses\\[118\\]\n\n【60】4.4.Mark\n\n【61】Therapeutic proteins have the potential to induce an immunogenic response and generate anti-drug antibodies (ADAs), especially when administered as multiple doses over prolonged periods \\[121,122\\] ERTs contain α-Gal A proteins that are administered via intravenous in- fusion.More often in male patients than in female patients,therapeutic proteins may be recognized as foreign to the body and consequently can cause infusion-associated reactions (IARs) and the formation of ADAs \\[123\\]. IARs such as fever, chills, and chest pain, as well as the more clas- sic immunological reactions such as edema, dyspnea, rash, itching, and, rarely, anaphylactic shock \\[124-127\\], can occur in patients with anti- bodies to ERT. There are few reports of immunoglobulin E (IgE) in pa- tients treated with ERT, suggesting that IARs are IgE-independent and somostlyresult from anaphylactoid reactions as opposed to anaphylac- tic reactions. Patients with ADAs against agalsidase are at a higher risk of IARs. Antibody status should be regularly monitored, particularly in males with a classic phenotype because the development of ADAs oc- curs almost exclusively in these patients \\[113\\]. ADAs can be neutralizing or non-neutralizing immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies and may im- pact on the overall clinical efficacy/effectiveness of ERT preparations, as they can inhibit α-Gal A activity, inhibit enzyme uptake into cells, have a negative impact on the pharmacokinetics of the exogenously ad- ministered enzyme,and limit the biochemical response to ERT \\[123,128-130\\]. The majority of studies identified in this literature search reported that ADAs to ERT were detected in male patients with a classic FD phe- notype \\[9,88,103,115,131133\\]. Overall,reports of increased ADA titers and consequent reductions in enzyme activity or plasma lyso-GL3 clear- ance have been described with both agalsidase alfa and agalsidase beta \\[9,12,88,103,115,129,131-133\\]. A negative correlation between in- creasing ADA titer against ERT and plasma lyso-GL3 clearance was dem- onstrated \\[113\\]. ADA development may also be ERT dose- and/or preparation-dependent \\[114\\], as one study identified an increase in se- roconversion time associated with 1.0 mg/kg EOW versus 0.2 mg/kg EOW (unlicensed dose) of agalsidase beta \\[23\\], and another found an in- creased risk of ADA development associated with agalsidase beta com- pared with agalsidase alfa \\[12\\]. One study of 26 males with classic FD demonstrated a reduction in agalsidase alfa and agalsidase beta ADA\n\n【62】titer with high doses of immunosuppressive therapy due to kidney (n = 24) or heart (n = 2) transplantation \\[134\\]. Evidence also indicated sta- tistically higher plasma lyso-GL3 in ADA-positive patients compared with ADA-negative patients \\[131\\], as well as attenuation of plasma lyso-GL3 response in ADA-positive patients \\[9,12,123\\]. In agreement with earlier publications \\[13\\], evidence identified by this literature review suggests an association between impaired plasma lyso-GL3 clearance and ADA-positive status \\[12,26,113,131,132\\]. Al- though lyso-GL3 reduction does not guarantee a clinical response in all affected organs, absence of a lyso-GL3 response after treatment initi- ation may suggest a loss of therapeutic effectiveness. In the presence of ADAs against agalsidase alfa or agalsidase beta in male patients with classic FD, therapeutic non-saturation of ADAs was associated with a marked decrease in eGFR compared with those with saturation of ADAs \\[113\\]. In another study of 26 males with classic FD receiving ERT for a median of 94 months, a non-saturated ADA status during infusion was associated with progressive decrease in eGFR and ongoing cardiac hypertrophy. Dose escalation resulted in ADA satura- tion and reduced lyso-GL3 levels \\[114\\]. Increasing the dose of agalsidase alfa or agalsidase beta in male pa- tients with classic FD with established inhibitory ADAs to saturate the ADAs has been shown to significantly reduce plasma lyso-GL3 levels \\[114\\]. Consistent with studies that pre-date the period covered,evi- dence identified by this literature review also suggests that switching from agalsidase alfa to agalsidase beta in ADA-positive patients may in- Crease ADA titers but may also be associated with a reduction in plasma lys0-GL3 \\[25,135,136\\]. Some studies have also highlighted the possible benefit of immuno- modulatory therapy in response to ADA formation, as immunosuppres- sion has been shown to reduce ADAs significantly in patients who are receiving or have received ERT \\[103,121,134\\]. Routine antibody screen- ing may inform treatment switching decisions. For example, if anti- bodies develop to either agalsidase alfa or agalsidase beta, a switch to migalastat could be an option in patients with amenable mutations, al- though this is currently not part of routine clinical practice.Additional evidence and consensus are needed to develop strategies relating to treatment switch, dose modification, and the potential use of immuno- modulatorytherapy.\n\n【63】4.4.1.Summary of keyrecommendationsformarkers ofimmunogenicity andseroconversion\n\n【64】andseroconversion Patients with FD, mostly males with a classic phenotype,receiving ERT may experience the formation of ADAs \\[113\\]. The findings identi- fied in the literature review suggest that the presence of ADAs is associ- ated with higher levels of lyso-GL3 and a decline in eGFR. Therefore, the potential loss of therapeutic effectiveness that is observed warrants rou- tine measurement of ADAs in patients with FD, to guide treatment adjustment.\n\n【65】Inervoussystemimagingmarke\n\n【66】Clinical manifestations of FD often involve the CNS and can result in cognitive and psychiatric manifestations \\[137\\]. Cerebrovascular disease is prevalent in patients with FD and has a severe impact on patient QoL because it is highly debilitating, due to acute events such as stroke, and chronic impairment such as small vessel disease (SVD). Common brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings associ- ated with FD include white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and cere- bral microbleeds (CMBs), which suggest the presence of cerebral SVD, and the pulvinar sign \\[138,139\\]. Individually, these neuroradiological markers lack sensitivity (the pulvinar sign) or specificity (WMH and CMBs). MRI-visible perivascular spaces (PVS) may be a marker of SVD that might be relevant for the diagnosis and understanding of the mech- anism of white matter injury in FD. The study by Lyndon et al. found that when comparing MRI findings from patients with confirmed FD against\n\n【67】healthy controls, and after adjustment for age and sex, FD was asso ated with more severe basal ganglia PVS, significantly higher WMH vol ume, more CMBs, and a higher prevalence of lacunes \\[140\\]. These findings were consistent with other studies confirming the association of SVD markers with FD \\[141,142\\], and in keeping with the functional relevance of PVS, given that cognitive impairment is common in FD \\[143,144\\]. In addition, another lysosomal storage disease, mucopolysaccharidosis,has also been associated with PVS enlargement \\[145\\]. Given that enlarged PVS occurs early in the course of SVD, before the burden of WMH increases, PVS may be an early indicator of FD cerebrovasculopathy\\[140,146\\] Dolichoectasia of the basilar artery is an early finding in patients with FD and thus identification of dolichoectasic basilar arteries can be an early neuroradiological marker in patients with FD \\[147\\]. A study of the effect of ERT on basilar artery diameter in 30 male patients with FD with a mean duration of 7.2 ± 4.6 years until follow-up, using MRI, found a significant correlation between the duration of ERT and basilar artery diameter. This finding suggests that basilar artery diameter could be a potential surrogate marker of therapeutic efficacy of ERT. This was the only study identified in this literature review demonstrating the effect of ERT on basilar artery diameter; therefore, further studies are required to confirm thesefindings \\[148\\]\n\n【68】4.5.1.Summaryofkeyrecommendationsforcentralnervoussystem biomarkers Brain MRI can be performed in patients with suspected FD to poten- tially assist in the diagnosis of patients because findings such as WMH and CMBs may indicate signs of FD \\[138\\]. As the prevalence of the pulvinar sign is around 24% and is higher among males than females, its diagnostic value is limited \\[139\\]. Dolichoectasia of the basilar artery can also indicate FD, and therefore its identification can be an early neu- roradiological marker in patients with FD \\[147\\]. Basilar artery diameter could alsobe a usefulsurrogate marker of therapeutic efficacy/effective- ness of ERT, as a finding from one study observed a correlation between duration of ERT and basilar artery diameter \\[148\\]; however, further investigation of this CNS marker is required to draw conclusive results.\n\n【69】5.Strengths andlimitations\n\n【70】The publications identified in this literature review largely reflect outcomes in male patients with classic FD, so the biomarkers in these studies are primarily for that patient population. This especially high- lights the need for further research into outcomes in female patients and those with later-onset disease. Many publications described out- comes for a mix of patients including male and female patients with classic disease, later-onset disease, or VUS, or did not specify whether patients had classic or later-onset disease.Therefore, the inclusion of pa- tients with later-onset phenotypes in clinical studies looking at out- comes related to organs that are not affected in such patients could be a source of error.Furthermore, the analysis did not stratify the kidney or cardiac outcomes according to concomitant medications,which may be relevant considering the effect of medications such as ACE inhib- itors and/or ARBs used to treat kidney and cardiac disease on the pro- gression of FD nephropathy and FD cardiomyopathy. Data on CNS biomarkers are still limited, with the most important findings based onMRI.\n\n【71】6.PotentialfuturebiomarkersinFabrydisease\n\n【72】The challenge for the majority of potential biomarkers and why they are not all translatable to routine clinical practice is that the biomarker must have demonstrated technical, preclinical, and clinical validity, clin- ical utility must be clearly demonstrated, and biomarker measurement must have an impact on clinical management \\[149\\]. In addition, the search for new biomarkers and deeper understanding of FD may also\n\n【73】belimited byhypotheses-drivenexploration ofbiological pathways that are already known to be associated with the disease.New biological sig- natures may enhance screening and diagnostic capability. In the post- genomic era, advances in omics technologies have generated abundant information that has advanced our understanding of complex inherited metabolic diseases. An omics approach also has the potential to over- come the limitations and potential biases of a hypothesis-driven bio- marker search strategy \\[150\\]. A recent proteomics study that aimed to identify proteomic-based patternsthat could distinguish between pa- tients with FD, Pompe, Niemann-Pick type C, and Gaucher diseases, and healthy controls identified four discriminant proteins: fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), VEGFA, VEGFC, and interleukin 7 (IL-7). How- ever, no correlation was observed between these four proteins and lyso-GL3. In addition, a significant correlation between IL-7 and residual enzyme activity in a later-onset phenotype was identified, highlighting the multi-dimensional information an omics-based approach offers that may help in stratifying patients with FD with greater accuracy for im- proved clinical management \\[150\\]. Another avenue of exploration is the use of imaging data. This is a new biomarkers frontier and quantita- tive data extraction from imaging analysis remains a major challenge \\[17\\]. Development of novel imaging techniques, such as artificial intelli- gence (Al)-ECG, may provide solutions. Advancements in machine learning and computation methods have led to the clinical application of Al, which has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and effi- ciency by providing fully automated, unbiased, and unambiguous ECG analysis \\[151\\].\n\n【74】7.Conclusions\n\n【75】The gold standard of FD diagnosis is the assessment of α-Gal A activ- ity (for males) and confirmatory genetic analysis but identification of the broad range of variants is challenging. Disease-specific biomarkers such as lyso-GL3 may be valuable additions to current FD diagnostic procedures and aid in objective monitoring of pharmacodynamic re- sponse in patients with classic FD. Lyso-GL3 has been shown to decline in response to ERT but there is not a clear correlation between the change in lyso-GL3 levels with a reduction in clinical events.In addition, lyso-GL3 only partially correlates with response to chaperone therapy. Furthermore, the value of lyso-GL3 as a biomarker in patients with a later-onset FD phenotype is still not well understood, nor do we have sufficient data on changes in lyso-GL3 levels as patients age. Non- disease-specific biomarkers are of value in assessing organ involvement but should be used in conjunction with disease-specific biomarkers to support their use in monitoring response to treatment.In addition, as- sessment of ADAs and imaging studies, including CMR T1 mapping. may bevaluable tools tomonitor therapeuticresponse and disease pro- gression in patients with FD, but their widespread application is ham- pered by limited availability across all countries. The future of biomarker discovery in FD may lie in the exploration of biological path- ways that have not been considered, such as the FGF2 signaling and in- flammatory cytokine signaling pathways\\[150\\]. In conjunction with biomarkers that are already being studied in FD, the identification of novel molecular signatures may enhance our understanding of the com- plex underlying pathophysiology,thereby providing opportunities fon therapeuticinnovation.\n\n【76】Funding\n\n【77】Funding support of the advisory board that resulted in this publica- ionwasprovidedbySanofi\n\n【78】Data availability\n\n【79】Data will be made available on request\n\n【80】Acknowledgements\n\n【81】The authors thank Marco Rago and Ana Crespo, from Sanofi, who supported the development of this manuscript.The authors would also like to acknowledge the contributions of Kiran Cheema,Colin Glen, and Alex Goonesinghe, from Lucid Group Ltd.,United Kingdom, for their medical writing and editorial support, funded by Sanofi, US, for the de- velopment of thismanuscript underthe directionof all authors\n\n【82】AppendixA.Supplementarydata\n\n【83】upplementary data tothis articlecanbefound online athttps 10.1016/j.ymgme.2023.107585\n\n【84】Reference", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_guidelines/指南数据/【2023】全科室指南+解读+共识（最新版）/儿科/2023 专家共识建议：生物标志物在法布里病中的应用.pdf", "converted_result_oss_path": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/infocr_results/medical_guidelines_20240422/453"}, "ext": null, "dataset": "guidelines_liangyong", "batch_name": "20240424", "version": "version0"}

Consequently, the Palliative Care Study Group of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) formed a Subgroup to develop evidence-based guidance on the use CAN in patients with advanced cancer. 科研公工 Methods This guidance was developed in accordance with the MASCC Guidelines Policy. A search strategy for Medline was developed, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were explored for relevant reviews/trials respectively. The outcomes of the review were categorised by the level of evidence, and a “\"category of guideline” based on the level of evidence (i.e. “\"recommendation\",“\"suggestion\", or “\"no guideline possible\")) Results The Subgroup produced 11 suggestions, and 1 recommendation (due to the paucity of evidence). These outcomes relate to assessment of patients, indications for CAN, contraindications for CAN, procedures for initiating CAN, and re- assessmentofpatients. Conclusions This guidance provides a framework for the use of CAN in advanced cancer, although every patient needs individualisedmanagement. 小狗 科 C H Keywords Clinicll asted urition Neoplas Paliaiv are Pratie gideline Advaned ancer - 开公\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】The decision to initiate (or withdraw) clinically assisted nutrition (CAN) in patients with advanced cancer is a com- mon clinical scenario. In some cases,the decision appears relatively straightforward, whilst in many cases, the decision depends on a subjective assessment of the potential benefits versus the potential risks. Research suggests that, especially at the end of life, the use of CAN varies enormously (3-53%) \\[1\\], and that patients and their families often have very posi- tive views about CAN, whilst healthcare professionals often have disparate views about CAN \\[2-4\\]. On the basis of the above, the Palliative Care Study Group of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Can- cer (MASCC) formed a Subgroup to develop evidence-based guidance on the use of CAN in patients with advanced can- cer. This paper gives an overview of CAN in patients with advanced cancer, the methodology involved in developing\n\n【6】the outcomes, and the evidence to support the outcomes (and the grading of the evidence). At the time the Subgroup started the project, there were no up-to-date guidelines on the use of CAN in patients with advanced cancer, although there are older guidelines relating to this cohort of patients \\[5, 6\\], and there are newer guide- lines relating to cancer patients in general (which address this cohort of patients to a minor extent) \\[7,8\\]. Our guidance complements the latter guidelines, and is aimed at the core multidisciplinary team involved in the care of patients with advancedcancer\n\n【7】Background\n\n【8】Definitions\n\n【9】For the purposes of this guidance, CAN refers to all forms of tube-feeding (e.g. via nasogastric tube, percutaneous endo- scopic gastrostomy (PEG), or parenteral nutrition (PN). It does not cover oral feeding, by cup, spoon, or any other method of delivering food or nutritional supplements into a patient's mouth \\[9\\]. Synonymous terms within the medical literature include “medically-assisted nutrition” \\[10\\], “arti- ficial nutrition\" \\[5\\],\"“artificial feeding” \\[11\\], and \\*\"hyperali- mentation\" (specifically for parenteral nutrition) \\[12\\]. The term“medical nutrition therapy” includes the use of oral nutritional supplements as well as “tube feeding\" \\[13\\]. Other definitions used in this guidance include “advanced cancer\" (i.e. “cancer that is unlikely to be cured or controlled with treatment. The cancer may have spread from where it first started, to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or distant parts of the body. Treatment may be given to help shrink the tumour, slow the growth of cancer cells,or relieve symptoms\")\\[14\\], \"end-of-life” (i.e. the last year of life) \\[15\\], and “\"terminal phase”(i.e. the last days to weeks of life) \\[16\\]. It should be noted that patients with advanced cancer may not be at the end-of-life (as defined), and that prognostication remains exceptionally challenging (especially when the prognosis is of the order of months to years rather than days to weeks) \\[17\\]. Thus, the trajectory of the illness may change (i.e. accelerate or decelerate), and/or acute events may intervene (i.e. cancer-related or separate condition).\n\n【10】Nutritionalrequirements\n\n【11】The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence/ NICE (United Kingdom) recommend a“total intake”for all adults that includes \\[18\\] (a) 25-35 kcal/kg/day total energy; (b) 0.8-1.5 g protein (0.13-0.24 g nitrogen)/kg/day; (c) 30-35 ml fluid/kg (allowing for excessive losses, and other sources of fuids); and (d) adequate electrolytes, minerals, micronutrients, and fibre. Other guidelines recommend\n\n【12】similar amounts of nutrients for cancer patients \\[7, 19 Fig.1.\n\n【13】Malnutrition\n\n【14】Malnutrition(also known as undernutrition)has been defined as \"a state resulting from lack of intake or uptake of nutrition that leads to altered body composition (decreased fat free mass) and body cell mass leading to diminished physical and mental function and impaired clinical outcome from disease\" \\[13\\]. Malnutrition can result from starvation, disease (gastrointestinal disease, acute injury, acute systemic disease with inflammation, chronic systemic disease with/ without infammation), normal ageing, or a combination of these factors \\[13, 20\\]. Consensus diagnostic criteria for malnutrition include the presence of one so-called pheno- typic criterion (i.e. weight loss, reduced body mass index. reduced muscle mass),and one so-called etiologic criterion (i.e. reduced food intake or assimilation, disease burden/ inflammation) \\[20\\]. Malnutrition remains a major cause of mortality world- wide,andit has been estimated that malnutritionis the direct cause of death in 10-20% cancer patients \\[21\\]. Data on the Irish Republican Army (IRA) hunger strikers suggests that on average, an otherwise healthy young adult male can sur- vive for 61 days without food \\[22\\]: the minimum recorded survival was 46 days, whilst the maximum recorded survival was 73 days \\[23\\]. However, survival would be expected to be “considerably reduced” in patients with an underlying malignancy \\[24\\]. Importantly, malnutrition also results in significant morbidity. Every system within the body is affected, resulting in physical (e.g. muscle weakness), cog- nitive (e.g. impaired memory), and psychological problems (e.g. depression), with associated impact on quality of life and the ability to undertake activities of daily living \\[24. 25\\]. ? 小\n\n【15】Nutritional problemsincancerpatients\n\n【16】Anorexia\n\n【17】Anorexia(loss ofappetite)isa commonsymptominpatients with advanced cancer(30-92%)\\[26,27\\], and is especially prevalent in patients at the end-of-life and in the terminall phase. Anorexia often leads to weight loss, although this is not an inevitable consequence. Anorexia may be related to a number of potentially reversible factors (e.g. “\"nutrition impact symptoms\"—— see below), and may be amenable to specific interventions (e.g. corticosteroids, progestogens) \\[28\\], as well as use of supportive measures (i.e. dietary advice, use of oral nutritional supplements). CAN should never be initiated solely on the basis of the development of anorexia(causingreduced oralintake). 狗科工\n\n【18】measures (i.e.dietary advice,use of oral nutritional supple- ments). CAN should never be initiated solely on the basis of the development ofweight loss. Nutritionimpactsymptoms 开保 Q Nutrition impact symptoms (NIS) are a range of symptoms/ problems that interfere with the patient's appetite, their ability to ingest food, or their ability to digest food \\[29\\]. Examples of NIS include dry mouth, taste disturbance, oral discomfort, dental/denture problems, difficulty swallowing, 斗研\n\n【19】nausea, vomiting, early satiety, constipation, and certain sys- temic symptoms/problems (e.g. fatigue, low mood). NIS form part of certain assessment tools (e.g. Patient- Generated Subjective Global Assessment / PG-SGA) \\[30\\], and specific a checklist has been developed for patients with advanced cancer \\[29\\]. However, none of these tools include a complete list of NIS, and most cancer-related/cancer treat- ment-related symptoms have the potential to interfere with patient nutrition (either directly,orindirectly)\n\n【20】Malnutrition\n\n【21】Malnutrition is common in patients with cancer (20-70%), with the prevalence dependent on the cancer type, the cancer stage, and the age of the patient \\[21\\]. Thus, malnutrition is more common in patients with head and neck, lung, and gas trointestinal cancers: malnutrition is also more common in patients with advanced disease (cf.early cancer),and more common in older patients (cf. younger patients) \\[21\\].\n\n【22】Cancercachexia\n\n【23】Cancer cachexia is a distinct type of disease-associated mal- nutrition \\[13\\], which is common in patients with advanced cancer(~50%)\\[28\\].It is the result of a variable combina- tion of reduced food intake and abnormal metabolism\\[31\\] The metabolic alterations are highly complex (and not com- pletely understood), but prominent features include systemic inflammation, and increased catabolism (or decreased anab- olism) \\[32\\]. Importantly, for the reasons outlined, medical nutritional therapies(includingCAN)per se are ineffective in managing cancer cachexia\\[28\\]. T公开 International consensus diagnostic criteria for can- cer cachexia are (a) weight loss>5% over 6 months (in absence of simple starvation); or (b)Body Mass Index (BMI)<20 and any degree of weight loss>2%; or (c) appendicular skeletal muscle index consistent with sarco- penia (males <7.26 kg/m²; females <5.45 kg/m²) and any degree of weight loss >2% \\[31\\]. Of note, the wasting process in cancer cachexia is somewhat different from the wasting process in simple starvation: in the former, the predominant factoris skeletal muscle loss (with or without loss of adipose\n\n【24】tissue),whilst in the latter,the predominant factor is loss of adipose tissue (with preservation of skeletal muscle).\n\n【25】Nutritionaltherapies\n\n【26】Nutritional therapies include oral nutritional supplements, enteral tube feeding (also known as enteral nutrition), and parenteral nutrition \\[13\\]. Enteral tube feeding involves the delivery of nutrients via a tube (e.g. nasogastric/NG; naso- jejunal/NJ), or via a stoma (e.g. percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy/PEG; percutaneous jejunostomy/PEJ). Enteral tube feeding may be total (TEN), or supplemental to oral intake of food.Parenteral nutrition (PN)involves delivery of nutrients through a peripheralvenous line or a central venous line.Parenteral nutrition may also be total (TPN), or supplemental to oral intake of food (SPN). CAN is considered a medical treatment, and recent European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabo- lism (ESPEN) guidelines highlight the ethical principles regarding the provision/omission of CAN(Table 1）\\[8\\]. This guideline is based on universal ethical principles (i.e. autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, justice), but read- ers are encouraged to check their own national guidance on the provision/omission of CAN/medical treatments.\n\n【27】Methods\n\n【28】The aim of the Subgroup was to develop comprehensive, clinically relevant, evidence-based guidance on the provi- sion of CAN in patients with advanced cancer. Thus, it was agreed that the guidance could include ones supported by \"high\" levels of evidence (e.g. systematic reviews), as well as ones supported by “\"low” levels of evidence (e.g. expert opinion), if the topic were deemed to be clinically relevant. The guidance was developed in accordance with the MASCC Guidelines Policy \\[33\\]. The Subgroup adopted the National Cancer Institute (NCI) definition of advanced cancer (see above) \\[14\\], and data was included from studies) involving cancer patients still receiving anti-cancer treat- ment, and also cancer patients only receiving palliative care (orbothmodalities).\n\n【29】A search strategy for Medline was developed (Appendix 1), and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CEN- TRAL) were explored for relevant reviews/trials respec- tively \\[34, 35\\]. The review of the published literature was restricted to papers written in English, and to papers relating to adult (≥ 19 years) humans. All abstracts identified by the search of Medline (1946 to 10th July 2020) were downloaded into a reference manage- ment software package. These abstracts were independently assessed for relevance by the two main authors (BA,AD), and if one author deemed the abstract relevant, then the full text of the article was obtained. These articles were inde- pendently assessed for inclusion by the two main authors. All of the authors were involved in assessing the randomised controlled trials in the CENTRAL, and the two main authors were involved in assessing the systematic reviews in the CochraneDatabase of SystematicReviews. Whenever possible, the guidance was based on data from patients with advanced cancer. However, when no data was available, or only poor-quality data was available, then data from other populations was extrapolated (if deemed appro- priate). The outcomes of the review were characterised by a level of evidence (i.e. I, I1, II, IV, or V), and a “category off guideline” based on the level of evidence (i.e.“recommenda- tion\", “suggestion\", or “\"no guideline possible\") (Appendix 2) \\[33\\]. The outcomes were independently characterised by the two main authors (BA, AD), and a consensus reached in the case of any disagreement. All of the authors agreed with the outcomes/characterisations of outcomes.\n\n【30】Results\n\n【31】The searches were last undertaken on13thJuly 2020.The Medline search identified 1513 references, and 110 full text articles were retrieved(and reviewed).The search of the Cochrane CentralRegister of Controlled Trials(29th July 2020) identified 1368 references, and 11 more full-text articles were formally examined.Similarly,the search of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (29th July 2020) identified 39 references, and 4 reviews were formally examined. Reference lists of the retrieved articles/reviews were also checked for additional sources of information (not identified in the original searches). 小实 The Subgroup were only able to formulate 11 suggestions, and1 recommendation(due to the paucity of evidence).\n\n【32】Outcomes of review\n\n【33】The suggestions/recommendation of theSubgroup are sum- marised in Table 2 (with the levels of evidence, and the categories of guideline).\n\n| 1- All patients with advanced cancer should have regular nutritional assessments \\[Level of evidence -V-category of guideline - suggestion\\].  |\n| --- |\n| 2- Patients with nutritional problems should be reviewed by a specialist dietitian (with / without other members of the nutrition support team)\\[Level of evidence - V- category of guideline - suggestion\\].  |\n| 3- Any decision to initiate clinically assisted nutrition should be made by an appropriately constituted multidisciplinary/leaifeare team togetherwith the patient and their family \\[Level of evidence - V- category of guideline - suggestion\\].  |\n| 4- Clipielly assisted nutrition should be considered in patients with an inability (reversible / irreversible) to ingest sufficient nutrients \\[they's\\]-evidence.V-category of guideline - suggestion\\].  |\n| Oi-Clipielly assisted nutrition should be considered in patients with an inability (reversible / irreversible) to absorb sufficient nutrients \\[Level of  |\n| evidence-V-category of guideline - suggestion\\].  |\n| evidence - V-category of guideline-/..  |\n\n【35】Springer\n\n【36】decreased albumin),and patients with a poor per- formance status (i.e.Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status≥3) are less likely to derive benefit from CAN \\[7\\]. However, the decision remains somewhatsubjectiveduetothelimited evidencein this cohort of patients \\[10, 36\\], and the diffculty/complex- ity of prognostication in this cohort of patients \\[17\\]. The “stable” Cochrane systematic review of medi- cally assisted nutrition for adult palliative care patients (i.e.“patients receiving palliative care\") \\[10\\] identified four prospective uncontrolled studies involving cancer patients \\[37-40\\], but no randomised controlled trials. The authors of this systematic review concluded that \\*\"There are insufficient good-quality studies to make any recommendations for practice with regards to the use of medically assisted nutrition in palliative care patients\" \\[10\\]. It should be noted that this systematic review included studies involving patients with cancer and patients with other life limiting conditions. A recent systematic review of parenteral nutrition in patients with advanced cancer (i.e. \"not curable but might respond to cancer treatment or disease-directed therapy to prolong life and reduce symptoms\")\\[36\\] identified two randomised controlled trials \\[41,42\\], five prospective uncontrolled studies \\[43-47\\], and one retrospective uncontrolled study \\[48\\]. The authors of this systematic review concluded that “Current PN treatment in patients with advanced cancer is under- studied and the level of evidence is weak”\\[36\\]: the authors further concluded that “Regardless of anti- neoplastic treatment and GI function, nutritional sta- tus seems to be improved by current PN treatment in malnourished patients. No benefit on survival of PN in terminal patients or patients able to feed enterally were reported. The frequency of adverse effects was low; however, a lack of systematic reporting was obseryed\".\n\n【37】All patients receiving CAN should be regularly reas sessed with regard to the continuation, amendment, or dis- continuationoftherelevanttreatment\\[8\\].Theobjectives\n\n【38】Conclusion\n\n【39】Declarations\n\n【40】Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attri- bution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adapta- tion, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.
