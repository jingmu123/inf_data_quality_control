For young patients, multidisciplinary treatment and limb salvage are recommended, and surgical plans considering the growth potential and bone activity after tumor resection are essential.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】An 11-year-old Asian boy had a 1-mo history of a right-sided limping gait. Imaging revealed a proximal tumor with bone destruction and physeal involvement over the right femoral neck. He was diagnosed with stage IV (T1N0M1aG3) Ewing’s sarcoma with bilateral lung metastases. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy decreased the tumor size and confined it to the metaphyseal region. The patient underwent four stages of surgery: wide tumor excision plus reconstruction with vascular fibular bone graft plus internal fixation; repeat open reduction and internal fixation; femoral lengthening with orthosis after physeal maturity; and orthosis removal and bone elongation (approximately 6 cm). Following surgery, he could walk without discomfort and had almost equal-sized bilateral femoral heads, indicating physis preservation. The surgery was successful, and normal femoral head growth was achieved after complete remission. The patient was able to resume normal activities with equal length of the bilateral lower limbs.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】Tumor treatment and reconstruction following resection are important in skeletally immature patients with Ewing’s sarcoma to improve quality of life.\n\n【7】Key Words: Ewing’s sarcoma , Lower limb discrepancy , Orthosis , Vascular fibular graft , Reconstruction , Case report\n\n【8】Core Tip: Ewing’s sarcoma is an uncommon primary malignant bone tumor, and its treatment is a challenge to the orthopedic surgeon. Beyond survival, current treatment also focuses on functional preservation and cosmetic appearance. This 9-year follow-up case illustrates the complete treatment course from resection to reconstruction and rehabilitation for Ewing’s sarcoma, which demonstrates a complete clinical picture for pediatric specialist and pediatric surgeons dealing with complex tumor surgery. The patient not only achieved complete remission, but also had good functional outcomes with limb salvage.\n\n【9】   Citation: Lai CY, Chen KJ, Ho TY, Li LY, Kuo CC, Chen HT, Fong YC.

The lung and liver are frequent sites of distant metastasis. Liver metastasis as the initial clinical manifestation of sublingual gland ACC is very rare.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 51-year-old Chinese woman presented with a painless mass in the right lobe of liver. The tumor was composed of ductal cells and myoepithelial cells with a morphology including tubiform and cribriform structures. Immunostaining results showed ductal cells positive for CK7, CK14, CK19, CD117, and 34βE12, and negative for MYB, vimentin, ER, PR, and CEA. The myoepithelial cells were positive for p63, calponin and CK5/6. Metastatic salivary ACC was considered, and a sublingual gland mass was revealed by computed tomography. Histological evaluation confirmed primary sublingual gland ACC. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) did not find an MYB-NFIB fusion gene in specimens from either the primary or metastatic ACC tumors. The sublingual gland ACC relapsed in 20 mo. The recurrent lesion disappeared following local radiation therapy and computed tomography-guided radioactive seed implantation. The patient remains in good condition until now.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】Metastatic sublingual gland ACC with initial clinical manifestation as a liver mass is very rare, and was pathologically confirmed in this patient by its histological appearance. Primary hepatic tumors and metastatic carcinomas should be included in the differential diagnosis. Immunohistochemical detection of MYB protein and MYB-NFIB fusion gene detection by FISH can be helpful, but occasional negative results confuse the diagnosis.\n\n【7】Key Words: Liver metastasis , Adenoid cystic carcinoma , Sublingual gland , Differential diagnosis , Immunohistochemistry , Fluorescence in situ hybridization , Case report\n\n【8】Core Tip: This is a report of a very rare case of liver metastasis as the initial clinical manifestation of sublingual gland adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC). It has not been described in the English literature until now. We describe this case in detail, with a review of the clinical and pathological characteristics, differential diagnosis, and therapy of metastatic salivary gland ACC. Three previous reports and our case confirm that an isolated liver metastasis can be the primary presentation of salivary gland ACC. An MYB-NFIB fusion gene was not detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization in either the primary or metastatic ACC tumor.\n\n【9】   Citation: Li XH, Zhang YT, Feng H.

RCC represents 2% of all cancers with approximately 25% of patients presenting with advanced disease. Clear cell RCC (CCRCC) is the most common RCC, accounting for 75%-80% of all RCC.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 71-year-old man presented with a history of benign prostatic hypertrophy. He was asymptomatic without any hematuria, pain, or other urinary symptoms. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a 1.8 cm left retroperitoneal lymph node. There was no evidence of renal pathology. A core biopsy was performed of the left para-aortic lymph node. Although the primary tumor site was unknown, the morphological and immunohistochemical features were most consistent with CCRCC. A RPLND was performed which revealed a single mass 5.5 cm in greatest dimension with extensive necrosis. The retroperitoneal lymph node was most compatible with CCRCC. A nephrectomy was not conducted as a renal mass had not been detected on any prior imaging studies. The patient did not receive any type of adjuvant therapy. The patient underwent surveillance with serial CT scans with contrast of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis for the next 5 years, all of which demonstrated no recurrent or metastatic disease and no evidence of retroperitoneal adenopathy.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】Our unique case emphasizes the therapeutic role of metastasectomy in metastatic CCRCC even in the absence of primary tumor in the kidneys.\n\n【7】Key Words: Oncology , Renal cell carcinoma , Clear cell carcinoma , Lymph node dissection , Retroperitoneal , Metastasis , Nephrectomy without primary site , Case report\n\n【8】Core tip: Retroperitoneal lymph node dissection has important diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic functions in renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

All required tests were performed according to our pre-LT diagnostic protocol. The orthotopic LT procedure involving O+ donor and A1B+ recipient was performed. Our treatment strategy to overcome the antibody‐mediated rejection included a systemic triple immunosuppressive regimen: methylprednisolone, mycophenolate mofetil, and tacrolimus. The immunological desensitization consisted of the chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab and intravenous immunoglobulins. The patient was also on antibiotic treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefotaxime, and metronidazole. On the 10 <sup>th </sup> postoperative day, high titers of IgG anti-A and anti-B antibodies were found in the patient’s plasma. We performed a liver biopsy, which revealed histological evidence of antibody-mediated rejection, but the rejection was excluded according to the Banff classification. The therapy was continued until the titer decreased significantly on the 18 <sup>th </sup> postoperative day. Despite the antibiotic, antifungal, and antiviral treatment, the patient deteriorated and developed septic shock with anuria and pancytopenia. The conservative treatment was unsuccessful, which lead to the patient’s fatal outcome on the 42 <sup>nd </sup> postoperative day.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】We present a patient who underwent ABO-nonidentical LT from a deceased donor.

The main threat after ABO-nonidentical LT is the antibody-mediated rejection due to anti-A/B antibodies as a result of passenger lymphocyte syndrome. Our case demonstrated that a proper treatment protocol, including immunosuppression, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, intravenous immunoglobulin, anti-infectious agents, etc , is potent to maintain and even lower the isotiters of antibodies after ABO-nonidentical LT. However, due to other complications, the outcome for the patient was unfavorable.\n\n【9】   Citation: Peruhova M, Georgieva V, Yurukova N, Sekulovska M, Panayotova G, Mihova A, Terzieva V, Velikova TV.

Neurological complications associated with atrial myxoma most frequently include cerebral infarct due to embolus. Early complete resection of giant cardiac myxoma is the key to its treatment and prevention of stroke recurrence.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 42-year-old, previously healthy woman was admitted to the hospital with sudden-onset inability to speak and right-sided hemiplegia. While sweeping the floor 2 h prior to hospital admission, the patient developed sudden inability to express herself or understand what others were saying, accompanied by dyskinesia of the right limb, inability to walk or hold objects, and involuntary choreiform movements of the left upper limb. The patient was diagnosed with cerebral embolism and cardiac myxoma, complicated by left middle cerebral artery occlusion. The acute stroke was treated with intravenous thrombolytic therapy and arterial embolectomy as a bridging therapy to open resection of left atrial cardiac myxoma. The patient condition improved remarkably following initial thrombolysis and embolectomy and subsequently underwent emergency open resection of the atrial cardiac myxoma.

She had been diagnosed with a uterine leiomyoma, after complaints of irregular vaginal bleeding. She underwent dilatation and curettage (D&C) and subsequent total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. D&C were compatible with MGA. Histologically, a proliferation of small glands, without intervening stroma, with mucin production, accumulation of neutrophils in the gland lumen and stroma, mild nuclear atypia and rare mitoses, were seen. In the hysterectomy specimen, the endometrium was thickened, but without apparent tumor formation.

Cases positive for anti-Yo antibodies (anti-Purkinje cytoplasmic antibody 1) are the main subtype of PCD. PCD is subacute cerebellar degeneration, and while it progresses over weeks to months, its resultant deficits last much longer. Cancer patients with anti-Yo antibody-positive PCD are very rare. Most of them are breast cancer or ovarian cancer patients but also occasionally lung cancer patients.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 61-year-old woman presented with sudden vertigo, nausea, and vomiting for approximately 10 d. The patient's neurological examination showed torsion with downbeat nystagmus and ataxia of the right limb and trunk. Laboratory examination found that the patient's cerebrospinal fluid and serum were anti-Yo antibody-positive, positron emission tomography computed tomography showed an increased metabolic rate in the retroperitoneal lymph nodes, and the pathology of lymph node punctures in the retroperitoneum and neck suggested adenocarcinoma of the pancreaticobiliary duct, which strengthens the hypothesis of paraneoplastic origin.

We administered roxadustat to a maintenance hemodialysis patient who was allergic to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) and depended on blood transfusion for five years. After applying Roxadustat, the patient’s anemia improved significantly.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 77-year-old Chinese man had type 2 diabetes for 16 years, underwent maintenance hemodialysis for five years, and had fatigue for five years. Laboratory tests showed severe anemia (hemoglobin concentration of 42 g/L). The patient was administered a subcutaneous injection of ESAs before dialysis. He suffered an allergic shock immediately and fainted. His blood pressure dropped to undetectable levels. He was not administered ESAs henceforth. The patient was prescribed iron supplements and received blood transfusions occasionally for five years. His hemoglobin concentration ranged from 42-68 g/L. After taking six weeks of oral roxadustat three times weekly (100 mg TIW), the patient’s hemoglobin concentration increased significantly, and his symptoms decreased.

Complete blood count (CBC) examination by automated blood cell counter (ABCC) is a quick and convenient measurement for screening abnormalities of blood cells that are triggered by various pathogenic insults in disease diagnosis and for monitoring changes in the treatment of existing hematological conditions. However, CBC results are frequently affected by many intrinsic and extrinsic factors from blood samples, such as in the setting of hypergammaglobulinemia and certain anticoagulants. SHLE could also affect CBC results.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 33-year-old Chinese male presented with painful foot numbness and abdominal pain. He was initially misdiagnosed as having a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) because of the marked abnormalities in CBC examination by the ABCC. Morphological evaluation of the bone marrow smears and biopsy showed no evidence of MPN. Gene mutations in Breakpoint cluster regions-Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homologue 1 ( BCR-ABL1 ), Janus kinase 2 ( JAK2 ), calreticulin ( CALR ), myeloproliferative leukemia virus ( MPL ), and colony-stimulating factor 3 receptor ( CSF3R ) were negative. Having noticed the thick chylomicron layer on blood samples and the dramatically fluctuating CBC results, we speculated that the fat droplets formed by shaking the blood samples in the setting of SHLE were mistakenly identified as blood cells due to the limited parameters of ABCC. Therefore, we removed a large part of the chylomicron layer and then reexamined the CBC, and the CBC results, as we expected, differed significantly from that of the sample before the chylomicron layer was removed. These significant differences had been validated by the subsequently repeated laboratory tests by measuring dual blood samples that the chylomicron layer was removed in one sample and was not in another, and comparing the CBC results. Computerized tomography reexamination of the upper abdomen revealed an exudative lesion surrounding his pancreas. After intensive consultation, definitive diagnosis was made as recurrent pancreatitis, hyperlipemia and pseudoerythrocytosis.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】SHLE may become a potential cause of misdiagnosis of hyperlipemia-related diseases as MPNs and the resultant mistreatment. It may also lead to the misinterpretation of transfusion indications in patients with hematological disorders who critically need blood transfusion for supportive treatment.\n\n【7】Key Words: Case report , Hyperlipemia , Fat droplet , Pancreatitis , Pseudoerythrocytosis , Blood transfusion indication\n\n【8】Core Tip: Severe hyperlipemia could affect the results of complete blood cell examination by automated blood cell counter. Here, we report a patient with severe hyperlipemia who was at first misdiagnosed as a myeloproliferative neoplasm because of the marked abnormalities in complete blood cell examination. Repeated laboratory tests, by measuring dual blood samples that the chylomicron layer was removed in one sample and was not in another, confirmed that the marked abnormalities was caused by the mistaken readings on automated blood cell counter. This phenomenon may lead to the misjudgment of many laboratory tests and the misinterpretation of blood transfusion indications.\n\n【9】   Citation: Zhao XC, Ju B, Wei N, Ding J, Meng FJ, Zhao HG.

The patient’s symptoms improved over the course of several weeks following discharge and repeat endoscopy showed well healing esophageal mucosa.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】This report highlights AEN in the absence of overt GIB, emphasizing the importance of early consideration of EGD.\n\n【7】Key Words: Acute esophageal necrosis , Gurvits syndrome , Acute necrotizing esophagitis , Black Esophagus , Diabetic Ketoacidosis , Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists\n\n【8】Core Tip: Acute esophageal necrosis (AEN) is a rare condition with a mortality rate greater than 30%. It has been linked to low volume states including diabetic ketoacidosis in case reports but is usually associated with overt gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). This report provides an important description of a patient presenting with AEN and no overt GIB. Interestingly, the apparent trigger for ketoacidosis appears to be a ketogenic diet. The case explores Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists as a possible AEN precipitant, which is not a finding previously described in the existing literature.\n\n【9】   Citation: Moss K, Mahmood T, Spaziani R.

The vast majority of patients have obvious symptoms and can be timely diagnosed and treated. Cases of pyogenic cervical spondylitis and diskitis with retropharyngeal and epidural abscess resulting in incomplete quadriplegia due to foreign body ingestion have been rarely reported. The absence of pharyngeal or esophageal discomfort and negative computed tomography (CT) findings of fish bone have not been reported. We report the case of an elderly female patient with delayed cervical infection and incomplete quadriplegia who had a history of fish bone ingestion.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 73-year-old woman presented with right neck pain and weakness of four limbs for a week, and had a history of fish bone ingestion and negative findings on laryngoscopic examination one month previously. She did not complain of any pharyngeal or esophageal discomfort. Cervical magnetic resonance imaging showed C4/C5 spondylitis and diskitis along with retropharyngeal and ventral epidural abscesses. No sign of fish bone was detected on lateral cervical radiography and CT scans . The muscle strength of the patient’s right lower limb receded to grade 1 and other limbs to grade 2 suddenly on the 10th day of hospitalization. Emergency surgery was performed to drain the abscess and decompress the spinal cord by removing the anterior inflammatory necrotic tissue. Simultaneously, flexible esophagogastroduodenoscopy was carried out and a hole in the posterior pharyngeal wall was found. The motor weakness of the right lower limb improved to grade 3 and the other limbs to grade 4 within 2 d postoperatively.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】This rare case highlights the awareness of the posterior pharyngeal or esophageal wall perforation in patients with cervical pyogenic spondylitis along with a history of fish bone ingestion, even though local discomfort symptoms are absent and the radiological examinations are negative.\n\n【7】Key Words: Fish bone , Cervical infection , Pyogenic spondylitis , Retropharyngeal abscess , Epidural abscess , Case report\n\n【8】Core Tip: We report a rare case of an elderly female patient with delayed cervical infection and incomplete quadriplegia who had a history of fish bone ingestion.

Open surgery was performed in all patients and complete excision of the mass was achieved in all cases. All patients are alive and free of symptom. Authors described a further case of a 3-year-old boy with a large duodenal IFP, in whom the tumor was removed by “en block resection”. The presence of IFP throughout the gastrointestinal tract and its variable clinical appearances make it difficult to diagnose.

The main aim of this article is to present a case of MS invading the brachial plexus, causing ulnar nerve entrapment syndrome, and to further clinical understanding of the possibility of MS invasion of peripheral nerves.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】We present the case of a 46-year-old man with a 13-year history of well-treated acute nonlymphocytic leukaemia who was admitted to the hospital after presenting with numbness and pain in his left little finger. The initial diagnosis was considered a simple case of nerve entrapment disease, with magnetic resonance imaging showing slightly abnormal left brachial plexus nerve alignment with local thickening, entrapment, and high signal on compression lipid images. Due to the severity of the ulnar nerve compression, we surgically investigated and cleared the entrapment and nerve tissue hyperplasia; however, subsequent pathological biopsy results revealed evidence of MS. The patient had significant relief from his neurological symptoms, with no postoperative complications, and was referred to the haemato-oncology department for further consultation about the primary disease.

Serious adverse reactions are uncommon compared with cytotoxic drugs.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 52-year-old man presented with general weakness and cytopenia. He had been taking erlotinib for 11 mo to treat NSCLC. The pathological diagnosis from the right upper lobe mass was adenocarcinoma with an EGFR mutation in exon 21 (L858R). He had previously received paclitaxel/carboplatin, gemcitabin/ vinorelbine chemotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery for brain metastasis, and whole-brain radiotherapy as treatment for NSCLC. We diagnosed the patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). During the induction and consolidation chemotherapy for AML, the erlotinib was discontinued. When complete remission of the AML was achieved, since the lung masses were increased, pemetrexed/ cisplatin for the NSCLC was initiated. After two cycles of chemotherapy, the cytopenia was prolonged. AML relapse occurred with the same karyotype.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】Therapy-related acute myeloid neoplasm (t-MN) is a rare but fatal late complication. Although a patient may be taking EGFR-TKIs, the possibility of t-MN should be considered. Further studies are needed to determine whether EGFR-TKI usage is a predisposing factor for t-MN.\n\n【7】Key Words: Acute myeloid leukemia , Erlotinib , Neoplasm, second primary , Non-small cell lung cancer , Case report\n\n【8】Core Tip: Therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) developed during erlotinib treatment in a patient with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)–mutant advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Alkylating cytotoxic drugs and radiotherapy are common treatments for patients with NSCLC. Cases of t-AML related to alkylating agents typically have a long latency period. Since it was 20 mo in this case, EGFR–tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) usage may be related to or hasten AML development in patients who previously received cytotoxic chemotherapy. Although the mechanism remains unclear, when a patient takes an EGFR-TKI, t-AML development should be considered, especially if cytopenia persists.\n\n【9】   Citation: Koo SM, Kim KU, Kim YK, Uh ST.

However, when there is pericentric inversion of chromosomes, unbalanced gametes will be formed in the process of germ cell meiosis.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 23-year-old pregnant woman at 25 wk of gestation wanted to terminate her pregnancy due to fetal chromosomal abnormalities. She had no exposure to toxic or hazardous substances before and during pregnancy, no history of medication usage during pregnancy, and she underwent cystectomy of ovarian cysts in 2017. On the second day of the 16 <sup>th </sup> week of gestation, non-invasive prenatal testing showed chromosome 8 copy number variation. Following genetic counseling, her pregnancy was terminated.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】Recombinant offspring chromosome is rarely seen when the inversion segment is shorter than one-third of the chromosome length. In terms of the mechanism of chromosome 8 duplication/deletion occurrence, attention should be paid to the production of unbalanced gametes by the pairing of homologous chromosome during meiosis, and the possibility of mitotic recombination exchange as well.\n\n【7】Key Words: Chromosome 8 , Spontaneous mutation , Mitosis , Non-invasive prenatal tes ting , Case report\n\n【8】Core Tip: The mechanism of partial deletion/duplication at the end of chromosome 8 involves two prevailing theories: Parental chromosome 8 inversion producing un balanced gametes, and a recombination hot spot of chromosome 8p. Although the recombination hot spot of chromosome 8q occurring during mitosis is rarely reported, it was confirmed in the present case. Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) for copy number variation has been used, but 40% or less mosaic abnormalities cannot be detected by NIPT. When chromosome 8 partial deletion/duplication occurs, in addition to the unbalanced gamete production caused by parental chromosome 8 inversion, attention should be paid to the mechanism of spontaneous recombination in meiosis or mitosis.\n\n【9】   Citation: Jiang Y, Tang S, He F, Yuan JX, Zhang Z.

Although there are some cases of colorectal bleeding caused by syphilis, small intestinal bleeding caused by syphilis is still rare.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 58-year-old man had experienced recurrent abdominal pain and melena for 3 years. Repeated gastroenteroscopy and computed tomography angiography examinations failed to find bleeding lesions. During the same admission, multiple intestinal ulcers were found by capsule endoscopy, and syphilis was also diagnosed. With a history of atrial fibrillation and chronic pancreatitis, he had undergone mitral valve replacement and tricuspid valvuloplasty for valvular heart disease. After anti-syphilis treatment, the melena and abdominal pain disappeared and his hemoglobin gradually increased. It is considered that gastrointestinal bleeding, chronic pancreatitis, atrial fibrillation, and heart valvular disease may have been caused by syphilis.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】This case report found that syphilis can mimic systemic disease and cause intestinal bleeding. In addition, treatment of the disease requires both sexual partners to be treated.

We report a rare case of gastrointestinal hemorrhage caused by Treponema pallidum . The case occurred in an adult male patient. The patient has not only suffered from atrial fibrillation, heart valvular disease, chronic pancreatitis, etc. for more than 10 years, but has also undergone heart valve replacement surgery. In recent years, the patient experienced recurrent unexplained gastrointestinal bleeding. Finally, based on careful analysis, syphilis was identified as the cause of intestinal ulcers that eventually led to gastrointestinal bleeding. This case shows that syphilis is a systemic disease and that it is important to treat syphilis as a couple.\n\n【9】   Citation: Sun DJ, Li HT, Ye Z, Xu BB, Li DZ, Wang W.

Rotavirus, a common pathogenic gastrointestinal virus in the neonatal period that is preventable via vaccination, has not been identified as a possible etiology. We report the case of a neonate who was referred for skin lesions presenting as EM, where a meticulous workup identified rotavirus as the sole causative agent.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 14-day-old male infant was admitted to our hospital with a 1-day history of skin lesions. No medical history or medication intake was recorded. Except for the complaint of skin lesions, the caregivers denied any abnormal symptoms. Multiple tests, including routine laboratory evaluations, were performed to iden tify the cause of skin lesions. Serological tests for Immunoglobulin M for Toxoplasma, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus, Herpes Simplex Virus, and Epstein-Barr virus viral-capsid antigen were all negative. Multiple polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for respiratory viruses and bacterial pathogens were negative (including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). Multiple PCR tests for gastrointestinal viruses and bacterial pathogens demonstrated evidence of rotavirus infection. No growth was reported in the blood and urine cultures. The patient received intravenous fluids for hydration; meanwhile, no other medications were prescribed. The lesions improved rapidly without specific treatment, and full recovery was achieved within a week.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】The possibility of rotavirus, a major cause of pediatric gastrointestinal infections, being a trigger for neonatal EM should be considered.\n\n【7】Key Words: Erythema multiforme , Gastrointestinal diseases , Neonate , Rotavirus , Skin abnormalities , Case report\n\n【8】Core Tip: Various etiologies, including infections, medications, malignancy, and immunization, are responsible for erythema multiforme (EM). EM is extremely rare in the neonatal period. Some potential causes have been reported in the literature, including hepatitis B vaccination and certain infections. As demonstrated in the current case, rotavirus, which is a common pathogenic gastrointestinal virus in the neonatal period that is preventable via vaccination, could be a cause of EM. Physicians should make their best effort in scrutinizing the etiology of the illness.\n\n【9】   Citation: Kim JJ, Lee JK.

After subtotal resection of the tumor located in L4-S1, it had a solid component that extended to the adjacent subcutaneous region. Histologically, the tumor consisted of a typical MPE with anaplastic features. The anaplastic areas of the tumor showed hypercellularity, a rapid mitotic rate, vascular proliferation, and connective tissue proliferation. Pleomorphic cells and atypical mitotic figures were occasionally observed. The MIB-1 index in this area was 12.3%. The im munohistochemical study showed immunoreactivity for vimentin, glial fibrillary acidic protein and S100.

Initial treatment included medicines to lower her potassium-levels and hemodialysis. However, the therapy did not affect her serum potassium levels. Plasma potassium concentration measurements and a history of essential thrombocythemia established the diagnosis of pseudohyperkalemia. The treatments of the platelet disorder gradually normalized serum potassium levels; however, the treatments had to be discontinued later due to the severe leukopenia, and enhanced levels of serum potassium concentrations were observable in the patient. Since plasma sampling was not permitted, doctors had to use a diuretic just in case. Finally, the patient collapsed into unconsciousness and died due to multiple organ dysfunction and electrolyte disturbance.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】We reviewed the literature and suggest that serum and plasma potassium values should both be measured for patients whose platelet counts exceed 500 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L to eliminate chances of pseudohyperkalemia, especially for those with chronic renal failure. An inappropriate treatment for pseudohyperkalemia can aggravate a patient's condition.\n\n【7】Key Words: Hyperkalemia , Pseudohyperkalemia , Thrombocythemia , Chronic renal failure , Case report\n\n【8】Core Tip: Pseudohyperkalemia in patients with chronic renal failure has been rarely reported, as an elevated level of potassium is typically correlated with impaired renal function. Herein, we studied pseudohyperkalemia caused by thrombocythemia in a patient suffering from chronic renal failure. A review of the literature is also provided to improve the overall awareness of the phenomenon in these patients. To our knowledge, our study was the first related literature review, and is the first to report the therapeutic process and outcome for an essential thrombocythemia patient with chronic renal failure.\n\n【9】   Citation: Guo Y, Li HC.

The purpose of this case study was to report a new direction in the use of type BIIIb rotationplasty in treating patients with limb salvage and long-term non-healing infections.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】Case 1: A 47-year-old man underwent radiotherapy for hemangioendothelioma in his left thigh, resulting in a femoral fracture. Despite the use of plates, intramedullary nailing, and external fixators, the femoral bone failed to unite due to infectious nonunion. Multiple operations were unable to control the infection, leaving the patient immobile. We performed a modified tibia-pelvic-constrained hip rotationplasty, utilizing a constrained prosthetic hip between the tibia and pelvis following a femur resection. Two years post-surgery, the patient was able to walk with the prosthetic device without any signs of recurring infection. The corresponding functional scores were 72 points for the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS), 53 for the Functional Mobility Assessment (FMA), 93 for the Toronto Extremity Salvage Score (TESS), and 56 for the MOS 36-item short form health survey (SF-36). Case 2: A 59-year-old woman presented with liposarcoma in her left thigh. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed tumors in the medial, anterior, and posterior femur muscles, encircling the femoral vessels and nerves. Fortunately, there were no symptoms of sciatic dysfunction, and the tumor had not invaded the sciatic nucleus. After one year of follow-up, the patient expressed satisfaction with limb preservation post-type BIIIb rotationplasty. The corresponding functional scores were 63 points for the MSTS, 47 for the FMA, 88 for the TESS, and 52 for the SF-36.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】Our study suggests that type BIIIb rotationplasty may be an alternative to amputation in patients with incurable infections. For malignant tumors of the lower extremities without invasion of the sciatic nerve, type BIIIb rotationplasty remains an excellent alternative to amputation. This surgical method may prevent amputation, improve functional outcomes, and facilitate biological reconstruction.\n\n【7】Key Words: Salvage procedure , Type BIIIb rotationplasty , Hemangioendothelioma , Incurable infections , Liposarcoma , Case report\n\n【8】Core Tip: Rotationplasty has been reported primarily as an alternative to amputation for malignant tumors, while reports on type BIIIb rotationplasty have been rarer. Our study suggests that type BIIIb rotationplasty may be an alternative to amputation or extended tumor prostheses in two cases of patients suffering from incurable infections. This surgical method may prevent amputation, improve functional outcomes, and facilitate biological reconstruction.\n\n【9】   Citation: Chen ZX, Guo XW, Hong HS, Zhang C, Xie W, Sha M, Ding ZQ.

Surgical resection is the conventional treatment modality. With the improvement of endoscopic therapeutic interventions, less invasive procedures are becoming possible. However, potential risks of endoscopic treatment include bleeding and intestinal perforation. Since intestinal hemangiomas originate from the submucosal layer and some of them are transmural, endoscopic treatment might sometimes result in uncontrolled bleeding or perforation.\n\n【9】   Citation: Hu PF, Chen H, Wang XH, Wang WJ, Su N, Shi B.

However, to date, very few cases of HEV-related HCC have been reported. Nevertheless, the role of HEV re-infection in cirrhotic liver without other chronic hepatitis infections has rarely been explored.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 53-year-old male farmer was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis and splenomegaly in August 2016, accompanied with negative HEV-IgM and positive HEV-IgG. No evidence of hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infection was found. Since then the patient was evaluated for liver function and viral parameters every 3 mo. In June 2017, the patient presented severe fatigue with whole body itching and was diagnosed with HCC. Afterwards this patient experienced quick HCC development, progression, relapse, and metastasis in the following 8 mo, and presented persistent dual positivity of HEV-IgM and HEV-IgG.

We present herein a unique chronic HEV case with liver cirrhosis who experienced repeated HEV re-infection and rapid HCC development and relapse. This case highlights the importance to investigate the association between HEV re-infection and rapid development of HCC and progression in liver cirrhosis cases, even in the absence of HBV infection. Moreover, routinely detecting HEV infection in high risk occupational group and all blood donors is warranted. Additionally, the treatment for symptomatic and asymptomatic chronic HEV infection is highly suggested.\n\n【9】   Citation: Lin XN, Lin QX, Li SM, Xie KP, Hou J, Chen R.

The frequency of infectious endocarditis (IE) among SAB patients ranges from 5% to 10%-12%. In adults, the characteristics of epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (EHK) include hyperkeratosis, erosions, and blisters. Patients with inflammatory skin diseases and some diseases involving the epidermis tend to exhibit a disturbed skin barrier and tend to have poor cell-mediated immunity.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】We describe a case of SAB and infective endocarditis in a 43-year-old male who presented with fever of unknown origin and skin diseases.

In this paper, we report a patient who underwent kidney re-transplantation after living donor graft nephrectomy due to de novo chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (ChRCC) involving the allograft kidney.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 34-year-old man underwent living kidney transplantation at the age of 22 years for end-stage renal disease. Maintenance immunosuppression consisted of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and prednisone. Six years post-transplantation, at another hospital, ultrasonography revealed a small mass involving the upper pole of the graft. The patient declined further examination and treatment at this point. Seven years and three months post-transplantation, the patient experienced decreasing appetite, weight loss, gross hematuria, fatigue, and oliguria. Laboratory tests showed anemia (hemoglobin level was 53 g/L). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a large heterogeneous cystic-solid mass involving the upper pole of the renal allograft. Graft nephrectomy was performed and immunosuppressants were withdrawn. Histological and immunohistochemical features of the tumor were consistent with ChRCC. One year after allograft nephrectomy, low doses of tacrolimus and MMF were administered for preventing allosensitization. Two years after allograft nephrectomy, the patient underwent kidney re-transplantation. Graft function remained stable with no ChRCC recurrence in more than 2-years of follow-up.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】De novo ChRCC in kidney graft generally has a good prognosis after graft nephrectomy and withdrawal of immunosuppression. Kidney re-transplantation could be a viable treatment. A 2-year malignancy-free period may be sufficient time before re-transplantation.\n\n【7】Key Words: Chromophobe , Renal cell carcinoma , Kidney , Nephrectomy , Transplantation , Case report\n\n【8】Core Tip: Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (ChRCC) is a rare malignancy of kidney allografts. This paper presents a case of de novo ChRCC arising primarily in an allograft kidney many years post-transplantation. It was successfully managed by allograft nephrectomy, and 2 years later, the patient underwent successful re-transplantation. Graft function was stable with no ChRCC recurrence beyond 2 years after re-transplantation. There are no guidelines for kidney re-transplantation after graft nephrectomy due to graft cancer. It remains a challenge to balance prevention of allosensitization and recurrence of cancer.\n\n【9】   Citation: Wang H, Song WL, Cai WJ, Feng G, Fu YX.

Thrombus has the possibility of migrating into the left circulation via patent foramen ovale in certain extreme circumstances. Thrombus straddling a patent foramen ovale is a direct evidence of this scenario. However, the confirmed cases of thrombus in transit are still rare.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 32-year-old man suffered from recurrent syncope and intermittent dyspnea for 1 wk. Transthoracic echocardiography confirmed a thrombus straddling the patent foramen ovale, and thrombi were also found in the bilateral pulmonary artery by computed tomography. The man underwent inferior vena cava filter placement and thrombolysis with alteplase. Echocardiography showed the absence of thrombi in both the right atrium and left atrium 2 d after hospitalization. The man was discharged to home on warfarin without any complications 2 wk later.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】Scrutinizing intracardiac thrombi provides measurable value in pulmonary embolism as closure of patent foramen ovale may be considered in certain patients.

For the better understanding of PTTM in HCC, the information of our recent case and reported cases have been summarized.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A patient with HCC exhibited acute and severe respiratory failure. Radiography and computed tomography of the chest revealed the multiple metastatic tumors and a frosted glass–like shadow with no evidence of infectious pneumonia. We diagnosed his condition as acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by the lung metastases and involvement of the pulmonary vessels by tumor thrombus.

However, intercostal arterial bleeding is likely to result in critical complications such as abnormalities in vital signs, hypovolemic shock, and death due to massive bleeding. Therefore, it is very important to establish the diagnosis of intercostal arterial bleeding and to initiate treatment.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】We report a case in which a 59-year-old woman who was hospitalized at intensive care unit with multiple trauma had a massive hemothorax after the removal of a percutaneous catheter. She sustained a refractory right pleural effusion due to biloma caused by a traumatic injury to the liver, despite persistent intraperitoneal drainage. As a result, atelectasis persisted in the dependent portion of the right lung. Therefore, we performed right percutaneous catheter drainage (8.5-F pigtail catheter) for pleural effusion drainage at the 7 <sup>th </sup> intercostal space. After percuta neous catheter removal, portable chest radiography and vital signs of the patient assisted in establishing a diagnosis of intercostal arterial bleeding. Intercostal arterial bleeding was also confirmed using transarterial angiography; and embolization was performed. The patient’s condition progressively improved, and no further intervention was required.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】Massive hemothorax is a rare complication of percutaneous catheter removal.

Review of diagnostics by a multidisciplinary care team suggested metastatic disease in the peritoneum, lending to a shift in the goals of care to comfort.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】With the diagnostic and therapeutic challenges of concurrent SBA and CD, multidisciplinary care and algorithmic management can optimize outcomes.\n\n【7】Key Words: Crohn’s disease , Small bowel adenocarcinoma , Management , Diagnosis , Case report\n\n【8】Core Tip: The prognosis of Crohn’s disease-induced small bowel adenocarcinomas (SBA) depends largely on staging at diagnosis, with early detection resulting in potentially improved outcomes. A multidisciplinary approach with gastroenterology, colorectal surgery, and radiology is key to this early diagnosis. Initially, a thorough family history can aid in decision-making with earlier intervention in those with stricturing phenotype and suggestion of higher colorectal cancer risk or syndrome. If imaging shows atypical features such as a mass, retrograde balloon enteroscopy should not be delayed. Finally, when surgical resection is considered in strictures refractory to medical therapy, lymph node sampling can aid in surgical staging of the SBA.\n\n【9】   Citation: Karthikeyan S, Shen J, Keyashian K, Gubatan J.

The lethality of CCS can be up to 50% if it is untreated or if treatment is delayed or inadequate. More than 35% of the patients do not achieve long-term clinical remission after corticosteroid administration, with relapse occurring during or after the cessation of glucocorticoid use. The optimal strategy of maintenance therapy of this disease is controversial.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 47-year-old man presented to the hospital with a 3-mo history of frequent watery diarrhoea, accompanied by macular skin pigmentation that included the palms and soles, and onychodystrophy of the fingernails and toenails. Gastroscopy and colonoscopy revealed numerous polyps in the stomach and colon. After other possibilities were ruled out by a series of examinations, CCS was diagnosed and treated with prednisone. The patient took prednisone for more than 1 year before achieving complete resolution of his symptoms and endoscopic findings. The patient was then given prednisone 5 mg/d for 6 mo of maintenance therapy. With clinical improvement and polyp regression, prednisone was discontinued. Eight mo after the discontinuation of prednisone, the diarrhoea and gastrointestinal polyps relapsed. Therefore, the patient was given the same dose of prednisone, and complete remission was achieved again.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】It is necessary to extend the duration of prednisone maintenance therapy for CCS. Prednisone is still effective when readministered after relapse.

Here, we report a case of CCS that has been followed for almost 4 years. The patient was treated with prednisone. After he discontinued prednisone, his clinical and endoscopic manifestations relapsed. The patient was given prednisone again, and it was effective in bringing about a second remission. It is necessary to extend the duration of prednisone maintenance therapy for CCS.

This disease is characterized by a relatively high recurrence rate after primary treatment. En bloc resection has been a predominant option for recurrent GCT. However, total patellectomy can lead to disruption of the knee. Therefore, exploration of functional reconstruction of the extensor mechanism is worthwhile.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 54-year-old woman presented with right knee pain and swelling, and was diagnosed as having a GCT in the patella following curettage and autograft. Medical imaging revealed a lytic and expanded lesion involving the whole patella with focal cortical breaches and pathological fracture. Based on the combination of histological, radiological, and clinical features, a diagnosis of recurrent GCT in the patella was made (Campanacci grade III). After a multidisciplinary team discussion, three-dimensional (3D)-printed custom-made patellar endoprosthesis was performed following en bloc resection for reconstructing the extensor mechanism. The patient was followed for 35 mo postoperatively. No evidence of local recurrence, pulmonary metastasis, or osteoarthritis of the right knee was observed. The active flexion arc was 0°-120°, and no extension lag was detected. A favorable patellar tracking and height (Insall-Salvati ratio 0.93) were detected by radiography.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】We depict a case of a GCT at the right patella, which was successfully treated by patellectomy and 3D-printed custom-made endoprosthetic replacement.

Our study is a pioneering case using three-dimensional-printed custom-made patella, which could be able to minimize complications and improve knee function.

Before dissolution of the enteric coating, they may appear hyperdense on computed tomography (CT). Unfortunately, few reports have been published on this topic so far. In this case report, the hyperdense appearance on contrast-enhanced CT of an enteric-coated mesalamine tablet was initially misinterpreted as a jejunal gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST).\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】An asymptomatic 81-year-old male patient, who had undergone laparoscopic right nephrectomy four years earlier for stage 1 renal carcinoma, was diagnosed with a jejunal GIST at the 4-year follow-up thoraco-abdominal CT scan. He was referred to our hub hospital for gastroenterological evaluation, and subsequently underwent 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, abdominal magnetic resonance imaging, and video capsule endoscopy. None of these examinations detected any lesion of the small intestine. After reviewing all the CT images in a multidisciplinary setting, the panel estimated that the hyperdense jejunal image was consistent with a tablet rather than a GIST. The tablet was an 800 mg delayed-release enteric-coated oral mesalamine tablet (Asacol <sup>® </sup> ), which had been prescribed for non-specific colitis, while not informing the hospital physicians.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】Delayed-release oral mesalamine (Asacol <sup>® </sup> ), like other enteric-coated medications, can appear as a hyperdense image on a CT scan, mimicking a small intestinal GIST. Therefore, a detailed knowledge of the patients’ medications and a multidisciplinary review of the images are essential.\n\n【7】Key Words: Mesalamine , Enteric-coating , Asacol , Tablet , Gastrointestinal stromal tumor , Case report\n\n【8】Core Tip: Enteric-coated tablets may appear as hyperdense images on computed tomography (CT) scan, and lead to misdiagnosis, for example of small intestinal gastrointestinal stromal tumors which usually show homogeneous enhancement on contrast-enhanced CT phases. Therefore, when observing small hyperdense lesions in the gastrointestinal tract on CT scan, physicians should be aware of possible radiopaque medications. A perfect knowledge of the patients’ medical treatment (even occasional) and a multidisciplinary review of all the images are essential to avoid misdiagnosis and unnecessary investigations.\n\n【9】   Citation: Frosio F, Rausa E, Marra P, Boutron-Ruault MC, Lucianetti A.

In this case, an elderly woman presented with chest pain showing dynamic changes in precordial ST-segment elevation with RCA occlusion.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 96-year-old woman presented with acute chest pain showing precordial ST-segment elevation with dynamic changes. Myocardial injury markers became positive. Coronary angiography indicated acute total occlusion of the proximal nondominant RCA, mild atherosclerosis of left anterior descending artery and 75% stenosis in the left circumflex coronary artery. Percutaneous coronary intervention was conducted for the RCA. Repeated manual thrombus aspiration was performed, and fresh thrombus was aspirated. A 2 mm × 15 mm balloon was used to dilate the RCA with an acceptable angiographic result. The patient’s chest pain was relieved immediately.

A novel idea is to use endoscopic vacuum therapy (EVT) in a preemptive setting to prevent anastomotic leakage and pancreatic fistulas. In a recent case series, EVT was proven to be effective in preventing leaks in patients with anastomotic ischemia. There have been no previous reports on preemptive EVT after pancreaticoduodenectomy.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】We describe the case of a 71-year-old woman with hypertension and diabetes who was admitted to the emergency room with jaundice, choluria, fecal acholia, abdominal pain, and fever. Admission examinations revealed leukocytosis and hyperbilirubinemia (total: 13 mg/dL; conjugated: 12.1 mg/dL). Abdominal ultrasound showed cholelithiasis and dilation of the common bile duct. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a stenotic area, and a biopsy confirmed cholangiocarcinoma. Considering the high risk of leaks after pancreaticoduodenectomy, preemptive endoluminal vacuum therapy was performed. The system comprised a nasogastric tube, gauze, and an antimicrobial incise drape. The negative pressure was 125 mmHg, and no adverse events occurred.

Since the disease does not manifest a characteristic profile of clinical symptoms, it is easy to misdiagnose and still difficult to diagnose without operation. Here, we report a case of low-grade AMN (LAMN) and summarize its clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 63-year-old postmenopausal woman presented with a history of right lower abdominal mass. The patient underwent laparotomy, which showed an appendiceal mucocele originating from the apex of the appendix, and a simple appendectomy was performed. The subsequent histological assessment identified an LAMN with no lymph node involvement and negative surgical margin. The patient received six cycles of chemotherapy after surgery, and to date, more than a year after the surgery, the patient remains in good health.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】A unified, standardized, detailed, and accurate pathological diagnosis is needed for LAMN, to facilitate selection of an appropriate surgical plan. In addition, the surgeon should record the details of the tumors in the surgical records in order to facilitate follow-up after surgery.\n\n【7】Key Words: Mucocele of appendix , Appendiceal mucinous neoplasm , Low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm , Pathological profile , Diagnosis , Case report\n\n【8】Core tip: Appendiceal mucinous neoplasms (AMNs) are rare tumors. Only a few cases have been reported and most patients have no typical clinical manifestations. As such, diagnosis and treatment are a clinical challenge; even the terminology of AMN grading and staging has been controversial and is not standardized yet. Malignant AMNs have a poor curative effect and no treatment standard has been established. Here, we report a female patient with AMN who has survived throughout follow-up, now at 1 year post-surgery. A review of the latest literature is also provided to improve the overall awareness and understanding of this disease.\n\n【9】   Citation: Yang JM, Zhang WH, Yang DD, Jiang H, Yu L, Gao F.

GS in the central nervous system is rare, and an intraspinal space-occupying lesion caused by GS is even rarer. Surgical decompression is often necessary to remove the intraspinal space-occupying lesion. To the best of our knowledge, we report, for the first time a case of GS that caused extensive compression in the spinal canal without surgical decompression treatment.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 15-year-old male suddenly developed numbness and weakness in his lower limbs for 10 d, which affected his walking ability. Acute myeloid leukemia was later diagnosed in the Department of Hematology. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed that multiple segmental space-occupying lesions were causing severe spinal cord compression in the thoracic spinal canal. As a result, the patient received routine chemotherapy before surgery. Interestingly, the intraspinal space-occupying lesions completely diminished on magnetic resonance imaging after a course of chemotherapy, and the sensation and strength in his lower limbs markedly recovered.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】An intraspinal space-occupying lesion could be the first symptom of acute myeloid leukemia, causing spinal nerve compression without any other symptoms. Following standard chemotherapy, spinal canal compression can be quickly relieved, and the spinal cord and nerve function restored, avoiding emergency surgery.\n\n【7】Key Words: Granulocytic sarcoma , Acute myeloid leukemia , Spinal cord compression , Intraspinal tumor , Chemotherapy , Case report\n\n【8】Core Tip: This case is important as not all intraspinal granulocytic sarcoma in acute myeloid leukemia or chronic myeloid leukemia appear after systemic symptoms. We suggest that if conditions permit, relief of spinal cord compression can be achieved by standard chemotherapy. However, if hematological diseases are excluded, emergency surgery or biopsy is necessary to preserve the spinal cord and nerve function.\n\n【9】   Citation: Shao YD, Wang XH, Sun L, Cui XG.

We present the case of a 40-year-old woman diagnosed with Asherman’s syndrome who successfully gave birth to a live full-term neonate after hysteroscopic adhesiolysis under laparoscopic observation, intrauterine device insertion, and Kaufmann therapy.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 40-year-old woman (Gravida 3, Para 0) arrived at our hospital for specialist care to carry her pregnancy to term. She had previously undergone six sessions of dilation and curettage owing to a hydatidiform mole and persistent trophoblastic disease, followed by chemotherapy. She subsequently became pregnant twice, but both pregnancies resulted in spontaneous miscarriages during the first trimester. Her menstrual periods were very light and of short duration. Hysteroscopic adhesiolysis with concurrent laparoscopy was performed, and Asherman’s syndrome was diagnosed. The uterine adhesions covered the area from the in ternal cervical os to the uterine fundus. Postoperative Kaufmann therapy was administered, and endometrial regeneration was confirmed using hysteroscopy. She became pregnant 9 mo postoperatively and delivered through elective ces arean section at 37 wk of gestation. The postpartum course was uneventful, and she was discharged on postoperative day 7.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】Hysteroscopic adhesiolysis with concurrent laparoscopy enables identification and resection of the affected area and safe and accurate surgery, without complications.\n\n【7】Key Words: Hysteroscopic surgery , Laparoscopy , Intrauterine devices , Live birth , Pregnancy , Case report\n\n【8】Core Tip: Adhesion dissection under laparoscopic monitoring in Asherman's syndrome is useful not only for avoiding the risk of surgical complications such as uterine perforation, but also for intraperitoneal observation to investigate the cause of infertility.

Readers will gain an understanding of the challenge in determining the severity of luminal stenosis based on coronary angiography alone in tortuous coronary anatomy, the use of intravascular ultrasound in this setting, and the allied vasculopathies of interest.\n\n【2】Key Words: Coronary tortuosity , Intravascular ultrasound , Spontaneous coronary artery dissection , Diagnostic coronary angiography\n\n【3】Core tip: Coronary arteries are inherently tortuous, and are assessed at angiography, compressing a 3D structure into a 2D picture. An overly tortuous artery may resemble true luminal stenosis, rather than mere angulation, and may be interpreted as a significant coronary stenosis. We present a remarkably angulated coronary artery, which appeared to bear a significant stenosis. On further assessment with pressure wire study and intravascular ultrasound we found there to be no significant lesion. We demonstrate an artefactual false-positive finding, and describe our clinical approach to avoid mistaking such a lesion for one that requires intervention, with a review of the literature.\n\n【4】   Citation: Edroos SA, Sayer JW.

The most common symptoms are myoclonus, ataxia and seizure. It is rarely encountered in the Chinese mainland.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 22-year-old male presented with complaints of progressive myoclonus, ataxia and slurred speech, without visual symptoms; the presenting symptoms began at the age of 15-year-old. Whole exome sequencing revealed two pathogenic heterozygous missense variants \\[c.239C>T (p.P80L) and c.544A>G (p.S182G) in the neuraminidase 1 (NEU1) gene\\], both of which have been identified previously in Asian patients with type 1 sialidosis. All three patients identified in Mainland China come from three unrelated families, but all three show the NEU1 mutations p.S182G and p.P80L pathogenic variants. Increasing sialidase activity through chaperones is a promising therapeutic target in sialidosis.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】Through retrospective analysis and summarizing the clinical and genetic characteristics of type 1 sialidosis, we hope to raise awareness of lysosomal storage disorders among clinicians and minimize the delay in diagnosis.\n\n【7】Key Words: Sialidosis , Myoclonus , Ataxia , Neuraminidase 1 , Case report , Mucolipidoses\n\n【8】Core Tip: Type 1 sialidosis is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder.

All patients developed hemiplegia except patient 4 who also had cognitive decline, speech disturbance, nocturnal enuresis, polydipsia, polyuria, precocious puberty and abnormalities of thermoregulation. All four cases were alpha-fetoprotein and beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (β-HCG) negative except patient 3 who had slightly elevated β-HCG in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). No malignant cells were detected in the patients’ CSF. Brain magnetic resonance imaging findings were diverse in these patients with the exception of the unique and common characteristics of ipsilateral hemisphere atrophy, especially in the cerebral peduncle. All patients were diagnosed with germinomas of the basal ganglia and thalamus by stereotactic brain biopsy.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】Stereotactic brain biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of ectopic germinomas.

The definite diagnosis of these ectopic germinomas depends on histopathological examination. In this report, we describe four intractable cases whose histopathological diagnoses were germinomas in the basal ganglia and thalamus. Ipsilateral hemiatrophy, which was a common characteristic on neuroimaging of germinomas in the basal ganglia and thalamus, may be an important feature in differentiating these lesions from other intracranial tumors.\n\n【9】   Citation: Huang ZC, Dong Q, Song EP, Chen ZJ, Zhang JH, Hou B, Lu ZQ, Qin F.

Until now, most data on gastric MiNEN come from clinical cases, without large-scale retrospective studies or controlled clinical trials. Consequently, no consensus regarding the origin, molecular characteristics, or appropriate treatment of MiNEN has been reached so far. We conducted chemotherapy of irinotecan plus cisplatin (IP regimen) and surgery in two patients with gastric MiNEN, which had never been used in treating this kind of tumor, leading to their long-term survival for more than 3 and 7 years, respectively.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】We present two patients (one male and one female) with gastric MiNEN, with the primary manifestation of recurrent upper abdominal pain. After they were referred to our hospital, a diagnosis of gastric MiNEN was defined with the help of CT scan, and histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations on the samples of gastrointestinal endoscopy or radical surgery. The male patient (case 1) were found to have metastases in the reginal lymph nodes and the left liver. He received four cycles of IP regimens first, then the gastrectomy and partial left liver resection, followed by additional two cycles of IP chemotherapy. The female patient (case 2) underwent a laparoscopic gastrectomy, and received six cycles of IP regimen. She was found to have metastatic lesions in the right lung 2 years after that, and underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) of the lower lobe of the right lung. The two patients have now survived for more than 3 years and 7 years, respectively, without any evidence of recurrence or metastases.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】IP regimen, combined with curative-intent surgery if feasible, could be considered as the priority in the choice of front-line chemotherapy for gastric MiNEN.\n\n【7】Key Words: Gastric , Irinotecan plus cisplatin , Long-term survival , Mixed neuroendocrine-non-neuroendocrine neoplasm , Case report\n\n【8】Core Tip: Mixed neuroendocrine-non-neuroendocrine neoplasm (MiNEN) is a rare, highly aggressive tumor with a poor prognosis (median overall survival less than 12 mo), and no consensus regarding the appropriate treatment has been reached so far.

An ultrasound examination is a quick and safe examination with the benefit of no radiation exposure, which is always preferred for pregnant women. Currently, cases of spontaneous rupture and hemorrhage of RAML during pregnancy are rare, as is the diagnostic value and characteristics of ultrasound. The lack of understanding of the condition among ultrasound doctors makes it prone to misdiagnosis. In this study, we present the case of a pregnant woman who was preliminarily diagnosed with spontaneous rupture and hemorrhage of the left RAML using ultrasound and discuss the ultrasound characteristics.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 38-year-old woman in her 19 <sup>th </sup> wk of pregnancy (G2P1) was referred to our clinic for a sudden, persistent pain on the left side of the waist.

Laboratory investigations, physical examinations, and enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) suggested systemic lupus erythematosus complicated by LMV. She received treatments, such as GI decompression, somatostatin, glucocorticoids, and immu nosuppressants, and was evaluated using color ultrasonography. Twenty days later, the patient reported no stomach discomfort and was able to consume semi-liquid food. Laboratory investigations showed that inflammatory factors decreased to normal levels and complement levels increased slightly. One year after discharged, she recovered with methylprednisolone being tapered to 4 mg per day, mycophenolate mofetil to 0.75 g bid, and hydroxychloroquine to 0.2 g bid; however, only C3 complement level was slightly below the normal level.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】Early diagnosis of LMV is essential for successful treatment; this depends on a combination of clinical manifestations, laboratory investigations, and imaging findings.

As a rare disorder that may cause pleural effusion, renal lymphangiectasia is a congenital or acquired abnormality of the lymphatic system of the kidneys. As vaguely mentioned in a report from the American Journal of Kidney Diseases, this disorder can be caused by extrinsic compression of the kidney secondary to hemorrhage.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 54-year-old man with biopsy-proven acute tubulointerstitial nephropathy experienced bleeding 3 d post hoc, which, upon clinical detection, manifested as a massive perirenal hematoma on computed tomography (CT) scan without concurrent pleural effusion. His situation was eventually stabilized by expeditious management, including selective renal arterial embolization. Despite good hemodialysis adequacy and stringent volume control, a CT scan 1 mo later found further enlargement of the perirenal hematoma with heterogeneous hypodense fluid, left side pleural effusion and a small amount of ascites. These fluid collections showed a CT density of 3 Hounsfield units, and drained fluid of the pleural effusion revealed a dubiously light-colored transudate with lymphocytic predominance (> 80%). Similar results were found 3 mo later, during which time the patient was free of pulmonary infection, cardiac dysfunction and overt hypoalbuminemia. After careful consideration and exclusion of other possible causative etiologies, we believed that the pleural effusion was due to the occlusion of renal lymphatic ducts by the compression of kidney parenchyma and, in the absence of typical dilation of the related ducts, considered our case as extrarenal lymphangiectasia in a broad sense.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】As such, our case highlighted a morbific passage between the kidney and thorax under an extraordinarily rare condition. Given the paucity of pertinent knowledge, it may further broaden our understanding of this rare disorder.\n\n【7】Key Words: Urothorax , Pleural effusion , Perirenal hematoma , Renal lymphangiectasia , Lymphatic drainage , Case report\n\n【8】Core Tip: It is known that obstructive uropathy or occlusion of the lymphatic ducts may lead to extravasated fluids (urine or lymph) crossing the diaphragm via innate perforations or lymphatic channels. Therein, this clinical phenomenon is addressed as the “urothorax”. Among the diverse etiologies, renal lymphangiectasia is a congenital or acquired abnormality of the lymphatic system of the kidneys. Under this instance, pleural effusion of lymphoid origin may develop when the renal parenchyma is tightly compressed by a perirenal hematoma. Arguably, tight compression of the renal parenchyma may keep the draining lymphatic vessels shut but not prevent the inflow from the capsular lymph plexus. Thus, our report has for the first time described this extremely rare scenario and raises clinical awareness of the underlying passage, through which upward spread of perirenal infection could result in lung abscess.\n\n【9】   Citation: Lin QZ, Wang HE, Wei D, Bao YF, Li H, Wang T.

Limited by the diagnostic efficacy of histopathological examination, their malignant behavior is thought to be associated with local invasion or metastasis, with only four malignant cases reported in the literature to date. As pancreatic paragangliomas share similar imaging features with other types of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms, they are difficult to diagnose accurately without the support of pathological evidence. As primary pancreatic paragangliomas are rare, especially those accompanied by lymph node metastasis, there is currently no consensus on treatment. Herein, we report a case of primary pancreatic paraganglioma with lymph node metastasis.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A mass located in the pancreatic body was incidentally discovered on computed tomography in a 41-year-old Tibetan man. Distal pancreatectomy was subsequently performed and a 4.1 cm × 4.2 cm tumor was found embedded in the body of the pancreas during surgery. Histological examination confirmed the characteristics of paraganglioma in which the neoplastic chief cells were arranged in a classic Zellballen pattern under hematoxylin-eosin staining. Further, immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the sustentacular cells in the tumor tissue were positive for S-100 protein, and neoplastic cells and pancreatic draining lymph nodes were positive for chromogranin A and synaptophysin; thus, the presence of lymph node metastasis (two of the eight resected pancreatic draining lymph nodes) was also confirmed. A diagnosis of primary pancreatic paraganglioma with lymph node metastasis was finally established. The patient remained disease-free for 1 year after the surgery.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】A definite diagnosis of pancreatic paraganglioma mainly depends on posto perative histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations.

Paragangliomas arising from the pancreas are even less, local invasion or metastasis are thought to be associated with malignant behaviors, and only four of these cases have been reported to date. It is difficult to make an accurate preoperative diagnosis of pancreatic paraganglioma especially when the tumor is non-functioning. No standard therapeutic consensus has been reached yet.

We present an uncommon colonoscopy finding of a healed diver ticular perforation, mimicking a polyp, 6 wk post-diverticulitis-something that has not been reported in literature. We aim to shed light on the likely process that resulted in the trompe l'œil after diverticulitis. This also introduces the possibility of more targeted colonic resection in the event of a similar recurrence.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A middle-aged Chinese female presented with a 3-d history of non-colicky left iliac fossa pain. It was associated with fever (T <sub>max </sub> 37.6 ºC), non-bloody diarrhoea and non-bloody, non-bilious vomiting. She had a history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus, well controlled on metformin. Tenderness was noted on the left iliac fossa region with no guarding or mass. Total white cell count (11.45 × 10 <sup>9 </sup> /L) and C-reactive protein levels (213.9 mg/L) were elevated. Computed tomography imaging of the abdomen revealed pericolonic fat stranding and extraluminal air pockets fluid density with peritoneal thickening at the sigmoid colon, likely representing a sealed perforation. Six weeks after the episode, she underwent a follow-up colonoscopy. An exophytic polypoid lesion closely associated with a diverticulum was seen in the sigmoid colon. The lesion was easily “pinched” off without much effort using endoscopic forceps and sent for histology which revealed granulation tissue suggesting a healed diverticular perforation.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】Granulation tissue associated with healed diverticular perforations resemble polyps. Tattooing around these sites may allow for future targeted colonic resections.\n\n【7】Key Words: Diverticulitis , Colonoscopy , Colonic polyps , Colorectal cancer , Diverticular perforation , Case report\n\n【8】Core Tip: This case report aims to shed light on the possible morphology of a healed diverticular perforation. This is important as patients who have suffered from diverticular perforations are at increased risk of recurrence, with high likelihood of the previously perforated diverticulum being the offending cause. Recognising the appearance of granulation tissue from a possible sealed perforated diverticulum and marking the site with injectable tattoos may allow for targeted resections of the colon if recurrence occurs. This preserves more parenchyma, allows for a potentially faster surgery, and shortens recovery time while achieving an equivalent improvement in quality-of-life.\n\n【9】   Citation: Liew JJL, Lim WS, Koh FH.

It may form anywhere in the GI tract, but esophageal bezoar is rare because of the short esophageal transit time. Psyllium seed husk is an indigestible natural derivative that is widely used as an herbal laxative. Herein, we report a case of acute esophageal obstruction caused by a bezoar after ingestion of psyllium seed husk powder.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 76-year-old male with Parkinson's disease visited the emergency department with swallowing difficulty approximately 10 h after ingesting psyllium seed husk powder. Symptoms began a few hours after ingestion and progressed to severe dysphagia. There were no abnormal findings on simple radiography. However, a computed tomography scan revealed an approximately 2.0 cm × 2.5 cm mass located near the gastro-esophageal junction. After grinding, the mass was removed using an endoscopic capture net. Esophageal bezoars may cause life-threatening complications. Patients with Parkinson's disease may have esophageal motility dysfunction, which may increase esophageal transit time.

Furthermore, bulk-forming laxatives such as psyllium seed husk can be purchased cheaply over the counter in the form of herbal medications. Therefore, we recommend that physicians pay more attention to the use of bulk-forming laxative regimens in these patients. Furthermore, optimal usage guidelines and warning messages may need to be included when selling psyllium seed husk as a health supplement.\n\n【9】   Citation: Shin S, Kim JH, Mun YH, Chung HS.

The use of anthracycline is limited by dose-dependent cardiotoxicity, which may manifest initially as asymptomatic cardiac dysfunction with subsequent progression to congestive heart failure. Despite baseline assessment and periodic monitoring of cardiac function for patients receiving anthracycline agents, there are unmet needs in prediction and prevention of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity (AIC).\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 35-year-old African American female was found to have a 9-cm high-grade osteosarcoma of right femur and normal baseline cardiac function with left ventricular ejection fraction of approximately 60%-70% determined by transthoracic and dobutamine stress echocardiogram. She underwent perioperative doxorubicin and cisplatin chemotherapy with 3 cycles before surgery and 3 cycles after surgery, and received a total of 450 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> doxorubicin at the end of her treatment course. She was evaluated regularly during chemotherapy without any cardiac or respiratory symptoms. Approximately two months after her last chemotherapy, the patient presented to the emergency department with dyspnea for one week and was intubated for acute hypoxic respiratory failure. Echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 5%-10% with severe biventricular failure. Despite attempts to optimize cardiac function, the patient’s hemodynamic status continued to decline, and resuscitation was not successful on the seventh day of hospitalization. The autopsy showed no evidence of osteosarcoma, and the likely cause of death was cardiac failure with the evidence of pulmonary congestion, liver congestion, and multiple body cavity effusions.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】We present a case of 35-year-old African American female developing cardiogenic shock shortly after receiving a cumulative dose of 450 mg/m <sup>2 </sup> doxorubicin over 9 mo. Cardiac monitoring and management of patients receiving anthracycline chemotherapy have been an area of intense research since introduction of these agents in clinical practice.

The case presented demonstrates an example of acute heart failure in a well-compensated young adult who did not at first glance warrant greater than routine cardiac surveillance during doxorubicin treatment course. Utilization of cardioprotective agents and cardiac strain markers such as troponin and brain natriuretic peptide may help to prevent and identify cardiac dysfunction in asymptomatic patients. Prevention of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity and cardiovascular toxicities of other anti-cancer therapy requires multidisciplinary approaches such as modification of cardiovascular risk factors, active management of comorbidities, and pharmacologic therapy in selected patients.\n\n【9】   Citation: Chong EG, Lee EH, Sail R, Denham L, Nagaraj G, Hsueh CT.

Surgical total resection combined with postoperative radiotherapy can prolong progression-free survival and decrease the recurrence rate. Meanwhile, long-term follow-up is also necessary for patients after surgery. In addition, primary intracranial EMC should also be considered when diagnosing and distinguishing a lesion in the cavernous sinus.\n\n【9】   Citation: Zhu ZY, Wang YB, Li HY, Wu XM.

The patient and the family also had a history of bone loss of the jaw and early tooth loss, consistent with oligodontia. Genetic testing revealed the patient to have a previously unpublished variant of unknown significance (VUS) in the AXIN2 gene. These clinical findings have been demonstrated previously in only two other families, both of which exhibited oligodontia, colorectal neoplasia (polyps and cancer) and a heterozygous mutation in AXIN2 . The AXIN2 protein is component of the Wnt pathway, which is known to be vital for organism development and cellular homeostasis. Alterations of the Wnt pathway lead to cell proliferation and neoplasm, in addition to agenesis of physical structures (such as teeth). The analysis of our pedigree further supports an association between colonic neoplasm (polyposis and CRC), the AXIN2 gene in general, and this particular VUS.

We initially performed induction chemotherapy using three courses of DCF, but the lesion was still evaluated unresectable after DCF chemotherapy. Therefore, we subsequently performed dCRT treatment (CF and radiation). After dCRT, prominent reduction of the primary tumor was recognized but a residual tumor with ulceration was detected by EGD. Since the patient had some surgical risk, we performed two additional courses of CF and achieved a clinically complete response. After 14 mo from last administration of CF chemotherapy, recurrence has not been detected by computed tomography and EGD, and biopsy from the scar formation has revealed no cancer cells.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】We report successful case with tumor remnants even after DCF and subsequent dCRT, for whom a complete response was finally achieved with two additional courses of CF chemotherapy. Additional CF chemotherapy could be one radical treatment option for residual ESCC after treatment with induction DCF followed by dCRT to avoid salvage surgery, especially for high-risk patients.\n\n【7】Key Words: Unresectable esophageal cancer , Induction docetaxel, cisplatin and fluorouracil , Chemoradiotherapy , Complete response , Additional chemotherapy , Case report\n\n【8】Core Tip: Salvage surgery after definitive chemoradiotherapy (dCRT) for T4 esophageal cancer is associated with a high incidence of surgery-related death and severe complication. In the present study, we have described the successful case of an unresectable locally advanced T4 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma treated by additional cisplatin plus 5fluorouracil chemotherapy after induction docetaxel, cisplatin and fluorouracil followed by dCRT. This case suggests that additional cisplatin plus 5fluorouracil chemotherapy could be one radical treatment option for residual esophageal squamous cell carcinoma after induction docetaxel, cisplatin and fluorouracil followed by dCRT to avoid salvage surgery, especially for high-risk patients.\n\n【9】   Citation: Yura M, Koyanagi K, Hara A, Hayashi K, Tajima Y, Kaneko Y, Fujisaki H, Hirata A, Takano K, Hongo K, Yo K, Yoneyama K, Tamai Y, Dehari R, Nakagawa M.

Suspected cases accounted for a large proportion in the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. The deviation of the nucleic acid test by throat swab (the current gold standard of COVID-19) caused by variation in sampling techniques and reagent kits and coupled with nonspecific clinical manifestations make confirmation of the suspected cases difficult. Proper management of the suspected cases of COVID-19 is crucial for disease control.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 65-year-old male presented with fever, lymphopenia, and chest computed tomography (CT) images similar to COVID-19 after percutaneous coronary intervention. The patient was diagnosed as having bacterial pneumonia with cardiogenic pulmonary edema instead of COVID-19. This was based on four negative results for throat swab detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay and one negative result for serological antibody of SARS-CoV-2 with the serological assay. Additionally, the distribution of ground-glass opacities and thickened blood vessels from the CT images differed from COVID-19 features, which further supported the exclusion of COVID-19.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】Distinguishing COVID-19 patients from those with bacterial pneumonia with cardiogenic pulmonary edema can be difficult.

Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis is a specific type of cerebrovascular disease caused by multiple etiologies of cerebral venous sinus or vein thrombosis that obstructs cerebral venous return and is associated with impaired cerebrospinal fluid absorption; this entity is rarely seen clinically. Spontaneous intracranial hy potension syndrome is one of the causes of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, and the probability of their combined occurrence is only 1%-2%. As such, it is easily overlooked clinically, thus increasing the difficulty of diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 29-year-old young woman presented with postural headache. Lumbar puncture suggested a pressure of 50 mmH <sub>2 </sub> O (normal 80 mmH <sub>2 </sub> O-180 mmH <sub>2 </sub> O), and magnetic resonance imaging cerebral venography suggested thrombosis of the supratentorial sinus. These findings were considered indicative of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis due to spontaneous intracranial hypotension syndrome after ruling out immunological causes, tumor, infection, abnormal coagulation mechanism, and hypercoagulable state, etc. She was treated with rehydration and low-molecular heparin anticoagulation for 15 d, and follow-up magnetic resonance imaging cerebral venography suggested resolution of the thrombus.

The clinical presentations of HE vary; however, myocardial fibrosis and thrombosis can threaten the lives of patients with sustained eosinophilia. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) in the setting of eosinophil-related diseases has seldom been reported. Here, we review the literature on HE with CVST to increase knowledge and encourage early diagnosis.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A previously healthy 41-year-old man was admitted to hospital with diarrhea and abdominal pain. He was treated with antibiotics for suspected acute colitis. Three days later, he experienced headache and vomiting. Brain computed tomography (CT) revealed thrombosis of the left jugular vein to the left transverse sinus vein.

Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imagings revealed a tumor, about 30 cm in diameter, occupied the right hepatic lobe and the peritoneal cavity. Abdominal angiography showed that the tumor was fed mainly by the cystic artery. We preoperatively diagnosed angiosarcoma of the gallbladder and performed tumor resection with cholecystectomy because the tumor was almost casplated, however the posterior wall of the gallbladder attached to the tumor firmly. Histologically, the tumor was composed of spindle cells including lipoblasts with cellular pleomorphism, which were also detected in the muscular layer of the gallbladder.

Disease progression can be delayed using enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). In patients with classic FD, sporadic accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) in the heart and kidney begins in utero ; however, until childhood, GL-3 accumulation is mild and reversible and can be restored by ERT. The current consensus is that ERT initiation during early childhood is paramount. Nonetheless, complete recovery of organs in patients with advanced FD is challenging.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】Two related male patients, an uncle (patient 1) and nephew (patient 2), presented with classic FD. Both patients were treated by us. Patient 1 was in his 50s, and ERT was initiated following end-organ damage; this was subsequently ineffective. He developed cerebral infarction and died of sudden cardiac arrest. Patient 2 was in his mid-30s, and ERT was initiated when the patient was diagnosed with FD, during which the damage to vital organs was not overtly apparent. Although he had left ventricular hypertrophy at the beginning of this treatment, the degree of hypertrophy progression was limited to a minimal range after > 18 years of ERT.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】We obtained discouraging ERT outcomes for older patients but encouraging outcomes for younger adults with classic FD.\n\n【7】Key Words: Enzyme replacement therapy , Fabry disease , Pedigree , Left ventricular hypertrophy , α-galactosidase , Case report\n\n【8】Core Tip: Fabry disease (FD) is an inherited metabolic disorder, caused by a genetic mutation or decreased α-galactosidase activity in lysosomes. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is a promising treatment for FD. Few reports have compared the effect of ERT in older adult populations vs. that in populations in their 30s. Here we report the effect of ERT in an older adult and a patient in his mid-30s from the same FD family. We demonstrated that ERT is sufficiently effective for patients in their mid-30s if the major organs such as the brain, heart and kidney are not severely damaged.\n\n【9】   Citation: Harigane Y, Morimoto I, Suzuki O, Temmoku J, Sakamoto T, Nakamura K, Machii K, Miyata M.

Plasmablastic myeloma is an aggressive plasma cell neoplasm associated with poor outcomes. A small number of cases with gastrointestinal involvement is reported in the literature and therefore high index of suspicion is essential for avoiding delays in diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】Our aim is to present our experience of a 70-year-old patient with a secondary presentation of plasmablastic myeloma manifesting as unstable upper gastrointestinal bleeding and to review the literature with the view to consolidate and discuss information about diagnosis and management of this rare entity. In addition to our case, a literature search (PubMed database) of case reports of extramedullary plasma cell neoplasms manifesting as upper gastrointestinal bleeding was performed. Twenty-seven cases of extramedullary plasmacytoma (EMP) involving the stomach and small bowel presenting with upper gastrointestinal bleeding were retrieved. The majority of patients were males (67%). The average age on diagnosis was 62.7 years. The most common site of presentation was the stomach (41%), followed by the duodenum (15%). The most common presenting complaint was melena (44%). In the majority of cases, the EMPs were a secondary manifestation (63%) at the background of multiple myeloma (26%), plasmablastic myeloma (7%) or high-grade plasma cell myeloma (4%). Oesophagogastroscopy was the main diagnostic modality and chemotherapy the preferred treatment option for secondary EMPs.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】Despite their rare presentation, upper gastrointestinal EMPs should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with gastrointestinal bleeding especially in the presence of systemic haematological malignancy.\n\n【7】Key Words: Gastrointestinal bleeding , Extramedullary plasma cell neoplasm , Plasmablastic myeloma , Multiple myeloma , Extramedullary plasmacytoma , Case report\n\n【8】Core tip: The involvement of gastrointestinal tract by plasma cell neoplasms and the manifestation as gastrointestinal bleeding is very rare. However, patients can be profoundly unstable on presentation requiring immediate diagnosis and intervention. As the existing literature is very scattered and it mainly consists of case reports, we are aiming with our present work not only to describe our experience but also to review, consolidate and discuss information about diagnosis and management of this rare cause of gastrointestinal bleeding. The management these patients requires a multidisciplinary team approach and should involve not only the gastroenterology and surgical teams but also haematology and oncology teams for achievement of the best possible outcomes.\n\n【9】   Citation: Iosif E, Rees C, Beeslaar S, Shamali A, Lauro R, Kyriakides C.
