High fluorodeoxyglucose uptake was detected in lymph nodes in the portacaval space, but distant metastasis was not seen by positron emission tomography. Ultrasound-guided needle biopsy of the GB neoplasm was suggestive of high-grade NEC. Because of the functional characteristics of poorly differentiated NEC, _en bloc_ cholecystectomy, resection of hepatic segments IVb and V, pancreaticoduodenectomy, and regional lymphadenectomy were performed.

This disease is characterized by the accumulation of BCAAs and corresponding branched-chain ketoacids of leucine, isoleucine, and valine in the plasma, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid. However, the mechanisms of MSUD-induced brain damage remain poorly defined. The accumulation of BCAAs in the brain inhibits the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase and α-ketoglutarate, disrupting the citric acid cycle and consequently impacting the synthesis of amino acids, causing cerebral edema and abnormal myelination.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】We report three neonates admitted to our hospital with the classic subtype of MSUD. All three patients, with a transient normal period, presented with poor feeding, vomiting, poor weight gain, and increasing lethargy after birth. Laboratory testing revealed metabolic acidosis. The serum tandem mass spectrometry amino acid profile showed elevated plasma levels of BCAAs (leucine, isoleucine, and valine). Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) presented abnormal signals mainly involving the globus pallidus, thalamus, internal capsule, brainstem, and cerebellar white matter, which represent the typical myelinated areas in normal full-term neonates.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】In our patients, MRI showed typical features, in concordance with the available literature.

Case 2 was a 10-year-old girl who had a history of NB for 6 years. Both of them presented with symptoms of nasal and sinus masses such as epistaxis or discharge from the nose. The radiologic imaging results revealed masses in the nasal cavity or nasopharynx in both cases and a mass in the right adrenal gland of case 1. The pathologic examination of biopsy samples of their nasal masses revealed “small round blue-cell tumor” along with abundant vascular fibrous septa. The tumor cells expressed synaptophysin, cluster of differentiation 56, chromogranin A, paired like homeobox protein 2B and a very high Ki67 index in both case but were negative for vimentin, desmin, leucocyte common antigen and cytokeratin. Myelocytomatosis viral related oncogene, neuroblastoma derived (MYCN) amplification was detected in both cases.

To our knowledge, this is the first report on simultaneously occurring dose-related adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of balance disorder, asthenia, peripheral edema, and constipation in an elderly patient after pregabalin.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 76-year-old female with a history of postherpetic neuralgia was prescribed pregabalin (300 mg daily). After taking pregabalin for 7 d, the patient developed balance disorder, weakness, peripheral pitting edema (2+), and constipation. On days 8-14, the pregabalin dose was reduced to 150 mg/d based on creatinine clearance. The patient’s peripheral edema improved significantly with the disappearance of all other adverse symptoms. On day 15, the pregabalin dose was increased to 225 mg/d to relieve pain. Unfortunately, the symptoms mentioned earlier gradually reappeared after 1 wk of pregabalin treatment. However, the complaints were not as severe as when taking 300 mg/d pregabalin.

Upon fiberoptic bronchoscopy, an endobronchial pedunculated polypoid was discovered without submucosal involvement. As the neoplasm was confined to the bronchus, interventional bronchoscopy was performed to remove the mass by high-frequency electric knife and laser resection. Tissue was sampled and histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of low-grade MEC. As the proliferation index was low, no further treatment was given. During 2 years of follow-up, the patient’s condition was good and no relapse was discovered under fluorescence bronchoscopy or CT scan.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】Interventional bronchoscopy can be considered for treatment of low-grade bronchial MEC, with few complications and preserved lung function.\n\n【7】**Key Words:** Mucoepidermoid carcinoma , Interventional bronchoscopic therapy , Intraluminal nodule , Airway tumor , Bronchoscopy , Case report\n\n【8】  \n\n【9】**Core Tip:** At present, surgery is still the mainstay of treatment for primary pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC), although it will cause significant trauma and loss of lung function. We report a case with MEC in the bronchus intermedius who received interventional bronchoscopy to remove the mass successfully. Our results indicate the effectiveness and safety of the interventional bronchoscopic therapy in the treatment of low-grade bronchial MEC.\n\n【10】* * *\n\n【11】*   **Citation:** Ding YM, Wang Q. Endoscopic resection of bronchial mucoepidermoid carcinoma in a young adult man: A case report and review of literature. _World J Clin Cases_ 2022; 10(32): 11921-11928\n*   **URL:** https://www.wjgnet.com/2307-8960/full/v10/i32/11921.htm\n*   **DOI:** https://dx.doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v10.i32.11921\n\n【12】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "wjcc_case", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

RA often causes damage to multiple organs and systems within the body, including the blood hemostasis system. Few reports have focused on acquired coagulation dysfunction resulting from vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor deficiency associated with RA.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 64-year-old woman with a history of RA presented to our hospital, complaining of painless gross hematuria for 2 wk. Blood coagulation function tests showed increased prothrombin time, international normalized ratio, and activated partial thromboplastin time. Abnormal blood coagulation factor (F) activity was detected (FII, 7.0%; FV, 122.0%; and FX, 6.0%), indicating vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor deficiency. Thromboelastography and an activated partial thromboplastin time mixed correction experiment also suggested decreased coagulation factor activity. Clinically, the patient was initially diagnosed with hematuria, RA, and vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor deficiency. The patient received daily intravenous administration of vitamin K1 20 mg, etamsylate 3 g, and vitamin C 3000 mg for 10 d. Concurrently, oral leflunomide tablets and prednisone were administered for treatment of RA. After the treatment, the patient's symptoms improved markedly and she was discharged on day 12. There were no hemorrhagic events during 18 mo of follow- up.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】RA can result in vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor deficiency, which leads to acquired coagulation dysfunction. Vitamin K1 supplementation has an obvious effect on coagulation dysfunction under these circumstances.\n\n【7】**Key Words:** Acquired coagulation dysfunction , Rheumatoid arthritis , Coagulation factor deficiency , Vitamin K-dependent , Case report\n\n【8】  \n\n【9】**Core Tip:** Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease that frequently involves multiple organs and systems, potentially leading to coagulation dysfunction. In this paper, we report the rare case of a patient who was diagnosed with acquired coagulation dysfunction resulting from vitamin K-dependent coagulation factor deficiency associated with RA, and subsequently benefited from vitamin K1 supplementation treatment.

To our knowledge, no more than 4 cases of appendico-vesicocolonic fistulas have been publicly reported throughout the world, and no more than 100 cases of appendiceal-colonic fistulas have been reported. Although the overall incidence is low, an early diagnosis is difficult due to their atypical initial symptoms, but these diseases still require our attention.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】Here, we report a case of a 77-year-old male patient diagnosed with an appendico-vesicocolonic fistula combined with an appendiceal-colonic fistula. The main manifestations were diarrhea and urine that contained fecal material. The diagnosis was confirmed by multiple laboratory and imaging examinations. A routine urinalysis showed red blood cells and white blood cells. Abdominal and pelvic computed tomography scans showed close adhesions between the bowels and the bladder, and fistulas could be seen. Colonoscopy and cystoscopy and some other imaging examinations clearly showed fistulas. The preoperative diagnoses were a colovesical fistula and an appendiceal-colonic fistula. The fistulas were repaired by laparoscopic surgical treatment. The diseased bowel and part of the bladder wall were removed, followed by a protective ileostomy. The postoperative diagnosis was an appendico-vesicocolonic fistula combined with an appendiceal-colonic fistula, and the pathology suggested inflammatory changes. The patient recovered well after surgery, and all his symptoms resolved.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】The final diagnosis in this case was a double fistula consisting of an appendico-vesicocolonic fistula combined with an appendiceal-colonic fistula.\n\n【7】**Key Words:** Appendico-vesicocolonic , Appendiceal-colonic , Enterovesical , Fistula , Laparoscopic surgery , Case report\n\n【8】  \n\n【9】**Core Tip:** Appendico-vesicocolonic fistulas and appendicovesical fistulas are rare diseases involving the intestine and urinary bladder.

A 74-year-old man was referred to another hospital with melena. Endoscopic examination revealed a localized ulcerative lesion at the gastrojejunal anastomosis. The diagnosis by endoscopic biopsy was neuroendocrine carcinoma. A total gastrectomy of the remnant stomach with D2 lymphadenectomy was performed at our hospital. The lesion invaded the subserosa, and metastasis was found in two of nine the lymph nodes retrieved. The lesion was positive for synaptophysin and chromogranin A, and the Ki-67 labeling index was 60%. The diagnosis of neuroendocrine carcinoma of the gastric stump was confirmed using World Health Organization 2010 criteria. Subsequently, the patient underwent one course of adjuvant chemotherapy with the etoposide plus cisplatin (EP) regimen; however, treatment was discontinued due to grade 3 myelosuppression. The patient showed lymph node metastasis in the region around the gastrojejunal anastomosis in the abdominal cavity 7 mo post-surgery. He then underwent radiotherapy and platinum-based combination chemotherapy; however, the disease progressed and liver recurrence was observed on follow-up computed tomography at 16 mo post-surgery.

There are two main protocols: Premolars with only two thirds of the root or premolars with complete root development. Premolars with two thirds of the root completed remain vital and show complete pulp obliteration while premolars with closed apex require root canal treatment. The problem arises when the child is very young and the root of the donor premolar is developed for only one third. This case report describes the outcome of an autotransplantation of a lower first premolar with only a third of developed root to the anterior region. The donor tooth was extracted with his follicle and placed instead of tooth No. 21. For the first month esthetics was restored with a glass-fibers ribbon attached to tooth No. 11 and composite material. After a month, the crown erupted and was reshaped to mimic an incisor with composite. Orthodontic movement was performed after 5 mo, in order to alleviate the gingival contour. The final restoration was performed after 15 mo. Follow up showed full root development with normal mobility, continuous periodontal ligament and complete pulp obliteration. A multidisciplinary approach and meticulous preparation are necessary for a positive result in autotransplantation of premolars with only a third of root development to the anterior region and this case report show that this method can be performed in very young children.\n\n【2】**Key Words:** Autotransplantation , Dental trauma , Donor tooth root length\n\n【3】  \n\n【4】**Core tip:** Autotransplantation of a premolar to the anterior region has a success rate of more than 90% if the donor tooth has a developing root and pulp healing occurs. The only negative outcome is total obliteration of the pulp. This case report describe an autotransplantation of a lower first premolar with only a third of root length to the incisor area after a dental trauma that caused root resorption of a permanent upper left incisor, in a 8-year-old boy. Follow up of 15 mo showed full root growth and periodontal healing with normal mobility and obliteration of the pulp. The crown was restored using composite material to resemble the adjacent incisor.

We report the case of a tardive SDH in an oncologic patient who underwent VP for Myxoid Liposarcoma metastasis.

The condition is characterized by a malformed fetus (acardiac twin) without cardiac activities being perfused by a structurally normal one (pump twin) _via_ an artery-to-artery anastomosis in a reverse direction.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】We described the first case of TRAP to receive laser surgery in Vietnam. The 26-wk pregnancy was originally misdiagnosed in another hospital as MC twins with single intrauterine fetal death. Following admission to our center, the diagnosis was amended to a 26-wk TRAP sequence stage IIb. The acardiac twin was 7.5 cm at the longest length, the ratio of the weight of the acardiac twin to the weight of the pump twin was more than 90%, the pump twin showed fetal distress with absent diastolic flow in umbilical artery of pump twin, and the peak systolic velocity in the middle cerebral artery = 1.6 MoM. We performed emergency laser photocoagulation of the acardiac twin’s umbilical cord. After surgery, we suc cessfully maintained the pregnancy for 8 wk and ended it electively by cesarean section at 34 wk of gestation due to rupture of membranes.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】TRAP should be appropriately diagnosed and treated early to avoid complications of the pump twin.

To our knowledge, only 64 cases of pancreatic schwannoma have been reported in the English literature over the past 40 years. In this paper, we present a pancreatic schwannoma in a 59-year-old female. Ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed the tumor located in the pancreatic body; however, accurate diagnosis was hard to obtain preoperatively and a pancreatic cystadenoma was preliminarily considered. During laparotomy, the mass was found in the body of the pancreas. An enlarged gallbladder with multiple stones was also observed. We performed central pancreatectomy, end-to-side pancreaticojejunostomy and cholecystectomy. Notably, central pancreatectomy has been reported in only one case prior to this report. The gross specimen showed a mass with a thin capsule, 1.6 cm × 1.1 cm × 1.1 cm in size. Microscopic examination showed that the tumor was mainly composed of spindle-shaped cells with palisading arrangement and no atypia, which is consistent with a benign tumor. Both hypercellular and hypocellular areas were visible. Immunohistochemical staining revealed strongly positive results for protein S-100. Finally, the tumor was diagnosed as a schwannoma of the pancreatic body. Postoperatively, the patient recovered well and left the hospital 6 d later. During the 53-mo follow-up period, the patient remained well and free of complications.\n\n【2】**Key Words:** Pancreaticojejunostomy , Schwannoma , Pancreas , Central pancreatectomy , S-100\n\n【3】  \n\n【4】**Core tip:** Over the past 40 years, only 64 cases of pancreatic schwannomas have been reported in the English literature.

Subdural hematoma (SDH), a serious complication of SIH, may lead to neurological deficits. This report presents a case of SDH after spontaneous C1/2 CSF leakage, which was treated with a targeted epidural blood patch (EBP).\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 60-year-old man with no history of trauma was admitted to our hospital with orthostatic headache, nausea, and vomiting. Brain computed tomography imaging revealed bilateral, subacute to chronic SDH. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings were SDH with dural enhancement in the bilateral cerebral convexity and posterior fossa and mild sagging, suggesting SIH. Although the patient underwent burr hole trephination, the patient’s orthostatic headache was aggravated. MR myelography led to a suspicion of CSF leakage at C1/2. Therefore, we performed a targeted cervical EBP using an epidural catheter under fluoroscopic guidance. At 5 d after EBP, a follow-up MR myelography revealed a decrease in the interval size of the CSF collected. Although his symptoms improved, the patient still complained of headaches; therefore, we repeated the targeted cervical EBP 6 d after the initial EBP. Subsequently, his headache had almost disappeared on the 8 <sup>th </sup> day after the repeated EBP.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】Targeted EBP is an effective treatment for SDH in patients with SIH due to CSF leakage at C1/2.\n\n【7】**Key Words:** Cerebrospinal fluid , Chronic subdural hematoma , Epidural blood patch , Myelography , Spontaneous intracranial hypotension , Case report\n\n【8】  \n\n【9】**Core Tip:** Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage at C1/2 in spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is rare.

They are usually late manifestations of massive advanced malignancies. However, a small portion of acrometastases are indications of occult primary cancer. Here, we report an extremely rare case in which a scaphoid bone lesion was the initial manifestation and was found to be a metastasis from gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 57-year-old male patient presented with ongoing left wrist pain and swelling after trauma. He was initially misdiagnosed with infection of the scaphoid bone and treated with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs. Further radiographic investigations showed a scaphoid pathological fracture, indicating a metastatic tumor derived from the GEJ and/or right lung malignancies. Gastroscopy failed to identify the pathology of the mass at the GEJ, which grew in an exophytic pattern. A lung puncture biopsy was not performed because the patient refused the procedure. To relieve his wrist pain and obtain a definite pathology, we resected the scaphoid lesion. Based on the clinical and pathological results, the patient was finally diagnosed with multiple metastases of advanced GEJ adenocarcinoma. He underwent chemotherapy and died 6 mo after his initial presentation.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】Despite the rareness of the disease, orthopedic surgeons should consider the possibility of metastasis to the bones of the hand when patients complain of persistent and progressive pain in the hand.\n\n【7】**Key Words:** Hand metastasis , Scaphoid , Gastroesophageal junction cancer , Diagnosis , Case report\n\n【8】  \n\n【9】**Core tip:** Hand metastasis is very rare, especially when it is the first sign of an occult primary malignancy.

Due to its low incidence and the lack of specific symptoms, hand bone metastasis is easily misdiagnosed, leading to delayed treatment. A review of the literature provides a systematic understanding of the epidemiology, manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of metastatic carcinomas of the hand.

This paper presents a case of a GGT, exhibited both intraluminally and extraluminally growth that was removed by laparoscopy-gastroscopy cooperative surgery.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 52-year-old male presented with epigastric discomfort accompanied by a sense of fullness for 3 mo. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy identified a submucosal lump located in the gastric antrum. Endoscopic ultrasonography identified a 2.4 cm × 1.8 cm lump located in the gastric antrum. It originated from the muscularis propria and exhibited both intraluminally and extraluminally growth, with hypoechoicity on the periphery, hyperechoicity in the middle, and unclear boundaries. Computed tomography showed nodular thickening of 3.0 cm × 2.2 cm in the gastric wall of the gastric antrum, and after enhancement, the lesion exhibited obvious enhancement We suspected that it was a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (glomus tumor and schwannoma were not excluded) and planned to perform laparoscopy-gastroscopy cooperative surgery.

They are often mistaken as common gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), which means that they are difficult to diagnose preoperatively. Whereas laparoscopic resection can be performed in traditional surgery, it is difficult to accurately determine the location of the region growing into the cavity. Surgery is traumatic and invasive and can cause related complications. This paper presents a case of GGT that was removed by laparoscopy-gastroscopy cooperative surgery.

There are very few cases of this condition reported in the last decade and a lack of established treatment guidelines. While the exact etiology remains unknown, bile cast nephropathy is presumed to be secondary to multiple concurrent insults to the kidney including direct toxicity from bile acids, obstructive physiology from bile casts, and systemic hypoperfusion from vasodilation. Therapy directed at bilirubin reduction may improve renal function, but will likely need dialysis or plasmapheresis as well. We report our case of bile cast nephropathy and the therapeutic measures undertaken in a middle-aged male with chronic renal insufficiency that developed hyperbilirubinemia and drug-induced liver injury secondary to antibiotic use. He developed acute renal injury in the setting of rising bilirubin.

Unfortunately, misdiagnosis of the latter is common due to its insidious onset, atypical symptoms, and varied manifestations. We report here a case of bilateral posterior scleritis that presented with acute eye pain and intraocular hypertension, and was initially misdiagnosed as acute primary angle closure. Expanding the literature on such cases will not only increase physicians’ awareness but also help to improve accurate diagnosis.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 53-year-old man was referred to our hospital to address a 4-d history of bilateral acute eye pain, headache, and loss of vision, after initial presentation to a local hospital 3 d prior. Our initial examination revealed bilateral cornea edema accompanied by a shallow anterior chamber and visual acuity reduction, with left-eye amblyopia (> 30 years). There was bilateral hypertension (by intraocular pressure: 28 mmHg in right, 34 mmHg in left) and normal fundi. Accordingly, acute primary angle closure was diagnosed. Miotics and ocular hypotensive drugs were prescribed, but the symptoms continued to worsen over the 3-d treatment course. Further imaging examinations ( _i.e._ , anterior segment photography and ultrasonography) indicated a diagnosis of bilateral posterior scleritis. Methylprednisolone, topical atropine, and steroid eye drops were prescribed along with intraocular pressure-lowering agents.

The long-term prognosis of myocarditis is varied, and it fully recovers without leaving any special complications. However, even after recovery, heart failure may occur and eventually progress to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), which causes serious left ventricular dysfunction. In the case of follow-up observation, no clear guidelines have been established.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】We report the case of a 21-year-old woman who presented with dyspnea.

At the end of 2018, some children with such symptoms were admitted to our hospital. In this study, we aimed to assess two children with AFP and neurogenic respiratory failure associated with enterovirus D68 (EV-D68).\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】Two children admitted to our hospital presented with symptoms and imaging results different from those of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and hand, foot, and mouth disease. Their main symptoms were AFP and neurogenic respiratory failure. Magnetic resonance imaging showed severe inflammatory injury mainly to the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid samples were collected to assess for pathogens, including bacteria, tuberculosis, cryptococcus, herpes virus, and coxsackie virus, and the results were negative. At the beginning, the two cases were not assessed for EV-D68 in the nasopharyngeal, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid specimens. About 2 mo later, EV-D68 was detected in the stool sample of one of the cases. The symptom of AFP was caused by injury to the anterior horn cells at levels C5-L5 of the spinal cord, while neurogenic respiratory failure was at levels C3-C5.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】We should pay attention to the detection and diagnosis of EV-D68 and make efforts to develop antivirus drugs and vaccines.\n\n【7】**Key Words:** Infection , Enterovirus D68 , Flaccid , Paralysis , Neurogenic , Respiratory failure , Case report\n\n【8】  \n\n【9】**Core Tip:** This paper reports two pediatric cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) and neurogenic respiratory failure associated with enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) infection which rarely occur.

AFP was caused at levels C5-L5, while neurogenic respiratory failure was caused at levels C3-C5.

The syndrome predisposes patients to hypercoagulable states, including venous thromboembolism and pulmonary embolism (PE).\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 12-year-old girl with KTS was scheduled excision of verrucous hyperkeratosis in the left foot and posterior aspect of the left leg and left thigh and excision of a cutaneous hemangioma in the right buttock. After induction, the surgeon elevated the patient’s leg for sterilization, whereupon she experienced a massive PE and refractory cardiac arrest. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was performed after prolonged resuscitation, and she had a return of spontaneous circulation. After this episode, the patient was discharged without any neurologic complications.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】The mechanism of PE, a lethal disease, involves a preexisting deep vein throm bosis that is mechanically dislodged by compression or changing positions and travels to the pulmonary artery. Therefore, patients predisposed to PE should be prescribed prophylactic anticoagulants. If the patient has unstable vital signs, resuscitation should be started immediately, and extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be considered in settings with existing ECMO protocols, expertise, and equipment.

The feasibility of surgery is not certain, which is a contraindication according to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. The role of immunotherapy as a neoadjuvant therapy for ICC is not clear. We herein describe a case of ICC with lymph node metastasis that was successfully treated with neoadjuvant therapy.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 60-year-old man with a liver tumor was admitted to our hospital. Enhanced computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a space-occupying lesion in the right lobe of the liver. Multiple subfoci were found around the tumor, and the right posterior branch of the portal vein was invaded. Liver biopsy indicated poorly differentiated cholangiocytes. According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer disease stage classification, ICC with hilar lymph node metastasis (stage IIIB) and para-aortic lymph node metastasis was suspected. A report showed that two patients with stage IIIB ICC achieved a complete response (CR) 13 mo and 16 mo after chemotherapy with a PD-1 monoclonal antibody. After multidisciplinary consultation, the patient was given neoadjuvant therapy, surgical resection and lymph node dissection, and postoperative adjuvant therapy. After three rounds of PD-1 immunotherapy (camrelizumab) and two rounds of gemcitabine combined with cisplatin regimen chemotherapy, the tumor size was reduced. Therefore, a partial response was achieved. Exploratory laparotomy found that the lymph nodes of Group 16 were negative, and the tumor could be surgically removed. Therefore, the patient underwent right hemihepatectomy plus lymph node dissection. The patient received six rounds of chemotherapy and five rounds of PD-1 treatment postoperatively. After 8 mo of follow-up, no recurrence was found, and a CR was achieved.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】Neoadjuvant therapy combined with surgical resection is useful for advanced-stage ICC. This is the first report of successful treatment of stage IIIB ICC using neoadjuvant therapy with a PD-1 inhibitor.\n\n【7】**Key Words:** Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma , Lymph node metastasis , Neoadjuvant therapy , Immuno therapy , Chemotherapy , Surgical resection , Case report\n\n【8】  \n\n【9】**Core Tip:** At present, the objective remission rate of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) in the treatment of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients is approximately 20%. The development of more sensitive and efficient predictive methods will improve the benefits of ICC therapy in potential patients with advanced HCC and benefit patients who are suitable for ICC therapy. This will hopefully open up a new prospect of immunotherapy for liver tumors.

The inability to perform ultrasound-guided puncture and drainage to eradicate the primary disease may allow for the persistence of bacterial endotoxins and endogenous cytokines, exacerbating organ damage, and potentially causing immunosuppression and T-cell exhaustion. Therefore, the search for additional effective treatments that complement antibiotic therapy is of great importance.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 45-year-old critically ill female patient presented to our hospital’s intensive care unit with intermittent vomiting, diarrhea, and decreased urine output. The patient exhibited a temperature of 37.8 °C. Based on the results of liver ultrasonography, laboratory tests, fever, and oliguria, the patient was diagnosed with NMLA, sepsis, SA-AKI, and immunosuppression. We administered antibiotic therapy, entire care, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) with an M100 hemo filter, and hemoperfusion (HP) with an HA380 hemofilter. The aforementioned treatment resulted in a substantial reduction in disease severity scores and a decrease in the extent of infection and inflammatory factors. In addition, the treatment stimulated the expansion of the cluster of differentiation 8 <sup>+ </sup> (CD8 <sup>+ </sup> ) T-cells and led to the complete recovery of renal function.

Metastatic spermatic cord tumors are even rarer. Several studies have revealed that the most frequent primary tumors metastasizing to the spermatic cord and peritesticular tissues are neoplasms of the stomach and prostate. Furthermore, metastasis to the spermatic cord or epididymis may occur _via_ retrograde lymphatic and hematic routes. We present the case of a man with gastric cancer that metastasized to the spermatic cord and epididymis, with concomitant ipsilateral hydronephrosis after surgical resection and chemotherapy for his primary tumor.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 71-year-old man underwent total gastrectomy for pT4aN2 poorly differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma in December 2016. Two months after surgery, he received adjuvant chemotherapy with TS-1 from February 2017 to February 2018. Surveillance computed tomography (CT) was performed in June 2018, which did not reveal any sign of tumor recurrence. In November 2019, he presented with left lower quadrant abdominal pain and a palpable left inguinal-scrotal mass. CT revealed left mild hydronephrosis and a left scrotal mass measuring 4.0 cm × 1.7 cm. Tumor biomarkers, including alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (βHCG), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) were all normal. Renal and testicular echography showed left hydronephrosis and a left peritesticular soft tissue lesion with blood flow. Diagnostic ureteroscopy showed left lower ureter narrowing without an intraluminal lesion. A biopsy was obtained for the indurated spermatic cord and epididymis, which showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that the tumor was diffusely and strongly positive for homeobox protein CDX2. The features were consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma of a primary gastric tumor.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】In patients with a history of primary cancer, an inguinal mass of unknown cause with accompanying ipsilateral hydronephrosis may be a sign of distant metastasis from a primary tumor, especially of gastrointestinal origin.\n\n【7】**Key Words:** Case report , Epididymis , Gastric cancer , Krukenberg tumor , Male , Spermatic cord\n\n【8】  \n\n【9】**Core Tip:** Gastric cancer rarely metastasizes to the spermatic cord, but when it does, the prognosis is typically unfavorable.

Polycythemia is significantly associated with risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), which is further increased in case of a large pelvic mass and obesity. Here we report the surgical challenges in the case of an obese patient with a giant fibromatous uterus and associated polycythemia.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 42-year-old obese woman was referred to our department for treatment for a huge fibromatous uterus. She suffered of pelvic pressure and abdominal distension and reported severe dyspnea from several months. Laboratory analyses including hemoglobin (Hb) 19.2 g/dL and hematocrit (Hct) 59.7% were indicative of polycythemia. Arterial blood gas analysis showed arterial oxygen pressure (pO <sub>2 </sub> ) of 81.5 mmHg. Abdominal computed tomography confirmed a giant fibromatous uterus measuring 28.2 cm × 17 cm × 25 cm. To reduce the thromboembolic risk, the patient underwent low molecular weight heparin, phlebotomy twice before surgery, and we opted for a laparoscopic hysterectomy. The uterus weighed 5400 g and the histology confirmed a diagnosis of leiomyoma. We did not find increased erythropoietin levels in the supernatant of the myomatous uterine tissue. There were no complications. On postoperative day 1, the Hb and the Hct levels normalized to 13.3 g/dL and 41.7%, respectively. Arterial blood gas analysis after surgery showed a pO <sub>2 </sub> of 144.7 mmHg. These results suggested the diagnosis of myomatous erythrocytosis syndrome. The patient was discharged on the second postoperative day in very good condition with no symptoms.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】We believe this is the first reported laparoscopic hysterectomy in a patient with a giant uterus, polycythemia and obesity.

However, there are additional types of shock from unusual causes that are often undiagnosed. Here, we report the case of a patient who was initially misdiagnosed with hypovolemic shock, but exhibited persistent hypotension because of continuous fluid replacement and vasoactive drug administration, and was eventually diagnosed with hypopituitarism with crisis.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 73-year-old Chinese man was admitted to the neurosurgery department following injury caused by a heavy object with symptoms of anemia and high fever. He was transferred to the ICU on the fourth day after hospitalization because of hypotension and unconsciousness. Blood analysis indicated that the patient was suffering from anemia and thrombocytopenia. Ultrasonography showed that there was no apparent abnormality in the cardiac structure but there was mild tricuspid regurgitation. Computed tomography revealed that there were signs of hemorrhage at the right basal ganglia; accordingly, hypovolemic shock, possibly septic shock, was initially considered. Even after routine treatment for shock, the hypotension remained severe. The patient was again thoroughly examined to investigate the underlying cause.

PHPT can cause maternal and fetal complications in pregnant women. General anesthesia for non-obstetric surgery in pregnant women is associated with maternal hazards and concerns regarding long-term neonatal neurocognitive effects. Surgical removal of the lesion in mid-pregnancy is currently the primary treatment option for pregnant patients with PHPT. However, the blood calcium concentration at which surgery should be considered remains under discussion due to the risk of miscarriage.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 31-year-old nulliparous woman at 11 wk of gestation was admitted to our hospital for parathyroidectomy. The patient had a history of intrauterine fetal death with unknown etiology at 16 wk of gestation 1 year prior. Her blood test results showed that the serum calcium level was elevated to 12.9 mg/dL, and the parathyroid hormone level was elevated to 157 pg/mL. In a neck ultrasound, it revealed a 0.8 cm × 1.5 cm sized oval, hypoechoic mass in the upper posterior of the left thyroid gland, which was compatible with parathyroid adenoma. Superficial cervical plexus block (SCPB) for parathyroidectomy was performed. After surgery, the obstetrician checked the status of the fetus, and there were no abnormal signs.

Such chronic wounds are uneven and complex due to persistent abscess and ulceration. Without external intervention, they can easily result in local tissue necrosis or, in severe cases, large area tissue resection, amputation, and even death.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】This article describes the use of hydrogen to treat a 42-year-old female patient with a chronic wound on her left shoulder. The patient had a skin graft that involved implanting a dilator under the skin of her left shoulder, and then transferring excess skin from her shoulder onto scar tissue on her chest. The skin grafting was followed by two rounds of RT, after which the shoulder wound had difficulty healing. For six months, the patient was treated with 2 h of hydrogen inhalation (HI) therapy per day, in addition to application of sterile gauze on the wound and periodic debridement. We also performed one deep, large, sharp debridement to enlarge the wound area. The wound healed completely within 6 mo of beginning the HI treatment.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】After HI therapy, the patient showed superior progress in reepithelialization and wound repair, with eventual wound closure in 6 mo, in comparison with the previous failures of hyperbaric oxygen and recombinant bovine basic fibroblast growth factor therapies.

At present, the most widely used intestinal cleaner recommended at home and abroad is Polyethylene glycol (PEG). Intestinal cleansers can cause electrolyte disturbances and hyponatremia. However, hyponatremic encephalopathy due to hyponatremia induced by PEG solution, although rare, can lead to serious irreversible sequelae and even death.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】In this report, we discuss a case of neurological dysfunction due to hyponatremia, also known as hyponatremic encephalopathy, observed in a 63-year-old woman who underwent PEG-based bowel preparation for colonoscopy. She was eventually transferred to our intensive care unit for treatment due to her Glasgow Coma Scale score of 9/15 (Eye opening 2; Verbal response 1; Motor response 6) and abnormal laboratory tests.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】Physicians should be thoroughly familiarized with the patient's history before prescribing PEG for bowel preparation, and timely identification of patients with hyponatremic encephalopathy is essential as delayed treatment is associated with poor neurological outcomes. An intravenous infusion of 3% sodium chloride is recommended at the onset of early symptoms.

However, such cases of different initial and relapse manifestations have not been reported in myeloperoxidase (MPO)-AAV patients.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 52-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of headache. Laboratory findings indicated nephrotic range proteinuria and microscopic hematuria, serum creatinine of 243 μmol/L, anti-MPO antibody titer of > 400 RU/mL, and positive perinuclearantineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody. Renal biopsy showed pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis. The cerebrospinal fluid examination and brain magnetic resonance imaging did not show any abnormality. Therefore, MPO-AAV was diagnosed. Corticosteroids, plasma pheresis, and cyclophosphamide as induction therapy and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) as maintenance therapy were administered. The patient’s headache disappeared; serum creatinine returned to normal; complete remission of microscopic hematuria and proteinuria was observed.

Multisystem smooth muscle dysfunction syndrome (MSMDS) is a multisystem disease characterized by aortic and cerebrovascular lesions caused by _ACTA2_ gene mutations. There have been many reports of cardiac, pulmonary and cerebrovascular lesions caused by MSMDS; however, few studies have focused on seizures caused by MSMDS.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】Our patient was a girl aged 7 years and 8 mo with recurrent cough, asthma and seizures for 7 years. She was diagnosed with severe pneumonia, congenital heart disease, cardiac insufficiency, and malnutrition in the local hospital. Cardiac ultrasonography revealed congenital heart disease, patent ductus arteriosus (with a diameter of 0.68 cm), left coronary arteriectasis, patent oval foramen (0.12 cm), tricuspid and pulmonary regurgitation, and pulmonary hypertension. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography indicated stiffness in the brain vessels, together with multiple aberrant signaling shadows in bilateral paraventricular regions. A heterozygous mutation ( _c.536_ G>A) was identified in the _ACTA2_ gene, resulting in generation of _p.R179H._ Finally, the girl was diagnosed with MSMDS combined with epilepsy.

Despite its high mortality, an emergency liver transplantation nowadays forms an integral part in ALF management and has substantially improved the outcomes of ALF. Here, we report the case of a 32-year-old female patient who was admitted with grade IV hepatic encephalopathy (coma) following drug-induced ALF. We performed an emergency auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplantation with a “high risk” graft (liver macrovesicular steatosis approximately 40%) from a living donor. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 57 with normal liver function. Weaning from immunosuppression was achieved 9 mo after transplantation. A follow-up using CT scan showed a remarkable increase in native liver volume and gradual loss of the graft.

In the presented case of a young female with acute liver failure, the use of a “high risk” graft (partial liver with approximately 40% macrovesicular steatosis) resulted in an excellent short and long term outcome.

However, some cases are resistant or hyporesponsive to ESAs. Roxadustat is an oral hypoxia-inducible factor-prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor that stimulates erythropoiesis and regulates iron metabolism. Here, we describe a hemodialysis patient with refractory anemia who did not respond to traditional treatments and depended on blood transfusion for more than 1 year. After applying Roxadustat, the patient’s anemia improved significantly.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 44-year-old man was diagnosed with uremia accompanied by severe anemia with a hemoglobin (Hb) level ranging from 30-40 g/L.

The patient required approximately 600-1000 mL of red blood cell suspension every 15-30 d for more than 1 year. After accepting Roxadustat therapy, the patient’s anemia symptoms improved significantly; his Hb level gradually increased to 50 g/L, and no further blood transfusions were administered.

This was a case of unexplained peritoneal bile leakage following abdominal trauma in a patient without severe peritoneal irritation, which led to diagnostic difficulties. In particular, no obvious lesion was found after exploratory examination, so only a T-shaped tube was indwelling in the common bile duct. Isolated EHBDI was confirmed by postoperative T-tube angiography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, and mild common bile duct stenosis was found at follow-up. We believe this is a rare case that deserves to be summarized. Combined with a literature review, we summarize the injury mechanism, clinical manifestations and treatment strategies of solitary EHBDIs.\n\n【10】* * *\n\n【11】*   **Citation:** Zhao J, Dang YL, Lin JM, Hu CH, Yu ZY. Rare isolated extra-hepatic bile duct injury: A case report. _World J Clin Cases_ 2021; 9(20): 5661-5667\n*   **URL:** https://www.wjgnet.com/2307-8960/full/v9/i20/5661.htm\n*   **DOI:** https://dx.doi.org/10.12998/wjcc.v9.i20.5661\n\n【12】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "wjcc_case", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Isolated pancreatic metastasis from renal cell cancer (isPM-RCC) is extremely rare and may be difficult to differentiate from more common primary neoplasms. A history of nephrectomy is crucial for the diagnosis.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】We report the case of a 64-year-old Asian man who was diagnosed with a mass in the pancreatic head using computed tomography. He had no related symptoms, and his medical history was unremarkable, except for unilateral nephrectomy performed to remove a “benign” tumor 19 years ago. All preoperative imaging findings suggested a diagnosis of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. However, ultrasound-guided biopsy revealed features of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Re-examination of the specimen resected 19 years ago confirmed that he had a ccRCC. The pancreatic mass was resected and pathological examination confirmed isPM-RCC.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】Misdiagnosis of isPM-RCC is common because of its rarity and the long interval from resection of the primary tumor and manifestation of the metastasis. The history of the previous surgery may be the only clue.\n\n【7】**Key Words:** Renal cell carcinoma , Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor , Pancreatic meta stases , Case report\n\n【8】  \n\n【9】**Core Tip:** Pancreatic metastases derived from clear cell renal cell carcinoma are rare and can be maintained for a long time and progress until years later. It is easily confused with hypervascular tumors, such as pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pNET). We present a case of a pancreatic mass that had undergone nephrectomy 19 years ago. Due to the lack of medical records, the clinical and imaging findings were misdiagnosed as pNET due to a false medical history. Preoperative biopsy was performed prudently, resulting in a renal-derived tumor, consistent with the findings of the pathological section obtained from the previous surgery hospital.

However, CT findings of some lung contusions are similar to those of COVID-19, as shown in the present case.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 46-year-old woman was admitted to hospital for backache and foot pain caused by a fall injury 1 d before hospitalization. She was suspected of having COVID-19, since there was a confirmed COVID-19 case near her residence. But she had no fever, cough, chest tightness, difficult breathing, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, _etc_ . On physical examination, the lower posterior chest of both sides showed dullness on percussion and moist rales at the end of inspiration on auscultation.

Physical and laboratory examinations showed no obvious abnormalities. In order to confirm further the diagnosis, electronic endoscopy was performed and tissue biopsies were taken. Duodenal histopathology showed granuloma and necrosis. In-depth tuberculosis-related examination did not rule out tuberculosis, so we initiated treatment with anti-tuberculosis drugs.

We present here a case of a 76-year-old woman who was diagnosed with metastatic oncocytic thyroid cancer. A rearrangement of the _anaplastic lymphoma kinase_ ( _ALK_ ) gene within the thyroid tumor was found, and the patient started a daily treatment of crizotinib, a specific ALK inhibitor. After 4 mo, an unexpected complete metabolic response was observed. The efficacy of crizotinib in an _ALK_ \\-rearranged thyroid tumor is a promising therapeutic track and needs to be explored.\n\n【10】* * *\n\n【11】*   **Citation:** de Salins V, Loganadane G, Joly C, Abulizi M, Nourieh M, Boussion H, Belkacemi Y, Tournigand C, Kempf E. Complete response in anaplastic lymphoma kinase–rearranged oncocytic thyroid cancer: A case report and review of literature. _World J Clin Oncol_ 2020; 11(7): 495-503\n*   **URL:** https://www.wjgnet.com/2218-4333/full/v11/i7/495.htm\n*   **DOI:** https://dx.doi.org/10.5306/wjco.v11.i7.495\n\n【12】* * *", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "wjcc_case", "batch_name": "20240407", "version": "version1"}

Up to now, only 90 cases have been reported in the English language literature. This report describes a case of SFT of the liver misdiagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 42-year-old male had a two-year history of a gradually enlarging intrahepatic nodule. The preoperative imaging revealed a mass with a size of 2.7 cm × 2.3 cm located in the segment IV of the liver. The patient was subjected to the resection of the segment IV, such as the medial segment of the left lobe of the liver. The histological examination of the mass showed various spindled cells irregularly arranged in the stroma. The immunohistochemistry of this mass revealed a positive staining for CD34 and STAT6. The history of intracranial tumor and postoperative pathological results led to the diagnosis of SFT of the liver (SFTL) due to a metastasis from the brain.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】SFTL is an uncommon mesenchymal neoplasm that can be easily overlooked or misdiagnosed. The best treatment choice is the complete surgical resection of the mass. A regular follow-up after the surgery should be performed due to the poor prognosis of metastatic or recurrent SFT.\n\n【7】**Key Words:** Solitary fibrous tumor , Liver , Surgical treatment , Mesenchymal neoplasm , Metastasis , Case report\n\n【8】  \n\n【9】**Core Tip:** This article describes a rare case of liver mesenchymal neoplasm preoperatively misdiagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma.

We also review reported cases of exogenous endophthalmitis caused by _Enterococcus casseliflavus_ and discuss the clinical management and prognosis of this disease.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 43-year-old man with no previous visual problems complained of endophthalmitis in his left eye following injury caused by a pig. Visual acuity was light perception and B-ultrasonography revealed vitreous opacities with retinal detachment. He was treated with intravitreal vancomycin and ceftazidime after refusing vitrectomy. However, the vitreous opacities and retinal detachment deteriorated and he underwent vitrectomy 5 d post-injury. Intraoperatively, advanced rhegmatogenous and tractional retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy were observed. On postoperative day 5, vitreous cultures grew Gram-positive cocci identified as _Enterococcus casseliflavus_ . A 2-wk course of intravenous ampicillin and dexamethasone was commenced.

However, the effects of lenvatinib in uHCC patients with a tumor thrombus in the main portal vein and/or a high tumor burden (tumor occupancy more than 50% of the total liver volume), remain unclear, because these were set as exclusion criteria in the aforementioned trial.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 53-year-old man (case 1) and 66-year-old woman (case 2) with uHCC presented to us with a tumor thrombus in both the main portal vein and inferior vena cava, a high tumor burden accompanied by a tumor diameter greater than > 100 mm, and distant metastasis, with the residual liver function classified as grade 2A according to the modified Albumin–Bilirubin grading. We started both patients on lenvatinib. The therapeutic effect, as evaluated by the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, was rated as partial response in both case 1 and case 2 (at 8 wk and 4 wk after the start of lenvatinib administration, respectively). The therapeutic effect was sustained for 6 mo in case 1 and 20 mo in case 2.

However, cases of unilateral PPFE are scarce.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 75-year-old Korean male presented to our hospital with chronic dry cough and exertional dyspnea. The patient’s symptoms started 6 mo previously and had been gradually worsening. At the time of presentation, he felt dyspnea when walking at his own pace. Radiologic findings suggested PPFE, but the lesion was localized in the upper lobe of the right lung. After multidisciplinary discussion, a transbronchial lung biopsy in the right upper lobe revealed collapsed alveoli with parenchymal fibroelastosis, and elastic van Gieson staining demonstrated septal elastosis with intra-alveolar collagenosis, which met the histopathologic criteria of definite PPFE. After multidisciplinary discussion in an experienced interstitial lung disease center, we confirmed the diagnosis of unilateral PPFE.

However, given the large volume of procedures performed, awareness of the infrequent complications is essential. Perforation is an established complication of colonoscopy, and can range from 0.2%-3% depending on the series, population and modality of colonoscopy. Acute appendicitis after colonoscopy is an extremely rare event, and a cause-effect relationship between the colonoscopy and the appendicitis is not well documented. In addition, awareness of this condition can aid in prompt diagnosis. Relatively mild symptoms and exclusion of bowel perforation by contrast studies do not exclude appendicitis from the differential diagnosis for post-colonoscopy pain. In addition to the difficult diagnosis inherent to postcolonoscopy appendicitis, treatment strategies have varied greatly. This paper reviews these approaches. We also expand upon prior articles by giving guidance for the role of nonoperative management in these patients. This case and review of the literature will help to create awareness about this complication, and guide optimal treatment of pericolonoscopy appendicitis.\n\n【2】**Key Words:** Colonoscopy complications , Appendicitis\n\n【3】  \n\n【4】**Core tip:** The manuscript highlights a recent interesting case from our institution demonstrating appendicitis after colonoscopy, which was managed surgically.
