Only 8 cases have been reported in the literature. Concurrent occurrence of HCC and NEC in the liver is classified as combined type or collision type by histological distributional patterns; only 2 cases have been reported. Herein, we report a case of collision type concurrent occurrence of HCC and NEC, in which primary hepatic NEC was in only a small portion of the nodule, which is different from the 2 previously reported cases. A 72-year-old male with chronic hepatitis C was admitted to our hospital for a hepatic mass detected by liver computed tomography (CT) at another clinic. Because the nodule was in hepatic segment 3 and had proper radiologic findings for diagnosis of HCC, including enhancement in the arterial phase and wash-out in the portal and delay phases, the patient was treated with laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomy. The pathology demonstrated that the nodule was 2.5 cm and was moderately differentiated HCC. However, a 3 mm-sized focal neuroendocrine carcinoma was also detected on the capsule of the nodule. The tumor was concluded to be a collision type with HCC and primary hepatic NEC. After the surgery, for follow-up, the patient underwent a liver CT every 3 mo. Five multiple nodules were found in the right hepatic lobe on the follow-up liver CT 6 mo post-operatively. As the features of the nodules in the liver CT and MRI were different from that of HCC, a liver biopsy was performed. Intrahepatic recurrent NEC was proven after the liver biopsy, which showed the same pathologic features with the specimen obtained 6 mo ago. Palliative chemotherapy with a combination of etoposide and cisplatin has been administered for 4 months, showing partial response.\n\n【2】Key Words: Collision tumor , Hepatocellular carcinoma , Neuroendocrine carcinoma , Chronic hepatitis C\n\n【3】Core tip: Only 2 cases of collision tumor of hepatocellular carcinoma and primary hepatic neuroendocrine carcinoma involving the liver have been reported in the literature.

It is commonly misdiagnosed as condyloma accuminatum, verruca, and seborrheic keratosis. Since this lesion is benign, treatment is not necessary. However, it is often misdiagnosed, and patients are likely to undergo incorrect counseling and unnecessary treatment, causing undue burden to the patient. This study seeks to increase awareness of this rare condition to prevent future misdiagnoses.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 55-year-old man living with human immunodeficiency virus presented for anal cancer screening. His physical examination revealed a flesh colored papule at the anal margin. The initial differential diagnosis included molluscum contagiosum, anal condyloma, and basal cell carcinoma. The lesion was excised to obtain a definitive diagnosis and was discovered to be EA.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】EA is often misdiagnosed due to its similarity to other dermatologic conditions.

Herein, we describe a patient who presented with a solitary perianal EA and summarize the existing literature. EAs often present as pale papules in the genital region, trunk and extremities. EA is benign and cannot be spread to others, however they are commonly misdiagnosed as condyloma accuminatum, verruca, and seborrheic keratosis. Careful histopathological examination is necessary to obtain an accurate diagnosis and prevent unnecessary treatments. Although treatment of EA is not medically necessary, many patients prefer treatment, which can be accomplished with topical therapy or with excision.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>   Citation: Ginsberg AS, Rajagopalan A, Terlizzi JP.

Endometrial clear cell carcinoma cells were distributed in a solid nest, papillary, shoe nail-like, and glandular tube-like distribution. There was infiltrative growth, and tumor cells had clear cytoplasm and obvious nuclear heteromorphism. The cancer tissue was necrotic and mitotic. The cancer tissue invaded the right oviduct. The ipsilateral oviduct also had an adenomatoid tumor. The adenomatoid tumor was arranged in microcapsules lined with flat or cubic cells that were surrounded by smooth muscle tissue. The adenomatoid tumor cells were round in shape.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】Clear cell carcinoma of the endometrium can invade the oviduct and occur simultaneously with tubal adenomatoid tumors.

A 57-year old man visited our hospital for the treatment of decompensated chronic hepatitis B. Lamivudine was started in December 2001. Subsequently, serum HBV was negative for HBV DNA with seroconversion from HBeAg to anti-HBe and improvement of liver function. However, HBV DNA and HBeAg were again detected in September 2002. He was complicated by breakthrough hepatitis and admitted to our hospital in November for severely impaired liver function. Vidarabine treatment was started and serum HBV DNA and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) decreased transiently. However, after the start of α-interferon treatment, HBV DNA level increased and liver function deteriorated. He died 1 mo after admission. An analysis of amino acid sequences in the polymerase region revealed that rtM204I/V with rtL80I/V occurred at the time of viral breakthrough. After the start of antiviral treatment, rtL180M was detected in addition to rtM204I/V and rtL80I/V, and became predominant in the terminal stage of the disease. HBV clone with a high replication capacity may be produced by antiviral treatment leading to the worsening of liver function. Antiviral therapy for patients with breakthrough hepatitis in advanced liver disease should be carefully performed.\n\n【2】Key Words: Hepatitis B virus , Lamivudine , Polymerase , Interferon , Tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate\n\n【3】删除1:<u>   Citation: Suzuki Y, Yotsuyanagi H, Okuse C, Nagase Y, Takahashi H, Moriya K, Suzuki M, Koike K, Iino S, Itoh F.

We report the case of a 46-year-old woman with chronic, active collagenous colitis who either failed to achieve clinical remission or experienced adverse effects with the following drugs: loperamide, cholestyramine, budesonide, methotrexate and adalimumab. Due to the intractable nature of the disease and because the patient was having up to 15 watery bowel movements per day, she underwent a temporary ileostomy. Colonic biopsies were analyzed for mucosal cytokine protein levels before and during fecal stream diversion and after intestinal continuity was restored. Mucosal protein levels of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, IL-17 A, IL-23, TNF, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13 were all higher during active disease and decreased to non-detectable or considerably lower levels during fecal stream diversion. One month after the restoration of bowel continuity, when the patient experienced a relapse of symptoms, IL-2, IL-23 and IL-21 levels were again increased. Our results indicate that fecal stream diversion in this patient suppressed the levels of all cytokines analyzed in colonic biopsies. With the recurrence of clinical symptoms and histological changes after bowel reconstruction, the levels of primarily proinflammatory cytokines increased. Our findings support the hypothesis that a luminal factor triggers the inflammation observed in collagenous colitis.\n\n【2】Key Words: Microscopic colitis , Collagenous colitis , Luminex , Mucosal cytokines , Fecal stream diversion\n\n【3】Core tip: The pathophysiology of collagenous colitis remains poorly understood. We describe a patient with chronic, active collagenous colitis who either failed to achieve clinical remission or experienced adverse effects with all medications given; therefore the patient was treated with a temporary loop ileostomy. We analyzed cytokine protein production with Luminex assays in colonic biopsy tissues obtained before and during fecal stream diversion (FSD) and after intestinal continuity was restored. Because FSD leads to clinical and histological remission, this study protocol provided a unique opportunity to study cytokine dynamics during different stages of disease. We were thus able to demonstrate that FSD was followed by a decrease in the levels of nearly all cytokines and that the restoration of bowel continuity increased the levels of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin IL-2, IL-21 and IL-23.\n\n【4】删除1:<u>   Citation: Daferera N, Kumawat AK, Hultgren-Hörnquist E, Ignatova S, Ström M, Münch A.

Gastrointestinal schwannomas are rare and are most frequently reported in the stomach. They are usually asymptomatic and are difficult to diagnose preoperatively; however, endoscopy and imaging modalities can provide beneficial preliminary diagnostic data. There are various surgical options for management. Here, we present a case of a large gastric schwannoma (GS) managed by combined laparoscopic and endoscopic surgery.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 28-year-old woman presented with a 2-mo history of epigastric discomfort and a feeling of abdominal fullness. On upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and endoscopic ultrasonography, a hypoechogenic submucosal mass was detected in the gastric antrum: It emerged from the muscularis propria and projected intraluminally. Computed tomography showed a nodular lesion (4 cm × 3.5 cm), which exhibited uniform enhancement, on the gastric antrum wall. Based on these findings, a preliminary diagnosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumor was established, with schwannoma as a differential. Considering the large tumor size, we planned to perform endoscopic resection and to convert to laparoscopic treatment, if necessary. Eventually, the patient underwent combined laparoscopic and gastroscopic surgery. Immunohistochemically, the resected specimen showed positivity for S-100 and negativity for desmin, DOG-1, α-smooth muscle actin, CD34, CD117, and p53. The Ki-67 index was 3%, and a final diagnosis of GS was established.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】Combined laparoscopic and endoscopic surgery is a minimally invasive and effective treatment option for large GSs.\n\n【7】Key Words: Gastric schwannoma , Laparoscopy , Gastroscopy , Immunohistochemical staining , Operation method , Case report\n\n【8】Core Tip: Gastric schwannomas (GSs) do not have specific clinical and endoscopic characteristics. Therefore, preoperative diagnosis may be difficult, and they can be misdiagnosed as gastrointestinal stromal tumors. In addition, while laparoscopic resection is possible, it is difficult to determine the location of intraluminal tumors. In contrast, endoscopic resection is only suitable for small submucosal tumors. Here, we present a case of a GS excised using laparoscopic-gastroscopic cooperative surgery. Additionally, we performed a literature review on computed tomography findings and surgical interventions used in the management of gastrointestinal stromal tumors and GSs.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>   Citation: He CH, Lin SH, Chen Z, Li WM, Weng CY, Guo Y, Li GD.

No report has been issued on an SMT-like gastric cancer cured by endoscopic resection alone or on changes in the endoscopic features of this type of tumor over several years.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】We describe an exceptional case of a 53-year-old male with a 1.5 cm-sized SMT-like lesion covered by normal-appearing mucosa discovered by esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) at the gastric antrum. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) visualized a homogeneous, well-circumscribed hypoechogenic lesion arising from the second sonographic layer with associated subtle obliteration of the third sonographic layer. Initial endoscopic biopsy was negative for neoplasm. The patient refused to undergo an invasive procedure and was subsequently lost to follow-up. Three years after initial detection, EGD revealed the lesion had become markedly erythematous, and at 4 years after initial EGD it had increased in size to 1.8 cm and developed a central ulcer and a heterogeneous EUS echo. Finally, endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) was performed, and histopathologic examination revealed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma had minutely invaded the submucosal layer (invasion depth 169 μm) but without lympho vascular invasion and with negative resection margins. Fortunately, no additional surgical treatment was required. He has been followed for 4 years after ESD without any evidence of local or distant recurrence.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】This report describes an extremely rare case of early gastric cancer presenting as SMT that was cured by ESD after a treatment delay of 4 years and the endoscopic changes that occurred during this period.

The present case cautions that SMT-like gastric cancer should be included in the differential diagnosis when a hypoechogenic mass is detected in the 2 <sup>nd </sup> or 3 <sup>rd </sup> layer by endoscopic ultrasound, regardless of size and the absence of findings suggesting malignancy. When diagnosis is uncertain, invasive techniques such as diagnostic endoscopic mucosal resection or ESD, which can potentially be used for therapeutic purposes, should be considered and close follow-up is recommended.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>   Citation: Cho JH, Lee SH.

Pathological examination is the gold standard for the diagnosis of hepatic MS. There are different biological characteristics of different lesions and protocols for surgical treatment; therefore, we should pay attention to more information conducive to differential diagnosis in order to improve the preoperative diagnosis, and to choose an appropriate surgical approach.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>   Citation: Li J, Huang XY, Zhang B.

However, MAL division often fails, and success can only be determined intraoperatively. To overcome this problem, we performed endovascular CA stenting preoperatively, and thereafter safely performed pancreaticoduodenectomy. We present this case as a new preoperative treatment strategy that was successful.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 77-year-old man with a diagnosis of pancreatic head cancer presented to our department for surgery. Preoperative assessment revealed CA stenosis caused by MAL. We performed endovascular stenting in the CA preoperatively because we knew that going into the operation without a strategy could lead to ischemic complications. Double-antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) – which is needed when a stent is inserted – was then administered in parallel with neoadjuvant chemothe rapy (NAC). This allowed us to administer DAPT for a sufficient period before the main pancreaticoduodenectomy procedure while obtaining therapeutic effects from NAC. Subtotal stomach-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy was then performed. The operation did not require any unusual techniques and was performed safely. Postoperatively, the patient progressed well, without any ischemic complications. Histopathologically, curative resection was confirmed, and the patient had no recurrence or complications due to ischemia up to six months postoperatively.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】Preoperative endovascular stenting, with NAC and DAPT, is effective and safe prior to pancreaticoduodenectomy in potentially resectable pancreatic cancer.\n\n【7】Key Words: Pancreaticoduodenectomy , Celiac axis stenosis , Median arcuate ligament , Endovascular stenting , Pancreatic head cancer , Case report\n\n【8】Core Tip: Celiac axis stenosis (CAS), caused by the median arcuate ligament, is an anatomical anomaly that should be noted when performing pancreaticoduodenectomy. In this case, an endovascular stent was placed preoperatively to recanalize the stenotic celiac axis, allowing the patient to safely undergo radical surgery without concern for intraoperative organ perfusion. The point to be highlighted with this preoperative strategy, was the use of double-antiplatelet therapy following endovascular stenting, during the interval when for neoadjuvant chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer (PC), thus providing a rational and effective combination of the two preoperative treatments for patients with PC and CAS.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>   Citation: Yoshida E, Kimura Y, Kyuno T, Kawagishi R, Sato K, Kono T, Chiba T, Kimura T, Yonezawa H, Funato O, Kobayashi M, Murakami K, Takagane A, Takemasa I.

Magnetic resonance imaging showed infected pancreatic cysts connected to the stomach with a fistula from the splenic hilum to the caudal portion of the liver’s lateral segment. An endoscopic retrograde pancreatography was performed; the guide wires could not pass through the stones in the pancreas and therefore, drainage of the main pancreatic duct was not achieved. Next, a distal pancreatomy and splenectomy were performed; however, the pancreatic juice in the remaining parenchyma was blocked by the stones.

Occasionally, the tumors may arise in some exotic sites, including the head and neck region and the urogenital tract. Paraganglioma presenting as a primary rectal neoplasm has not been well described in the literature. Here, we report the first case of malignant paraganglioma arising in the rectum of a 37-year-old male. He presented to the clinic because of hematochezia with tenesmus. The anorectal digital examination and colonoscopic examination revealed a polypoid mass of the rectum, measuring approximately 4 cm in diameter. The overall morphology and immunophenotype were consistent with a typical paraganglioma. However, the tumor exhibited features suggestive of malignant potential, including local extension into adjacent adipose tissue, nuclear pleomorphism, confluent tumor necrosis, vascular invasion and metastases to regional lymph nodes. In conclusion, we present the first case of rectal malignant paraganglioma. Due to the unexpected occurrence in this region, malignant paraganglioma may be misdiagnosed as other tumors with overlapping features; in particular, a neuroendocrine tumor of epithelial origin.

HC has been described in various organs; however, HC of the pancreas is extremely rare. To our knowledge, only 38 cases have been reported. We present a case of HC of the pancreas in a 36-year-old male patient.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 36-year-old cachexic man with no significant past medical history was transferred to our hospital with a history of painless jaundice, elevated blood glucose and significant weight loss. Lab tests showed elevated serum transaminases, bilirubin and alpha-fetoprotein levels. Magnetic resonance imaging of the upper abdomen showed a diffusely enlarged pancreas, appearing “sausage-shaped”. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showed upstream ductal dilation secondary to stricture of the main pancreatic duct and the common bile duct, which were not visible. Immunohistochemistry of biopsied tissue from a percutaneous pancreatic biopsy showed tumor cell positivity for HepPar1, polyclonal carcinoembryonic antigen and CK19, suggestive of HC of the pancreas. The characteristics of 39 patients with HC of the pancreas were reviewed.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】HC of the pancreas is more prevalent in males, and patients have a median age of 57 years.

Although the benign nature has been known, complete surgical excision is the major treatment consensus because of its high recurrence rate. We report a rare case of GMC with accompanying lower urinary tract symptoms and repeated urine retention initially thought to be symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia, which was treated with robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 65-year-old man presented with a 2-year history of lower urinary tract symptoms that had deteriorated gradually within the previous six months, even though he had received treatment with a selective alpha-blocking agent. He had undergone two transurethral resections of the prostate (TURP) at a local hospital during a 4-mo interval because initial ultrasound imaging and prostatic core needle biopsy showed benign prostate hyperplasia. Upon the third recurrence, the patient underwent TURP with a green-light laser at our institution. The diagnosis was a tumor composed of variously sized dilated glandular and cystic structures lined by blended prostatic type epithelia positive for prostate-specific antigen; the final diagnosis was giant multilocular cystadenoma. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large multilocular retrovesical mass 8.0 cm × 7.3 cm × 6.4 cm, with heterogeneous enhancement. A coexisting malignant part could not be excluded.

IPMN associated with malignant IPNB is extremely rare and only nine cases have been reported in the literature.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】We report a 52-year-old man who presented with recurrent cholangitis for nine months. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography showed the common bile duct stricture with dilated pancreatobiliary duct without other abnormal findings. The underlying pathogenesis could not be identified based on the radiologic images. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography revealed a pancreatobiliary fistula with dilated main pancreatic duct, biliary stricture with dilated biliary tree, and mucus discharge from the enlarged orifice of the major papilla. The patient underwent SpyGlass cholangiopancreatoscopy due to a suspected mucin-producing biliary neoplasm and indeterminate main pancreatic duct dilatation. Multiple papillary growing neoplasms with vascular images, with the extent of lesions spreading in the biliopancreatic ductal lumens, were identified by SpyGlass.

Its common causes include primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease, ACTH-independent macronodular adrenal hyperplasia, and bilateral adrenocortical adenomas (BAAs) or carcinomas. BAAs causing ACTH-independent CS are rare; up to now, fewer than 40 BAA cases have been reported. The accurate diagnosis and evaluation of BAAs are critical for determining optimal treatment options. Adrenal vein sampling (AVS) is a good way to diagnose ACTH-independent CS.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 31-year-old woman had a typical appearance of CS. The oral glucose tolerance test showed impaired glucose tolerance and obviously increased insulin and C-peptide levels. Her baseline serum cortisol and urine free cortisol were elevated and did not show either a circadian rhythm or suppression with dexamethasone administration. The peripheral 1-deamino-8-D-arginine-vasopressin (DDVAP) stimulation test showed a delay of the peak level, which was 1.05 times as high as the baseline level. Bilateral AVS results suggested the possibility of BAAs. Abdominal computed tomography showed bilateral adrenal adenomas with atrophic adrenal glands (right: 3.1 cm × 2.0 cm × 1.9 cm; left: 2.2 cm × 1.9 cm × 2.1 cm). Magnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary gland demonstrated normal findings. A left adenomectomy by retroperitoneoscopy was performed first, followed by resection of the right-side adrenal mass 3 mo later. Biopsy results of both adenomas showed cortical tumors. Evaluations of ACTH and cortisol showed a significant decrease after left adenomectomy but could still not be suppressed, and the circadian rhythm was absent. Following bilateral adenomectomy, this patient has been administered with prednisone until now, all of her symptoms were alleviated, and she had normal blood pressure without edema in either of her lower extremities.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】BAAs causing ACTH-independent CS are rare. AVS is of great significance for obtaining information on the functional state of BAAs before surgery.\n\n【7】Key Words: Bilateral adrenocortical adenomas , Adrenocorticotropic hormone-independent Cushing’s syndrome , Adrenal venous sampling , Case report\n\n【8】Core tip: Bilateral adrenocortical adenomas (BAAs) causing adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-independent Cushing syndrome (CS) are rare; up to now, fewer than 40 BAA cases have been reported. The accurate diagnosis and evaluation of BAAs are critical for determining optimal treatment options. We report a rare case of BAAs causing ACTH-independent CS, which was diagnosed by adrenal vein sampling (AVS) and computed tomography before surgery. The patient underwent a bilateral retroperitoneoscopy adenomectomy and glucocorticoid replacement therapy. Our case indicates that AVS is of great significance for obtaining information on the functional state of BAAs before surgery.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>   Citation: Gu YL, Gu WJ, Dou JT, Lv ZH, Li J, Zhang SC, Yang GQ, Guo QH, Ba JM, Zang L, Jin N, Du J, Pei Y, Mu YM.

While cardiac sarcoidosis is found on autopsy in up to 25% of sarcoidosis cases, it is still underdiagnosed and is associated with a poor prognosis. Although the etiology of sarcoidosis remains unclear, an antigen triggered exaggerated immune response has been hypothesized. Early detection and prompt management of cardiac sarcoidosis remains pivotal.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 60-year-old female, with pulmonary sarcoidosis in remission, presented to the cardiology outpatient clinic for evaluation of weeks-long dyspnea on moderate exertion (New York Heart Association class II) that was relieved by rest. Submaximal exercise stress test showed multifocal ventricular extrasystoles, followed by a self-limiting torsades de pointes. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed nondilated and normotrophic left ventricle with basoseptal and mid-septal dyskinesis. The magnetic resonance imaging-derived left ventricular ejection fraction was 45%. Delayed enhancement showed patchy transmural fibrosis of the septum and hyperenhancement of the papillary muscles, all in favor of extensive cardiac involvement of sarcoidosis. A double-chamber implantable cardiac defibrillator was implanted, and methylprednisolone (12 mg/d) and methotrexate (12.5 mg/wk) treatment was initiated. Follow-up and implantable cardiac defibrillator interrogation showed episodes of asymptomatic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and an asymptomatic episode of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia ending by the first antitachycardia pacing run.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】Along an extensive review of the literature, this unusual case report highlights the importance of early detection of cardiac involvement of sarcoidosis, in order to avoid potential complications and increase survival.\n\n【7】Key Words: Sarcoidosis , Cardiac sarcoidosis , Torsades de pointes , Ventricular tachycardia , Immunotherapy , Case report\n\n【8】Core tip: Cardiac sarcoidosis (CS) remains an underdiagnosed illness bearing a poor prognosis.

We report a rare case of paracoccidioidomycosis in the pancreas. A 45-year-old man was referred to our institution with a 2-mo history of epigastric abdominal pain that was not diet-related, with night sweating, inappetence, weight loss, jaundice, pruritus, choluria, and acholic feces, without signs of sepsis or palpable tumors. Abdominal ultrasonography (US) showed a solid mass of approximately 7 cm × 5.5 cm on the pancreas head. Abdominal computerized tomography showed dilation of the biliary tract, an enlarged pancreas (up to 4.5 in the head region), with dilation of the major pancreatic duct. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy, and the surgical description consisted of a tumor, measuring 7 to 8 cm with a poorly-defined margin, adhering to posterior planes and mesenteric vessels, showing an enlarged bile duct. External drainage of the biliary tract, Roux-en-Y gastroenteroanastomosis, lymph node excision, and biopsies were performed, but malignant neoplasia was not found. Microscopic analysis showed chronic pancreatitis and a granulomatous chronic inflammatory process in the choledochal lymph node. Acid-alcohol resistant bacillus and fungus screening were negative.

In approximately 10%-15% of patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA), the disease phenotype is transformed into myeloid neoplasms following antithymocyte globulin plus cyclosporine-based immuno suppressive therapy. In some of these patients, myeloid neoplasms appear during or shortly after immunosuppressive therapy. Leukemic transformation in SAA patients during anti-tuberculosis treatment has not been reported.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A middle-aged Chinese female had a 6-year history of non-SAA and a 2-year history of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). With aggravation of systemic inflammatory symptoms, severe pancytopenia developed, and her hemoglobinuria disappeared. Laboratory findings in cytological, immunological and cytogenetic analyses of bone marrow samples met the diagnostic criteria for “SAA.” Definitive diagnosis of disseminated tuberculosis was made in the search for infectious niches. Remarkable improvement in hematological parameters was achieved within 1 mo of anti-tuberculosis treatment, and complete hematological remission was achieved within 4 mo of treatment. Frustratingly, the hematological response lasted for only 3 mo, and pancytopenia reemerged. At this time, cytological findings (increased bone marrow cellularity and an increased percentage of myeloblasts that accounted for 16.0% of all nucleated hematopoietic cells), immunological findings (increased percentage of cluster of differentiation 34+ cells that accounted for 12.28% of all nucleated hematopoietic cells) and molecular biological findings (identification of somatic mutations in nucleophosmin-1 and casitas B-lineage lymphoma genes) revealed that “SAA” had transformed into acute myeloid leukemia with mutated nucleophosmin-1. The transformation process suggested that the leukemic clones were preexistent but were suppressed in the PNH and SAA stages, as development of symptomatic myeloid neoplasm through acquisition and accumulation of novel oncogenic mutations is unlikely in an interval of only 7 mo. Aggravation of inflammatory stressors due to disseminated tuberculosis likely contributed to the repression of normal and leukemic hematopoiesis, and the relief of inflammatory stressors due to anti-tuberculosis treatment contributed to penetration of neoplastic hematopoiesis. The concealed leukemic clones in the SAA and PNH stages raise the possibility of an inflammatory stress-fueled antileukemic mechanism.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】Aggravated inflammatory stressors can repress normal and leukemic hematopoiesis, and relieved inflammatory stressors can facilitate penetration of neoplastic hematopoiesis.\n\n【7】Key Words: Aplastic anemia , Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria , Acute myeloid leukemia , Tuberculosis , Leukemic transformation , Case report\n\n【8】Core Tip: A Chinese female had a 6-year history of nonsevere aplastic anemia and a 2-year history of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. With aggravation of systemic inflammatory symptoms, severe pancytopenia developed, and her hemoglobinuria disappeared. Laboratory findings met the diagnostic criteria for “severe aplastic anemia.” Anti-tuberculosis treatment resulted in leukemic transformation after a short duration of hematological remission. This case study revealed that aggravated inflammatory stressors can repress normal and leukemic hematopoiesis, and relieved inflammatory stressors can facilitate penetration of neoplastic hematopoiesis, suggesting an inflammatory stress-fueled antileukemic mechanism.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>   Citation: Xiu NN, Yang XD, Xu J, Ju B, Sun XY, Zhao XC.

Multisystem smooth muscle dysfunction syndrome (MSMDS) is a multisystem disease characterized by aortic and cerebrovascular lesions caused by ACTA2 gene mutations. There have been many reports of cardiac, pulmonary and cerebrovascular lesions caused by MSMDS; however, few studies have focused on seizures caused by MSMDS.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】Our patient was a girl aged 7 years and 8 mo with recurrent cough, asthma and seizures for 7 years. She was diagnosed with severe pneumonia, congenital heart disease, cardiac insufficiency, and malnutrition in the local hospital. Cardiac ultrasonography revealed congenital heart disease, patent ductus arteriosus (with a diameter of 0.68 cm), left coronary arteriectasis, patent oval foramen (0.12 cm), tricuspid and pulmonary regurgitation, and pulmonary hypertension. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography indicated stiffness in the brain vessels, together with multiple aberrant signaling shadows in bilateral paraventricular regions. A heterozygous mutation ( c.536 G>A) was identified in the ACTA2 gene, resulting in generation of p.R179H. Finally, the girl was diagnosed with MSMDS combined with epilepsy.

Although the tumor can be located in any part of the human body, the most common locations are the head, neck, trunk and extremities. Pancreatic schwannomas are rare. To our knowledge, only 64 cases of pancreatic schwannoma have been reported in the English literature over the past 40 years. In this paper, we present a pancreatic schwannoma in a 59-year-old female. Ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed the tumor located in the pancreatic body; however, accurate diagnosis was hard to obtain preoperatively and a pancreatic cystadenoma was preliminarily considered. During laparotomy, the mass was found in the body of the pancreas. An enlarged gallbladder with multiple stones was also observed. We performed central pancreatectomy, end-to-side pancreaticojejunostomy and cholecystectomy. Notably, central pancreatectomy has been reported in only one case prior to this report. The gross specimen showed a mass with a thin capsule, 1.6 cm × 1.1 cm × 1.1 cm in size. Microscopic examination showed that the tumor was mainly composed of spindle-shaped cells with palisading arrangement and no atypia, which is consistent with a benign tumor. Both hypercellular and hypocellular areas were visible. Immunohistochemical staining revealed strongly positive results for protein S-100.

We report an unique case of a 63-year-old male who presented with massive haemorrhage from jejunal diverticula, which was successfully managed by initial resuscitation and defi nitive surgery.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 63-year-old male was admitted as an emergency with 6 h history of haema temesis and melena. The haematemesis appeared to be bright red, with volume exceeding 100 mL. The amount of melena was estimated to be 200 mL. Initially, the patient received fluid resuscitation and three unit blood transfusion. Then, in order to localize the bleeding sites, colonoscopy, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and mesenteric angiography were utilized but failed to identify the source of haemorrhage. Informed consent form was obtained for further treatment, and he was treated with an exploratory laparotomy and the bleeding site was successfully located during the procedure. He was diagnosed with JDH. The postoperative period was uneventful, and he was discharged on day 18 after surgery. No rebleeding occurred at the 1-year follow-up.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】In patients with gastrointestinal bleeding, if various techniques fail to identify the cause of haemorrhage in small bowel and haemodynamic instability is sustained with continuous resuscitation, we recommend surgical intervention should be the ultimate treatment of choice.\n\n【7】Key Words: Case report , Jejunal diverticular haemorrhage , Colonoscopy , Gastrointestinal bleeding , Surgical intervention\n\n【8】Core Tip: In patients with gastrointestinal bleeding, if all methods have failed to identify the cause of haemorrhage in small bowel and haemodynamic instability sustains with continuous resuscitation, we recommend surgical intervention as the ultimate treatment of choice for jejunal diverticular haemorrhage. Surgeons should strictly follow the diagnosis and treatment guidelines of acute gastrointestinal bleeding and have a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of various techniques, which would be extremely helpful for selecting the optimal clinical pathways and conducting multidisciplinary collaboration accurately and quickly.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>   Citation: Ma HC, Xiao H, Qu H, Wang ZJ.

Multiple primary cancer always presents as solid cancer or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) secondary to lymphoma. Here, we report a rare case of secondary peripheral T-cell lymphoma and AML after Burkitt lymphoma treatment.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 54-year-old female patient was admitted to our hospital complaining of edema on her left lower limb. Physical examination revealed multiple superficial lymphadenectasis on her neck and pelvis. Color ultrasonography examination showed multiple uterine fibroids and a solid mass at the lower left side of the abdomen. Pathological biopsy revealed Burkitt lymphoma. After three hyper-CVAD (A + B) regimens, she achieved complete remission. Two years later, lymphadenectasis reoccurred. A relevant biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, which was accompanied by gastrointestinal invasion and hemocytopenia. Meanwhile, bone marrow examination revealed AML. On the second day of scheduled treatment, she developed gastrointestinal bleeding, peptic ulcers, and hemorrhagic shock and was critically ill.

Here, we report the case of a 32-year-old female patient who was admitted with grade IV hepatic encephalopathy (coma) following drug-induced ALF. We performed an emergency auxiliary partial orthotopic liver transplantation with a “high risk” graft (liver macrovesicular steatosis approximately 40%) from a living donor. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 57 with normal liver function. Weaning from immunosuppression was achieved 9 mo after transplantation.

From this review of literature, we can see that most common types of migrated stents entailing bowel perforation are the plastic stents and the most common site of perforation is duodenum. A significant finding is the mortality after bowel perforation from biliary stent which is as high as 10.3%. The main treatment is surgical stent removal, but a growing body of literature shows that endoscopic removal and mucosal repair is feasible in select cases. This has still not been accomplished in the mid portion of the bowel.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>   Citation: Zorbas KA, Ashmeade S, Lois W, Farkas DT.

We present a case of a young adult survivor of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest as late KD sequelae.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 29-year-old man with presumed acute KD history at the age of 5 suddenly lost consciousness while jogging and was diagnosed a sudden cardiac arrest by an emergency doctor. After about 10 min cardiopulmonary resuscitation, return of spontaneous circulation was achieved, and the patient was transferred to our hospital. A coronary computed tomography angiogram and coronary angiography revealed extensive calcifications of left anterior descending and right coronary artery aneurysms. The patient was an active individual who took exercise regularly and claimed no previous symptoms of chest pain or shortness of breath on exertion. The most possible cause of his sudden cardiac arrest could be presumed as a thrombus within the coronary artery aneurysms. After that, a thromboembolism induced extensive ischemia, and this ischemia-induced arrhythmia led to a cardiac arrest.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】Few patients who suffer a late sequela of KD can survive from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

Different to the combined type, the two adjacent tumors of collision carcinoma are histologically distinct. Collision carcinoma may occur from any origin or organ, including the cecum, liver, cervix, thyroid, stomach, kidney, and esophagus. In the rectum, adenocarcinoma is the most common pathological type, the combined type is rare, and collision tumors are even rarer. To date, only a limited number of collision carcinoma cases originating from the rectum have been reported. Due to the scarcity of rectal collision carcinoma, more cases need to be reported to fully understand the clinico-pathological features and biological behavior of the tumor.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】Here we report a 40-year-old female who presented with the chief complaints of persistent changes in bowel habits and hematochezia for 10 d. She underwent Miles' operation which revealed a collision carcinoma of the rectum, showing a “side by side” pattern, composed of a high grade neuroendocrine carcinoma, (small cell carcinoma) and moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, based on its clinico-pathological features and biological behavior. The patient remained disease-free at 12 mo follow-up. We also focused on the related literature and expert opinion.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】Collision carcinoma is a rare tumor with ambiguous biological behavior.

We established a diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia, complicated with COVID-19 and septic shock, together with acute renal failure. He was admitted to the intensive care unit, to be treated with piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, and 6.6 mg per day of dexamethasone sodium phosphate, along with noradrenaline as a vasopressor, ventilator management, and continuous hemodiafiltration. His condition improved, and we finished the vasopressor on the fifth hospital day. We administered dexamethasone for ten days, and finished the course of treatment.

Successful treatment for AHA in solid cancer can be difficult because not only active hemorrhage management and inhibitor eradication but also treatment of the underlying malignancy is required.\n\n【4】删除1:<u>   Citation: Saito M, Ogasawara R, Izumiyama K, Mori A, Kondo T, Tanaka M, Morioka M, Ieko M.

Occasionally, it may be totally thrombosed, increasing the complexity of the procedure, as it should also be resected. The challenge is even greater when performing living-donor LT as the graft does not contain the retrohepatic IVC; thus, it may be necessary to reconstruct it.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 35-year-old male patient with liver cirrhosis due to BCS and hepatocellular carcinoma beyond the Milan criteria underwent living-donor LT with IVC reconstruction. It was necessary to remove the IVC as its retrohepatic portion was completely thrombosed, up to almost the right atrium. A right-lobe graft was retrieved from his sister, with outflow reconstruction including the right hepatic vein and the branches of segment V and VIII to the middle hepatic vein. Owing to massive subcutaneous collaterals in the abdominal wall, venovenous bypass was implemented before incising the skin. The right atrium was reached via a transdiaphragramatic approach. Hepatectomy was performed en bloc with the retrohepatic vena cava. It was reconstructed with an infra-hepatic vena cava graft obtained from a deceased donor.

What if a patient undergoes hysteroscopy accidentally during the early gestational period? We here report a rare case of a woman who continued pregnancy after a diagnostic hysteroscopy was performed in early pregnancy and delivered a healthy baby. The patient had a history of infertility and oligomenorrhea, probably due to a previous induced abortion. A hysteroscopy was performed after the end of her “menstruation” for assessment of her uterine cavity. Early pregnancy, instead of the expected intrauterine adhesions, was suspected, and the procedure was immediately ceased. Subsequent tests confirmed the diagnosis of pregnancy. She had a full-term delivery by elective caesarean section. The success of this case was attributed to the use of vaginoscopic techniques in hysteroscopy and correct judgment and decision-making during the procedure. This case report provides some useful methods and experience that might be helpful when a similar situation occurs in clinical practice.\n\n【2】Key Words: Gestation , Hysteroscopy , Livebirth , Ongoing pregnancy\n\n【3】Core tip: An intended pregnancy without any suspected abnormalities is a contraindication for hysteroscopy. Although hysteroscopy is often scheduled in the follicular phase, potential pregnancy is unavoidable, even in patients with a history of infertility. When the image under hysteroscopy is not so typical for a doctor to recognize and immediately confirm a state of pregnancy, gentle and careful operation along with appropriate measures can benefit the patients to the largest extent.\n\n【4】删除1:<u>   Citation: Zhao CY, Ye F.

Salpingectomy is proposed as a pretreatment before in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET) to reduce the risk of HP. HP after IVF-ET occurs in women who had already underwent bilateral salpingectomy, even though it is extremely rare.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A case of a 29-year-old woman with recurrent interstitial HP after IVF-ET following salpingectomy is presented. The main symptom was a sudden and worsening pelvic pain. Physical examinations revealed signs of peritoneal bleeding and irritation with stable vital signs. Transvaginal ultrasound showed a live intrauterine pregnancy and another live embryo with cardiac activity in the left cornu extending beyond the lateral edge of the uterus. Her hemoglobin concentration was 8.0 g/dL, and serum human chorionic gonadotropin value was 171116.9 mIU/mL. With the diagnosis of ruptured HP with internal bleeding, an emergency laparoscopic resection of left cornu was performed. The interstitial pregnancy was removed with caution to protect the intrauterine pregnancy. After the surgical treatment, the intrauterine pregnancy continued with no complications. A healthy baby was delivered by caesarean section at 39 wk. Outcomes of another three cases are further summarized.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】Post-salpingectomy HP is a rare but challenging condition.

This disease entity presents differentiation towards the fundic gland, especially chief cell-predominant differentiation (GA-FG-CCP). GA-FG-CCP easily invades into the submucosa but rarely shows metastasis. The reports mostly describe primarily single lesions. Herein, we report a case with multiple lesions, and summarize the clinicopathologic characteristics of multiple cases.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 55-year-old woman underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy screening. Two whitish lesions on the anterior wall of the gastric corpus and the gastric fundus were detected. The patient had previously received Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy.

We diagnosed the patient with multiple GA-FG (GA-FG-CCP) by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and immunohistochemical staining of the endoscopic biopsy. Upon performing endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), one lesion was not found, but the scar from the biopsy was visible; the mucularis mucosa of the biopsy and ESD-resected specimen were intact. The two lesions showed no lymphatic nor venous invasion.

Although needle-tract seeding caused by EUS-FNA has been recently reported, dissemination of pancreatic cancer cells is generally considered to be a rare complication that does not affect patient prognosis. However, the frequency of dissemination and needle-tract seeding appears to have been underestimated. We present a case of peritoneal dissemination of pancreatic cancer due to preoperative EUS-FNA.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】An 81-year-old man was referred to the Department of Surgery of our hospital in Japan owing to the detection of a pancreatic mass on computed tomography during medical screening. Trans-gastric EUS-FNA revealed that the mass was an adenocarcinoma; hence laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy with lympha-denectomy was performed. No intraoperative peritoneal dissemination and liver metastasis were visually detected, and pelvic lavage cytology was negative for carcinoma cells. The postoperative surgical specimen was negative for carcinoma cells at the dissected margin and the cut end margin; however, pathological findings revealed adenocarcinoma cells on the peritoneal surface proximal to the needle puncture site, and the cells were suspected to be disseminated via EUS- FNA. Hence, the patient received adjuvant therapy with S-1 (tegafur, gimeracil, and oteracil potassium); however, computed tomography performed 5 mo after surgery revealed liver metastasis and cancerous peritonitis. The patient received palliative therapy and died 8 mo after the operation.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】The indications of EUS-FNA should be carefully considered to avoid iatrogenic dissemination, especially for cancers in the pancreatic body or tail.\n\n【7】Key Words: Case report , Pancreatic carcinoma , Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration , Peritoneal dissemination , Cancerous peritonitis , Biopsy\n\n【8】Core Tip: Along with the development of preoperative chemotherapy, there is an increasing need for tissue sample collection using endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). Peritoneal dissemination and needle-tract seeding caused by EUS-FNA were previously considered rare events with minimal prognostic impact. However, we experienced a case of peritoneal dissemination of pancreatic cancer—secondary to EUS-FNA—that markedly affected postoperative survival.

On examination, the tooth was slightly rotated, with slight tenderness on percussion and grade I mobility but with no caries, pockets or restorations and non-vital pulp ( via vitality tests). Radiographic examination revealed unusual configuration of the tooth’s root canals, with an enamel-lined invagination extending to the apex, suggesting the possibility of DI Oehler’s type IIIB and a periapical radiolucency. Widening the access cavity lingually revealed one distinct buccal orifice and two distinct palatal orifices; under higher magnification of a dental operating microscope (DOM), the mesio-palatal and disto-palatal orifices were observed as connected by a C-shaped groove. The root canals were prepared with hand K-files following a step-back technique, and obturated using a combination technique of lateral condensation and vertical compaction.

The clinical manifestations of pheochromocytoma are diverse, and the typical triad, including episodic headache, palpitations, and sweating, only occurs in 24% of pheochromocytoma patients, which often misleads clinicians into making an incorrect diagnosis. We herein report the case of a patient with intermittent chest pain and elevated myocardial enzymes for 2 years who was diagnosed with pheochromocytoma.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 49-year-old woman presented with intermittent chest pain for 2 years. Two years ago, the patient experienced chest pain and was diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction, with 25% stenosis in the left circumflex. The patient still had intermittent chest pain after discharge. Two hours before admission to our hospital, the patient experienced chest pain with nausea and vomiting, lasting for 20 min. Troponin I and urinary norepinephrine and catecholamine levels were elevated. An electrocardiogram indicated QT prolongation and ST-segment depression in leads II, III, aVF, and V3-V6. A coronary computed tomography angiogram revealed no evidence of coronary artery disease. Echocardiography showed left ventricular enlargement and a decreased posterior inferior wall motion amplitude. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography demonstrated an inhomogeneous right adrenal mass.

Abdominal pseudocysts containing CSF are the common long-term complication of this frequently performed procedure, mainly because VP shunts have significantly prolonged survival. Of these, liver CSF pseudocysts are rare entities that may cause shunt dysfunction, affect normal organ function, and therefore pose therapeutic challenges.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 49-year-old man with history of congenital hydrocephalus status post bilateral VP shunt placement presented with progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion, abdominal discomfort/distention. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a large CSF pseudocyst in the right hepatic lobe with the tip of VP shunt catheter into the hepatic cyst cavity. Patient underwent robotic laparoscopic cyst fenestration with a partial hepatectomy, and repositioning of VP shunt catheter to the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. Follow-up CT demonstrated a significant reduction in hepatic CSF pseudocyst.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】A high index of clinical suspicion is required for early detection of liver CSF pseudocysts since their presentation is often asymptomatic and cunning early in the course. Late-stage liver CSF pseudocysts could have adverse outcomes on the treatment course of hydrocephalus as well as on hepatobiliary dysfunction. There is paucity of data to define the management of liver CSF pseudocyst in current guidelines due to rare nature of this entity. The reported occurrences have been managed by laparotomy with debridement, paracentesis, radiological imaging guided fluid aspiration and laparoscopic-associated cyst fenestration.

The majority of patients are asymptomatic in early stages, however, as the size of the liver CSF pseudocyst increases this may result in ineffective drainage of CSF, thereby aggravating hydrocephalus symptoms.

The exact nature of SPA is unclear, but its tumor nature has recently been proposed. Although SPA has a good prognosis after adequate surgery, atypical lesions might occur, ranging from mild dysplasia to carcinoma in situ in some cases. To the best of our knowledge, only five cases of SPA in the submandibular gland have been reported to date. Here, we present two new cases of SPA involving the submandibular gland.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 50-year-old woman and a 52-year-old woman were referred to Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, China, with complaints of moderate pain, recurrent swelling, and a mass in the submandibular area. After admission, the two cases of the submandibular mass were examined physically. The boundary of the submandibular tumor was clear, and the range of motion was good. After preoperative examinations, surgery was performed on a selective basis. Postoperative histopathological examination revealed a well-defined mass with acinar structures, ducts, or cystic dilated glands of various sizes scattered in a large number of proliferative sclerosing stroma.

Upon examination, labial adhesions were observed with nearly-complete labial fusion with a pinpoint opening. Bacteriuria was detected in urine analysis, and the urine culture test was positive for Escherichia coli . Therefore, a parenteral antibiotic (Fosfomycin) and topical estrogen cream were administered. However, since the adhesion did not separate after 2 wk of treatment, surgical correction was performed. First, adhesiolysis was conducted with a blunt instrument. Then, hysteroscopy and cystoscopy were performed. Hysteroscopic findings showed no abnormalities of the endometrium and endocervix, and the cystoscopic results were also normal. Finally, labiaplasty was completed to prevent adhesion recurrence. One month after the surgery, the discomfort while urinating was eliminated and the adhesion did not recur.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】Labial adhesions in postmenopausal women cannot be successfully treated with estrogen creams, and surgical treatment should be considered.\n\n【7】Key Words: Post menopause , Genitalia, female , Cystitis , Gynecologic Surgical Procedures , Atrophy , Urinary Retention , Case report\n\n【8】Core Tip: Labial adhesions have a prevalence of approximately 1.8% in infants aged 13-23 mo, however, but they are rarely found in adult women, especially in women of reproductive age. Few cases have been reported in postmenopausal women. Labial adhesion is caused by various inflammatory diseases and estrogen deficiency. The beginning of adhesion occurs most frequently around the clitoris, and depending on the extent of the adhesion, it is classified as complete or partial type.

They can occur almost anywhere, although the most common locations are the head, neck and extremities. Primary benign schwannoma of the hepatoduodenal ligament is rare. To date, only three cases have been reported in the English literature. In the present study, we report a case of hepatoduodenal ligament schwannoma in a 43-year-old male, who was admitted to our hospital because of a abdominal mass found by physical examination. It was hard to determine the definitive location and diagnosis of the mass using ultrasound, computed tomography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography. During laparotomy, the mass was found in the hepatoduodenal ligament and close to the cholecystic duct, so we resected the gallbladder and cholecystic duct along with the mass. The gross specimen revealed an 8.5 cm × 5.5 cm × 3.0 cm localized tumor. Microscopic examination showed that the tumor was mainly composed of spindle-shaped cells. Immunohistochemical staining showed a strong positive S-100 protein reaction. Finally, the lesion was diagnosed as a benign schwannoma in the hepatoduodenal ligament. However, one month later, the patient was readmitted to our hospital because of skin and sclera jaundice caused by common bile duct stenosis without common bile duct stone or tumor. The patient recovered well after implantation of a common bile duct stent under endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.

Its course is recurrent, and response to therapy is unpredictable. In a case in which the patient has a number of potential triggers for the manifestation of Wells’ syndrome skin rash, the treating physician must decide or must make an assumption in order to establish the most likely clinical scenario. This is important for the patient’s future treatment plans.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】We describe the clinical case of a 46-year-old female with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who had already received treatment for several months with ibrutinib. She was diagnosed with Wells’ syndrome 10 d after an influenza vaccination containing thimerosal. Based on the literature, the patient was treated with a course of oral steroids. Resolution of clinical symptoms and rash were observed in response to the treatment. Ibrutinib was not discontinued.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】The etiology of Wells’ syndrome remains unknown. Clinically, it resembles bacterial cellulitis. Lack of response to antibiotic treatment should lead the physician to consider a diagnosis of Wells’ syndrome. Treating the underlying condition is important and may lead to resolution of the syndrome.

A phase II trial has explored the combination of cytotoxic chemotherapy with the anti-HER-2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab in selected patients with metastatic bladder cancer, but it failed.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】Here, we report a case of recurrent urothelial bladder carcinoma (UBC) in a patient who has undergone three operations, and further illuminate its diagnosis and treatment. The diagnosis of UBC was rendered according to the pathological indices. Next-generation sequencing on formalin fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue was also performed and suggested HER2 gene amplification in the FFPE tissue. Based on HER2 gene amplification in FFPE, the patient was treated with chemotherapy in combination with trastuzumab after his third surgery. Fortunately, the patient got a clinically complete remission to trastuzumab for 34 mo.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】There is not enough clinical evidence for incorporating trastuzumab in routine treatment of UBC. This case hinted that recurrent UBC patients with HER2 gene amplification may benefit from targeted trastuzumab. Further studies are needed to further investigate the status of HER2 gene and better determine trastuzumab in the management of UBC.\n\n【7】Key Words: Urothelial bladder carcinoma , Trastuzumab , Complete response , Next generation sequencing , HER2 , Case report\n\n【8】Core tip: Urothelial bladder carcinoma (UBC) is the most common type of urinary system tumor. Approximately 25% of patients present de novo with metastatic disease affecting long-term survival. Although cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy has become the standard first-line regimens for recurrent UBC patients, there are still no second- or third-line treatments for definite efficacy. HER2 gene amplification has been found in UBC patients, but there is not enough clinical evidence for incorporating trastuzumab for treatment of recurrent UBC.

However, intercostal arterial bleeding is likely to result in critical complications such as abnormalities in vital signs, hypovolemic shock, and death due to massive bleeding. Therefore, it is very important to establish the diagnosis of intercostal arterial bleeding and to initiate treatment.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】We report a case in which a 59-year-old woman who was hospitalized at intensive care unit with multiple trauma had a massive hemothorax after the removal of a percutaneous catheter. She sustained a refractory right pleural effusion due to biloma caused by a traumatic injury to the liver, despite persistent intraperitoneal drainage. As a result, atelectasis persisted in the dependent portion of the right lung. Therefore, we performed right percutaneous catheter drainage (8.5-F pigtail catheter) for pleural effusion drainage at the 7 <sup>th </sup> intercostal space. After percuta neous catheter removal, portable chest radiography and vital signs of the patient assisted in establishing a diagnosis of intercostal arterial bleeding. Intercostal arterial bleeding was also confirmed using transarterial angiography; and embolization was performed. The patient’s condition progressively improved, and no further intervention was required.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】Massive hemothorax is a rare complication of percutaneous catheter removal.

The majority of PTC variants have been reported, but PTC with nodular fasciitis-like stroma (NFS) is a rare pathological variant and has been infrequently reported in the relevant literature. This condition involves abundant reactive stromal components rich in spindle cells, which may account for 60%-80% of the tumor along with a typical papillary carcinoma.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 44-year-old man presented with a 4-mo history of a palpable mass over the anterior aspect of the left neck, the tumor demonstrated gradual enlargement but was painless during the 4 mo prior to discovery.

However, limited information has been reported to obtain a good understanding of pediatric PH. Gaps exist between genome sequencing and metabolic assessments and lead to misinterpretations of the complicated symptoms of PH. Here, we report a rare case of a patient who presented with severe PH as the first manifestation without significant cardiovascular malformation and was finally diagnosed with methylmalonic aciduria (MMA) after metabolic and genomic assessments.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】An 11-year-old female presented with an aggressive reduction in activity capability and shortness of breath for only 4 mo and suffered from unexplained PH. A series of examinations was performed to evaluate any possible malformations or abnormalities of the cardiovascular system and lungs, but negative results were obtained. The blood tests were normal except for manifestations of microcytic anemia and elevated total homocysteine. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging failed to identify any pulmonary diseases. Cardiac catheterization examination identified a small right coronary artery to pulmonary artery shunt and severe PH. During the follow-up, PH progressed rapidly. Then, genome sequencing and metabolic disorder screening were performed, which confirmed a diagnosis of MMA with MMACHC c.80A > G/c and 609G > A mutations. Vitamin B12, betaine and bosentan were then administered as the main treatments. During the 6-mo follow-up, the pulmonary artery pressure dropped to 45 mmHg, while the right ventricle structure recovered. The patient’s heart function recovered to NYHA class II. Metabolic disorder analysis failed to identify significant abnormalities.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】As emerging types of metabolic dysfunction have been shown to present as the first manifestation of PH, and taking advantage of next generation sequencing technology, genome sequencing and metabolic disorder screening are recommended to have a more superior role when attempting to understand unclear or aggressive PH.\n\n【7】Key Words: Pulmonary hypertension , Methylmalonic acidemia , Genomic sequence , Metabolic disorder , Case report\n\n【8】Core tip: This report describes a case who suffered an aggressive pulmonary hypertension (PH) as her first onset manifestation. Following the routine diagnostic and therapeutic procedure, we failed to address any abnormalities which could explain the origins of PH. However, taking the advantage of metabolic screening and genome sequencing, we achieved the diagnosis of methylmalonic acidemia and revealed that the severe PH is secondary to methylmalonic acidemia, which was not mentioned among several guidelines of PH. Although metabolic and genome screenings have been recommended in guideline, this case brought our reconsideration to the timing for perform metabolic and genomic screenings. So that, we would like to mention that for some aggressive unexplained PH patients who meets the criteria, such screening procedure should be applied in an earlier stage to prevent putting the patients into irreversible conditions.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>   Citation: Liao HY, Shi XQ, Li YF.

In this study, we present an unusual case of recurrent infection of the knee after an ACL reconstruction, and discuss the importance of accurate diagnosis and appropriate management, including the issue of graft preservation versus removal.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 33-year-old gentleman underwent ACL reconstruction using a hamstring tendon autograft with suspensory Endobutton fixation to the distal femur and an interference screw fixation to the proximal tibia. Four years after ACL reconstruction, he developed an abscess over the proximal tibia and underwent incision and drainage. Remnant suture material was found at the base of the abscess and was removed. Five years later, he re-presented with a lateral distal thigh abscess that encroached the femoral tunnel. He underwent incision and drainage of the abscess which was later complicated by a chronic discharging sinus. Repeated magnetic resonance imaging revealed a fistulous communication between the lateral thigh wound extending toward the femoral tunnel with suggestion of osteomyelitis. Decision was made for a second surgery and the patient was counselled about the need for graft removal should there be intra-articular involvement. Knee arthroscopy revealed the graft to be intact with no evidence of intra-articular involvement. As such, the decision was made to retain the ACL graft. Re-debridement, excision of the sinus tract and removal of Endobutton was also performed in the same setting. Joint fluid cultures did not grow bacteria. However, tissue cultures from the femoral tunnel abscess grew Enterobacter cloacae complex, similar to what grew in tissue cultures from the tibial abscess five years earlier. In view of the recurrent and indolent nature of the infection, antibiotic therapy was escalated from Clindamycin to Ertapenem. He completed a six-week course of intravenous antibiotics and has been well for six months since surgery, with excellent knee function and no evidence of any further infection.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】Prompt and accurate diagnosis of surgical site infection following ACL reconstruction, including the exclusion of intra-articular involvement, is important for timely and appropriate treatment. Arthroscopic debridement and removal of implant with graft preservation, together with a course of antibiotics, is a suitable treatment option for extra-articular knee infections following ACL reconstruction.\n\n【7】Key Words: Chronic surgical site infection , Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction , Surgical site infection , Graft preservation , Enterobacter cloacae complex , Septic arthritis , Case report\n\n【8】Core tip: Chronic surgical site infections following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructions are rare. Most infections occur in the acute or subacute post-operative periods. Astute clinic judgement and patient involvement are key when managing recurrent infections post-ACL reconstruction. Early intervention involving joint washout and debridement as well as commencing culture-directed antibiotic therapy are key. The decision for graft-sparing versus graft-sacrificing surgery remains controversial.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>   Citation: Koh D, Tan SM, Tan AHC.

The incidence of AL ranges from 5% to 20% depending on patient characteristics and the distance of the anastomosis from the anal verge. Low anastomoses and leaks pose technical challenges for endoscopic treatment. The aim of this report was to describe the use of a commercially available laparoscopic energy device through a transanal minimally invasive surgery (TAMIS) port for the management of a symptomatic leak not requiring relaparotomy (grade B) after a LAR with diverting loop ileostomy.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A TAMIS GelPOINT Path port was inserted into the anus to access the distal rectum. Pneumorectum was achieved with AirSeal insufflation and a 30 degree laparoscope was introduced through a trocar. A LigaSure <sup>TM </sup> Retractable L-Hook device was then used to perform a septotomy of the chronic sinus tract identified posterior to the coloproctostomy. The procedure was then repeated twice in three weeks intervals with ultimate resolution of the chronic leak cavity. Several months after serial TAMIS septotomies, barium enema demonstrated a patent anastomosis with no evidence of persistent leak or stricture. The patient subsequently underwent ileostomy reversal and has had no significant post-operative issues.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】TAMIS septotomy with the LigaSure <sup>TM </sup> Retractable L-Hook is a feasible and effective, minimally invasive salvage technique for the treatment of grade B ALs.

The reported incidence of head and neck MFSs is extremely rare. We report a 46-year-old male with “a neoplasm in the scalp” who was hospitalized and diagnosed with an MFS (highly malignant with massive necrotic lesions) based on histologic and immunohistochemistry evaluations. The magnetic resonance imaging manifestations did not demonstrate the “tail sign” mentioned in several studies, which resulted in a great challenge to establish an imaging diagnosis. The treatment plan is closely associated with the anatomic location and histologic grade, and more importantly, aggressive surgery and adjuvant radiotherapy may be helpful. Hence, we report the case and share some valuable information about the disease.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 46-year-old male with “a neoplasm in the scalp for 6 mo” was hospitalized. Initially, the tumor was about the size of a soybean, without algesia or ulceration. The patient ignored the growth, did not seek treatment, and thus, did not receive treatment. Recently, the tumor increased to the size of an egg; there was no bleeding or algesia. His family history was unremarkable. No abnormalities were found upon laboratory testing, including routine hematologic, biochemistry, and tumor markers. Computed tomography showed an ovoid mass (6.25 cm × 3.29 cm × 3.09 cm in size) in the left frontal scalp with low density intermingled with equidense strips in adjacent areas of the scalp. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a lesion with an irregular surface and an approximate size of 3.55 cm × 6.34 cm in the left frontal region, with clear boundaries and visible separation. Adjacent areas of the skull were damaged and the dura mater was involved. Contrast enhancement showed an uneven enhancement pattern. Surgery was performed and postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy was administered to avoid recurrence or metastasis. The post-operative pathologic diagnosis confirmed an MFS. A repeat computed tomography scan showed no local recurrence or distant metastasis 19 mo post-operatively.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】The case reported herein of MFS was demonstrated in an extremely rare location on the scalp and had atypical magnetic resonance imaging findings, which serves as a reminder to radiologists of the possibility of this diagnosis to assist in clinical treatment. Given the special anatomic location and the high malignant potential of this rare tumor, combined surgical and adjuvant radiotherapy should be considered to avoid local recurrence and distant metastasis. The significance of regular follow-up is strongly recommended to improve the long-term survival rate.\n\n【7】Key Words: Malignant fibrous histiocytoma , Myxofibrosarcoma , Scalp , Magnetic resonance imaging , Treatment , Case report\n\n【8】Core tip: Myxofibrosarcoma (MFS) is a malignant fibroblastic tumor that has a predilection for lower and upper extremities. Rare occurrences have been reported in the scalp. We describe a 46-year-old male diagnosed with a MFS of the scalp (highly malignant with massive necrotic lesions) by histologic examination and immunohistochemistry testing. The magnetic resonance imaging findings did not conform to the reported typical “tail sign”, which may be confused with other tumors and lead to the correct diagnosis being missed. The definitive diagnosis of MFS is based on immunohistologic features. Considering the location and non-specific imaging manifestations of this case, the treatment is also worthy of discussion. Surgical excision combined with postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy was effective in our case.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>   Citation: Ke XT, Yu XF, Liu JY, Huang F, Chen MG, Lai QQ.

This caused severe iatrogenic thoracic and abdominal aortic dissection, and the dissection involved many visceral arteries.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】The patient had pain in the chest and back for 1 mo. A computed tomography scan showed that the patient had secondary thoracic and abdominal aortic dissection. The ascending aortic replacement, total arch replacement, and descending aortic stent implantation for Stanford type A aortic dissection were performed 2 years prior. An intraoperative stent-graft was deployed in the false lumen. Endovascular aneurysm repair was performed to address this intractable situation. An occluder was used to occlude the proximal end of the true lumen, and a covered stent was used to direct blood flow back to the true lumen. A three-dimensional printing technique was used in this operation to guide pre-fenestration. The computed tomography scan at the 1 <sup>st </sup> mo after surgery showed that the thoracic and abdominal aortic dissection was repaired, with all visceral arteries remaining patent. The patient did not develop renal failure or neurological complications after surgery.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】The total endovascular repair for false lumen stent-graft implantation was feasible and minimally invasive.

This is very rare because the patient survived this catastrophic thoracic surgery for 2 years. We performed a well-designed total endovascular repair to draw blood back to the true lumen. Our report presents a new solution for incorrect stent-graft implantation. Other departments may be inspired by this case when they need to rescue an incorrect stent implantation.

Lymphomatous infiltration or local oppression usually accounts for CNS or peripheral nerve lesions. The incidence of peripheral neuropathy was 5%. Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is rare and may occur in less than 0.3% of patients with NHL. Hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) is a rare complication of NHL. It has been reported that 1% of patients with hematological malignancies develop HPS. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) combined with GBS has been reported in 10 cases.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】We report the case of a 53-year-old man who was initially hospitalized because of abnormal feelings in the lower limbs and urinary incontinence. He was finally diagnosed with DLBCL combined with GBS and HPS after 16 d, which was earlier than previously reported. Immunoglobulin pulse therapy, dexamethasone, and etoposide were immediately administered. The neurological symptoms did not improve, but cytopenia was relieved. However, GBS-related clinical symptoms were relieved partially after one cycle of rituximab - cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) chemotherapy and disappeared after six cycles of R-CHOP.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】GBS and HPS heralding the diagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus DLBCL are rare.

As surgery is the only curative therapy, preoperative evaluation of the tumor extent is essential for surgical planning. Although high-quality image modalities such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging have been used extensively in preoperative evaluation, the accuracy is low. To obtain precise localization of tumor spread arising from the hilar region preoperatively, the development of an acceptable imaging modality is still an unmet need.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 52-year-old female presented to our emergency department with jaundice, abdominal pain, and fever. Initially, she was treated for cholangitis. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with the cholangiogram showed long segment filling defect in the common hepatic duct with dilatation of bilateral intrahepatic ducts. Transpapillary biopsy was performed, and the pathology suggested intraductal papillary neoplasm with high-grade dysplasia. After treatment of cholangitis, contrasted-enhanced computed tomography revealed a hilar lesion with undetermined Bismuth-Corlette classification. SpyGlass cholangioscopy showed that the lesion involved the confluence of the common hepatic duct with one skip lesion in the posterior branch of the right intrahepatic duct, which was not detected by previous image modalities. The surgical plan was modified from extended left hepatectomy to extended right hepatectomy. The final diagnosis was hilar CC, pT2aN0M0.

An IML usually occurs in a large muscle of the limb or torso. Recurrence of IML is rare. Recurrent IMLs, especially those with unclear boundaries, necessitate complete excision. Several cases of IML in the hand have been reported. However, recurrent IML appearing along the muscle and tendon of EPB on wrist and forearm has not been reported yet.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】In this report, the authors describe clinical and histopathological features of recurrent IML at EPB. A 42-year-old Asian woman presented with a slow-growing lump in her right forearm and wrist area six months ago. The patient had a history of surgery for a lipoma of the right forearm one year ago with a scar of 6 cm on the right forearm. magnetic resonance imaging confirmed that the lipomatous mass, which had attenuation similar to subcutaneous fat, had invaded the muscle layer of EPB. Excision and biopsy were performed under general anesthesia. On histological examination, it was identified as an IML showing mature adipocytes and skeletal muscle fibers. Therefore, surgery was terminated without further resection. No recurrence occurred during a follow-up of five years after surgery.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】Recurrent IML in the wrist must be examined to differentiate it from sarcoma.

The mass almost filled the whole esophageal lumen, but the endoscope could still pass through. Despite the suspicion of a malignancy, repeated biopsies indicated necrosis and inflammation. After multidisciplinary team consultation, an endoscopic resection to diagnose and relieve the obstruction was recommended. The pedicle of the mass was cut off, the bleeding was stopped, and the mass was cut into pieces and pulled out. The mass was 26 cm × 5 cm × 4 cm in size.

Advances in the identification of MEITL over the last two decades have led to its recognition as a se parate entity. MEITL patients, predominantly male, typically present with vague and nonspecific symptoms and diagnosis is predominantly confirmed at la parotomy. Currently, there are no standardized treatment protocols, and the optimal therapy remains unclear.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】We report a case of MEITL that was initially considered to be gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and Imatinib was administered for one cycle. The 62-year-old man presented with abdominal pain, abdominal distension, and weight loss of 20 pounds. Within 2 wk, the size of the mass considerably increased on computed tomography scans. The patient underwent surgery followed by chemotherapy with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) and stem-cell transplant. A correct diagnosis of MEITL was established based on postoperative pathology.

The tumor is characterized by immunoreactivity to MDM2 and CDK4 and can be confirmed by detecting MDM2 amplification via fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Herein, we report an unusual case of DDLPS arising from the duodenum.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 64-year-old man presented with repeated abdominal pain and weight loss. Radiologic studies revealed a mass of the duodenum involving the pancreas. The patient was treated with pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy. Histologically, the tumor showed a high-grade sarcoma. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the tumor cells were positive for MDM2 and CDK4 expression. MDM2 amplification was detected via FISH, leading to the final diagnosis of DDLPS. Following surgery, the patient was treated in the intensive care unit due to peritonitis, and died 60 d after surgery.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first case of primary duodenal DDLPS in Korea and the third case in the English-language literature.

Literature data on how to address this problem are limited. Here, we report on a case of massive stomach bleeding with MIC that was successfully treated endoscopically using an overtube of single-balloon enteroscopy.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 62-year-old gentleman with metastatic lung cancer was admitted to the intensive care unit due to tarry stools and hematemesis of 1500 mL of blood during hospitalization. Emergent esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed massive blood clots and fresh blood in the stomach with evidence of active bleeding. Bleeding sites could not be observed even by changing the patient’s position and aggressive endoscope suction. The MIC was successfully removed using an overtube connected with a suction pipe, which was inserted into the stomach with an overtube of a single-balloon enteroscope. An ultrathin gastroscope was also introduced through the nose into the stomach to guide the suction. A massive blood clot was successfully removed, and an ulcer with oozing bleeding at the inferior lesser curvature of the upper gastric body was revealed, facilitating endoscopic hemostatic therapy.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】This technique appears to be a previously unreported method to suction MIC out of the stomach in patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding.

We suggest a new and simple way to deal with acute UGIB with massive intragastric clotting when the suction of the endoscope can’t remove it with common materials found in the endoscope department. An ultrathin electronic gastroscope was inserted through the nose to provide vision and an over tube of single-balloon enteroscope was inserted into the mouth to suction the massive blood clots out with a negative pressure of 2 kPa. This is a good way to provide a visual field and to stop bleeding in UGIB when other methods are not available or are unhelpful.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>   Citation: Liu SX, Shi B, Liu YF, Shan JY, Sun B.

In the current case, we report a 27-year-old woman with NF1, who presented with a lower abdominal mass, symptomatic anaemia, and significant weight loss. We employed multiple approaches to assess the tumor behavior, including computed tomography (CT) scan, surgical tumor resection, histological and immunohistochemical analysis and gene sequencing. Additionally, the patient was given Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) as adjuvant therapy. CT scan delineated a large thick wall cavity lesion connecting to the small bowel segment. Resection of the tumor yielded a mass of 17 cm × 13 cm with achievement of safety margins. The diagnosis was GIST, confirmed by immunohistochemical expression of CD117, CD34, and Bcl-2. Sequencing revealed no mutations in either KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha, genes which are mutated in over 85% of sporadic GIST cases. Further, there was no evidence of recurrence, metastasis or metachronous GIST for over three years in our patient. From our analyses, we believe selective genotyping is advisable for high risk patients to predict potential tumor behavior.\n\n【2】Key Words: KIT , Gastrointestinal stromal tumor , Imatinib , Neurofibromatosis type-1 , Platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha\n\n【3】Core tip: There are several differences between gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) in a neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) patient and sporadic GISTs with regard to the tumor site, tumor behavior, targeted therapeutic approach, survival, prognosis, and recurrence based on genomic mutations. Wild type GISTs, those that do not have mutations in KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFR-α), are typically resistant to imatanib therapy. Mutational analysis is critical in predicting tumor behavior and might individualize targeted therapy. We show that sequencing for KIT and PDGFR-α provide a useful tool in predicting tumor behavior of GIST in a NF1 patient.\n\n【4】删除1:<u>   Citation: Sawalhi S, Al-Harbi K, Raghib Z, Abdelrahman AI, Al-Hujaily A.

A 28-year-old female developed acute duodenal Crohn’s disease. Upper GI radiologic and endoscopic examinations showed a stricture in the duodenal bulb. Using the duodenal biopsy specimens, mucosal cytokine levels were measured; interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-α levels were remarkably elevated.

Among all the pathological types of tumors in the bladder, paraganglioma, which arises from extra-adrenal paraganglia and consists of chromaffin cells, is rare. Paragangliomas might cause severe clinical symptoms due to catecholamine hypersecretion or mass compression. Bladder paragangliomas are rare, especially those appearing after kidney transplantation. Here, we report a case of bladder paraganglioma developing after kidney transplan tation.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 63-year-old woman received a kidney transplant 12 years ago and took oral immunosuppressants (cyclosporine, mizoribine, and methylprednisolone) for regular post-transplant treatment. The patient felt no discomfort and she came to the hospital for a routine checkup. A mass located in the bladder was incidentally discovered by computed tomography, and she underwent surgical treatment.

The lung, bone, joint, eye, brain, skin, and other sites are easily infected, and there is a marked risk of misdiagnosis. There have been few case reports of infection by S. apiospermum of the lumbar vertebrae; most reports have focused on infection of the lung.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】An otherwise healthy 60-year-old man presented with a 4-mo history of lumbosacral pain, stooping, and limited walking. The symptoms were significantly aggravated 10 d prior to hospitalization, and radiating pain in the back of his left lower leg developed, which was so severe that he could not walk. Movement of the lumbar spine was significantly limited, anterior flexion was about 30°; backward extension, right and left lateral curvature, and rotational mobility were about 10°; tenderness of the spinous processes of the lumbar 3-5 vertebrae was evident, and the muscle strength of both lower limbs was grade IV. Imaging suggested bony destruction of the lumbar 3, 4, and 5 vertebrae and sacral 1 vertebra; in addition, the corresponding intervertebral spaces were narrowed and the lumbar 5 vertebra was posteriorly displaced and unstable. Lumbar vertebral infection was also noted, and the possibility of lumbar tuberculosis was considered. We first performed surgical intervention on the lesioned lumbar vertebrae, cleared the infected lesion, and performed stable fixation of the lesioned vertebral body using a lumbar internal fixation device, which restored the stability of the lumbar vertebrae. Cytological and pathological examination of the lesioned tissue removed during surgery confirmed S. apiospermum infection of the lumbar vertebrae; on this basis, the patient was administered voriconazole. At the 6-mo follow-up, efficacy was significant, no drug-related side effects were observed, and imaging examination showed no evidence of recurrence.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】S. apiospermum infection can occur in immunocompetent individuals with no history of near drowning.

Following splenectomy, the patient developed a gastric fistula. He underwent a long period of conservative treatment, including antibiotics and total parenteral nutrition, which was ineffective. The fistula could not be closed and titanium clip closure using a gastroscopy was then performed in order to close the fistula. After endoscopic therapy and clipping surgery, the patient’s general condition improved significantly, and he had no post-procedural abdominal complications. On post-clipping day 6, the gastric fistula was completely closed as shown by X-ray examination of the upper digestive tract. The patient was discharged from hospital and no complications were observed during the six-month follow-up period. Our report suggests that titanium clip closure using endoscopy may be the choice of treatment in patients with a gastric fistula.\n\n【2】Key Words: Titanium clipping , Endoscopy , Splenectomy , Case report , Gastric fistula\n\n【3】Core tip: Gastric fistula after splenectomy is an uncommon complication, and is difficult to treat and cure.

However, AML is relatively rare in the population overall, accounting for only about 1 percent of all cancers. Treatment for AML can be very effective for some patients, yet it leaves others with serious and even life-threatening side effects. Chemotherapy is still the primary treatment for most AML, but over time, leukemia cells become resistant to chemotherapy drugs. In addition, stem cell transplantation, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy are currently available. At the same time, with the progression of the disease, the patient may have corresponding complications, such as coagulation dysfunction, anemia, granulocytopenia, and repeated infection, so transfusion supportive therapy will be involved in the overall treatment regime. To date, few articles have reported on blood transfusion treatment options for patients with ABO subtypes AML-M2. Blood transfusion therapy is an important supportive treatment for AML-M2, and accurate determination of patients' blood type is one of the most important steps in the treatment process. In this study, we explored blood typing and supportive treatment strategies for a patient with A2 subtype AML-M2 to provide the basis for treatment for all patients.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】In order to determine the blood type of the patient, serological and molecular biological methods were used for reference tests, and the genetic background was studied to determine the patient's final blood type and select the appropriate blood products for infusion treatment. According to the results obtained by serological and molecular biological methods, the blood type of the patient was A2 subtype; the genotype was A02/001; the irregular antibody screening was negative, and anti-A1 was found in the plasma. According to the overall treatment plan, active anti-infection, elevated cells, component blood transfusion support, and other rescue and supportive treatments were given, and the patient successfully passed the stage of myelosuppression after chemotherapy. Re-examination of bone marrow smears showed that AL was in complete remission of bone marrow signs, and minimal residual leukemia lesions suggested no cells with obvious abnormal immunophenotype (residual leukemia cells < 10 <sup>-4 </sup> ).\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】The infusion of patients with A2 subtype AML-M2 with A irradiated platelets and O washing red blood cells can meet the needs of clinical treatment.\n\n【7】Key Words: ABO blood-group system , A2 subtypes , Blood grouping and crossmatching , Blood transfusion , Acute myeloid leukemia , Atypical blood transfusion\n\n【8】Core Tip: There has always been a debate on the large-scale transfusion therapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This study provides strong and favorable evidence for the clinical treatment of blood transfusion. There are few specific reports in the literature on the treatment of blood transfusion for patients with AML-M2 blood type A2, and this study provides a protocol and precedent for the treatment of blood transfusion for patients with rare subtype AML. The study can provide clinical reference data for supporting transfusion therapy in patients with clinically rare blood type leukemia.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>   Citation: Kuang XC, Zhang SH, Cen YJ, Zhang JB, Liu YS.

It may mimic pulmonary mass especially in the absence of trauma. Cough is a common side effect of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors that may cause diaphragmatic rupture due to a sudden increase in trans-diaphragmatic pressure. We present a case of ACE-inhibitor associated spontaneous herniation of the liver mimicking pleural mass.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】An 80-year-old woman presented with dry cough for 1 mo and sudden onset of cramping abdominal pain for 1 d. She denied history of trauma, prior surgeries, smoking, alcohol or illicit drug use. She has a history of diabetes and was started on an ACE inhibitor 6 mo ago for the management of hypertension. Examination was remarkable for right upper quadrant tenderness. Lab work-up was unremarkable. Chest X-ray showed a right lower lung opacity suspecting right pleural mass. Chest computed tomography scan ruled out pleural mass, however, revealed herniated right lobe of the liver (3.9 cm × 3.6 cm × 3.4 cm) into the thoracic cavity through the posterolateral diaphragmatic defect. Laparoscopic repair of the diaphragmatic defect was performed and the ACE inhibitor was stopped. Patients’ symptoms had completely resolved on follow-up.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】ACE inhibitor-associated cough may cause diaphragmatic liver herniation mimicking pleural mass.

Despite medical treatment, coagulopathy was uncontrollable, prompting liver transplantation at age 8 mo with incidental splenectomy. The patient experienced catch-up growth with good liver function and did not develop allograft steatosis. However, 1 year after transplant, he died from an acute infection, considered secondary to immunosuppression and asplenia. A homozygous protein-truncating mutation, c.547C > T, p.(Arg183Ter), was subsequently identified in NR1H4 , and both parents were shown to be heterozygous carriers.

Therefore, its mechanism and incidence have not been determined conclusively. This type of fracture is considered a serious injury that requires prompt diagnosis and early surgical repair. There is no therapeutic algorithm or standard method of treatment due to the infrequency of the injury. In this case report, we conducted an exhaustive review and synthesis of the existing literature including all previously reported cases.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】We present a 16-year-old male soccer player with a case of a tibial tuberosity fracture with distal avulsion of the patellar tendon 5 d prior to surgical treatment.

The diagnosis was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. The patient underwent open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture with a cannulated screw and washer as well as patellar tendon repair with two metallic anchors.

The incidence of ICI-associated arthritis (IA) is unknown. In most cases, IA is not serious and non-lethal. Higher checkpoint inhibitor arthritis disease activity may be associated with cancer progression. Here, we report a severe case of IA with high arthritis disease activity in advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma, causing permanent withdrawal of pembrolizumab, but the patient remained in complete remission (CR) 20 mo after the development of IA.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】An 81-year-old smoking man was admitted to our hospital because of left chest pain for 9 mo. He was finally diagnosed with advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma, with programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 expression of 70%. The patient responded to pembrolizumab treatment and achieved CR, but IA occurred after the 5 <sup>th </sup> cycle of pembrolizumab administration. Although non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs were pres cribed, arthralgia and joint swelling occurred. The symptoms of arthritis were further aggravated when immunotherapy was given again after short-term with drawal. Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score, a traditional measure of arthritis activity, was 43. Intravenous methylprednisolone was prescribed at 20 mg/d and then tapered over the subsequent 4 wk. The symptoms of arthritis steadily improved and completely resolved 4 mo after withdrawal of pembrolizumab. A recent follow-up in June 2022 revealed satisfactory clinical recovery of arthritis and the patient remained in CR.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】This case report highlights that early recognition of IA and appropriate treatment are critical to improving the outcome of both ICI-arthritis and lung cancer.\n\n【7】Key Words: Immune checkpoint inhibitors , Immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated arthritis , Pembro lizumab , Clinical Disease Activity Index , Case report\n\n【8】Core Tip: We report a severe case of immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated arthritis (IA) in advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma. A recent study suggested that higher checkpoint inhibitor arthritis disease activity may be associated with cancer progression. In our case, Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score increased to as high as 43, but cancer disease remained in complete remission 20 mo after the development of IA. Whether CDAI can be a predictor of disease progression needs to be confirmed in future studies.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>   Citation: Yang Y, Huang XJ.

Spontaneous orbital hemorrhage refers to an internal orbital hemorrhage without apparent cause. Therefore, we aimed to describe a case of an orbital hematoma after a severe cough the night before due to inhalation of cooking oil fumes.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 46-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with a complaint of exophthalmos accompanied with blurred vision, pain, binocular diplopia, and dizziness lasting for 5 h noted on waking in the morning. She also experienced nausea and vomiting due to high pressure of orbit and dizziness. Based on the auxiliary examination and her medical history, the patient was finally diagnosed with bulbar conjunctival vascular lesion combined with spontaneous retrobulbar hematoma. The patient was administered tobramycin and dexamethasone eye ointment, and applied pressure dressing on the left eye to stop the bleeding. Simultaneously, we administered intravenous etamsylate, oral Yunnan Baiyao capsule, intravenous mannitol to reduce orbital pressure, and intravenous dexamethasone injection at 10 mg/dL combined with neurotrophic therapy to reduce tissue edema. Among them, the Yunnan Baiyao capsule is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine to remove stasis and stop bleeding; thus, it promotes blood circulation and relieves pain resulting in reduced edema of the lesion site. The symptoms did not improve significantly during the first 2 d of treatment. We speculate that high orbital pressure and binocular diplopia induced frequent nausea and vomiting in the patient, causing increased pressure on the superior vena cava and leading to repeated orbital bleeding. After the second day, the symptoms started gradually improving.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】This case further emphasizes the importance of comprehensive, detailed medical history and careful ophthalmic examination of the patient.\n\n【7】Key Words: Bulbar conjunctival vascular lesion , Spontaneous retrobulbar hematoma , Intraorbital hemorrhage , Nontraumatic orbital hemorrhage , Case report\n\n【8】Core Tip: Orbital hemorrhage can be classified as traumatic or spontaneous according to its cause. Spontaneous orbital hemorrhage is an extremely rare and vision-threatening condition that may occur due to a variety of systemic predisposing factors. This case report suggests that patients with malformed periorbital vasculature should be alert for the risk of spontaneous intraorbital hemorrhage. In previous literature, we found reports of retrobulbar hematomas caused by sneezing or vomiting.

The recognition of dangerous vital sign parameters, rapid evacuation of the artificial pneumothorax, and initiation of lateral position cardiopulmonary resuscitation while simultaneously removing the endotracheal tube to the main airway are critically important. Moreover, even though the sinus rhythm was restored, the patient’s continued tachycardia, reduced pulse pressure, and depressed pulse oximeter waveform were worrisome. We should highly suspect the possibility of pneumothorax and use rapid diagnostic methods to make judgment calls.

BL is a great masquerader that presents in varied forms and in atypical locations, and it is prone to misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis. The prognosis of BL remains poor because of the difficulty in early diagnosis and the limited advances in chemotherapy.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 53-year-old man was referred to our hospital from the local county hospital due to abdominal pain for two weeks and weakness in the lower extremities for one day. Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen and lumbar spine showed a swollen pancreas and gallbladder, with peripancreatic exudation and liquid collection, indicating acute pancreatitis and acute cholecystitis. Additionally, we observed abnormally thickened lesions of the gastric wall, multiple enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes and a well-demarcated, posterolateral extradural mass lesion between T9 and T12, with extension through the spinal foramen and definite bony destruction, suggesting metastasis in gastric malignancy. Subse quent whole-body positron emission tomography/computed tomography exa mination showed multifocal malignant lesions in the stomach, pancreas, gall bladder, bone, bilateral supraclavicular fossa, anterior mediastinum, bilateral axillary and retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Gastroduodenal endoscopy revealed primary BL with massive involvement of the gastric body and duodenum. The patient refused chemotherapeutic treatment and died one week later due to upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Afterward, we reviewed the characteristics of 11 patients with BL involving the stomach, pancreas or spinal cord.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】Clinicians should be aware that BL can be the potential cause of acute pancreatitis or a rapidly progressive spinal tumor with accompanying paraplegia. For gastric BL, gastroscopy biopsies and pathology are necessary for a definite diagnosis.\n\n【7】Key Words: Burkitt lymphoma , Paraplegia , Acute pancreatitis , Case report\n\n【8】Core Tip: The incidence of Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is extremely low, and the clinical symptoms are atypical. The misdiagnosis rate is high, and the patient's prognosis is poor. The patient in this case was eventually diagnosed with BL involving the stomach, pancreas and vertebral column presenting with acute pancreatitis and neurological symptoms secondary to compression of the spinal cord. Chemotherapeutic treatment was refused by the patient, and he eventually died after one week due to upper gas trointestinal hemorrhage. This case reminds us that further transcriptomic and clinical studies are needed to explore desirable biomarkers for early BL. Eleven cases were reviewed with an emphasis on diagnostic criteria and treatment protocols.

The first ECG showed only T-wave inversion in III and aVF leads. Another ECG was performed at the 100 <sup>th </sup> minute, showing upsloping ST segments depressed with tall and symmetrical T waves in the precordial leads; the J point was raised by 0.1 mV at the aVR lead. The patient was referred to our catheterization laboratory. A third ECG showed ST segment elevation by 0.2 mV in the I and aVL leads. The patient underwent emergency coronary angiography, which revealed complete proximal left anterior descending coronary (LAD) occlusion. The second patient presented with a 1-h history of sudden-onset, severe, substernal crushing chest pain. The first ECG showed ST-segment elevation (0.1–1.7 mV) in I, aVL, and precordial leads.

Two large omental masses measured 15 cm x 10 cm and 5 cm × 4 cm sized and several small ovoid fragments were attached to small intestine, mesentery and peritoneum. On histologic findings, the masses were separated from small bowel serosa and had high mitotic count (115/50 HPFs). In the results of immunohistochemical stains, the tumor showed CD117 (c-kit) positive reactivity and high Ki-67 labeling index. On mutation analysis, the c-kit gene mutation was found in the juxtamembrane domain (exon 11) and it was heterozygote. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) gene mutation was also found in the juxtamemembrane (exon 12) and it was polymorphism.

Prior to intensive care unit admission, the patient reported intermittent diarrhea and decreased urine output. His blood pressure was 70/40 mmHg, necessitating fluid resuscitation and large doses of noradrenaline. Based on the results of a blood culture and the presence of hypotension, oliguria, and hypoxemia, we diagnosed septic shock, AKI, and multiple organ dysfunction. We administered continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) with an oXiris <sup>® </sup> hemofilter for 72 h with intermittent continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF), and changed the filter every 12 h. After his hemodynamic parameters were stable, we used a traditional filter (AN69 hemofilter) with intermittent CVVHDF.

The anterior-nasal fibers of the inferior oblique muscle were attached at 9 mm posterior to the corneal limbus along the temporal board of the inferior rectus muscle, the other fibers were attached a further 5 mm temporal to the anterior-nasal fibers. Postoperatively, both hype rtropia and floating were improved, and no obvious complications occurred.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】In these cases, the modified unilateral IOAT was an effective and safe surgical method for treating DVD with SOP.\n\n【7】Key Words: Anterior transposition , Inferior oblique muscles , Dissociated vertical deviation , Superior oblique palsy , Anti-elevation syndrome , Case report\n\n【8】Core Tip: Inferior oblique anterior transposition (IOAT) is effective for dissociated vertical deviation combined with superior oblique palsy; however, unilateral IOAT also increases the risk of the anti-elevation syndrome. This modified unilateral IOAT involves a more backward new insertion and the new insertion line perpendicular to the inferior rectus muscle axis, which provides satisfactory primary position alignment and restricts the superior floating phenomenon without obvious postoperative complications.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>   Citation: Zong Y, Wang Z, Jiang WL, Yang X.

To the best of our knowledge, fewer than 30 cases have been reported in the literature. More rarely, metastasis to tunica vaginalis testis occurs without involvement of the testes and epididymis.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 65-year-old male who complained of painless swelling of the left scrotum for over 1 wk was referred to the Department of Urology. Scrotal ultrasound showed left testicular hydrocele with paratesticular masses. Chest computed tomography revealed lung metastasis and enlarged left supraclavicular lymph node.The blood tumor markersalpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, and serum lactate dehydrogenase were withinnormal limits.The preoperative diagnosis was left testicular tumor with lung metastasis. Then radical orchidectomy of the left testicle and high ligation of the spermatic cord were performed, and postoperative histopathology suggested metastatic tumors that was confirmed by an abdominal computed tomographic scan. The positive computed tomography findings, in conjunction with the expression of cytokeratin 7 (CK7), CK20, CK5/6, and absence of expression of Wilms’ tumor suppressor gene 1, calretinin, melanocyte, prostate-specific antigen, thyroid transcription factor-1, GATA binding protein 3, caudal type homeobox 2, and napsinA supported the diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

However, IMAVF occurs very rarely and there are few reports in patients during chemotherapy. We report a case of a patient who developed IMAVF during treatment with bevacizumab in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) after colon surgery.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】An 81-year-old man was diagnosed with descending colon cancer and underwent left hemicolectomy without any complications. He was definitely diagnosed with high-risk stage 2 and received tegafur-uracil plus leucovorin as adjuvant chemotherapy. Three years and 6 mo after the operation, the cancer relapsed with peritoneal dissemination. The patient underwent CyberKnife radiosurgery targeting the recurrent tumor and received chemotherapy with S-1 plus bevacizumab. At 1 year after chemotherapy, he complained of severe diarrhea, which is suspected drug-induced colitis. As diarrhea worsened despite the termination of treatment, he underwent colonoscopy and computed tomography (CT) scans that revealed edematous change from sigmoid to rectosigmoid colon. CT scans also revealed an aneurysm adjacent to the inferior mesenteric vein and multidetector CT angiography showed the IMAVF.

However, when a patient’s tumor tissue volume is insufficient for genomic profiling of HRR gene mutations, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) may be useful in helping to determine and monitor the efficacy of olaparib, as well as in abiraterone-combination treatment, and for understanding any resistance mechanism related to such mutations.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 61-year-old man who was diagnosed with metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma was initially hormone sensitivity, showing high Gleason score (5 + 5 = 10) and absolute positive rate (14/14 biopsied specimens). Following failure of several standard therapies, the patient progressed to mCRPC. Surprisingly, the patient showed good response to olaparib-abiraterone-prednisone combination treatment (an androgen-deprivation therapy, provided as the ‘final choice’ in China). Serum total prostate-specific antigen (TPSA) level reduced and symptoms remitted for 4 months. However, thereafter, serum TPSA levels began slowly increasing, indicating development of olaparib resistance. Subsequent comprehensive genomic profiling of ctDNA, screening 508 cancer-related genes by next-generation sequencing, identified 10 somatic variants as well as 3 copy number alterations.

Nerve conduction study showed reduced compound muscle action potentials and loss of sensory nerve action potentials. Symptoms did not improve despite pharmacotherapy and the patient gradually developed flexion restrictions of the index and middle fingers. Median nerve injury and associated flexor tendon adhesion was diagnosed, and the patient was referred for surgery at 3 mo after injury. When the same area was opened, no injury to the median nerve epithelium was obvious, but the area of the positive tinel-like sign was highly adherent to surrounding tissue and to the flexor digitorum superficialis of the index and middle fingers.

The incidence of the disease is low, and it is difficult to diagnose, especially in children. Here, we report a case of DYNC1H1 gene mutation and review the related literature to improve the pediatrician’s understanding of DYNC1H1 gene-related disease to make an early correct diagnosis and provide better services for children.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 4-mo-old Chinese female child with adducted thumbs, high arch feet, and epileptic seizure presented slow response, delayed development, and low limb muscle strength. Electroencephalogram showed abnormal waves, a large number of multifocal sharp waves, sharp slow waves, and multiple spasms with a series of attacks. High-throughput sequencing and Sanger sequencing identified a heterozygous mutation, c.5885G>A (p.R1962H), in the DYNC1H1 gene (NM\\001376) of the proband, which was not identified in her parents. Combined with the clinical manifestations and pedigree of this family, this mutation is likely pathogenic based on the American Academy of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines. The child was followed when she was 1 year and 2 mo old. The magnetic resonance imaging result was consistent with the findings of white matter myelinated dysplasia and congenital giant gyrus. The extensive neuro genic damage to the extremities was considered, as the results of electromyo graphy showed that the motor conduction velocity and sensory conduction of the nerves of the extremities were not abnormal, and the degree of fit of the children with severe contraction was poor. At present, the child is 80 cm in length and 9 kg in weight, with slender limbs and low muscle strength, and still does not raise her head. She cannot sit or speak.

During the course of his illness, the patient variably presented with gastrointestinal symptoms, eczema, vitiligo, mastitis, joint symptoms, nephrotic syndrome, and interstitial pneumonia. The chronic mastitis proved burdensome, necessitating bilateral mastectomy. HE was diagnosed by repeat bone marrow biopsy, and a kidney biopsy showed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Intermittent steroidal therapy is typically initiated to relieve such symptoms, although relapse and organ involvement often ensue once treatment is withdrawn. We administered methylprednisolone sodium succinate (40 mg/d) intravenously for 3 d, followed by oral tablets at the same dose. Subsequent computed tomography (CT) of the chest CT showed relative improvement of the interstitial pneumonia. The patient is currently on a continuous regimen of oral steroid, and his condition is stable.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】HE is heterogeneous condition.

The thyroid mass was initially considered to be benign, then he underwent left radical nephrectomy. One year after the nephrectomy, stereotactic radiosurgery was performed for brain metastasis. During follow-up, the thyroid nodule gradually grew, and the patient manifested swallowing discomfort. Under a clinical diagnosis of thyroid follicular neoplasm, left hemithyroidectomy was performed.

Early diagnosis is essential, as these conditions can first manifest themselves with sudden cardiac death. Electrical complications usually appear before structural complications; therefore, it is important to take into consideration these rare genetic disorders for the differential diagnosis of brady and tachyarrhythmias, even when left ventricle systolic function is still preserved.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 60-year-old man, without history of previous disorders, presented in September 2019 to the emergency department because of the onset of syncope associated with hypotension. The patient was diagnosed with a high-grade atrioventricular block. A dual chamber pacemaker was implanted, but after the onset of a sus tained ventricular tachycardia during physical exertion, a drug eluting stent was implanted on an intermediate stenosis on the left anterior descending artery, which had previously been considered non-haemodynamically significant. Dur ing the follow-up, the treating cardiologist, suspicious of the overall clinical picture, recommended a genetic test for the diagnosis of cardiomyopathies, which tested positive for a pathogenetic mutation of the lamin A/C gene. While await ing the result of the genetic test and, later, the pacemaker to be upgraded to a biventricular defibrillator, a remote monitoring device was given to the patient in order to minimize in-person clinical evaluations during the coronavirus disease 2019-related lockdown.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】This case aims to raise awareness of the cardiological manifestations of laminopathies, which can be dangerously misdiagnosed as other, more common con ditions.\n\n【7】Key Words: Lamin A/C-mutation , Cardiolaminopathy , Ventricular tachyarrhythmias , Remote-monitoring , COVID-19 , Case report\n\n【8】Core Tip: Cardiolaminopathy diagnosis, especially in its initial stage, is challenging.

The clinical phenotypes of CMD are broad, and there are only a few reports of CMD worldwide.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】This report describes the cases of two children with CMD caused by B3GALNT2 gene mutation. The main manifestations of the two cases were abnormal walking posture, language development delay, and abnormal development of the white matter. Case 2 also had unreported symptoms of meningocele and giant arachnoid cyst. Both cases had compound heterozygous mutations of the B3GALNT2 gene, each containing a truncated mutation and a missense mutation, and three of the four loci had not been reported. Nineteen patients with CMD caused by B3GALNT2 gene mutation were found in the literature. Summary and analysis of the characteristics of CMD caused by B3GALNT2 gene mutation showed that 100% of the cases had nervous system involvement.

According to their origin, they may be classified as benign or malignant. Benign TEFs occur mostly as a con sequence of prolonged mechanical ventilation, particularly among patients exposed to endotracheal cuff overinflation. During the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus pandemic, the amount of patients requiring prolonged ventilation rose, which in turn increased the incidence of TEFs.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】We report the cases of 14 patients with different comorbidities such as being over weight, or having been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus or systemic hype rtension. The most common symptoms on arrival were dyspnea and cough. In all cases, the diagnosis of TEFs was made through upper endoscopy. Depending on the location and size of each fistula, either endoscopic or surgical treatment was provided. Eight patients were treated endoscopically. Successful closure of the defect was achieved through over the scope clips in two patients, while three of them required endoscopic metal stenting. A hemoclip was used to successfully treat one patient, and it was used temporarily for another patient pended surgery. Surgical treatment was performed in patients with failed endoscopic man agement, leading to successful defect correction.

As such, it is easily overlooked clinically, thus increasing the difficulty of diagnosis and treatment.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 29-year-old young woman presented with postural headache. Lumbar puncture suggested a pressure of 50 mmH <sub>2 </sub> O (normal 80 mmH <sub>2 </sub> O-180 mmH <sub>2 </sub> O), and magnetic resonance imaging cerebral venography suggested thrombosis of the supratentorial sinus. These findings were considered indicative of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis due to spontaneous intracranial hypotension syndrome after ruling out immunological causes, tumor, infection, abnormal coagulation mechanism, and hypercoagulable state, etc. She was treated with rehydration and low-molecular heparin anticoagulation for 15 d, and follow-up magnetic resonance imaging cerebral venography suggested resolution of the thrombus. The patient had complete improvement of her headache symptoms.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】Spontaneous intracranial hypotension syndrome is one of the rare causes of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, which is frequently misdiagnosed or missed and deserves consideration by clinicians during differential diagnosis. Dehydration should be avoided in such patients, and early rehydration and anticoagulation therapy are effective treatment options.\n\n【7】Key Words: Spontaneous intracranial hypotension , Cerebral venous sinus , Thrombosis , Rehydration , Anticoagulation , Case report\n\n【8】Core Tip: In patients with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis of unknown origin, spontaneous intracranial hypotension syndrome may be considered as a rare cause.

In the case report, LCS occurred on the skin, and there was no CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma in the same lesion. A possible mechanism is that ibrutinib led to the activation of a proto-oncogene that resulted in the malignant transformation of dendritic cells. Still, this hypothesis will have to be explored.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>   Citation: Li SY, Wang Y, Wang LH.

The results of a longitudinal study of TDF treatment demonstrated no development of resistance. We observed one treatment-naïve chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patient who developed TDF resistance after complete viral suppression during long-term TDF treatment. A 37-year-old HBeAg-positive man received TDF 300 mg/d for 43 mo. The hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA titer was 8 log <sub>10 </sub> copies/mL at baseline and became undetectable at 16 mo after treatment. However, the HBV DNA titer rebounded to 7.5 log <sub>10 </sub> copies/mL at 43 mo after treatment. We performed full sequencing to find mutation sites associated with virologic breakthrough. The results showed 9 mutation sites, most of which had not been well-known as mutation sites. We changed the therapy from tenofovir to entecavir with a regimen of 0.5 mg once daily. After 4 mo, the HBV DNA titer decreased to 267 copies/mL, and the liver enzyme levels were normalized.\n\n【2】Key Words: Chronic hepatitis B , Tenofovir , Resistance , Mutation\n\n【3】Core tip: The results of many clinical longitudinal studies of Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) treatment have demonstrated no development of resistance until now. Recently, a few cases of resistance to TDF have been reported. However, the mutation site had not been clearly revealed and confirmed because of the rarity of resistant cases. In the present case, TDF resistance developed following the complete suppression of HBV DNA in a treatment-naïve patient. We detected 9 mutation sites, including some that have been unknown until now. We believe that the present study is helpful in revealing the exact mutation sites associated with TDF resistance.\n\n【4】删除1:<u>   Citation: Cho WH, Lee HJ, Bang KB, Kim SB, Song IH.

Duodenal web as a cause of intestinal obstruction is rare, with an incidence of about 1:20000-1:40000. Furthermore, when described, these con ditions are usually seen in early life and very infrequently in adulthood.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】We report a case of a middle-aged woman with intestinal malrotation who pre sented with a three-month history of right-sided abdominal pain, early satiety, and a 22-pound weight loss. Patient underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which demonstrated numerous retained pills in a deformed first portion of the duodenum, concerning for a partial gastric outlet obstruction. An upper gastr ointestinal series showed marked distention of the proximal duodenum with retained debris and the presence of a windsock sign, increasing the suspicion of a duodenal web. The patient subsequently underwent surgical intervention where a duodenal web with two lumens was noted and resected, opening the duodenum. There were over 150 pill capsules that were removed. The patient is doing well after this intervention.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】Both intestinal malrotation and duodenal webs are infrequently encountered in the adult population.

Intra-abdominal gas gangrene caused by C. perfringens infection after closed abdominal injury is extremely rare, difficult to diagnose, and progresses rapidly with high mortality risk. Here, we report a case of C. perfringens infection caused by closed abdominal injury.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 54-year-old male suffered multiple intestinal tears and necrosis after sustaining an injury caused by falling from a high height. These injuries and the subsequent necrosis resulted in intra-abdominal C. perfringens infection. In the first operation, we removed the necrotic intestinal segment, kept the abdomen open and covered the intestine with a Bogota bag. A vacuum sealing drainage system was used to cover the outer layer of the Bogota bag, and the drainage was flushed under negative pressure. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for sup portive care and empirical antibiotic treatment. The antibiotics were not changed until the results of bacterial culture and drug susceptibility testing were obtained. Two consecutive operations were then performed due to secondary intestinal necrosis. After three definitive operations, the patient successfully survived the perioperative period. Unfortunately, he died of complications related to Guillain-Barre syndrome 75 d after the first surgery. This paper presents this case of intra-abdominal gas gangrene infection and analyzes the diagnosis and treatment based on a review of current literature.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】When the intestines rupture leading to contamination of the abdominal cavity by intestinal contents, C. perfringens bacteria normally present in the intestinal tract may proliferate in large numbers and lead to intra-abdominal infection. Prompt surgical intervention, adequate drainage, appropriate antibiotic therapy, and intensive supportive care comprise the most effective treatment strategy. If the abdominal cavity is heavily contaminated, an open abdominal approach may be a beneficial treatment.\n\n【7】Key Words: Clostridium perfringens , Intra-abdominal infection , Gas gangrene , Open abdomen , Case report\n\n【8】Core Tip: Intra-abdominal gas gangrene caused by closed abdominal injury is extremely rare.

However, the treatment options for advanced HCC are limited to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as sorafenib and lenvatinib. Since previous regimens have an insufficient efficacy, the combination therapy of atezolizumab and bevacizumab (Ate/Bev) has been investigated, which showed an improvement in progression-free and overall survival. However, the adverse events of this combination therapy in advanced HCC have not been established. Herein, we report a novel case of an unresectable HCC and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after a combination therapy of Ate/Bev.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】An 82-year-old male visited our outpatient clinic for an incidentally detected liver mass. Liver magnetic resonance imaging and enhanced chest computed tomography (CT) were performed, which showed arterial hyperenhancement with washout in delayed phase suggesting HCC, and a well-defined metastatic solid nodule, respectively. F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomo graphy (PET)-CT exhibited multiple hypermetabolic lesions in the iliac bone, lumbar vertebrae, and femur. Because of the high burden of the intrahepatic tumor, transarterial radioembolization was initially performed; after 37 d, a combination therapy of Ate/Bev was administered. The patient visited the emergency department three days after Ate/Bev treatment complaining of dyspnea. He was diagnosed with severe pneumonitis based on CT. Despite administering oxygen via a high-flow nasal cannula, the P/F ratio was only 74; therefore, the patient was diagnosed with ARDS based on the overall examination results. Low tidal volume with high positive end-expiratory pressure, sedative agents combined with a neuromuscular blocker, and a systemic steroid were promptly applied to manage the ARDS. However, the patient did not recover from the hypoxia and expired 31 h after being admitted.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】Clinicians should be aware of severe pneumonitis due to the immune-related adverse events of this combination therapy, and patients should be closely monitored after therapy.\n\n【7】Key Words: Hepatocellular carcinoma , Systemic therapy , Adverse events , Pneumonitis , Atezolizumab , Acute respiratory distress syndrome\n\n【8】Core Tip: Nowadays, the combination therapy of atezolizumab and bevacizumab is recommended as the first-line systemic treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinomas. A global phase III study and recent real-world studies demonstrated rare life-threatening adverse events of atezolizumab and bevacizumab. However, our patient underwent acute respiratory distress syndrome and finally died three days after treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of severe respiratory failure resulting in death with a very short interval from atezolizumab and bevacizumab administration.

The abnormal ECG pattern is classified into type A (biphasic T waves) and type B (deeply inverted T waves), based on the T wave pattern seen in the pericodial chest leads.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】We present the case of a 37-year-old male with history of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), gastroparesis, mild peripheral artery disease and right toe cellulitis on IV antibiotics who presented to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain for 3 d and as a result couldn’t take his insulin. Noted to have fasting blood sugar 392 mg/dL. Admitted for diabetic gastroparesis. During the hospital course, the patient was asymptomatic and denied any chest pain. On admission, No ECG and troponin draws were performed. On day 2, the patient became hypoxic with oxygen saturation 80% on room air, intermittent mild right-sided chest pain which he attributed to vomiting from his gastroparesis. Initial ECG done was significant for Biphasic T wave changes in leads V2 and V3 and elevated high sensitivity troponin. Patient was transitioned to cardiac intensive care unit and cardiac catheterization performed with result significant for extensive coronary artery disease.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】This case highlights an exceptional manifestation of Wellen's syndrome, wherein the right coronary artery and circumflex artery display a remarkable 100% constriction, alongside a proximal LAD stenosis of 90%-95%. Notably, this occurrence transpired in a patient grappling with extensive complications arising from T1DM. Moreover, it underscores the utmost significance of promptly recognizing the presence of Wellen's syndrome and swiftly initiating appropriate medical intervention.\n\n【7】Key Words: Wellens’s syndrome , Biphasic T waves , Deeply inverted T waves , Precordial leads , Left anterior descending artery , Pseudo-normalization , Right coronary artery , Left circumflex artery , Case report\n\n【8】Core Tip: When a patient exhibits atypical symptoms preceding chest pain and displays distinct T wave abnormalities on the electrocardiogram, it is crucial to seek immediate cardiology intervention. This entails conducting emergent cardiac catheterization to evaluate the presence of proximal stenosis in the left anterior descending artery, or in rare instances, the right coronary artery and left circumflex artery. Such stenosis can lead to the development of ischemic cardiomyopathy if left untreated. Acting promptly and carefully monitoring the characteristic T wave patterns, alongside normal or minimally elevated cardiac biomarkers, contributes to improved mortality prognosis.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>   Citation: Obi MF, Sharma M, Namireddy V, Gargiulo P, Noel C, Hyun C, Gale BD.

The patient had no obvious history of trauma. X-ray and computed tomography showed fracture of the femoral neck and proximal femur. The patient had undergone surgery 1 year prior to address a fracture of the left proximal femur that had occurred in a traffic accident. Our first consideration was stress fracture of the femoral neck; however, simultaneous stress fractures of the femoral neck and proximal femur of the unilateral femur were seen. The femoral neck stress fracture was a tension fracture, with obvious displacement and varus deformity of the hip.

This means that infertility affects one in six couples and is recognized by the World Health Organization as the fifth most serious global disability. The International Committee for Monitoring Assisted Reproductive Technology reported that the global total of babies born as a result of assisted reproductive technology procedures and other advanced fertility treatments is more than 8 million. Advancements in controlled ovarian hyperstimulation procedures led to crucial accomplishments in human fertility treatments. The European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology guideline on ovarian stimulation gave us valuable evidence-based recommendations to optimize ovarian stimulation in assisted reproductive technology. Conventional ovarian stimulation protocols for in vitro fertilization (IVF)–embryo transfer are based upon the administration of gonadotropins combined with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, either GnRH agonists (GnRHa) or antagonists. The development of ovarian cysts requires the combination of GnRHa and gonadotropins for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. However, in rare cases patients may develop an ovarian hyper response after administration of GnRHa alone.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】Here, two case studies were conducted. In the first case, a 33-year-old female diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome presented for her first IVF cycle at our reproductive center. Fourteen days after triptorelin acetate was administrated (day 18 of her menstrual cycle), bilateral ovaries presented polycystic manifestations. The patient was given 5000 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin. Twenty-two oocytes were obtained, and eight embryos formed. Two blastospheres were transferred in the frozen-thawed embryo transfer cycle, and the patient was impregnated. In the second case, a 37-year-old woman presented to the reproductive center for her first donor IVF cycle. Fourteen days after GnRHa administration, the transvaginal ultrasound revealed six follicles measuring 17-26 mm in the bilateral ovaries. The patient was given 10000 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin. Three oocytes were obtained, and three embryos formed. Two high-grade embryos were transferred in the frozen-thawed embryo transfer cycle, and the patient was impregnated.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】These two special cases provide valuable knowledge through our experience. We hypothesize that oocyte retrieval can be an alternative to cycle cancellation in these conditions. Considering the high progesterone level in most cases of this situation, we advocate freezing embryos after oocyte retrieval rather than fresh embryo transfer.\n\n【7】Key Words: Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist , Ovarian hyperstimulation , In vitro fertilization , Live birth , Infertility , Frozen-thawed embryo transfer , Human chorionic gonadotropin , Case report\n\n【8】Core Tip: Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) is administered in the ‘long protocol’ regimen for pituitary downregulation in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer. The development of ovarian cysts requires gonadotropin administration after pituitary downregulation in the long protocol. However, our cases presented an extremely special condition that a very small group of patients can develop called ovarian hyperstimulation receiving GnRHa alone. It is extremely rare that both patients had a successful egg retrieval during their first in vitro fertilization cycle and were impregnated. These cases provide some experience for clinical judgment and a new insight into the possible mechanisms of GnRHa action without gonadotropins.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>   Citation: Li M, Su P, Zhou LM.

However, limited data on clinical outcomes after KT from ECMO donors left acceptance of these marginal kidneys solely to clinicians. We report a rare case of successful KT from a brain-dead donor who had been supported with therapeutic ECMO for three weeks before the donation. This strongly suggests that expanded criteria donors’ kidneys, even after a donor has been on ECMO for a relatively long duration, can provide favorable outcomes in well-selected recipients.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>   Citation: Seo HW, Lee S, Lee HY, Park SC, Chung BH, Yang CW, Ban TH.

However, it is less commonly used due to its narrow therapeutic range, meaning that its lethal dose is close to its therapeutic dose. The lethal dose of colchicine is considered to be 0.8 mg/kg. As chronic colchicine poisoning has multiple manifestations, it poses a challenge in the clinician’s differential diagnosis. Historically, the drug was important in treating gout; however, clinical studies are currently underway regarding the use of colchicine in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 as well as its use in coronary artery disease, making this drug more important in clinical practice.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 61-year-old male with a history of gout and chronic colchicine intake was admitted to our Emergency Department due to numbness and weakness of the lower limbs. The patient reported a history of colchicine intake for 23 years. After thorough examination, he was diagnosed with colchicine poisoning, manifesting as neuromyopathy, multiple gastric ulcers and myelosuppression. We advised him to stop taking colchicine and drinking alcohol. We also provided a prescription of lansoprazole and mecobalamin, and then asked him to return to the clinic for re-examination. The patient was followed up for 3-mo during which time his gout symptoms were controlled to the point where he was asymptomatic.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】Colchicine overdose can mimic the clinical manifestations of several conditions. Physicians easily pay attention to the disease while ignoring the cause of the disease. Thus, the patient’s medication history should never be ignored.\n\n【7】Key Words: Colchicine poisoning , Neuromyopathy , Myelosuppression , Gastric ulcer , Gout , Case report\n\n【8】Core Tip: With ongoing clinical trials on colchicine use in more generalized diseases, the probability of chronic colchicine poisoning is on the rise.

According to the existing literature, sperm granuloma often occurs unilaterally. Clinical and ultrasound features are similar to epididymal tuberculosis, chronic epididymitis and other diseases. Sperm granuloma is usually diagnosed based on postoperative histopathological and immunohistochemical examination.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】A 46-year-old man was admitted to the hospital due to the presence of a left scrotal mass for 3 mo and aggravation of pain for 1 wk. The lesions at both sites were surgically resected. Postoperative pathological examination showed that the left spermatic cord mass and the right epididymal mass were consistent with sperm granuloma. The sperm granulomas then recurred 3 mo after surgery. There is little change in the local mass so far.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】The case report is helpful for our understanding of this disease.

Remarkably, the granuloma recurred at 3 mo after surgery and this recurrence has not been reported before. Since the patient has no history of vasectomy, tumor or trauma, it is more likely that this case of sperm granuloma is merely caused by inflammation which is rare for sperm granuloma. This case report can greatly enhance our understanding of sperm granuloma and it is helpful for differential diagnosis of various epididymal lesions in clinical practice.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>   Citation: Lv DY, Xie HJ, Cui F, Zhou HY, Shuang WB.

The lumen-apposing metal stent (LAMS) is a novel device recently developed for therapeutic gastrointestinal endoscopy. LAMSs have demonstrated significantly better results with regard to stent migration than fully covered self-expandable metal stents (FCSEMSs).\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】This article presents six cases of symptomatic PAICS successfully treated with a LAMS and a review of the relevant literature. We report a life-saving technique not previously documented and the use of technology to improve patient outcomes. The six patients (median age, 75 years) suffered from vomiting, constipation and recurrent abdominal pain, with symptoms starting 23-25 wk post-surgery. The median stricture length was 1.83 cm. All six patients underwent successful and uneventful bi-flanged metal stent (BFMS)-LAMS placement for benign PAICS. All patients remained asymptomatic during the three months of stent indwelling and up to a median of 7 mo after stent removal. According to the literature, the application of LAMS for PAICS is associated with a < 10% risk of migration and a < 5% risk of bleeding. Conversely, FCSEMS has a high migration rate (15%-50%).\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】The evolving role of interventional endoscopy and the availability of LAMSs provide patients with minimally invasive treatment options, allowing them to avoid more invasive surgical inter ventions.

We present six cases of post-anastomotic ileocolonic strictures successfully treated with a bi-flanged metal stent (NAGI stent) and a review of the relevant literature. The long and broad flanges of the bi-flanged metal stent may reduce the migration rate and improve patient tolerance and thus may represent a suitable alternative to traditional endoscopic options, with better long-term results in the management of luminal gastrointestinal strictures longer than 10 mm and shorter than 30 mm.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>   Citation: Kasapidis P, Mavrogenis G, Mandrekas D, Bazerbachi F.

Severe Clostridium difficile infection (sCDI) is a serious and rare nosocomial diarrheal complication, especially in MSAP patients. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a highly effective treatment for refractory and recurrent CDI (rCDI). However, knowledge regarding the initial use of FMT in patients suffering from sCDI is limited.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】Here, we report an MSAP patient complicated with sCDI who was treated by FMT as a first-line therapy. The patient was a 51-year-old man who suffered from diarrhea in his course of acute pancreatitis. An enzyme immunoassay was performed to detect toxins, and the result was positive for toxin-producing C. difficile and toxin B and negative for C. difficile ribotype 027. The colonoscopy revealed pseudomembranous colitis. Due to these findings, sCDI was our primary consideration. Because the patient provided informed consent for FMT treatment, we initially treated the patient by FMT rather than metronidazole. Diarrhea resolved within 5 d after FMT. The patient remained asymptomatic, and the follow-up colonoscopy performed 40 d after discharge showed a complete recovery. Our case is the first reported in China.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】This case explores the possibilities of initially using FMT to treat severe CDI. Moreover, FMT may become a critical component of the treatment for severe CDI in MSAP patients.\n\n【7】Key Words: Acute pancreatitis , Clostridium difficile infection , Fecal microbiota transplantation , Pseudomembranous colitis , Initial therapy , Case report\n\n【8】Core tip: A rare complication of acute pancreatitis is Clostridium difficile infection (CDI).

Disease progression can be delayed using enzyme replacement therapy (ERT). In patients with classic FD, sporadic accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) in the heart and kidney begins in utero ; however, until childhood, GL-3 accumulation is mild and reversible and can be restored by ERT. The current consensus is that ERT initiation during early childhood is paramount. Nonetheless, complete recovery of organs in patients with advanced FD is challenging.\n\n【3】CASE SUMMARY\n\n【4】Two related male patients, an uncle (patient 1) and nephew (patient 2), presented with classic FD. Both patients were treated by us. Patient 1 was in his 50s, and ERT was initiated following end-organ damage; this was subsequently ineffective. He developed cerebral infarction and died of sudden cardiac arrest. Patient 2 was in his mid-30s, and ERT was initiated when the patient was diagnosed with FD, during which the damage to vital organs was not overtly apparent. Although he had left ventricular hypertrophy at the beginning of this treatment, the degree of hypertrophy progression was limited to a minimal range after > 18 years of ERT.\n\n【5】CONCLUSION\n\n【6】We obtained discouraging ERT outcomes for older patients but encouraging outcomes for younger adults with classic FD.\n\n【7】Key Words: Enzyme replacement therapy , Fabry disease , Pedigree , Left ventricular hypertrophy , α-galactosidase , Case report\n\n【8】Core Tip: Fabry disease (FD) is an inherited metabolic disorder, caused by a genetic mutation or decreased α-galactosidase activity in lysosomes. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is a promising treatment for FD. Few reports have compared the effect of ERT in older adult populations vs. that in populations in their 30s. Here we report the effect of ERT in an older adult and a patient in his mid-30s from the same FD family. We demonstrated that ERT is sufficiently effective for patients in their mid-30s if the major organs such as the brain, heart and kidney are not severely damaged.\n\n【9】删除1:<u>   Citation: Harigane Y, Morimoto I, Suzuki O, Temmoku J, Sakamoto T, Nakamura K, Machii K, Miyata M.
