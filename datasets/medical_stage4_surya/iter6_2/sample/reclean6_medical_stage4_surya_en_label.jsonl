Therefore, regardless of the patient's habitus, use the actual body weight for calculating initial resuscitation drug doses or use a body length tape with precalculated doses (Class IIb, LOE C).\nFor subsequent doses of resuscitation drugs in both nonobese and obese patients, expert providers may consider adjusting doses to achieve the desired therapeutic effect.

The drug has a wide safety margin because of its short half-life. Adenosine should be given only IV or IO, followed by a rapid saline flush to promote drug delivery to the central circulation. If adenosine is given IV, it should be administered as close to the heart as possible. (See also \"Arrhythmia.\")\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Amiodarone\n\n【6】Amiodarone slows AV conduction, prolongs the AV refractory period and QT interval, and slows ventricular conduction (widens the QRS).

(See also \"Arrhythmia.\")\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Precautions\n\n【8】Monitor blood pressure and electrocardiograph (ECG) during intravenous administration of amiodarone. If the patient has a perfusing rhythm, administer the drug as slowly (over 20 to 60 minutes) as the patient's clinical condition allows; if the patient is in VF/pulseless VT, give the drug as a rapid bolus.\nAmiodarone causes hypotension through its vasodilatory property, and the severity is related to the infusion rate; hypotension is less common with the aqueous form of amiodarone.删除26_2:<u> 207</u> Decrease the infusion rate if there is prolongation of the QT interval or heart block; stop the infusion if the QRS widens to > 50% of baseline or hypotension develops. Other potential complications of amiodarone include bradycardia and torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia.\nAmiodarone should not be administered together with another drug that causes QT prolongation, such as procainamide, without expert consultation.\n\n【9】删除10:<u>Downloaded from http://circ.ahajournals.org/ by guest on September 4, 2011</u>\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Atropine\n\n【11】Atropine sulfate is a parasympatholytic drug that accelerates sinus or atrial pacemakers and increases the speed of AV conduction.\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Precautions\n\n【13】Small doses of atropine ( < 0.1 mg) may produce paradoxical bradycardia because of its central effect.删除26_2:<u> 208</u> Larger than recommended doses may be required in special circumstances such as organophosphate poisoning 209 or exposure to nerve gas agents.\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Calcium\n\n【15】Calcium administration is not recommended for pediatric cardiopulmonary arrest in the absence of documented hypocalcemia, calcium channel blocker overdose, hypermagnesemia, or hyperkalemia (Class III, LOE B).

Hepatic dysfunction does not appear to alter the ability of calcium gluconate to raise serum calcium levels.删除26_2:<u> 222</u> In critically ill children, calcium chloride may be preferred because it results in a greater increase in ionized calcium during the treatment of hypocalcemia.删除26_2:<u> 222</u> A In the nonarrest setting, if the only venous access is peripheral, calcium gluconate is recommended because it has a lower osmolality than calcium chloride and is therefore less irritating to the vein.\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Epinephrine\n\n【18】The α -adrenergic-mediated vasoconstriction of epinephrine increases aortic diastolic pressure and thus coronary perfusion pressure, a critical determinant of successful resuscitation from cardiac arrest. 删除2:<u>223 , 224</u>At low doses, the β -adrenergic effects may predominate, leading to decreased systemic vascular resistance; in the doses used during cardiac arrest, the vasoconstrictive α -effects predominate.\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Precautions\n\n【20】•Do not administer catecholamines and sodium bicarbonate simultaneously through an IV catheter or tubing because alkaline solutions such as the bicarbonate inactivate the catecholamines.\n\n【21】•In patients with a perfusing rhythm, epinephrine causes tachycardia; it may also cause ventricular ectopy, tachyarrhythmias, vasoconstriction, and hypertension.\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Glucose\n\n【23】Because infants have a relatively high glucose requirement and low glycogen stores, they may develop hypoglycemia when energy requirements rise.删除26_2:<u> 225</u> Check blood glucose concentration during the resuscitation and treat hypoglycemia promptly (Class I, LOE C).删除26_2:<u> 226</u>\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Lidocaine\n\n【25】Lidocaine decreases automaticity and suppresses ventricular arrhythmias, 227 but is not as effective as amiodarone for improving ROSC or survival to hospital admission among", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": "\n## Medication Dose Calculation\n", "block_text_old": "\n## Medication Dose Calculation\n", "raw_context": [{"text": "Medication Dose Calculation", "bbox": [60.0, 84.0, 239.0, 99.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [59.0, 83.0, 238.0, 98.0], "position": 3, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n\nTo calculate the dose of resuscitation medications, use the child's weight if it is known.

The dose of subcutaneous epinephrine (concentration 1:1000) is 0.01 mg/kg, divided into 3 doses of approximately 0.3 mg administered at 20-minute intervals. Although the nonselective adrenergic properties of epinephrine may cause an increase in heart rate, myocardial irritability, and increased oxygen demand, its use is well-tolerated, even in patients > 35 years of age.删除26_2:<u> 23</u> Terbutaline is given in a subcutaneous dose of 0.25 mg, which can be repeated every 20 minutes for 3 doses. There is no evidence that subcutaneous epinephrine or terbutaline has advantages over inhaled β 2 -agonists. Epinephrine has been administered IV (initiated at 0.25 mcg/min to 1 mcg/min continuous infusion) in severe asthma; however, 1 retrospective investigation indicated a 4% incidence of serious side effects.

Wartime prosperity lifted the birth rate and produced the largest crop of babies ever. Concurrently the death rate has fallen to a new low. Immigration, although a relatively negligible factor, also added about one million, including refugees and displaced persons.\"\n\nDDT SHORTAGE—\"The World Health Organization last month reported a developing shortage of DDT so serious that it threatens the breakdown of the campaign against insect-borne disease, which since the end of the war has wiped out malaria in many parts of the world.

Fatal as the disease is in man, the committee finds its greatest cause for alarm not in the dreadful nature of the disease, nor yet in the difficulties attending its control by sanitary measure  , but in the existence in the United States of numerous societies with large membership which are deliberate and active in the circulation of literature calculated to deceive the people as to the existence of this disease, and to develop obstacles to the health officers in their efforts to eradicate it. It has been frequently asserted that there has not been a single well-es-\n#0 Years Ago tablished case of either rabies or hydrophobia in the great City of New York for the past thirty years, and yet the records of the American Veterinary College show an average of seven cases a year for twenty-five years.\"\n\nX-RAYS—\"Five years have elapsed since删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Prof. Roentgen startled the world by the announcement of his discovery of the rays which are now quite commonly called by his name. We must admit that no more is known today as to the essence of the rays than was contained in Prof. Roentgen's original paper. They do not behave like any other radiation known to science; yet scientific men are generally of the opinion that they belong in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum, perhaps having the shortest wave length of any known radiation—so short that it is not possible to deviate them from their course by any known form of reflecting or refracting substance.\"\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>April 1851\n\n【8】FOSSIL EGG—\"Recently arrived in France, from the island of Madagascar, are three enormous fossil eggs, with some bones of a gigantic bird, which is not doubted to have hatched them, or been hatched from one of them.

Yet little in the history of the area's more recent Puebloan peoples suggested that cannibalism was a widespread practice, and some modern tribes who claim descent from the Anasazi have found claims of cannibalism among their ancestors disturbing.\n\nThe vast majority of Anasazi burials involve whole, articulated skeletons frequently accompanied by decorated ceramic vessels that have become a favorite target of pot hunters in this area. But, as Turner recorded, several dozen sites had fragmented, often burned human remains, and a larger pattern began to emerge. Over the past three decades the total number of human bone specimens from these sites has grown to tens of thousands, representing dozens of individuals spread across 800 years of prehistory and tens of thousands of square kilometers of the American Southwest.\n\nThe assemblage that I analyzed 10 years ago from an Anasazi site in the Mancos Canyon of southwestern Colorado, for instance, contained 2,106 pieces of bone from at least 29 Native American men, women and children.\n\nThese assemblages have been found in settlements ranging from small pueblos to large towns and were often contemporaneous with the abandonment of the dwellings. The bones frequently show evidence of roasting before the flesh was removed. They invariably indicate that people extracted the brain and cracked the limb bones for marrow after removing the muscle tissue. And some of the long bone splinters even show end-polishing, a phenomenon associated with cooking in", "raw_context": [{"text": "Corn agriculturists have inhabited the", "bbox": [502.0, 86.0, 718.0, 101.0]}, {"text": "Four Corners region of the American", "bbox": [502.0, 103.0, 718.0, 117.0]}, {"text": "Southwest for centuries, building their", "bbox": [502.0, 119.0, 718.0, 133.0]}, {"text": "pueblos and spectacular cliff dwellings", "bbox": [502.0, 135.0, 718.0, 149.0]}, {"text": "and leaving one of the richest and most", "bbox": [502.0, 151.0, 718.0, 165.0]}, {"text": "fine-grained archaeological records any-", "bbox": [502.0, 167.0, 717.0, 181.0]}, {"text": "where on earth.

In addition to their effect on public health, unexploded bombs greatly hamper the small and fragile Lao economy, especially by impeding agricultural development.\nAfter the war ended in 1975, bomb disposal groups tried to clear swaths of land with marginal success. But it wasn't until the mid-1990s that a more sophisticated, countrywide program called UXO删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Lao (the national office of which is in Vientiane) was launched by the Lao government with the support of international aid agencies. Finding and disposing of unexploded ordnance, or UXO, is the slow and exacting work of the program's 628 bomb technicians and 23 foreign advisers.\nFor the past two years, Sheinkman, employed first by a government contractor called Management Support Technology and now by Federal Resource Corporation, both based in Fairfax, Va., has as- sisted the group in using U.S. bombing records and digital mapping technology to identify areas most likely to be strewn with unexploded bombs. His work is an outgrowth of U.S. funding that began three years ago, when the U.S. Department of Defense's Humanitarian Demining Office began assisting UXO Lao with training and equipment. In late 1998\nSheinkman and his Lao advisees began charting old bombing runs that may have left unexploded ordnance in their wake.\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Bomb Sniffing\n\nTHE DIGITAL MAPS splashed across删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Sheinkman's office incorporate bombing data that had to be painstakingly culled from electronic records kept by the U.S. military during the war.

He and his colleagues at Bolling删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Air Force Base's History Support Office planned to write a history of air combat operations during the Vietnam War. He was browsing the office library and found an index of U.S. bombing records. \"It had pages and pages of databases from the Vietnam War era,\" Stanley marvels. \"I thought, 'This is just incredible.' \"\nThe index, from a Rand Corporation study published in 1976, inspired Stanley to seek the actual magnetic tapes embedded with streams of arcane numerical codes used by the U.S. military during the war. Stanley realized that those tapes—if they still existed—should denote bomb and aircraft types, target coordinates and other information about U.S. bombing missions in Southeast Asia. Military analysts knew nothing of the antiquated records.\nStanley next checked closer to home, at the National Archives, in Maryland.\n\n【7】NINE-TRACK TAPES such as these contained code-within-code information about bombing during the Vietnam War—a planeload of bombs every eight minutes for nine years.

With exercise, the lungs' passages actually dilate and open up more. Exercise is good for the lungs! You have a responsibility to report any exercise-related symptoms to your physician or asthma specialist. Your treating doctor has a responsibility, in turn, to address the emergence of exercise-related symptoms and advise you on appropriate measures and treatment.\n\n【1】Successful treatment of asthma always includes a prescription for aerobic exercise. A balanced exercise program, tailored to a person's specific interests and abilities, is ideal and inherent to good health. Exercise can be separated into aerobic, flexibility, and anaerobic activities. The first achieves cardio-pul删除16:<u>¬ </u>monary fitness, the second targets the range of muscle and joint motion, and the third focuses on muscle build-up and strength. Pedaling a bicycle is an example of aerobic exercise. As you pedal faster, your heart and lungs work in tandem to provide oxygen to exercising muscles while excreting acids from the accumulating effort. Yoga is an example of a flexibility exercise. Weightlifting is an anaerobic exercise. A good exercise regimen can incorporate a balance of all three types of exercise, with particular emphasis on aerobic activities.\n\n【2】Studies have identified factors that tend to trigger asthmatic symptoms during exercise.

If the child is responsive, he or she will answer, move, or moan. Quickly check to see if the child has any injuries or needs medical assistance. If you are alone and the child is breathing, leave the child to phone the emergency response system, but return quickly and recheck the child's condition frequently. Children with respiratory distress often assume a position that maintains airway patency and optimizes ventilation. Allow the child with respiratory distress to remain in a position that is most comfortable. If the child is unresponsive, shout for help.\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Check For Breathing\n\n【14】If you see regular breathing, the victim does not need CPR.\nIf there is no evidence of trauma, turn the child onto the side (recovery position), which helps maintain a patent airway and decreases risk of aspiration.\nIf the victim is unresponsive and not breathing (or only gasping), begin CPR. Sometimes victims who require CPR will gasp, which may be misinterpreted as breathing. Treat the victim with gasps as though there is no breathing and begin CPR. Formal training as well as \"just in time\" training, such as that provided by an emergency response system dispatcher, should emphasize how to recognize the difference between gasping and normal breathing; rescuers should be instructed to provide CPR even when the unresponsive victim has occasional gasps (Class IIa, LOE C).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": " blood flow to vital organs and to achieve ROSC.

If cricoid pressure is used in special circumstances during cardiac arrest, the pressure should be adjusted, relaxed, or released if it impedes ventilation or advanced airway placement. The routine use of cricoid pressure in cardiac arrest is not recommended (Class III, LOE C).\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Oropharyngeal Airways\n\n【15】Although studies have not specifically considered the use of oropharyngeal airways in patients with cardiac arrest, airways may aid in the delivery of adequate ventilation with a bag-mask device by preventing the tongue from occluding the airway. Incorrect insertion of an oropharyngeal airway can displace the tongue into the hypopharynx, causing airway obstruction. To facilitate delivery of ventilations with a bag-mask device, oropharyngeal airways can be used in unconscious (unresponsive) patients with no cough or gag reflex and should be inserted only by persons trained in their use (Class IIa, LOE C).\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Nasopharyngeal Airways\n\nNasopharyngeal airways are useful in patients with airway obstruction or those at risk for developing airway obstruction, particularly when conditions such as a clenched jaw prevent placement of an oral airway.

Now biotech companies and their investors are betting that a similar souped-up, assembly-line approach can be applied to the new science of proteomics: an effort to catalogue which proteins our genes encode and to decipher how these proteins function to direct the behavior of a cell, an organ or a next-door neighbor.\nThe latest boast comes from researchers at Myriad Genetics in Salt删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Lake City, who in April announced that they plan to map the entire human proteome in less than three years. To do this, Myriad has spawned a subsidiary, called Myriad Proteomics, with Hitachi and Oracle, which will supply the hardware and the database software needed to handle the massive amount of information that will be generated by the project.\nTheir bold proclamation has raised a few eyebrows in the scientific community. \"It's easy to say that you'll complete a comprehensive proteome map,\" notes Marc Vidal of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.\n\n\"But none of us knows what that means.\"\nThere may be only one genome, but when it comes to the proteome, different proteins can be more or less active in different cells at different times during development, under different physiological conditions or in different disease states. The proteome's nature \"makes it hard to define what we're doing—not just删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Myriad, but all of us,\" remarks Joshua La-删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Baer, director of the Institute of Proteomics at删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Harvard Medical School. \"There's no such thing as a human proteome,\" adds Keith L.\n\n【5】Williams, CEO of Proteome Systems, headquartered in Sydney, Australia. Look at the liver, for example, he says: \"After a glass of red wine, you'll have a different proteome.\" \"'Proteomics' is a newly invented word, so it means different things to different people,\" notes Sudhir Sahasrabudhe, executive vice president of research at Myriad Genet- ics. For its part, Myriad is narrowing its definition: it will zero in on \"systematically uncovering all protein-protein interactions,\" Sahasrabudhe says. With a detailed inventory of which proteins touch one another inside cells, scientists can begin to place proteins within biochemical pathways and predict their intracellular operations.\nTo accomplish this feat, Myriad has been industrializing techniques that scientists have traditionally used to examine protein interactions one at a time. One such method is the yeast two-hybrid system. It uses a single bait protein to fish for binding partners in a sea of prey proteins produced artificially inside a yeast cell. The binding of bait to prey activates a reporter gene, allowing researchers to easily detect when an interaction occurs.\nMyriad will adopt a \"shotgun\" approach, throwing together collections of bait and collections of prey to see what falls out. Repeat the analysis again and again, looking at tens of thousands of reactions a day, and the bulk of the interactions will reveal themselves, Sahasrabudhe says. If the human proteome contains删除26_1:<u> 300,000</u> to删除26_1:<u> 400,000</u> proteins, each of which interacts on average with an estimated five to 10 protein partners, it should take three years to generate a comprehensive map.\nAt that point, the problem becomes ascertaining which of these interactions are biologically meaningful. Two proteins may be physically able to interact but may never actually meet up in a cell. To filter out such false positives, Sahasrabudhe envisions follow-up studies to assess whether interactions in the primary map are physiologically relevant.\nTime will tell how successful this largescale approach will be. Even Myriad's official press announcement of its proteome plan includes a boilerplate disclaimer: \"This news release includes forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, including statements regarding the ability of Myriad Proteomics to map the entire human proteome in less than three years.\" In any case, Williams says, \"We wish them luck.\"\n\n【6】Karen Hopkin is a Boston-based writer who was relieved to learn that she isn't the only one who has trouble defining \"proteome.\"\n\n【7】, 删除0:<u>©</u> NATURE 2001\n\n【8】C MILLAN MAGAZINES L T D . ,", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": " PROTEOME SAMPLER shows 1,458 yeast proteins ( circles ) and their 1,948 interactions ( lines ).

Visual feedback helps quite a bit.\" \"It can pick up an object and manipulate something on that object,\" adds Robert Ambrose, Robonaut project leader at the Johnson center. \"It can use a pistol-grip drill designed for a human, and it can articulate the trigger.\nThat's very unusual for a robot.\" Engineers plan to have Robonaut function beyond telepresence, operating on voice command.\nThen, too, some Robonaut technology might come in handy down here on Earth. In删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Somerset, England, scientists have developed a robot that incorporates the brain of the primitive sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus .\nWhen fed information through light sensors, the brain sends signals to the robot's motors, telling it how to respond. Such technology could allow prosthetics to be controlled directly from the brain. Developing prosthetics from Robonaut, however, is not in NASA's immediate future. \"It is not impossible,\" Culbert explains.\n\n【6】\"But to interface it to the human nervous system—we don't have that capability.\"\nIn fact, only late last year did the NASA team install Robonaut's left hand and torso. The best prediction is that it will be two years before the robot is ready for launch. The slow pace stems in large part from the project's minimal funding. \"A lot of the attitude will change as the station becomes more and more of a burden on the astronauts,\" Lovchik says. \"Systems like this will look much, much better.\"\n\n【7】Phil Scott is a technology writer based in New York City .\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Robonaut\"S\n\n【9】Has more than 47 degrees of freedom, 14 in each hand alone; human hands have 22\n\n【10】Has half the grip strength of a human, and arm can lift only 21 pounds—still strong enough for space work\n\n【11】Incorporates various sensors, including thermal, positional, tactile, force and torque instrumentation; each arm has more than 150 sensors\n\n【12】Relies on software written in C and C++\n\nWhy Robonaut resembles bounty hunter Boba Fett from删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Star Wars: \"The face had to meet a couple of characteristics: it had to support the cameras— the eyes—and have room for additional cameras, small ones pointing down through the chin.

For a child who is unresponsive and not breathing normally, if a pulse cannot be detected within 10 seconds, healthcare providers should begin CPR.\n\n【4】•More data support the safety and effectiveness of cuffed endotracheal tubes in infants and young children, and the formula for selecting the appropriately sized cuffed tube has been updated.\n\n【5】•The safety and value of using cricoid pressure during emergency intubation has been questioned. It is therefore recommended that the application of cricoid pressure should be modified or discontinued if it impedes ventilation or the speed or ease of intubation.\nMonitoring capnography/capnometry is again recommended to confirm proper endotracheal tube (and other advanced airway) position and may be useful during CPR to assess and optimize quality of chest compressions.\n\n【6】•The optimal energy dose required for defibrillation (using either a monophasic or biphasic waveform) in infants and children is unknown. When shocks are indicated for VF or pulseless VT in infants and children, an initial energy dose of 2 to 4 J/kg of either waveform is reasonable; doses higher than 4 J/kg, especially if delivered with a biphasic defibrillator, may also be safe and effective.\n\n【7】•On the basis of increasing evidence of potential harm from high oxygen exposure after cardiac arrest, once spontaneous circulation is restored, inspired oxygen should be titrated to limit the risk of hyperoxemia.\n\n【8】•New sections have been added on resuscitation of infants and children with a single ventricle, after a variety of palliative procedures, and with pulmonary hypertension.\nThere is recognition that for some young victims of sudden death, no cause of death is found on routine autopsy but these victims are found to have a genetic ion channel defect (channelopathy) that predisposes them to a fatal arrhythmia. It is therefore recommended that young victims of a sudden, unexpected cardiac arrest should have an unrestricted, complete autopsy when possible with appropriate preservation and genetic analysis of tissue. Detailed testing may reveal an inherited channelopathy that may also be present in surviving family members.\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Neonatal Resuscitation\n\n【10】The etiology of neonatal arrests is nearly always asphyxia.\nTherefore, the A-B-C sequence has been retained for resuscitation of neonates unless there is a known cardiac etiology.\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Assessment, Supplementary Oxygen, And删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Peripartum Suctioning\n\n【12】When assessing an infant's cardiorespiratory transition and need for resuscitation, the best indicators were found to be increasing heart rate, effective respirations, and good tone.\nPulse oximetry, with the probe attached to the right upper extremity, should be used to assess any need for supplementary oxygen. Studies demonstrate that healthy babies born at term start with an oxygen saturation of < 60% and will take > 10 minutes to reach a saturation of > 90%. Hyperoxia can be toxic, particularly to the preterm infant. For babies born at term, it is best to begin resuscitation with room air rather than 100% oxygen. Any supplementary oxygen administered should be regulated by blending oxygen and air, using oximetry to guide titration of the blend delivered.\nThe role of peripartum suctioning has been deemphasized.\nThere is no evidence to support airway suctioning in active babies, even in the presence of meconium. The available evidence does not support or refute the routine endotracheal suctioning of non-vigorous infants born through meconiumstained amniotic fluid.\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Chest Compressions\n\n【14】The recommended compression-ventilation ratio remains 3:1 because ventilation is critical to reversal of newborn asphyxial arrest and higher ratios may decrease minute ventilation. If the arrest is known to be of cardiac etiology, a higher ratio (15:2) should be considered. If epinephrine is indicated, a dose of 0.01 to 0.03 mg/kg should be administered IV as soon as possible. When using the endotracheal route it is likely that a larger dose (0.05 mg/kg to 0.1 mg/kg) will be required.\n\nPostresuscitation Care (Post-Cardiac Arrest Care)删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Therapeutic hypothermia is recommended for babies born near term with evolving moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.

With this rule, a single + grows into four more +'s, each of which grows likewise, and so forth.\nSuch weedlike proliferation does not shed much light on the principles of replication, because there is no significant machine. Of course, that invites the question of how you would tell a \"significant\" machine from a trivially prolific automata.\nNo one has yet devised a satisfactory answer. What is clear, however, is that the replicating structure must in some sense be complex. For example, it must consist of multiple, diverse components whose interactions collectively bring about replication—the proverbial \"whole must be greater than the sum of the parts.\" The existence of multiple distinct components permits a self-description to be stored within the replicating structure.\nIn the years since von Neumann's seminal work, many researchers have probed the domain between the complex and the trivial, developing replicators that require fewer components, less space or simpler rules. A major step forward was taken in 1984 when Christopher G. Langton, then at the University of Michigan, observed that looplike storage devices—which had formed modules of earlier self-replicating machines—could be programmed to replicate on their own. These devices typically consist of two pieces: the loop itself, which is a string of components that circulate around a rectangle, and a construction arm, which protrudes from a corner of the rectangle into the surrounding space. The circulating components constitute a recipe for the loop—for example, \"go three squares ahead, then turn left.\" When this recipe reaches the construction arm, the automata rules make a copy of it.  One copy continues around the loop; the other goes down the arm, where it is interpreted as instructions.\nBy giving up the requirement of universal construction, which was central to von Neumann's approach, Langton showed that a replicator could be constructed from just seven unique components occupying only 86 cells.

This process is arduous and often frustrating; a small change to one of the rules results in an entirely different global behavior, most likely the disintegration of the structure in question. But recent work has gone beyond the direct-design approach.\nInstead of tailoring the rules to suit a par- ticular type of structure, researchers have experimented with various sets of rules, filled the cellular-automata grid with a \"primordial soup\" of randomly selected components and checked whether selfreplicators emerged spontaneously.\nIn 1997 Hui-Hsien Chou, now at删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Iowa State University, and Reggia noticed that as long as the initial density of the free-floating components was above a certain threshold, small self-replicating loops reliably appeared. Loops that collided underwent annihilation, so there was an ongoing process of death as well as birth.\nOver time, loops proliferated, grew in size and evolved through mutations triggered by debris from past collisions.

Once the earth formed 4.5 billion years ago, asteroid impacts periodically shattered and sterilized the planet's surface for another half a billion years. And yet, within a few hundred million years of that hellish age, microscopic life appeared in abundance. Sometime in the interim, the first living entity must have been crafted from air, water and rock.\nOf those three raw materials, the atmosphere and oceans have long enjoyed the starring roles in origins-of-life scenarios. But rocks, and the minerals of which they are made, have been called on only as bit players or simply as props.\nScientists are now realizing that such limited casting is a mistake. Indeed, a recent flurry of fascinating experiments is revealing that minerals play a crucial part in the basic chemical reactions from which life must have arisen.\nThe first act of life's origin story must have introduced collections of carbon-based molecules that could make copies of themselves.

His 1997\nNew England Journal of Medicine investigation found that yapping while driving makes for about a fourfold increase in the risk of crashing.)删除换行1:<u>| |</u>The Academy Award study subjects included all 762 actors and actresses ever nominated for a leading or supporting\n\n【5】Oscar. Another 887 non-nominees who appeared in the same films and were about the same age acted, in some of their best work, as controls. Redelmeier divided the entire cohort into three groups.\n\n\"Winners\" include 94-year-old Katharine删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Hepburn (a record four Oscars), who we sincerely hope is still alive when this issue hits the stands. Among the \"nominees\" is Robert Downey, Jr., about whom we can say the same thing. The \"controls\" cate- gory catches Lorne Greene, who was a chemical engineering student before coming to his senses.\nThe researchers analyzed the data in multiple ways to make sure that winning an Oscar led to increased longevity and not the other way around. Satisfied that they were looking in the right direction, they determined that Oscar winners live 3.9 years longer than members of the other two groups. (Shirley MacLaine can presumably divvy up the time over her next few lives.) Nominees who don't win live no longer than those never nominated. Apparently, it is \"an honor just to be nominated,\" and it is just an honor to be nominated.\nThe 3.9 years to the victors is an even more astounding statistic than it may at first seem. \"For perspective,\"\nRedelmeier says, \"if you were to cure all cancers in all people for all time for all of North America, you add only about 3.5 years to life expectancy.\" And if you win additional Oscars, you get another two years.\nPerhaps the Oscar winner has more help keeping healthy, in the form of personal trainers, chefs, nannies and managers. Whatever the underlying factors, winning an Oscar today is a bigger deal than ever. The first awards ceremony, in 1929, took place in a hotel banquet room; the latest one was watched by perhaps a billion television viewers, who saw Julia Roberts cop the prize for best actress. Dentures may eventually stand in for her teeth, but that smile looks like it's going to get flashed across movie screens for a long, long time. a", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": "# Antigravity\n", "block_text_old": "# Antigravity\n", "raw_context": [{"text": "ANTIGRAVITY", "bbox": [59.0, 54.0, 314.0, 97.0]}], "block_type": "Title", "full_blocks": [58.0, 53.0, 313.0, 96.0], "position": 0, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n## And The Winner Really Is The Best Years Of Their Lives May Be Oscar Winners’ Extra Ones, As They Slow Down The Journey From Here To Eternity   By Steve Mirsky\n", "block_text_old": "\n## And The Winner Really Is The Best Years Of Their Lives May Be Oscar Winners’ Extra Ones, As They Slow Down The Journey From Here To Eternity   By Steve Mirsky\n", "raw_context": [{"text": "And the Winner Really Is ", "bbox": [61.0, 226.0, 520.0, 269.0]}, {"text": "THE BEST YEARS OF THEIR LIVES MAY BE OSCAR WINNERS’ EXTRA ONES,", "bbox": [61.0, 272.0, 499.0, 292.0]}, {"text": "AS THEY SLOW DOWN THE JOURNEY FROM HERE TO ETERNITY   BY STEVE MIRSKY", "bbox": [61.0, 292.0, 566.0, 310.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [60.0, 225.0, 565.0, 309.0], "position": 2, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n\nAt the annual Oscars ceremony, the presenters in recent years have avoided saying, \"And the winner is\" in favor of \"And the Oscar goes to.\" This way the other four poor nominees allegedly aren't losers.\nExcept that everyone knows that the\nGladiator guy, Russell Crowe, won for best actor this year and the other four guys lost , and if you need proof that what they did was lose, try to name them.\n\n(If you guessed Tom Hanks, well, yes, but that's pretty much a given.)\nAnyway, if the competition for an\nOscar has been cutthroat up until now, wait until next year: according to new research, winning an Academy Award for acting gets you a little statue for your mantel plus about four extra years of life in which to savor the victory.\n\nDonald A.

Singh, whose report \"Survival in Academy Award–Winning Actors and Actresses\" appeared in the May 15 issue of Annals of Internal Medicine, thought that examining the Oscars would be an innovative way to see how social status and health are intertwined. \"We are trying to take advantage of these high-profile performers,\" Redelmeier says, \"to make a much more serious point that is relevant to every person in society— namely, that social factors have a major influence on a person's health.\" (Redelmeier, an epidemiologist whose affiliations include a professorship in medicine at the University of Toronto, was probably best known before this star turn as the man who took the cell phone", "raw_context": [{"text": "At the annual Oscars ceremony, the pre-", "bbox": [61.0, 327.0, 277.0, 341.0]}, {"text": "senters in recent years have avoided say-", "bbox": [61.0, 344.0, 276.0, 356.0]}, {"text": "ing, \"And the winner is\" in favor of \"And", "bbox": [61.0, 359.0, 278.0, 374.0]}, {"text": "the Oscar goes to.\" This way the other", "bbox": [61.0, 374.0, 277.0, 389.0]}, {"text": "four poor nominees allegedly aren't losers.", "bbox": [61.0, 391.0, 276.0, 405.0]}, {"text": "Except that everyone knows that the", "bbox": [61.0, 407.0, 277.0, 422.0]}, {"text": "Gladiator guy, Russell Crowe, won for", "bbox": [61.0, 423.0, 277.0, 437.0]}, {"text": "best actor this year and the other four guys", "bbox": [61.0, 439.0, 278.0, 453.0]}, {"text": "lost , and if you need proof that what", "bbox": [61.0, 455.0, 253.0, 469.0]}, {"text": "they did was lose, try to name them.", "bbox": [61.0, 471.0, 253.0, 485.0]}, {"text": "(If you guessed Tom Hanks, well,", "bbox": [61.0, 487.0, 254.0, 501.0]}, {"text": "yes, but that's pretty much a given.)", "bbox": [61.0, 503.0, 254.0, 517.0]}, {"text": "Anyway, if the competition for an", "bbox": [62.0, 519.0, 254.0, 534.0]}, {"text": "Oscar has been cutthroat up until", "bbox": [61.0, 535.0, 254.0, 549.0]}, {"text": "now, wait until next year: according", "bbox": [61.0, 551.0, 254.0, 565.0]}, {"text": "to new research, winning an Acade-", "bbox": [61.0, 567.0, 252.0, 581.0]}, {"text": "my Award for acting gets you a little", "bbox": [61.0, 583.0, 253.0, 597.0]}, {"text": "statue for your mantel plus about", "bbox": [61.0, 599.0, 254.0, 614.0]}, {"text": "four extra years of life in which to", "bbox": [61.0, 615.0, 254.0, 629.0]}, {"text": "savor the victory.", "bbox": [61.0, 632.0, 156.0, 645.0]}, {"text": "Donald A.

In most cases, a DNAR order is preceded by a documented discussion with the patient, family, or surrogate decision maker addressing the patient's wishes about resuscitation interventions. In addition, some jurisdictions may require confirmation by a witness or a second treating physician.\nSurrogate Decision Makers删除换行1:<u>| |</u>In the event of incapacity, an adult may require a surrogate decision maker to make medical decisions. In the event that the individual has a durable power of attorney for health care, the person appointed by that document is authorized to make medical decisions within the scope of authority granted by the document. If the individual has a court-appointed guardian with authority to make healthcare decisions, the guardian becomes the authorized surrogate.\nIf there is no court-appointed or other authority, a close relative or friend can become a surrogate decision maker. Most jurisdictions have laws that designate the legally authorized surrogate decision maker for an incompetent patient who has not identified a decision maker through a durable power of attorney for health care. Surrogate decision makers should base their decisions on the individual's previously expressed preferences, if known; otherwise, surrogates should make decisions based on their understanding of what constitutes the best interests of the individual.\nPediatric Decision Making删除换行1:<u>| |</u>As a general rule, minors are considered incompetent to provide legally binding consent about their health care. Parents or guardians are generally empowered to make healthcare decisions on their behalf, and in most situations, parents are given wide latitude in terms of the decisions they make on behalf of their children. Parental authority is not absolute, however, and when a parent or guardian's decision appears to place the child at significant risk of serious harm as compared to other options, medical providers may seek to involve state agencies (eg, child protective services or a court determination) to allow treatment of the child over parental objections.删除26_2:<u> 18</u>删除换行1:<u>| |</u>A child should be involved in decision making at a level appropriate for the child's maturity. Children should be asked to consent to healthcare decisions when able within the legal definition of a consenting adult based on local policy and legislation. Children < 14 years of age (in Canada) and < 18 years of age (in the US) rarely possess the legal authority to consent to their health care except under specific legally defined situations (emancipated minors, mature minors, and for specific health conditions such as sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy-related care). In situations where an older child will not consent, the dissent should be carefully considered by the treating provider.\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Principle Of Futility\n\n【2】Patients or families may ask for care that is highly unlikely to improve health outcomes. Healthcare providers, however, are not obliged to provide such care when there is scientific and social consensus that the treatment is ineffective. If the purpose of a medical treatment cannot be achieved, the treatment can be considered futile.\nAn objective criterion for medical futility was defined in 1990 for interventions and drug therapy as imparting a < 1% chance of survival.删除26_2:<u> 19</u> Although this criterion may be controversial, it remains a basis for current futility research. An obvious example of an inappropriate or futile intervention is providing CPR for a patient who has suffered irreversible death. Without objective signs of irreversible death (eg, decapitation, rigor mortis, or decomposition) and in the absence of known advance directives declining resuscitative attempts, full resuscitation should be offered.\nConditions such as irreversible brain damage or brain death cannot be reliably assessed or predicted at the time of cardiac arrest. Withholding resuscitation and the discontinuation of life-sustaining treatment during or after resuscitation are ethically equivalent. In situations where the prognosis is uncertain, a trial of treatment may be initiated while further information is gathered to help determine the likelihood of survival, the patient's preferences, and the expected clinical course (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Witholding And Withdrawing Cpr (Termination Of Resuscitative Efforts) Related To Out-Of Hospital Cardiac Arrest (Ohca)删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Criteria For Not Starting Cpr In All Ohca\n\n【4】Basic life support (BLS) training urges all potential rescuers to immediately begin CPR without seeking consent, because any delay in care dramatically decreases the chances of survival.\nWhile the general rule is to provide emergency treatment to a victim of cardiac arrest, there are a few exceptions where withholding CPR might be appropriate, as follows:\n\n•Situations where attempts to perform CPR would place the rescuer at risk of serious injury or mortal peril\n•Obvious clinical signs of irreversible death (eg, rigor mortis, dependent lividity, decapitation, transection, or decomposition)\n•A valid, signed, and dated advance directive indicating that resuscitation is not desired, or a valid, signed, and dated删除换行1:<u>| |</u>DNAR order", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": " living will affects the care received, and a durable power of attorney accounts for unforeseen circumstances.

If the individual has a court-appointed guardian with authority to make healthcare decisions, the guardian becomes the authorized surrogate.\nIf there is no court-appointed or other authority, a close relative or friend can become a surrogate decision maker. Most jurisdictions have laws that designate the legally authorized surrogate decision maker for an incompetent patient who has not identified a decision maker through a durable power of attorney for health care. Surrogate decision makers should base their decisions on the individual's previously expressed preferences, if known; otherwise, surrogates should make decisions based on their understanding of what constitutes the best interests of the individual.\nPediatric Decision Making\nAs a general rule, minors are considered incompetent to provide legally binding consent about their health care. Parents or guardians are generally empowered to make healthcare decisions on their behalf, and in most situations, parents are given wide latitude in terms of the decisions they make on behalf of their children. Parental authority is not absolute, however, and when a parent or guardian's decision appears to place the child at significant risk of serious harm as compared to other options, medical providers may seek to involve state agencies (eg, child", "block_text_old": " living will affects the care received, and a durable power of attorney accounts for unforeseen circumstances. The latter decisions may be in conflict with the living will or advance directive; at the time of the unforeseen circumstances they are considered to be valid expressions of the patient's best interests. 14 A comprehensive healthcare advance directive combines the living will and the durable power of attorney for health care into one legally binding document.\n\nAs a patient's medical condition and desire for types of medical treatment may change over time, all types of advance directives should be revisited regularly. Most importantly the presence of an advance directive, a living will, or a durable power of attorney for health care is closely associated with ensuring that personal preferences match the actual care received, as documented in a survey of surrogates for patients of at least 60 years of age who died between 2000 and 2006 and required surrogate decision making at some point in their care. 14 A Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAR) order is given by a licensed physician or alternative authority as per local regulation, and it must be signed and dated to be valid. 15. 16 In many settings, \"Allow Natural Death\" (AND) is becoming a preferred term to replace DNAR, to emphasize that the order is to allow natural consequences of a disease or injury, and to emphasize ongoing end-of-life care. 17 The DNAR order should explicitly describe the resuscitation interventions to be performed in the event of a life-threatening emergency. In most cases, a DNAR order is preceded by a documented discussion with the patient, family, or surrogate decision maker addressing the patient's wishes about resuscitation interventions.

Under normal conditions potential differences across membranes, especially cardiac, are not affected by alterations in potassium level. Rapid or significant changes in serum concentrations of potassium result from the shifting of potassium from one space to another and may have life-threatening consequences.\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Hyperkalemia\n\nHyperkalemia is one of the few potentially lethal electrolyte disturbances. Severe hyperkalemia (defined as a serum potassium concentration > 6.5 mmol/L) occurs most commonly from renal failure or from release of potassium from cells and can cause cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. In 1 retrospective in-hospital study of 29 063 patients, hyperkalemia was found to be directly responsible for sudden cardiac arrest in 7 cases.删除26_2:<u> 199</u>删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Acute kidney injury was present in all the arrest cases, accompanied by acute pancreatitis in 3 cases and acute hepatic failure in 2 cases. Overall renal failure and drug treatment were the most common causes of hyperkalemia, with the most severe cases occurring when excessive IV potassium was administered to a patient with renal insufficiency.\nAlthough severe hyperkalemia may cause flaccid paralysis, paresthesia, depressed deep tendon reflexes, or respiratory difficulties, 删除2:<u>200–202</u>the first indicator of hyperkalemia may be the presence of peaked T waves (tenting) on the electrocardiogram (ECG). As serum potassium rises, the ECG may progressively develop flattened or absent P waves, a prolonged PR interval, widened QRS complex, deepened S waves, and merging of S and T waves 删除图片5:<u>(Figure 5)</u>. If hyperkalemia is left untreated, a sine-wave pattern, idioventricular rhythms, and asystolic cardiac arrest may develop.删除26_1:<u> 203,204</u>\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Acls Modifications In Management Of Severe删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Cardiotoxicity Or Cardiac Arrest Due To Hyperkalemia\n\nTreatment of severe hyperkalemia aims at protecting the heart from the effects of hyperkalemia by antagonizing the effect of potassium on excitable cell membranes, forcing potassium into cells to remove it promptly from the circulation, and removing potassium from the body. Therapies that shift potassium will act rapidly but are temporary and thus may need to be repeated.

They process carcasses with tools of stone or metal. In so doing, they leave imprints of their presence and actions in the form of scars on the bones. These same imprints can be seen on butchered human skeletal remains.\nThe key to recognizing human cannibalism is to identify the patterns of processing—that is, the cut marks, hammering damage, fractures or burns seen on the remains—as well as the survival of different bones and parts of bones. Nutritionally valuable tissues, such as brains and marrow, reside within the bones and can be removed only with forceful hammering—and such forced entry leaves revealing patterns of bone damage. When human bones from archaeological sites show patterns of damage uniquely linked to butchery by other humans, the infer-\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>ence of cannibalism is strengthened. Judging which patterns are consistent with dietary butchery can be based on the associated archaeological record—particularly the nonhuman food-animal remains discovered in sites formed by the same culture—and checked against predictions embedded in ethnohistorical accounts.\nThis comparative system of determining cannibalism emphasizes multiple lines of osteological damage and contextual evidence. And, as noted earlier, it sets the standard for recognizing cannibalism very high. With this approach, for instance, the presence of cut marks on bones would not by themselves be considered evidence of cannibalism. For example, an American Civil War cemetery would contain skeletal remains with cut marks made by bayonets and swords, but this would not constitute evidence of cannibalism. Medical school cadavers are dissected, their bones cut-marked, but cannibalism is not part of this ritual.\nWith the threshold set so conservatively, most instances of past cannibalism will necessarily go unrecognized.

Tools were also used to make finer slices, to remove tissue or to sever heads from bodies.\nArchaeologists have to be careful in their interpretations, however, because humans process their dead in many ways; not all slice or hack marks indicate cannibalism. tice from Papua New Guinea, where cannibalism was recorded ethnographically, illustrates this point. There skulls of the deceased were carefully cleaned and the brains removed. The dry, mostly intact skulls were then handled extensively, often creating a polish on their projecting parts. They were sometimes painted and even mounted on poles for display and worship. Soft tissue, including brain matter, was eaten at the beginning of this process; thus, the practice would be identified as ritual cannibalism. If such skulls were encountered in an archaeological context without modern informants describing the cannibalism, they would not constitute direct evidence for cannibalism under the stringent criteria that my colleagues and I advocate.\nNevertheless, adoption of these standards of evidence has led us to some clear determinations in other, older situations.\nThe best indication of prehistoric cannibalism now comes from the archaeological record of the American Southwest, where archaeologists have interpreted dozens of assemblages of human remains", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": "\nConsequently, scientists have set the standard for recognizing ancient cannibalism very high.

At the institution where I attended graduate school, the chemistry department rewarded the students with a weekly treat. Every Wednesday at 4:30\nP.M. a big bag of bagels was delivered to the student lounge in an exercise that became known as \"bagel minute.\" Not since buzz bombs rained down on London have people raced to a common destination with a greater sense of urgency.\nBagel minute was nasty, brutish and short.\nIf you showed up at 4:31, all that was left were some stray schmears of cream cheese and the guilty faces of the survivors.\nM.I.T.'s charm school attempts, in a day, to at least expose students to the many guidelines of behavior that will help them move gracefully into the polite society that their postgraduate lives should in-\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>They Were More At Ease Asking For A Dewar Flask Than Asking, “Do You Want To Dance?” clude. Classes in table manners will most likely do away with any bagel-minute-like escapades. Dress-for-success instruction will come in particularly handy for the young man who showed up wearing a cap on which was written, simply, \"pimp.\"\nStudents were also free to sit at the feet of experts in both business and cell phone etiquette. Unfortunately, many more seemed interested in the former than the latter, a situation that needs quick remedy if my train trip from New York City was any indication: half a dozen loud cell phone conversations took place in my car all the way to Boston.\nPerhaps the highlight of M.I.T.'s charm school was the half-hour class on flirting, which ran repeatedly during the day. (One might think that teaching college kids how to flirt would be as necessary as teaching a nightingale to sing, but one might be wrong.) In each session, the mentors separated the men from the women and asked members in each group how they could tell if someone they had just met at a party liked them. The top two reasons the men thought a woman might be interested was that she made eye contact and seemed genuinely engaged in the conversation. The top two reasons the women thought a man might be into them was that \"they stare at me and they turn red.\" And so I was reminded that our tree-swinging origins still beckon. Which is all the more reason for learning how to flawlessly finger the fondue fork. a\n\n【6】LUSTRATION BY NICK DEWAR; PHOTOGRAPH BY FRANK VERONSKY", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": "# Antigravity\n", "block_text_old": "# Antigravity\n", "raw_context": [{"text": "ANTIGRAVITY", "bbox": [59.0, 53.0, 314.0, 98.0]}], "block_type": "Title", "full_blocks": [58.0, 52.0, 313.0, 97.0], "position": 0, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n## Charmed, I’M Sure\n", "block_text_old": "\n## Charmed, I’M Sure\n", "raw_context": [{"text": "Charmed, I’m Sure", "bbox": [46.0, 225.0, 388.0, 269.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [45.0, 224.0, 387.0, 268.0], "position": 2, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n FOR THE SCIENTIFICALLY BRIGHT BUT SOCIALLY BEFUDDLED, A DAY OF ETIQUETTE INSTRUCTION MIGHT BE JUST WHAT THE PH.D.

But is genetic engineering the best or only solution? We have sufficient food now, but it doesn't get to those who need it. Most hungry people simply can't afford to buy what's already out there even though commodity prices are at all-time lows. How does genetic engineering address the problems of income disparity?\nThe real tragedy is that the debate about biotechnology is diverting attention from solving the problem of world hunger. I'd like to see people seriously asking the question, \"What can we do to help the world's hungry feed themselves?\" and then make a list of answers.

It may be helpful for providers to master one primary method of airway control. Providers should have a second (backup) strategy for airway management and ventilation if they are unable to establish the first-choice airway adjunct. Bag-mask ventilation may serve as that backup strategy.\n\n【4】Once an advanced airway is inserted, providers should immediately perform a thorough assessment to ensure that it is properly positioned. This assessment should not interrupt chest compressions. Assessment by physical examination consists of visualizing chest expansion bilaterally and listening over the epigastrium (breath sounds should not be heard) and the lung fields bilaterally (breath sounds should be equal and adequate). A device also should be used to confirm correct placement (see the section \"Endotracheal Intubation\" below).\nContinuous waveform capnography is recommended in addition to clinical assessment as the most reliable method of confirming and monitoring correct placement of an endotracheal tube (Class I, LOE A). Providers should observe a persistent capnographic waveform with ventilation to confirm and monitor endotracheal tube placement in the field, in the transport vehicle, on arrival at the hospital, and after any patient transfer to reduce the risk of unrecognized tube misplacement or displacement.\nThe use of capnography to confirm and monitor correct placement of supraglottic airways has not been studied, and its utility will depend on airway design. However, effective ventilation through a supraglottic airway device should result in a capnograph waveform during CPR and after ROSC.\nOnce an advanced airway is in place, the 2 providers should no longer deliver cycles of CPR (ie, compressions interrupted by pauses for ventilation) unless ventilation is inadequate when compressions are not paused. Instead the compressing provider should give continuous chest compressions at a rate of at least 100 per minute, without pauses for ventilation. The provider delivering ventilation should provide 1 breath every 6 to 8 seconds (8 to 10 breaths per minute). Providers should avoid delivering an excessive ventilation rate because doing so can compromise venous return and cardiac output during CPR. The 2 providers should change compressor and ventilator roles approximately every 2 minutes to prevent compressor fatigue and deterioration in quality and rate of chest compressions. When multiple providers are present, they should rotate the compressor role about every 2 minutes.\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Supraglottic Airways\n\n【6】Supraglottic airways are devices designed to maintain an open airway and facilitate ventilation. Unlike endotracheal intubation, intubation with a supraglottic airway does not require visualization of the glottis, so both initial training and maintenance of skills are easier. Also, because direct visualization is not necessary, a supraglottic airway is inserted without interrupting compressions. Supraglottic airways that have been studied in cardiac arrest are the laryngeal mask airway (LMA), the esophageal-tracheal tube (Combitube) and the laryngeal tube", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": " nasopharyngeal airways in cardiac arrest patients.

Conversely, the transplanted cells can attack the recipient's body as foreign in a dire phenomenon called graft-versus-host disease. Graft-versus-host disease can manifest itself as a blistering and ulcerating skin rash, liver damage that progresses to liver failure or severe gastrointestinal bleeding; it can quickly lead to death.\nTo minimize such serious complications in people who cannot obtain a bone marrow transplant from a well-matched sibling, in 1987 a coalition of national blood bank organizations persuaded the U.S. federal government to establish the National Marrow Donor Program to find the best matches for patients among a pool of registered potential bone marrow donors. The program—together with other, similar, international registries— lists 6.5 million names. But because there is only a 1 in 400 chance that an individual will be a match for someone who is not a relative, those in need typically have just a 60 percent chance of finding a potentially lifesaving donor. The odds are even worse for patients who are members of a minority group, because matches are more likely to occur between people of the same race and the registries do not have enough minority volunteers.\nEven those who do find a suitable donor from one of the registries still face an alarming 80 percent risk of moderate to severe (grade II to IV) graft-versus-host disease. Scientists think this is because the matching process does not consider the many unknown minor HLA proteins. Although these proteins are not actively matched in sibling transplants either, the close genetic relationship of siblings ensures that many of them will be matched simply by chance. A good sibling pairing  , however, still carries a 20 percent risk of graft-versus-host disease.\nOne way to slash this incidence would be to attempt to match all known HLA proteins, but that would drastically reduce the chances of finding any potential donor for a recipient. Umbilical cord blood transplantation offers a better alternative. Because of differences in the newborn's immune system, immune cells in umbilical cord blood are much less likely than those in an older child's or an adult's bone mar-", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": "\nReceiving a bone marrow transplant from someone who is not a good tissuetype match is potentially fatal.

Therefore, one goal of the postresuscitation phase is to reduce the risk of oxidative injury while maintaining adequate oxygen delivery. A practical way to achieve that goal is to reduce the Fio 2 to reduce the Pao 2 while ensuring adequate arterial oxygen content. Specifically, use the lowest inspired oxygen concentration that will maintain the arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation ≥ 94%. Provided appropriate equipment is available, once ROSC is achieved, adjust the F IO 2 to the minimum concentration needed to achieve transcutaneous or arterial oxygen saturation at least 94%, with the goal of avoiding hyperoxia while ensuring adequate oxygen delivery. Since an arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation of 100% may correspond to a Pao, anywhere between ~80 and 500 mmHg, in general it is appropriate to wean the F 102 for a saturation of 100%, provided the oxyhemoglobin saturation can be maintained ≥ 94%.\nIn addition to the usual clinical signs of adequate perfusion, laboratory parameters of adequate oxygen delivery over time include resolution of metabolic acidosis, reduced lactate concentration, and normalization of venous oxygen saturation.\nAssist ventilation if there is significant respiratory compromise (tachypnea, respiratory distress with agitation or decreased responsiveness, poor air exchange, cyanosis, hypoxemia). If the patient is already intubated, verify tube position, patency, and security. In the hospital setting, consider obtaining arterial blood gases 10 to 15 minutes after establishing the initial mechanical ventilator settings and make appropriate adjustments. Ideally, correlate blood gases with capnographic end-tidal CO 2 concentration ( P ETCO 2 ) to enable noninvasive monitoring of ventilation.\nControl pain and discomfort with analgesics (eg, fentanyl or morphine) and sedatives (eg, lorazepam or midazolam).\nNeuromuscular blocking agents (eg, vecuronium or pancuronium) with analgesia or sedation, or both, may improve oxygenation and ventilation in case of patient-ventilator dyssynchrony or severely compromised pulmonary function. Neuromuscular blockers, however, can mask seizures and impede neurologic examinations.\n\n【15】•Monitor exhaled CO 2 (P ETCO 2 ), especially during transport and diagnostic procedures (Class IIa, LOE B). 删除2:<u>116, 412, 413</u>•Insert a gastric tube to relieve and help prevent gastric inflation.\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Cardiovascular System\n\n•Monitor heart rate and blood pressure.
