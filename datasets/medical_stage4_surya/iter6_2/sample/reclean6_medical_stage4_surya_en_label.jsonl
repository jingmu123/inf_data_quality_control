Most severe, but less fre删除16:<u>¬ </u>quent is posterior cross bite, which can have a deleterious effect upon the craniofacial growth of the child. The use of the pacifier and the incidence of posterior cross bite have been significantly correlated, most of all when the habit is prolonged more than 36 months. It is considered that such relation is because the oral position of the pacifier entails a lingual displacement over the mandible and an elongation of the orbicular and buccinator muscles. These changes provoke an increase in the mandibular transversal distance and a diminution of the maxillary transversal distance.\nChildren that present this habit suffer an alteration of the oral flora and hypertrophy of the lymphatic system and they usually are mouth breathers, which also contributes in the development of malocclusions. 删除1:<u>(16)</u>\n\n【5】The presence of oral ulcers is also described, specifically in the posterior third of the palate (Bednar aftous ulcers), that are due to a traumatic effect produced by the inten删除16:<u>¬ </u>sive use of non-orthodontic type pacifiers.

There is insufficient evidence to determine if 1 ½ to 3 minutes of CPR should be provided prior to defibrillation. CPR should be performed while a defibrillator is being readied (Class I, LOE B). One cycle of CPR consists of 30 compressions and 2 breaths. When compressions are delivered at a rate of about 100 per minute, 5 cycles of CPR should take roughly 2 minutes (range: about 1 ½ to 3 minutes).\nEMS system medical directors may consider implementing a protocol that allows EMS responders to provide CPR while preparing for defibrillation of patients found by EMS personnel to be in VF. In practice, however, CPR can be initiated while the AED is being readied.\nWith in-hospital SCA, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute CPR before defibrillation. However, in monitored patients, the time from VF to defibrillation should be under 3 minutes. When 2 or more rescuers are present, one rescuer should begin CPR while the other activates the emergency response system and prepares the defibrillator.\n\n【2】##\n1-Shock Protocol Versus 3-Shock Sequence\n\nAt the time of the 2010 Consensus Conference, there were 2 new published human studies that compared a 1-shock protocol versus a 3-stacked-shock protocol for treatment of VF cardiac arrest. Evidence from these 2 well-conducted pre/post design 19.20 studies suggested significant survival benefit with the singleshock defibrillation protocol compared with 3-stacked-shock protocols. If 1 shock fails to eliminate VF, the incremental benefit of another shock is low, and resumption of CPR is likely to confer a greater value than another shock. This fact, combined with the data from animal studies documenting harmful effects from interruptions to chest compressions and human studies suggesting a survival benefit with a 1-shock protocol, indicate that it is reasonable to use 1-shock for VF, then immediate CPR (Class IIa, LOE B).\nFirst-shock efficacy for biphasic shocks is comparable or better than 3 monophasic shocks. 删除2:<u>21–25</u>Although the optimal energy level for defibrillation using any of the monophasic or biphasic waveforms has not been determined, a recommendation for higher initial energy when using a monophasic waveform was weighed by expert consensus with consideration of the potential negative effects of a high first-shock energy versus the negative effects of prolonged VF.  The consensus was that rescuers using monophasic defibrillators should give an initial shock of 360 J; if VF persists after the first shock, second and subsequent shocks of 360 J should be given. This single dose for monophasic shocks is designed to simplify instructions to rescuers but is not a mandate to recall monophasic AEDs for reprogramming. If the monophasic AED being used is programmed to deliver a different first or subsequent dose, that dose is acceptable.\nAfter shock delivery, the rescuer should not delay resumption of chest compressions to recheck the rhythm or pulse. After about 5 cycles of CPR (about 2 minutes, although this time is not firm), ideally ending with compressions, the AED should then analyze the cardiac rhythm and deliver another shock if indicated (Class I, LOE B). If a nonshockable rhythm is detected, the AED should instruct the rescuer to resume CPR immediately, beginning with chest compressions (Class I, LOE B).\nConcern that chest compressions in the presence of a postshock organized rhythm might provoke recurrent VF has been expressed by 1 animal and 2 human studies, 删除2:<u>26–28</u>but this has not been shown to adversely affect survival if the current algorithms are followed. 删除2:<u>19,20</u>Furthermore, in animal studies, frequent or long interruptions in precordial chest compressions for rhythm analysis 29 or rescue breathing 30.31 were associated with postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction and reduced survival rates. Data from a prospective observational study showed that interruption in chest compressions is associated with a decreased probability of successful conversion of VF to a perfusing rhythm after shock.删除26_2:<u></u> In a recent clinical observational study of out-of-hospital CPR 33 and an inhospital study of CPR 34 by healthcare providers, chest compressions were performed only for 51% 33 to 76% 34 of total CPR time.\nThe rhythm analysis for a 3-shock sequence performed by commercially available AEDs can result in delays of up to 37 seconds between delivery of the first shock and delivery of the first postshock compression.删除26_2:<u></u> This delay is difficult to justify in light of the first-shock efficacy of > 90% reported by current biphasic defibrillators. 删除2:<u>28 , 35 – 39</u>AED manufacturers should seek innovative methods to decrease the amount of time chest compressions are interrupted for AED operation. Training materials for lay rescuers should emphasize the importance of continued CPR until basic or advanced life support personnel take over CPR or the victim begins to move.\nShortening the interval between the last compression and the shock by even a few seconds can improve shock success (defibrillation and ROSC). 删除2:<u>18,32,40</u>Thus, it is reasonable for healthcare providers to practice efficient coordination betwee删除换行1:<u>| |</u>PR and defibrillation to minimize the hands-off interval between stopping compression and administering shock (Class IIa, LOE C). For example, when 2 rescuers are present, the rescuer operating the AED should be prepared to deliver a shock as soon as the compressor removes his or her hands from the victim's chest and all rescuers are \"clear\" of contact with the victim.

Among the satellites tracking the storm was the Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE), which the National Aeronautics and Space Administration had launched just four months earlier. IMAGE is the first satellite dedicated to obtaining global images of the magnetosphere, the region of space protected by the earth's magnetic field. By providing an overall picture of the activity in the magnetosphere删除换行1:<u>| |</u>MAGE does for space what the first weather satellites did for the earth's atmosphere.\nIn 1996 I had been selected by NASA to lead a team of engineers and scientists in developing the IMAGE spacecraft and analyzing the data that it transmits. As the Bastille Day storm progressed, we received astounding images of ions circling the earth and pictures of the brilliant aurora borealis—the Northern Lights— that occurred when the charged particles struck the upper atmosphere. The results will help scientists answer longstanding questions about how CMEs and the solar wind interact with the earth's magnetosphere. The findings may also have practical applications. Space storms can disable satellites, threaten the safety of astronauts and even knock out power grids on the ground [ see box at left ]. Indeed, the Bastille Day storm caused the loss of the Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics, an x-ray observatory launched in 1993 by the Japanese space research agency. In hopes of mitigating such effects in the future, scientists are keenly interested in improving the accuracy of space weather forecasts.\n\n#删除换行1:<u>| |</u>t’S Not The Heat Or The Humidity Like Weather On The Earth, Weather In Space Is Extremely variable. Conditions can turn from quiet to stormy in a matter of minutes, and storms can last for hours or days. And just as terrestrial weather changes with the seasons, space weather, too, follows its own cycles. Solar magnetic activity, which causes flares and CMEs, rises and falls every 11 years, and therefore geomagnetic storms follow the same pattern. The Bastille Day storm took place during the solar maximum, the most active part of the cycle. Space weather also varies, though less dramatically, according to the sun's 27-day rotation period, as alternating streams of fast and slow solar wind sweep past the earth.\nSpace weather, however, arises from physical processes that are profoundly different from those responsible for terrestrial weather. The medium for terrestrial weather is the dense, electrically neutral gas in the earth's lower atmosphere, whose behavior is governed by the laws of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics. The medium for space weather, in contrast, is plasma—very sparse gases consisting of equal numbers of positively charged ions and negatively charged electrons. Unlike the atoms and molecules of the atmosphere, these plasma particles are subject to the influence of electric and magnetic fields, which guide and accelerate the particles as they travel through the space surrounding the earth.\nTerrestrial weather is driven by the sun's radiation as it heats the earth's atmosphere, oceans and landmasses.

The solar wind has its own magnetic field, which travels with the outflowing plasma into interplanetary space.

The earth is shielded by its magnetic field, which forms a kind of bubble within the stream of charged particles emanating from the sun. The shape of this cavity—the magnetosphere— is determined by the pressure of the solar wind and by the IMF [ see illustration above ]. The wind compresses the earth's magnetic field on the dayside of the planet—the side facing the sun—and stretches the field on the nightside to form a long tail resembling that of a comet. This magnetotail extends more than one million kilometers past the earth, well beyond the orbit of the moon.\nBetween the solar wind and the magnetosphere is a thin boundary called the magnetopause, where the pressure of the geomagnetic field balances that of the solar wind.

The result is that all the participants, however distant, can share and explore a life-size space.\nBeyond improving on videoconferencing, tele-immersion was conceived as an ideal application for driving networkengineering research, specifically for Internet2, the primary research consortium for advanced network studies in the U.S.\nIf a computer network can support teleimmersion, it can probably support any other application. This is because tele-immersion demands as little delay as possible from flows of information (and as little inconsistency in delay), in addition to the more common demands for very large and reliable flows.\n\n【6】Virtual Reality and Networks BECAUSE TELE-IMMERSION sits at the crossroads of research in virtual reality and networking, as well as computer vision and user-interface research, a little background in these various fields of research is in order.\nIn 1965 Ivan Sutherland, who is widely regarded as the father of computer graph- ics, proposed what he called the \"Ultimate Display.\" This display would allow the user to experience an entirely computer-rendered space as if it were real.\nSutherland termed such a space a \"Virtual World,\" invoking a term from the philosophy of aesthetics, particularly the writings of Suzanne K. Langer. In 1968\nSutherland realized a virtual world for the first time by means of a device called a head-mounted display. This was a helmet with a pair of display screens positioned in front of the eyes to give the wearer a sense of immersion in a stereoscopic, three-dimensional space. When the user moved his or her head, a computer would quickly recompute the images in front of each eye to maintain the illusion that the computer-rendered world remained stationary as the user explored it.\nIn the course of the 1980s I unintentionally ended up at the helm of the first company to sell general-purpose tools for making and experiencing virtual worlds— in large part because of this magazine.\nScientific American devoted its September 1984 issue to emerging digital technologies and chose to use one of my visual-programming experiments as an illustration for the cover.\nAt one point I received a somewhat panicked phone call from an editor who noticed that there was no affiliation listed for me. I explained that at the time I had no affiliation and neither did the work being described. \"Sir,\" he informed me, \"at Scientific American we have a strict rule that states that an affiliation must be indicated after a contributor's name.\" I blurted out \"VPL Research\" (for Visual Programming Language, or", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": "\nLike many researchers, I am a frequent but reluctant user of videoconferencing.

Intraoral anchorage can be divided in four big groups:\n\n【9】1:\n\n【10】Minimal Anchorage.\n\n【11】192. Moderate Anchorage.\n\n【12】1.1.3. Maximum or Severe Anchorage.\n\n【13】4. Absolut Anchorage.\n\n【14】##\n1. Minimal Anchorage\n\n【15】When we place this type of anchorage in molars, they migrate in a mesial direction up to 70% of the space, giving us 30% of anchorage; minimal anchorage is also helpful in anchoring the anterior segment. According to Nanda this type of anchorage is called C Anchorage or \"non-critical -anchorage\", where 75% of space closure is obtained by mesial displacement of posterior teeth. We elaborate this type of anchorage in the arch wire (stops, tip back, arch wire tie back, toe-in, toe-out, in-bend, out-bend) or with accessory elements (retro-ligature, intermaxillary elastics, lip bumper) or a combination of both. 删除1:<u>(19.24)</u>\n\n【16】Types of Minimal Anchorage:\n\n【17】1. Stops.\n\n【18】2. Tip back.\n\n【19】3. Arch wire tie back.\n\n【20】4. Toe-in, Toe-Out.\n\n【21】5. Retro-ligature.\n\n【22】6. Intermaxillary elastics.\n\n【23】7.

It is very economic.\n\n【29】2. Fast and easy to make.\nTip and torque of molars can be controlled if the arch wire is rectangular.\n\n【30】4. No patient cooperation dependence.\n\n【31】5. Because it is a minimal anchorage appliance, the quan删除16:<u>¬ </u>tity of anchorage loss can be controlled for each case.\n\n【32】6. It is a multipurpose anchorage appliance since it can be used solely as minimal anchorage (placing the arch wire in all the slots of the braces) or to correct an anterior cross bite (placing the arch wire separated 2 or 3 mm from the slot), provoking the proclination of the anterior sector and molar distalization (forward arch).\n\n【33】1.

Eleven randomized trials 删除2:<u>140–150</u>suggest that these protocols may be used to improve accuracy in identifying patients requiring inpatient admission or further diagnostic testing and, thereby, reduce length of stay, rate of hospital admission, and health care costs while improving quality of life measures.\nIn patients with suspicion for ACS, normal initial biomarkers, and nonischemic ECG, chest pain observation protocols may be recommended as a safe and effective strategy for evaluating patients in the ED (Class I, LOE A). There is no direct evidence demonstrating that CPUs/observation protocols reduce adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including mortality for patients presenting with possible ACS, normal serum cardiac biomarkers, and a nondiagnostic ECG.\n\n【2】Advanced Testing to Detect Coronary Ischemia and CAD For ED/CPU patients who are suspected of having ACS, have nonischemic ECG's and negative biomarkers, a noninvasive test for inducible myocardial ischemia or anatomic evaluation of the coronary arteries (eg, computed tomography [CT] angiography, cardiac magnetic resonance, myocardial perfusion imaging, stress echocardiography) can be useful in identifying patients suitable for discharge from the ED (Class IIa, LOE B). This strategy may be considered to increase diagnostic accuracy for ACS thereby decreasing costs, length of stay, time to diagnosis, and can provide valuable shortterm and long-term prognostic information of future major cardiac events.\nMyocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) has a high negative predictive value (NPV) for ruling out ACS; 99% in patients presenting to the ED with acute chest pain, nondiagnostic ECG, and negative cardiac markers. MPS can also be used for risk stratification, especially in low- to intermediatelikelihood of cardiac events according to traditional cardiac markers (Class IIa, LOE B). 删除2:<u>151–154</u>MPS is best utilized in patients with an intermediate probability or LOE of risk stratification.\n\n【3】The use of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) angiography (64-slice scanner) after presentation to the ED with chest discomfort, a nondiagnostic ECG, and negative cardiac biomarkers has also been demonstrated to have high sensitivity and specificity for CAD and ACS. 删除2:<u>155,156</u>The use of MDCT angiography for selected low-risk patients can be useful to allow for safe early discharge from the ED (Class IIa, LOE B). 删除2:<u>157–159</u>It is reasonable to consider both the exposure to radiation and iodinated contrast agents when using MDCT angiography and myocardial perfusion imaging.

But there is inadequate evidence to recommend the use of lidocaine in patients who have refractory VT/VF, defined as VT/VF not terminated by defibrillation or that continues to recur after defibrillation during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest or inhospital cardiac arrest.\nLidocaine is an alternative antiarrhythmic of long-standing and widespread familiarity with fewer immediate side effects than may be encountered with other antiarrhythmics. Lidocaine, however, has no proven short- or long-term efficacy in cardiac arrest. Lidocaine may be considered if amiodarone is not available (Class IIb, LOE B). The initial dose is 1 to 1.5 mg/kg IV.

See Part 8.3: \"Management of Symptomatic Bradycardia and Tachycardia\" for additional information about management of torsades de pointes not associated with cardiac arrest.\nThree RCTs 删除2:<u>292–294</u>did not identify a significant benefit from use of magnesium compared with placebo among patients with VF arrest in the prehospital, intensive care unit, and emergency department setting, respectively. Thus, routine administration of magnesium sulfate in cardiac arrest is not recommended (Class III, LOE A) unless torsades de pointes is present.\n\n#删除换行1:<u>| |</u>nterventions Not Recommended For Routine Us删除换行1:<u>| |</u>uring Cardiac Arrest\n\n#删除换行1:<u>| |</u>tropine\n\n【12】Atropine sulfate reverses cholinergic-mediated decreases in heart rate and atrioventricular nodal conduction.

Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), the most common method of delivering NIPPV, allows for separate control of inspiratory and expiratory pressures.\n\nEndotracheal Intubation With Mechanical Ventilatio删除换行1:<u>| |</u>ndotracheal intubation is indicated for patients who present with apnea, coma, persistent or increasing hypercapnia, exhaustion, severe distress, and depression of mental status. Clinical judgment is necessary to assess the need for immediate endotracheal intubation for these critically ill patients. Endotracheal intubation does not solve the problem of small airway constriction in patients with severe asthma; thus, therapy directed toward relief of bronchoconstriction should be continued. Mechanical ventilation in the asthmatic patient can be difficult and associated risks require careful management. Intubation and positivepressure ventilation can trigger further bronchoconstriction and complications such as breath stacking that result from incomplete expiration, air trapping, and buildup of positive endexpiratory pressure (ie, intrinsic or auto-PEEP). This breath stacking can cause barotrauma. Decreasing tidal volume may avoid auto-PEEP and high peak airway pressures. Optimal ventilator management requires expert consultation and ongoing careful review of ventilation flow and pressure curves. Although endotracheal intubation introduces risks, it should be performed when necessary based on clinical condition.\nRapid sequence intubation is the technique of choice and should be performed by an expert in airway management. The provider should use the largest endotracheal tube available (usually 8 or 9 mm) to decrease airway resistance. Immediately after intubation, endotracheal tube placement should be confirmed by clinical examination and waveform capnography. A chest radiograph should then be performed.\n\n#删除换行1:<u>| |</u>roubleshooting After Intubation\n\nWhen severe bronchoconstriction is present, breath stacking (so-called auto-PEEP) can develop during positive-pressure ventilation, leading to complications such as hyperinflation, tension pneumothorax, and hypotension. During manual or mechanical ventilation, a slower respiratory rate should be used with smaller tidal volumes (eg, 6 to 8 mL/kg), 36 shorter inspiratory time (eg, adult inspiratory flow rate 80 to 100 mL/min), and longer expiratory time (eg, inspiratory to expiratory ratio 1:4 or 1:5) than generally would be provided to patients without asthma.删除26_2:<u></u> Management of mechanical ventilation will vary based on patient-ventilation characteristics. Expert consultation should be obtained.\nMild hypoventilation (permissive hypercapnia) reduces the risk of barotrauma. Hypercapnia is typically well tolerated.删除26_2:<u></u> .删除26_2:<u></u删除换行1:<u>| |</u>edation is often required to optimize ventilation, decrease ventilator dyssynchrony (and therefore auto-PEEP), and minimize barotrauma after intubation. Because delivery of inhaled medications may be inadequate before intubation, the provider should continue to administer inhaled albuterol treatments through the endotracheal tube.\nFour common causes of acute deterioration in any intubated patient are recalled by the mnemonic DOPE (tube Displacement, tube Obstruction, Pneumothorax, Equipment failure).\nAuto-PEEP is another common cause of deterioration in patients with asthma. If the asthmatic patient's condition deteriorates or if it is difficult to ventilate the patient, check the ventilator for leaks or malfunction; verify endotracheal tube position; eliminate tube obstruction (eliminate any mucous plugs and kinks); evaluate for auto-PEEP; and rule out a pneumothorax.\nHigh-end expiratory pressure can be reduced quickly by separating the patient from the ventilator circuit; this will allo删除换行1:<u>| |</u>EEP to dissipate during passive exhalation. If auto-PEEP results in significant hypotension, assisting with exhalation by pressing on the chest wall after disconnection of the ventilator circuit will allow active exhalation and should lead to immediate resolution of hypotension. To minimize auto-PEEP, decrease the respiratory rate or tidal volume or both. If auto-PEEP persists and the patient displays ventilator dyssynchrony despite adequate sedation, paralytic agents may be considered.\nIn exceedingly rare circumstances, aggressive treatment for acute respiratory failure due to severe asthma will not provide adequate gas exchange.

Children can be vulnerable to bullies, so you can contact your child's teacher and tell him or her about the condition so that they keep an eye out.\n\n【1】Teachers usually accommodate children with Bell's palsy, and they can help the affected child feel comfortable in the classroom. It is necessary to speak to the child's school to be certain they are sensitive to the kid's needs and differences.\n\n【2】As parents, there are certain things you need to be careful about.\n\n【3】1. Kids recover quickly from Bell's palsy. For some children, it may take only a couple of weeks to recover completely. They might experience none of the emotional suffering or pain grownups do.\n\n【4】2. However, some children take longer to get well and may need other treatments such as medicine, therapy, or even surgery. Hence, parents should assess the condition and ask the doctor to decide whether the child is ready to go to school or if he/she needs time to heal and take a break.\n\n【5】3. If a child goes to school, it is vital to inform the teacher that the child might get tired and that his/her eye needs to be protected. An eye patch is essential to prevent dirt and debris from getting into the eye. If a child wants to go swimming, you need to get some good quality swimming goggles. It is best to let your child do whatever they want, just make sure you have all your bases covered in terms of protecting them both physically and emotionally.\n\n【6】4. Going out in the sun is problematic for children suffering from Bell's palsy since it's difficult to shut the affected eye. Remind the child to wear sunglasses to protect their eye. Sunglasses are also necessary for windy days. Make sure you apply eye drops to your child's eye several times throughout the day. It is also advisable to use an eye patch while the child sleeps. This helps keep the eye moist.\n\n【7】5. Some children experience pain in the face. A moist warm washcloth applied to the affected side of the face may assist in reducing the pain. You should also encourage your child to practice facial exercise as advised by your doctor. It helps speed up recovery.\n\n#删除换行1:<u>| |</u>ell’S Palsy: Problems Faced By Teenagers", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": "\nExplain to your child how to approach and answer questions about their condition.

The dispatcher should also provide CPR instructions to help bystanders initiate CPR when cardiac arrest is suspected.\nBecause it is easier for rescuers receiving telephone CPR instructions to perform Hands-Only (compression-only) CPR than conventional CPR (compressions plus rescue breathing), dispatchers should instruct untrained lay rescuers to provide Hands-Only CPR for adults with SCA (Class I, LOE B).删除26_2:<u></u删除换行1:<u>| |</u>hile Hands-Only CPR instructions have broad applicability, instances remain when rescue breaths are critically important.\nDispatchers should include rescue breathing in their telephone CPR instructions to bystanders treating adult and pediatric victims with a high likelihood of an asphyxial cause of arrest (eg, drowning).删除26_2:<u></u> The EMS system quality improvement process, including review of the quality of dispatcher CPR instructions provided to specific callers, is considered an important component of a high-quality lifesaving program (Class IIa, LOE B).删除26_2:<u></u> – 33\n\n#删除换行1:<u>| |</u>dult Bls Sequence\n\n【4】The steps of BLS consist of a series of sequential assessments and actions, which are illustrated in the new simplified BLS algorithm 删除图片5:<u>(Figure 1)</u>.

After cutting the cord and checking the afterbirth for gaps and tears that might indicate that a piece still remains inside the mother's uterus—where it could cause a potentially fatal infection—the doctor usually tosses it into a stainless-steel bucket with the rest of the medical waste bound for incineration.\nBut more and more physicians and parents are realizing the value of what they used to regard as merely birth's byproduct. Since 1988 hundreds of lives have been saved by the three ounces of blood contained in a typical placenta and umbilical cord. That blood is now known to be a rich source of so-called hematopoietic stem cells, the precursors of everything in the blood from infection-fighting white blood cells to the red blood cells that carry oxygen to the platelets that facilitate blood clotting after an injury.\nThe stem cells from a single placenta are sufficient to rebuild the blood and immune system of a child with leukemia, whose own white blood cells are abnormally dividing and must be killed by chemotherapy. In the past, physicians had to seek a living donor to provide such children with transplants of bone marrow, which also contains stem cells that produce blood and immune cells. Unfortu-\n\nTOGRAPH BY MAX-AGUILERA-HELLWEG TIMEPIX nately, many people have died during the long search for a donor with a matching tissue type or from complications if the donated marrow did not match well. Cord blood, which can be stored, is more likely to provide a suitable match and less likely to cause complications, because its stem cells are immunologically different from and more tolerant than those in adult bone marrow.\nThe benefits of umbilical cord blood transplantation have been demonstrated most conclusively in leukemia, but the process has other uses. The stem cells in cord blood can help to restore normal red blood cells in people with sickle cell anemia and to reconstitute the immune system of infants born with severe combined immunodeficiency. Cord blood can also be used to treat fatal inherited enzyme deficiencies, such as Hurler's syndrome, which results in progressive neurological degeneration and death. In such cases, the stem cells in cord blood can give rise not only to normal red and white blood cells but also to supporting cells in the brain called microglia that can provide the crucial missing enzyme there.\nRecognizing the apparent advantages of umbilical cord blood transplantation, a number of medical centers have established banks so that a mother can donate her baby's cord blood for use by a stranger in need. The New York Blood Center'删除换行1:<u>| |</u>lacental Blood Program, pioneered b删除换行1:<u>| |</u>ablo Rubinstein, now has 13,000 banked donations and is the nation's largest pub- lic cord blood bank. The University of California at Los Angeles and Duke University also have umbilical cord blood storage programs, which are federally funded.\nBut like many new scientific discoveries, umbilical cord blood transplantation brings with it a set of ethical questions [ see box on next page ]. Who owns umbilical cord blood: both parents, the mother or the infant? What happens if a mother donates her baby's cord blood to a bank but the child later develops leukemia and needs it? The ethical questions are compounded by the advent of for-profit companies that collect and preserve a newborn's cord blood for possible use by the family later. Is it right for such companies to aggressively market their services—which can cost $1,500 for collection and $95 per year for storage— when the chance a child will ever need his or her cord blood ranges from 1 in 10,000 (according to the New York Blood Center) to 1 in 200,000 (according to the National Institutes of Health)?\n\n#删除换行1:<u>| |</u>ounts Of Stem Cells the first hint that umbilical cord blood could be clinically useful came in 1972, when Norman Ende of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of Ne删除换行1:<u>| |</u>ersey and his brother, Milton, a physician in Petersburg, Va., reported giving a 16-year-old leukemia patient an infusion of cord blood.

The rescuer should intervene if the choking victim shows signs of severe airway obstruction. These include signs of poor air exchange and increased breathing difficulty, such as a silent cough, cyanosis, or inability to speak or breathe. The victim may clutch the neck, demonstrating the universal choking sign. Quickly ask, \"Are you choking?\" If the victim indicates \"yes\" by nodding his head without speaking, this will verify that the victim has severe airway obstruction.\n\nRelief of Foreign-Body Airway Obstruction When FBAO produces signs of severe airway obstruction, rescuers must act quickly to relieve the obstruction. If mild obstruction is present and the victim is coughing forcefully, do not interfere with the patient's spontaneous coughing and breathing efforts. Attempt to relieve the obstruction only if signs of severe obstruction develop: the cough becomes silent, respiratory difficulty increases and is accompanied by stridor, or the victim becomes unresponsive. Activate the EMS system quickly if the patient is having difficulty breathing. If more than one rescuer is present, one rescuer should phone 911 while the other rescuer attends to the choking victim.\nThe clinical data about effectiveness of maneuvers to relieve FBAO are largely retrospective and anecdotal. For responsive adults and children > 1 year of age with sever删除换行1:<u>| |</u>BAO, case reports show the feasibility and effectiveness of back blows or \"slaps,\" 删除2:<u>276 – 278</u>abdominal thrusts, 删除2:<u>275 – 277 , 279 , 280</u>and chest thrusts. 删除2:<u>276 , 281</u>In 1 case series of 513 choking episodes for which EMS was summoned, 275 approximately 50% of the episodes of airway obstruction were relieved prior to arrival of EMS. EMS intervention with abdominal thrusts successfully relieved the obstruction in more than 85% of the remaining cases. The few patients with persistent obstruction usually responded to suction or the use of Magill forceps.\nLess than 4% died.删除26_2:<u></u删除换行1:<u>| |</u>lthough chest thrusts, back slaps, and abdominal thrusts are feasible and effective for relieving severe FBAO in conscious (responsive) adults and children ≥ 1 year of age, for simplicity in training it is recommended that abdominal thrusts be applied in rapid sequence until the obstruction is relieved (Class IIb, LO删除换行1:<u>| |</u>). If abdominal thrusts are not effective, the rescuer may consider chest thrusts (Class IIb, LOE B). It is important to note that abdominal thrusts are not recommended for infants < 1 year of age because thrusts may cause injuries.\nChest thrusts should be used for obese patients if the rescuer is unable to encircle the victim's abdomen. If the choking victim is in the late stages of pregnancy, the rescuer should use chest thrusts instead of abdominal thrusts.\nIf the adult victim with FBAO becomes unresponsive, the rescuer should carefully support the patient to the ground, immediately activate (or send someone to activate) EMS, and then begin CPR.  The healthcare provider should carefully lower the victim to the ground, send someone to activate the emergency response system and begin CPR (without a pulse check). After 2 minutes, if someone has not already done so, the healthcare provider should activate the emeregency response system.

Dopamine hydrochloride is a catecholamine with both α - and β -adrenergic actions. It can be titrated to more selectively target heart rate or vasoconstriction. At lower doses dopamine has a more selective effect on inotropy and heart rate; at higher doses (>10 mcg/kg per minute), it also has vasoconstrictive effects. Dopamine infusion may be used for patients with symptomatic bradycardia, particularly if associated with hypotension, in whom atropine may be inappropriate or after atropine fails (Class IIb, LOE B).

Use of vasoconstrictors requires that the recipient be assessed for adequate intravascular volume and volume status supported as needed.\n\n【5】Isoproterenol.

A 12-lead ECG should be obtained as soon as possible after ROSC to determine whether acute ST elevation is present (Class I, LOE B).\nBecause it is impossible to determine the final neurological status of comatose patients in the first hours after ROSC, aggressive treatment of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) should begin as in non–cardiac arrest patients, regardless of coma or induced hypothermia.

Unfortunately many adrenergic drugs are not selective and may increase or decrease heart rate and afterload, increase cardiac arrhythmias, and increase myocardial ischemia by creating a mismatch between myocardial oxygen demand and delivery. Myocardial ischemia, in turn, may further decrease heart function. Some agents may also have metabolic effects that increase blood glucose, lactate, and metabolic rate. There is a paucity of data about which vasoactive drug to select first, although providers should become familiar with the differing adverse effects associated with these drugs, which might make a particular agent more or less appropriate for a specific patient.删除26_2:<u></u删除换行1:<u>| |</u>pecific drug infusion rates cannot be recommended because of variations in pharmacokinetics (relation between drug dose and concentration) and pharmacodynamics (relation between drug concentration and effect) in critically ill patients, 删除2:<u>154 , 155</u>so commonly used initial dose ranges are listed in Table 2. Vasoactive drugs must be titrated at the bedside to secure the intended effect while limiting side effects.

In most cases, a DNAR order is preceded by a documented discussion with the patient, family, or surrogate decision maker addressing the patient's wishes about resuscitation interventions.

If the individual has a court-appointed guardian with authority to make healthcare decisions, the guardian becomes the authorized surrogate.\nIf there is no court-appointed or other authority, a close relative or friend can become a surrogate decision maker. Most jurisdictions have laws that designate the legally authorized surrogate decision maker for an incompetent patient who has not identified a decision maker through a durable power of attorney for health care.

Parents or guardians are generally empowered to make healthcare decisions on their behalf, and in most situations, parents are given wide latitude in terms of the decisions they make on behalf of their children. Parental authority is not absolute, however, and when a parent or guardian's decision appears to place the child at significant risk of serious harm as compared to other options, medical providers may seek to involve state agencies (eg, child protective services or a court determination) to allow treatment of the child over parental objections.删除26_2:<u></u删除换行1:<u>| |</u> child should be involved in decision making at a level appropriate for the child's maturity. Children should be asked to consent to healthcare decisions when able within the legal definition of a consenting adult based on local policy and legislation.

Healthcare providers, however, are not obliged to provide such care when there is scientific and social consensus that the treatment is ineffective.

Of the more than 250 employees surveyed about symptoms associated with carpal tunnel, such as tingling and numbness, only 10.5 percent met official clinical criteria for the syndrome, and nerve conduction tests confirmed the condition in only 3.5 percent. These numbers are consistent with previous data for the general population. The study, which appeared in the June 12 Neurology , suggests that symptoms assumed to indicate carpal tunnel syndrome may have numerous other explanations, such as pinched neck nerves.\n\n【8】-Steve Mirsky\n\n#删除换行1:<u>| |</u>ematology\n\n#删除换行1:<u>| |</u>ticky Situation\n\n【11】The great hope for curing sickle-cell disease—affecting one in about 650 African-Americans— remains gene therapy: it would correct the single mutation responsible for the misshapen red blood cells that adhere to blood vessels and impede proper blood flow. But research from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has revealed another important aspect of the disease—a protein largely responsible for the cellular stickiness. The protein, called thrombospondin, binds to red blood cells and provokes them into releasing molecules that increase the cells' tendency to stick to blood vessel walls. The revelation, which appeared in the June 15 Journal of Clinical Investigation , brings up the possibility of treating sickle-cell disease by interfering with thrombospondin and its effects.\n\n【12】—Steve Mirsky\n\n#删除换行1:<u>| |</u>ealth\n\n#删除换行1:<u>| |</u>at Kills\n\nCombating obesity in childhood could prevent up to four million cancer cases a year worldwide, said researchers at the 11th Europea删除换行1:<u>| |</u>ongress on Obesity, held in Vienna in May.\nAbout 30 to 40 percent of all cancer cases stem from excessive weight.
