Developed for the government by IBM in the 1960s, NIPS did what database software does: it created, structured, maintained and revised data files.\nBut the details of missions over Laos—on average, a planeload of bombs every eight minutes for nine years—were coded to save space because of the limited storage capacity of mainframes at the time. \"What you have is nested data,\" Brown explains.\n\n\"You would have a fixed field with information about sorties and additional fields identifying each leg of the mission.\"\nFurther hindering Stanley's attempt to understand the databases was the scant documentation of changes in database codes. \"Sometimes codes were reused and the data processors just assigned new val- ues to the codes,\" Brown says. \"These changes were not always incorporated into the systems manuals, and early versions of the manuals were not always saved.\" In the Southeast Asia Database, for example, the National Archives has a manual dated 1975, but it is uncertain whether the information applies to earlier years.

Even in the public sector, where unions have maintained their membership in recent times, they have relatively little power.\nTeachers, for example, are perhaps the bestorganized government employees. Only 11 states grant them the right to strike; in 15 states they have no legal means to compel school boards to bargain. The other 24 states consider teacher strikes illegal but permit local governments to bargain with the boards.\nIn terms of labor rights, teachers fall midway between powerful industrial unions such as the United Auto Workers and certain groups not protected by federal labor regulations at all. Federal law, particularly the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947 (also known as the Taft-Hartley Act), compels employers to bargain with unions in good faith and protects workers from arbitrary firing for union activity. The situation of unprotected groups—which include farm laborers, domestics, supervisors, managers and independent contractors—is documented in detail by删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Human Rights Watch in its recent report Unfair Advantage. These employees, who may number up to 20 million, have minimal protection when trying to form a union. Although they may have some legal safeguards against arbitrary discharge under common law and antidiscrimination statutes, Human Rights Watch finds that an employer bent on discharging a worker for trying to form a union generally has the upper hand.\nThat also applies to jobs covered by labor laws. According to Human Rights删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Watch, the financial penalty for firing a worker for organizing is small and often is not paid until years of litigation go by. Another problem for workers, even those protected.\n\n【9】SOURCES: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (all unions); Bureau of National Affoirs, Inc., of Washington, D.\n删除1:<u>(2019)</u>, which are boosted on total on laws and private and oublic p ter 1973, which are based on tatal employment. Private- and public-sector data available an nward. The graph lines are not strictly comparable but are believed to measure averall trends by labor laws, is the employer's right under court decisions to replace them permanently if they strike for higher wages. Sympathy strikes are illegal. Employers have a virtually unlimited right to present their point of view in the workplace but can prevent union organizers from doing the same.\n\nThe U.S. has long been out of step with standards established by the International Labor Organization, an arm of the United Nations. The standards affirm workers' right to organize, to bargain collectively, to have a speedy resolution of grievances and, with certain limitations, to strike and conduct sympathy strikes. It disallows practices that would undermine the right to strike, such as the hiring of permanent replacement workers. Lance删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Compa, the author of Unfair Advantage and an expert on international labor law at Cornell University, notes that most other industrial countries follow the U.N. rules, which, among other things, allow teachers to strike.\nWould granting American workers U.N. standard rights harm the U.S. economy? Compa thinks the economy would be enhanced, because workers would feel more respected and worry less about employer reprisal. Thomas I.\nPalley, an economist with the AFL-CIO, argues that the chief effect would be a lessening of income disparities in the U.S. and that there is no evidence it would diminish America's competitive edge abroad. Marvin H. Kosters, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, says any effect would be minor.\nOn the other hand, Randall Johnson, vice president for labor and employee benefits at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, believes that the damage to the U.S. position would be substantial. Mark Wilson, an economist at the Heritage Foundation, says beefing up workers' rights would reduce the nation's competitive advantage with European trading partners and developing countries such as China and Mexico.\n\n【11】Rodger Doyle can be reached via e-mail: rdoyle2@adelphia.net\n\n【12】O D G E R  D O Y L E", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": "\nMillions of U.S. workers are not covered by labor-rights legislation, such as the Labor-Management\nRelations Act of 1947.

Ideally, healthcare systems that routinely provide care to children at risk for cardiac arrest should have available manual defibrillators capable of dose adjustment.删除26_2:<u></u>\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>In-Hospital Use Of Aeds\n\n【2】At the time of the 2010 Consensus Conference, there were no published in-hospital randomized trials of AEDs versus manual defibrillators. Evidence from 1 study with historic controls, 152 1 case series, 153 and 2 retrospective studies 删除2:<u>117,118</u>indicated higher rates of survival to hospital discharge when AEDs were used to treat adult VF or pulseless VT in the hospital. However, 1 before/after study did not show an improvement in survival to discharge or ROSC when in-hospital AEDs were implemented in noncritical areas of a hospital, 154 and 1 observational study with historical controls observed no improvement in survival to discharge when comparing biphasic AEDs to standard monophasic defibrillators.删除26_2:<u></u> The Gombotz and Hanefeld studies observed a decrease in the time interval from collapse to first shock delivery as well as increased ROSC and survival.\nDefibrillation may be delayed when patients develop SCA in unmonitored hospital beds and in outpatient and diagnostic facilities. In such areas, several minutes may elapse before centralized response teams arrive with the defibrillator, attach it, and deliver shocks.删除26_2:<u></u> Despite limited evidence, AEDs may be considered for the hospital setting as a way to facilitate early defibrillation (a goal of 删除0:<u>¶</u>3 minutes from collapse), especially in areas where staff have no rhythm recognition skills or defibrillators are used infrequently (Class IIb, LOE C).\nWhen hospitals deploy AEDs, first-responding personnel should also receive authorization and training to use an AED, with the goal of providing the first shock for any SCA within 3 minutes of collapse. The objective is to make goals for in-hospital use of AEDs consistent with goals established in the out-of-hospital setting.删除26_2:<u></u> Early defibrillation capability should be available in ambulatory care facilities, as well as throughout hospital inpatient areas. Hospitals should monitor collapse-to–first shock intervals and resuscitation outcomes.\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Fibrillation Waveform Analysis To删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Predict Outcome\n\n【4】There is evidence that VF waveforms change over time. 删除2:<u>158,139</u>Several retrospective case series, animal studies, and theoretical models suggest that it is possible to predict, with varying reliability, the success of attempted defibrillation by analyzing the VF waveform. 删除2:<u>18,40,160–177</u>However, there are currently no prospective studies that have identified optimal waveforms and/or timing. The value of VF waveform analysis to guide defibrillation management is uncertain (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【5】##\n\"Occult\" Versus \"False\" Asystole\n\nIn certain cases of cardiac arrest, it is difficult to be certain whether the rhythm is fine VF or asystole. In 1989, Losek 178 published a retrospective review of initial shock delivery for 49 children (infants through 19 years of age) in asystole compared with no shock delivery for 41 children in asystole and found no improvement in rhythm change, ROSC, or survival in the group that received the shocks. In 1993, the Nine City High-Dose删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Epinephrine Study Group published an analysis of 77 asystolic patients who received initial shock compared with 117 who received standard therapy.删除26_2:<u></u> There was a worse outcome of ROSC and survival for those who received shocks. Thus, it is not useful to shock asystole (Class III, LOE B).\n\n【7】Several case reports have described fires ignited by sparks from poorly applied defibrillator paddles in the presence of an oxygen-enriched atmosphere. 删除2:<u>180–185</u>Fires have been reported when ventilator tubing is disconnected from the endotracheal tube and then left adjacent to the patient's head, blowing oxygen across the chest during attempted defibrillation. 删除2:<u>181,183,185</u>It may be reasonable for rescuers to take precautions to minimize sparking during attempted defibrillation; try to avoid defibrillation in an oxygen-enriched atmosphere (Class IIb, LOE C).\nThe use of self-adhesive defibrillation pads and ensuring good pad–chest-wall contact will likely minimize the risk of sparks igniting during defibrillation. If manual paddles are used, gel pads are preferable to electrode pastes and gels, because the pastes and gels can spread between the 2 paddles, creating the potential for a spark (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Synchronized Cardioversion\n\n【9】Synchronized cardioversion is shock delivery that is timed (synchronized) with the QRS complex. This synchronization avoids shock delivery during the relative refractory portion of the cardiac cycle, when a shock could produce VF.删除26_2:<u></u> For\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Fire Hazard", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": " adverse effects.

Cardioversion or drugs or both may be used to control unstable or symptomatic tachycardia.\nACLS providers should closely monitor stable patients pending expert consultation and should be prepared to aggressively treat those with evidence of decompensation.\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Disclosures", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": " dial ischemia should be treated with β -blockers and consideration be given to expeditious cardiac catheterization with revascularization.

But sometimes cells botch the job, leading to misfolded proteins that are useless or even dangerous. How exactly most cells repair or destroy flawed proteins has remained somewhat elusive—until now. As reported in the January Nature Cell Biology , experiments revealed a component of the repair process that may participate in a cell's decision to fix or destroy a particular protein. Researchers found that a molecule called CHIP first prevented chaperones, which repair proteins, from trying to refold an unsalvageable protein, then subsequently transferred the hopeless case to a proteasome, which destroyed it.\nThese findings may help researchers develop new treatments for Alzheimer's disease and other kinds of neurogenerative disorders associated with an accumulation of misfolded proteins in cells.\n\n【10】—Alison McCook\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Neuroscience\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>You Look Awfully Familiar with a celebrity's to determine which hemisphere is involved in self-recognition, an ability shared with some删除换行1:<u>| |</u> apes and considered to be a hallmark of self-awareness.\n\n【13】AMAZON RIVER ( blue ) meets the Rio Negro [ black ]; the colors differ because of the sediment they carry.\nWhether organic sediment from rivers makes it to the ocean had been unclear.\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Earth Science\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Take Me To The Ocean\n\n【16】Rivers should dump plenty of organic matter into the sea, replacing all the ocean's carbon in 4,000 to 6,000 years. But geochemical studies have suggested that little of the riverine carbon, derived from plants, actually makes it out. In the January 25 Nature , researchers report a possible solution. Using radiocarbon techniques on sediments collected from four rivers, they determined that bacteria may alter riverine carbon, making it indistinguishable from ocean carbon. Although it fills in details about the carbon cycle, the study deals with timescales too long to affect carbon dioxide– influenced global warming by humans. In fact, in February the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change raised the estimate of the world's temperature rise between 1990 and 2100 from 1.0 to 3.5 degrees Celsius to 1.4 to 5.8 degrees C.\n\n【17】-Philip Yam\n\nYour sense of self may lie in the right side of your brain.

Once the anesthesia wore off  patients had to choose which face they had seen.

The EDD consists of a bulb that is compressed and attached to the endotracheal tube. If the tube is in the esophagus (positive result for an EDD), the suction created by the EDD will collapse the lumen of the esophagus or pull the esophageal tissue against the tip of the tube, and the bulb will not re-expand. The EDD may also consist of a syringe that is attached to the endotracheal tube; the provider attempts to pull the barrel of the syringe. If the tube is in the esophagus, it will not be possible to pull the barrel (aspirate air) with the syringe.\nHowever, studies of the syringe aspiration EDD79.99 and the self-inflating bulb EDD 删除2:<u>78 –80</u>indicate that the accuracy of these devices does not exceed that of auscultation and direct visualization for confirming the tracheal position of an endotracheal tube in victims of cardiac arrest. Given the simplicity of the EDD, it can be used as the initial method for confirming correct tube placement in addition to clinical assessment in the victim of cardiac arrest when waveform capnography is not available (Class IIa, LOE删除换行1:<u>| |</u>B).\n\n【1】The EDD may yield misleading results in patients with morbid obesity, late pregnancy, or status asthmaticus, or when there are copious endotracheal secretions, 删除2:<u>100,101</u>because the trachea tends to collapse in the presence of these conditions. There is no evidence that the EDD is accurate for the continued monitoring of endotracheal tube placement.\n\n【2】Thoracic Impedance. Transthoracic impedance is slightly but significantly higher during inspiration than during exhalation.删除26_2:<u></u> Air is a poor electric conductor. Preliminary studies suggest that changes in thoracic impedance, as measured through standard defibrillation pads, may distinguish tracheal from esophageal intubations. 删除2:<u>103 – 105</u>There are 2 published reports involving 6 patients where ventilation-induced changes in thoracic impedance disappeared after esophageal intubation. 删除2:<u>106 , 107</u>There is little evidence for the use of thoracic impedance in diagnosing adequacy of ventilation during CPR.  Treatment decisions should not be based solely on thoracic impedance measurements until further study has confirmed its utility and accuracy in this population.\n\nPostintubation Airway Management删除换行1:<u>| |</u>After inserting and confirming correct placement of an endotracheal tube, the provider should record the depth of the tube as marked at the front teeth or gums and secure it.\nThere is significant potential for endotracheal tube movement with head flexion and extension 删除2:<u>108 –110</u>and when the patient is moved from one location to another. 删除2:<u>111,112</u>Continuous monitoring of endotracheal tube placement with waveform capnography is recommended as discussed above. The endotracheal tube should be secured with tape or a commercial device (Class I, LOE C). Devices and tape should be applied in a manner that avoids compression of the front and sides of the neck, which may impair venous return from the brain.\nOne out-of-hospital study 113 and 2 studies in an intensivecare setting 删除2:<u>114 , 115</u>indicate that backboards, commercial devices for securing the endotracheal tube, and other strategies provide equivalent methods for preventing inadvertent tube displacement when compared with traditional methods of securing the tube (tape). These devices may be considered during patient transport (Class IIb, LOE C). After tube confirmation and fixation, obtain a chest x-ray (when feasible) to confirm that the end of the endotracheal tube is properly positioned above the carina.\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Ventilation After Advanced Airway Placement\n\nExcept for respiratory rate, it is unknown whether monitoring ventilatory parameters (eg, minute ventilation, peak pressure) during CPR will influence outcome. However, positivepressure ventilation increases intrathoracic pressure and may reduce venous return and cardiac output, especially in patients with hypovolemia or obstructive airway disease. Ventilation at high respiratory rates (> 25 breaths per minute) is common during resuscitation from cardiac arrest. 删除2:<u>116,117</u>In animal models, slower ventilation rates (6 to 12 breaths per minute) are associated with improved hemodynamic parameters and short-term survival. 删除2:<u>116,118–124</u>Because cardiac output is lower than normal during cardiac arrest, the need for ventilation is reduced. Following placement of an advanced airway, the provider delivering ventilations should perform 1 breath every 6 to 8 seconds (8 to 10 breaths per minute) without pausing in applying chest compressions (unless ventilation is inadequate when compressions are not paused) (Class IIb, LOE删除换行1:<u>| |</u>C).

Conventional photolithography equipment projects ultraviolet light (usually at 248 or 193 nanometers) through a mask—a sheet of glass on which are traced a chip's circuit patterns. A series of lenses reduces the image to a quarter of its size. The image projected through the lenses is exposed in a chemical on the wafer. Another chemical treatment then etches away either the exposed or unexposed areas of the image, carving the circuit elements into the chip surface.\nThings change at 13 nanometers, where extreme ultraviolet lithography earns its name. The mask and lenses, transparent at longer wavelengths, would absorb this radiation. So EUV uses mirrors for both the mask and the lenses. A laser trained on a jet of xenon gas creates a plasma that emits 13-nanometer radia- tion, which is focused onto a mask. The mask reflects the circuit pattern onto a series of curved mirrors that reduce the size of the image and focus it onto the wafer.\nThe 80 alternating layers of silicon and molybdenum that make up the mirrors and the mask have to be smoothed to single-atom tolerances. The entire circuitprinting process, moreover, has to be done in a vacuum because air itself absorbs radiation at this wavelength. And the mask will distort the image if it contains more than a handful of defects measuring even 50 nanometers, about 2,000 times narrower than the width of a human hair. The development team sometimes muses on ways to describe to the outside world the relative size of a 50- nanometer defect, comparing it to a search for a golf ball in a state the size of Maryland, a basketball in the state of Texas or a hair on a football field.\nPhysicists and engineers who designed and engineered nuclear weapons technology had to solve these challenges. Unlike删除换行1:<u>| |</u>AT&T, which conducted early development work on EUV at Bell Labs with about 30 employees, Intel has only five full-time employees at VNL's main facility at the Sandia laboratory in Livermore (although more than 10 others labor on developing proprietary mask designs and other EUV-related technology at several删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Intel facilities). \"They're using us as an advanced development and research lab,\" says Richard H. Stulen, the virtual laboratory's chief operating officer.\nThe company kept a close eye on how decisions were made at the labs. If alternative methods were proposed for making lenses, Intel would press the research team to pick one, instead of testing the merits of both. \"Nothing got spent that they didn't think would work,\" Freeman says. \"They didn't do it Bell Labs style.\"\nIntel also implemented the same detailed risk-management system that the compa- ny uses internally—essentially a rating system of things that could go wrong.\nThis flagged a list of about 200 problems, some of which the 150 national laboratories researchers who worked in the VNL might otherwise have downplayed.\nAt one meeting, the VNL staff mentioned that it would need to increase the power of the laser by a factor of 40, which raised a red flag for suppliers. \"The chip equipment manufacturers rated this at a much higher risk than we had,\" Stulen says.\nVNL researchers identified what they called \"seven deadly showstoppers,\" but by late 1998, at another industry session, solutions to many of these problems— such as how to make supersmooth mirrors—had been found, propelling EUV into first place when it came time to vote.\n\n【2】\"The group went from having an attitude of 'Sure, sure, tell us you can do that' to placing us up front,\" Freeman says.\nIntel has also brought a get-the-jobdone kind of urgency to laboratory employees unaccustomed to commercial deadlines.

Computer science has traditionally been driven by an educated guess that there will always be good uses for faster and more capacious digital tools, even if we don't always know in advance what those uses will be.\nIn the case of advanced networking research, however, this faith wasn't enough.\nThe new ideas would have to be tested on something.\n\n【2】Allan H. Weis, who had played a central role in building the NSFnet, was in charge of a nonprofit research organiza- tion called Advanced Network and Services, which housed and administered the engineering office for Internet2. He used the term \"tele-immersion\" to conjure an ideal \"driver\" application and asked me to take the assignment as lead scientist for a National Tele-Immersion Initiative to create it. I was delighted, as this was the logical extension of my previous work in shared virtual worlds.\nAlthough many components, such as the display system, awaited invention or refinement before we could enjoy a working tele-immersion system, the biggest challenge was creating an appropriate way of visually sensing people and places. It might not be immediately apparent why this problem is different from videoconferencing.\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Beyond The Camera As We Know It\n\n【4】THE KEY IS THAT in tele-immersion, each participant must have a personal viewpoint of remote scenes—in fact, two of them, because each eye must see from its own perspective to preserve a sense of depth. Furthermore, participants should be free to move about, so each person's perspective will be in constant motion.\nTele-immersion demands that each scene be sensed in a manner that is not bi-\n\n【5】THREE USERS in different cities can share a virtual space thanks to this telecubicle. ased toward any particular viewpoint (a camera, in contrast, is locked into portraying a scene from its own position).\nEach place, and the people and things in it, has to be sensed from all directions at once and conveyed as if it were an animated three-dimensional sculpture. Each remote site receives information describing the whole moving sculpture and renders viewpoints as needed locally. The scanning process has to be accomplished fast enough to take place in real time— at most within a small fraction of a second. The sculpture representing a person can then be updated quickly enough to achieve the illusion of continuous motion. This illusion starts to appear at about 12.5 frames per second (fps) but becomes robust at about 25 fps and better still at faster rates.\nMeasuring the moving three-dimensional contours of the inhabitants of a room and its other contents can be accomplished in a variety of ways. As ear- ly as 1993, Henry Fuchs of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill had proposed one method, known as the \"sea of cameras\" approach, in which the viewpoints of many cameras are compared. In typical scenes in a human environment, there will tend to be visual features, such as a fold in a sweater, that are visible to more than one camera. By comparing the angle at which these features are seen by different cameras, algorithms can piece together a three-dimensional model of the scene.\nThis technique had been explored in non-real-time configurations, notably in Takeo Kanade's work, which later culminated in the \"Virtualized Reality\" demonstration at Carnegie Mellon University, reported in 1995. That setup consisted of 51 inward-looking cameras mounted on a geodesic dome.

Will I Be Able To Breast-Feed My Baby If I’M Taking Medicine For My Asthma?\nYes, You Will Certainly Be Able To Breast-Feed If You So wish. Asthma medicine, especially that administered in inhaled form, is not a contraindication to nursing your infant. Breast-feeding has many widely known advantages for both mother and child, and may even have beneficial effects in delaying or altogether avoiding the development of asthma in young children. In fact, a recent study in Australia involving over 2,000 children found that infants who were \"exclusively breast-fed,\" that is, who received only mother's milk for at least the first 4 months of life, had a significantly reduced risk of developing asthma by the age of 6. Breast-feeding also appears to delay the development of allergy in children.

It is better to stick to semi-solid and liquid foods if the child is having problems swallowing.\n\n【6】Make sure you include the following food groups in the kid's diet plan.\n\n【7】1. Fruits: Try to include at least two servings of fruit per day. One serving here refers to one piece of fruit or ½ cup canned fruit or ¾ cup fruit juice or ¼ cup dried fruit. It's always best to include fresh produce in your child's diet plan.\n\n【8】2. Milk and Dairy: Kids might not be fond of dairy products but be sure to include two servings of dairy per day. One serving includes 2 oz. cheese or 1 cup of milk/yogurt. Please check with a doctor if your child is lactose intolerant.\n\n【9】3. Protein: Cooked lean meat, poultry or fish, beans, eggs and peanut butter can be used as ideal protein sources. Kids require two servings (85g each) of the protein group.\n\n【10】4. Whole grains and vegetables are also valuable options that cannot be ignored. You can include six servings of the grain group and three servings of veggies throughout the day. ½ cup of chopped raw or cooked vegetables or one cup of raw, leafy vegetables is counted as one serving.

Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), the most common method of delivering NIPPV, allows for separate control of inspiratory and expiratory pressures.\n\nEndotracheal Intubation With Mechanical Ventilation删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Endotracheal intubation is indicated for patients who present with apnea, coma, persistent or increasing hypercapnia, exhaustion, severe distress, and depression of mental status. Clinical judgment is necessary to assess the need for immediate endotracheal intubation for these critically ill patients. Endotracheal intubation does not solve the problem of small airway constriction in patients with severe asthma; thus, therapy directed toward relief of bronchoconstriction should be continued. Mechanical ventilation in the asthmatic patient can be difficult and associated risks require careful management. Intubation and positivepressure ventilation can trigger further bronchoconstriction and complications such as breath stacking that result from incomplete expiration, air trapping, and buildup of positive endexpiratory pressure (ie, intrinsic or auto-PEEP). This breath stacking can cause barotrauma. Decreasing tidal volume may avoid auto-PEEP and high peak airway pressures. Optimal ventilator management requires expert consultation and ongoing careful review of ventilation flow and pressure curves. Although endotracheal intubation introduces risks, it should be performed when necessary based on clinical condition.\nRapid sequence intubation is the technique of choice and should be performed by an expert in airway management. The provider should use the largest endotracheal tube available (usually 8 or 9 mm) to decrease airway resistance. Immediately after intubation, endotracheal tube placement should be confirmed by clinical examination and waveform capnography. A chest radiograph should then be performed.\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Troubleshooting After Intubation\n\nWhen severe bronchoconstriction is present, breath stacking (so-called auto-PEEP) can develop during positive-pressure ventilation, leading to complications such as hyperinflation, tension pneumothorax, and hypotension. During manual or mechanical ventilation, a slower respiratory rate should be used with smaller tidal volumes (eg, 6 to 8 mL/kg), 36 shorter inspiratory time (eg, adult inspiratory flow rate 80 to 100 mL/min), and longer expiratory time (eg, inspiratory to expiratory ratio 1:4 or 1:5) than generally would be provided to patients without asthma.删除26_2:<u></u> Management of mechanical ventilation will vary based on patient-ventilation characteristics. Expert consultation should be obtained.\nMild hypoventilation (permissive hypercapnia) reduces the risk of barotrauma. Hypercapnia is typically well tolerated.删除26_2:<u></u> .删除26_2:<u></u>删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Sedation is often required to optimize ventilation, decrease ventilator dyssynchrony (and therefore auto-PEEP), and minimize barotrauma after intubation. Because delivery of inhaled medications may be inadequate before intubation, the provider should continue to administer inhaled albuterol treatments through the endotracheal tube.\nFour common causes of acute deterioration in any intubated patient are recalled by the mnemonic DOPE (tube Displacement, tube Obstruction, Pneumothorax, Equipment failure).\nAuto-PEEP is another common cause of deterioration in patients with asthma. If the asthmatic patient's condition deteriorates or if it is difficult to ventilate the patient, check the ventilator for leaks or malfunction; verify endotracheal tube position; eliminate tube obstruction (eliminate any mucous plugs and kinks); evaluate for auto-PEEP; and rule out a pneumothorax.\nHigh-end expiratory pressure can be reduced quickly by separating the patient from the ventilator circuit; this will allow删除换行1:<u>| |</u>PEEP to dissipate during passive exhalation. If auto-PEEP results in significant hypotension, assisting with exhalation by pressing on the chest wall after disconnection of the ventilator circuit will allow active exhalation and should lead to immediate resolution of hypotension. To minimize auto-PEEP, decrease the respiratory rate or tidal volume or both. If auto-PEEP persists and the patient displays ventilator dyssynchrony despite adequate sedation, paralytic agents may be considered.\nIn exceedingly rare circumstances, aggressive treatment for acute respiratory failure due to severe asthma will not provide adequate gas exchange. There are case reports that describe successful use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in adult and pediatric patients 删除2:<u>40 – 43</u>with severe asthma after other aggressive measures have failed to reverse hyoxemia and hypercarbia.\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Bls Modifications\n\n【12】BLS treatment of cardiac arrest in asthmatic patients is unchanged.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": " patients with acute asthma. 29 Because the heliox mixture requires at least 70% helium for effect, it cannot be used if the patient requires > 30% oxygen.", "block_text_old": " patients with acute asthma. 29 Because the heliox mixture requires at least 70% helium for effect, it cannot be used if the patient requires > 30% oxygen.", "raw_context": [{"text": "patients with acute asthma. 29 Because the heliox mixture re-", "bbox": [60.0, 83.0, 375.0, 98.0]}, {"text": "quires at least 70% helium for effect, it cannot be used if the", "bbox": [60.0, 100.0, 375.0, 113.0]}, {"text": "patient requires > 30% oxygen.", "bbox": [60.0, 114.0, 218.0, 129.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [59.0, 82.0, 374.0, 128.0], "position": 8, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n## Methylxanthines\n", "block_text_old": "\n## Methylxanthines\n", "raw_context": [{"text": "Methylxanthines", "bbox": [60.0, 140.0, 151.0, 154.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [59.0, 139.0, 150.0, 153.0], "position": 3, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n\nAlthough once considered a mainstay in the treatment of acute asthma, methylxanthines are no longer recommended because of their erratic pharmacokinetics, known side effects, and lack of evidence of benefit. 30", "block_text_old": " Although once considered a mainstay in the treatment of acute asthma, methylxanthines are no longer recommended because of their erratic pharmacokinetics, known side effects, and lack of evidence of benefit. 30", "raw_context": [{"text": "Although once considered a mainstay in the treatment of acute", "bbox": [60.0, 153.0, 376.0, 167.0]}, {"text": "asthma, methylxanthines are no longer recommended because of", "bbox": [60.0, 169.0, 376.0, 183.0]}, {"text": "their erratic pharmacokinetics, known side effects, and lack of", "bbox": [60.0, 185.0, 376.0, 199.0]}, {"text": "evidence of benefit. 30", "bbox": [60.0, 200.0, 169.0, 214.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [59.0, 152.0, 375.0, 213.0], "position": 10, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n\nLeukotriene Antagonists\nLeukotriene antagonists improve lung function and decrease the need for short-acting β 2 -agonists for long-term asthma therapy, but their effectiveness during acute exacerbations of asthma is unproven.", "block_text_old": " Leukotriene Antagonists Leukotriene antagonists improve lung function and decrease the need for short-acting β 2 -agonists for long-term asthma therapy, but their effectiveness during acute exacerbations of asthma is unproven.", "raw_context": [{"text": "Leukotriene Antagonists", "bbox": [60.0, 225.0, 193.0, 239.0]}, {"text": "Leukotriene antagonists improve lung function and decrease the", "bbox": [60.0, 238.0, 376.0, 253.0]}, {"text": "need for short-acting β 2 -agonists for long-term asthma therapy,", "bbox": [60.0, 254.0, 376.0, 267.0]}, {"text": "but their effectiveness during acute exacerbations of asthma is", "bbox": [60.0, 269.0, 377.0, 283.0]}, {"text": "unproven.", "bbox": [60.0, 285.0, 112.0, 299.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [59.0, 224.0, 376.0, 298.0], "position": 12, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n## Inhaled Anesthetics\n", "block_text_old": "\n## Inhaled Anesthetics\n", "raw_context": [{"text": "Inhaled Anesthetics", "bbox": [60.0, 308.0, 168.0, 322.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [59.0, 307.0, 167.0, 321.0], "position": 5, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n\nCase reports in adults 31 and children 32 suggest a benefit of the potent inhalation anesthetics sevoflurane and isoflurane for patients with life-threatening asthma unresponsive to maximal conventional therapy.

Withholding and withdrawing life support are ethically similar. A decision to limit care or withdraw life support is justifiable if the patient is determined to be brain dead, if the physician and patient or surrogate agree that treatment goals cannot be met, or if the burden to the patient of continued treatment is believed to exceed any benefits.\nPatients in the end stage of an incurable disease should receive care that ensures their autonomy, comfort, and dignity. Interventions that minimize suffering and pain, dyspnea, delirium, convulsions, and other terminal complications should always be provided. For such patients it is ethically acceptable to gradually increase the doses of narcotics and sedatives to relieve pain and other suffering, even to levels that might concomitantly shorten the patient's life. The care team should initiate plans for future care by collaborative discussions and the resolution of any conflicts with nurses, consultants, residents, fellows, the patient (when capable of participating), surrogate decision makers, and the family. Nursing and comfort care (eg, oral hygiene, skin care, patient positioning, and measures to relieve pain and suffering) must always be continued.\nIn the absence of evidence of an incurable disease in the end stage, decisions to withdraw or limit care in the post-arrest patient are often challenging, given the difficulties of accurate prognostication, especially in the era of treatment advances such as therapeutic hypothermia.\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Prognostication In Neonatal And Pediatric Patients删除换行1:<u>| |</u>After Cardiac Arrest—Determining When To删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Withdraw Life-Sustaining Therapies\n\n【6】There is insufficient evidence about clinical neurologic signs, electrophysiologic studies, biomarkers, or imaging modalities to describe an approach to prognostication in the neonatal or pediatric patient after cardiac arrest. In the absence of prognostication guidelines, the decision to withdraw life-sustaining therapies rests with the treating physician and may vary considerably across physicians and institutions. Further research in this area is needed.\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Prognostication In Adult Patients After Cardiac删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Arrest—Determining When To Withdraw删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Life-Sustaining Therapies\n\nThere are no clinical neurologic signs, electrophysiologic studies, biomarkers, or imaging modalities that can reliably predict death or poor neurologic outcome (eg, Cerebral Performance删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Category of 3, 4, or 5) within the first 24 hours after cardiac arrest in patients treated with or without therapeutic hypothermia (see Part 9: \"Post–Cardiac Arrest Care\"). There is a tendency to withdraw care prematurely in the post-arrest patient, and this has contributed to a selection bias in the current literature on prognostic testing.\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Prognostic Testing In The Adult Post-Arrest Patient Not删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Treated With Therapeutic Hypothermia\n\nIn adult post–cardiac arrest patients who are not treated with therapeutic hypothermia, it is recommended in comatose patients that pupillary light and corneal reflexes as well as vestibular-ocular reflexes and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Motor Score be documented at 72 hours after sustained ROSC and thereafter at least daily (Class I, LOE B). When available, recording the unprocessed electroencephalography interpretation between 24 and 72 hours after sustained ROSC may be helpful to assist in the prediction of a poor outcome in the absence of sedatives, hypotension, accidental hypothermia, or hypoxemia; specifically the finding of generalized suppression to < 20 µ V, burst suppression pattern with generalized epileptic activity, or diffuse periodic complexes on a flat background (Class IIb, LOE B 81 ).\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Prognostic Testing In The Adult Post-Arrest Patient删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Treated With Therapeutic Hypothermia\n\n【12】Based on limited available evidence, potentially reliable prognosticators of poor outcome in patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest include bilateral absence of N20 peak on median nerve somatosensory evoked potential ≥ 24 hours after cardiac arrest 82.83 and the absence of both corneal and pupillary reflexes ≥ 3 days after cardiac arrest. Limited available evidence also suggests that 删除1:<u>(1)</u> GCS Motor Score of 2 or less at day 3 after sustained ROSC, 82 and 删除1:<u>(2)</u> presence of status epilepticus 删除2:<u>84 – 86</u>are potentially unreliable prognosticators of poor outcome in post–cardiac arrest patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia. Similarly, recovery of consciousness and cognitive functions is possible in a few post–cardiac arrest patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia despite bilateral absent or minimally present N20 responses of median nerve somatosensoryevoked potentials, suggesting that they may be unreliable as", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": " with no medical background have reported that being at a loved one's side and saying goodbye during the final moments of life was comforting. 62,63,67 Family members have also reported that it helped them to adjust to the death of their loved one, 68. 70 and most indicated that they would do so again. 67 Several retrospective reports note positive reactions from family members, 58– 60 many of whom said that they felt a sense of having helped their loved one and of easing their own grieving. 61 Most parents surveyed indicated that they wanted to be offered the option of being present during the resuscitative effort for their child. 60,71–79\nIn the absence of data documenting harm and in light of data suggesting that it may be helpful, offering select family members the opportunity to be present during a resuscitation is reasonable and desirable (assuming that the patient, if an adult, has not raised a prior objection) (Class IIa, LOE C for adults and Class I, LOE B for pediatric patients).

Here are a few things that you can expect from a specialized therapist:\n\n【2】1. Initial sessions with the therapist will involve the assessment of symptoms and condition. Patients may be asked about their existing symptoms, and they will also be asked what improves or worsens their condition.\n\n【3】2. Medical history can also be reviewed to help the therapist evaluate the patient's condition. From these assessment results, the specialist will be able to develop an individualized plan for therapy.\n\n【4】3.

It helps detect the presence of the condition and evaluates the extent of damage to the facial nerve. This also helps the therapist get an idea of the rate of recovery. There is no need to worry about this test. It is a simple, painless procedure and will not take much time.\n\n【5】4. If the therapist doesn't have access to an EMG machine, he or she can evaluate the condition through careful inspection of facial features including the cheeks, lips, brows, etc. The therapist might ask patients to raise their eyebrows, close their eyes or smile widely. Through these actions, the therapist will be able to observe the symmetry and movement of the face. This will also help evaluate nerve functions.\n\n【6】5. After this, the therapist will be able to judge the extent of weakness of the facial muscles. Subsequently, patients will be guided as to how they can protect their face and eyes. Therapists will perform the role of a coach and educate patients about how they can perform their daily life functions with this condition.\n\n【7】6. If patients have severe problems, such as extremely dry eyes or slurred speech, the therapist may refer them to a specialist. An ophthalmologist (a physician who specializes in the surgical or medical care of the eyes) or language therapist would then be able to manage the specific symptoms.\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Guidance And Useful Advice", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": "\n## What Will You Experience?\n", "block_text_old": "\n## What Will You Experience?\n", "raw_context": [{"text": "What Will You Experience?", "bbox": [94.0, 96.0, 328.0, 116.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [93.0, 95.0, 327.0, 115.0], "position": 0, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n\nWondering what happens in this rehabilitation therapy?

The dedicated rescuer who provides manual abdominal compressions will compress the abdomen midway between the xiphoid and the umbilicus during the relaxation phase of chest compression. Hand position, depth, rhythm, and rate of abdominal compressions are similar to those for chest compressions and the force required is similar to that used to palpate the abdominal aorta.\nIn most reports, an endotracheal tube is placed before or shortly after initiation of IAC-CPR. IAC-CPR increases diastolic aortic pressure and venous return, resulting in improved coronary perfusion pressure and blood flow to other vital organs.\nIn 2 randomized in-hospital trials, IAC-CPR performed by trained rescuers improved short-term survival 17 and survival to hospital discharge 18 compared with conventional CPR for adult cardiac arrest.

The slow pace stems in large part from the project's minimal funding. \"A lot of the attitude will change as the station becomes more and more of a burden on the astronauts,\" Lovchik says. \"Systems like this will look much, much better.\"", "raw_context": [{"text": "So three years ago the robotics crew began to", "bbox": [310.0, 166.0, 548.0, 181.0]}, {"text": "build Robonaut, designed to be the size of a", "bbox": [310.0, 183.0, 548.0, 197.0]}, {"text": "suited astronaut and to be just as dexterous.", "bbox": [310.0, 199.0, 547.0, 213.0]}, {"text": "\"The biggest problem is that the operator has", "bbox": [312.0, 215.0, 548.0, 229.0]}, {"text": "no sense of touch,\" comments Chris Lovchik,", "bbox": [310.0, 231.0, 547.0, 245.0]}, {"text": "a NASA senior engineer working on the", "bbox": [310.0, 247.0, 549.0, 261.0]}, {"text": "hands. \"To some degree, it's like operating", "bbox": [310.0, 263.0, 549.0, 277.0]}, {"text": "on Novocain, but at the same time the tools", "bbox": [310.0, 279.0, 548.0, 294.0]}, {"text": "fit into your hand as you would expect them", "bbox": [310.0, 295.0, 548.0, 309.0]}, {"text": "to.

The energy saved in a steel wire is less than the energy in a TMA wire.\nThis is why these wires exert high forces that dissipate in short periods of time.\n\nTMA is composed of 77.8% titanium, 11.3% of molibdenium, 6.6% zirconia and 4.3% of tin.

Over time, insect pests and weeds can become resistant to killing by routine chemical sprays. The same is bound to happen in the biotech age: eventually, impervious insects will munch away on GM insect-resistant plants, and the weeds surrounding herbicide-tolerant crops will shrug off the herbicide of choice. \"Agriculture is an evolutionary arms race between plant protections and pests,\" comments botanist Jonathan Wendel of Iowa State University. \"And GM crops are just one more way that we're trying to outsmart pests—temporarily.\"\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>U.S. Landscape Logistics Make It Unlikely That Herbicide-Tolerant Or Bt Crops Will Spread Their Biotech Genes.\nIt May Be Harder To Avoid Creating Superweeds Elsewhere.\n\n【3】To keep weeds vulnerable to herbicides, Monsanto and other companies urge growers to use the sprays responsibly, only when necessary. To slow insect resistance to the Bt toxin, the EPA requires Bt crop growers to set aside some part of their farmland for crops that have not been genetically modified.\nThese \"refuges\" may be a corner of a field outside a Bt crop, for instance, or rows of standard plants that break up a Bt plot.\nInside the refuges, insects that have acquired some Bt resistance breed with those that have not, diluting the resistance trait.\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>More To Explore\n\nTransgenic Plants and World Agriculture.

More broadly, Goldburg questions how much删除换行1:<u>| |</u>GM crops really do for the environment. \"In however many years,\" she says, \"we'll lose Bt as an effective control against insects, and then we'll be on to another chemical control. Many of us view this current generation of biotech crops as a kind of diversion, rather than a substantive gain for agriculture.\" She favors sustainable agriculture alternatives, including careful crop rotation and organic farming methods, over pesticides sprayed on or engineered into plants.\n\n【10】Virus-resistant GM crops have escaped widespread public concern, but they, too, pose some of the same risks as other GM crops. Some scientists worry that viruses will pick up resistance traits from virus-fighting GM crops and evolve into hard-tobeat strains that infect a newly expanded repertoire of plants.\nSome critics also question the ecological safety of emerging crops designed to resist drought, tolerate salt or deliver an extra nutritional punch. For example, Margaret Mellon of the Union of Concerned Scientists notes that salt-tolerant rice could potentially behave like a disruptive weed if it found its way into vulnerable wetlands.\n\n\"I don't think it's fair to say that every single GM crop is going to be a problem,\" Rissler remarks. \"But we need to devote the research to risks now, rather than deal with repercussions later.\"\nStill, some farmers are confident that GM technology can revolutionize agriculture for the better. For 30 years, Ryland删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Utlaut of Grand Pass, Mo., has been sowing and reaping 3,500 acres along the Missouri River. Last year, for the first time, he planted only herbicide-tolerant corn and soybeans across his entire, soil-friendly, no-till farm.

There is massive evidence relating to the use of this technique for other medical conditions and different muscle groups in your body. You can always ask your doctor whether biofeedback is something you should incorporate into your treatment.\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Facial Rehabilitation\n\n【9】Facial rehabilitation therapy is another known method used to promote recovery among patients affected by Bell’s palsy. It incorporates various methods such as facial exercise; massages and stretching techniques that help people relearn facial movements and develop stronger movement control as well.\n\n【10】Successful treatment and the subsequent choice of therapy for Bell's palsy depends on determining the cause of the condition. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, it is also important to assess the severity of the symptoms and how long you've had this condition before any therapy is started.\n\n【11】An expert of facial rehabilitation will assess your diagnosis and will refer you to a speech or language therapist depending on your symptoms and present situation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": "\nEach biofeedback session usually lasts less than 60 minutes.

Recent studies showed that the Atkins Diet causes greater weight loss than the American Heart Association-recommended high carb, low fat diet. In fact, for obese people with disorders of carbohydrate metabolism (hyperinsulinemia, hypoglycemia, and insulin resistance), Atkins-style diets have been shown to work especially well.\n\n【2】However, if your definition of what \"works\" is permanent fat loss , then the Atkins diet doesn't fare so well… but then again neither do any other diets. It seems that despite some encouraging initial successes, Atkin's dieters still face the same difficulties in keeping off the weight as everyone else. Some of the same studies showing rapid weight loss on Atkins in the beginning also showed substantial weight gain as soon as the diets ended.\n\n【3】Truth is, a growing body of evidence is mounting that carbohydrate restriction can accelerate weight loss in the short term, but it has yet to be proven that it keeps the fat off in the long run.\n\n【4】Which approach towards low carb dieting is best is also up for debate: Not all low carb diets are high fat or ketogenic and not all are \"ultra-low\" in carbs. A low carb diet can be low in carbs and high in fat, it can be low in carbs and high in protein, or it can be somewhere in the middle\n\n【5】I predict that continued research will discover that moderate carbohydrate restriction (especially in a cyclical fashion) and careful selection of carbohydrates, will in fact assist with fat loss via hormonal control, metabolic efficiency and appetite regulation.\nI believe that neither extreme  - the severely restricted low carb diet (ketogenic diet) or the very high carb, low fat diet – will emerge the victor.\n\n##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Lie #2: There’S A Ton Of New Research Proving The Atkins Diet Is Effective\n\n【7】If you surf around the Internet for a while searching for \"Atkins Diet,\" you are likely to see a lot of advertisements and news briefs pointing to the new research \"proving\" that Atkins is effective.\n\n【8】\"New England Journal of Medicine Vindicates Atkins diet.\"\n\n【9】\"Studies suggest Atkins diet is safe.\"\n\n【10】\"New research challenges 30 years of Nutritional Dogma.\"\n\n【11】Truth is, these headlines are not giving you the full picture.\n\n【12】Until and unless you have closely examined these studies and the researcher's interpretation of the results, don't be so quick to believe the diet hearsay and gossip.\n\n【13】The general conclusion of nearly all these studies is that Atkins IS equally if not more effective for short term weight loss than conventional diets.
