These arrhythmias are not due to a circulating circuit but to an excited automatic focus. Unlike the abrupt pattern of reentry, the characteristic onset and termination of these tachyarrhythmias are more gradual and analogous to how the sinus node behaves in gradually accelerating and slowing heart rate. These automatic arrhythmias include ectopic atrial tachycardia, MAT, and junctional tachycardia. These arrhythmias can be difficult to treat, are not responsive to cardioversion, and are usually controlled acutely with drugs that slow conduction through the AV node and thereby slow ventricular rate.\n\n【1】#删除26_4:<u>\n</u>herapy\n\n【2】Vagal Maneuvers.  Vagal maneuvers and adenosine are the preferred initial therapeutic choices for the termination of stable PSVT 删除图片5:<u>(Figure 4, Box 7)</u>. Vagal maneuvers alone (Valsalva maneuver or carotid sinus massage) will terminate up to 25% of PSVTs. 删除2:<u>378–380</u>For other SVTs, vagal maneuvers and adenosine may transiently slow the ventricular rate and potentially assist rhythm diagnosis but will not usually terminate such arrhythmias.\n\n【3】Adenosine.  If PSVT does not respond to vagal maneuvers, give 6 mg of IV adenosine as a rapid IV push through a large (eg, antecubital) vein followed by a 20 mL saline flush (Class I, LOE B). If the rhythm does not convert within 1 to 2 minutes, give a 12 mg rapid IV push using the method above.\nBecause of the possibility of initiating atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rates in a patient with WPW, a defibrillator should be available when adenosine is administered to any patient in whom WPW is a consideration. As with vagal maneuvers, the effect of adenosine on other SVTs (such as atrial fibrillation or flutter) is to transiently slow ventricular rate (which may be useful diagnostically) but not afford their termination or meaningful lasting rate control.\nA number of studies 删除2:<u>381–398</u>support the use of adenosine in the treatment of stable PSVT. Although 2 randomized clinical trials 删除2:<u>383 , 386</u>documented a similar PSVT conversion rate between adenosine and calcium channel blockers, adenosine was more rapid and had fewer severe side effects than verapamil. Amiodarone as well as other antiarrhythmic agents can be useful in the termination of PSVT, but the onset of action of amiodarone is slower than that of adenosine, 399 and the potential proarrhythmic risks of these agents favor the use of safer treatment alternatives.\nAdenosine is safe and effective in pregnancy.删除26_2:<u></u> However, adenosine does have several important drug interactions.\nLarger doses may be required for patients with a significant blood level of theophylline, caffeine, or theobromine. The initial dose should be reduced to 3  mg in patients taking dipyridamole or carbamazepine, those with transplanted hearts, or if given by central venous access. Side effects with adenosine are common but transient; flushing, dyspnea, and chest discomfort are the most frequently observed.删除26_2:<u></u> Adenosine should not be given to patients with asthma.\nAfter conversion, monitor the patient for recurrence and treat any recurrence of PSVT with adenosine or a longeracting AV nodal blocking agent (eg, diltiazem or β -blocker).\nIf adenosine or vagal maneuvers disclose another form of SVT (such as atrial fibrillation or flutter), treatment with a longer-acting AV nodal blocking agent should be considered to afford more lasting control of ventricular rate.\n\n【4】Calcium Channel Blockers and β -Blockers.  If adenosine or vagal maneuvers fail to convert PSVT 删除图片5:<u>(Figure 4, Box 7)</u>, PSVT recurs after such treatment, or these treatments disclose a different form of SVT (such as atrial fibrillation or flutter), it is reasonable to use longer-acting AV nodal blocking agents, such as the nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil and diltiazem) (Class IIa, LOE B) or β -blockers (Class IIa, LO删除26_4:<u>\n</u>). These drugs act primarily on nodal tissue either to terminate the reentry PSVTs that depend on conduction through the AV node or to slow the ventricular response to other SVTs by blocking conduction through the AV node. The alternate mechanism of action and longer duration of these drugs may result in more sustained termination of PSVT or afford more sustained rate control of atrial arrhythmias (such as atrial fibrillation or flutter). A number of studies have established the effectiveness of verapamil 删除2:<u>381,383,384,386,394</u> 删除2:<u>398,402–405</u>and diltiazem 删除2:<u>402,406,407</u>in converting PSVT to normal sinus rhythm.\nFor verapamil, give a 2.5 mg to 5 mg IV bolus over 2 minutes (over 3 minutes in older patients). If there is no therapeutic response and no drug-induced adverse event, repeated doses of 5 mg to 10 mg may be administered every 15 to 30 minutes to a total dose of 20 mg. An alternative dosing regimen is to give a 5  mg bolus every 15 minutes to a total dose of 30  mg.\nVerapamil should be given only to patients with narrowcomplex reentry SVT or arrhythmias known with certainty to be of supraventricular origin. Verapamil should not be given to patients with wide-complex tachycardias. It should not be given to patients with impaired ventricular function or heart failure.\nFor diltiazem, give a dose of 15 mg to 20 mg (0.25 mg/kg) IV over 2 minutes; if needed, in 15 minutes give an additional IV dose of 20 mg to 25 mg (0.35 mg/kg). The maintenance infusion dose is 5 mg/hour to 15 mg/hour, titrated to heart rate.\nA wide variety of IV β -blockers are available for treatment of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. These include metoprolol, atenolol, propranolol, esmolol, and labetolol (the latter more commonly used for acute management of hypertension than for arrhythmias). In principle these agents exert their effect by antagonizing sympathetic tone in nodal tissue, resulting in slowing of conduction. Like calcium channel blockers, they also have negative inotropic effects and further reduce cardiac output in patients with heart failure. More detailed information is provided below. Side effects of β -blockers can include bradycardias, AV conduction delays, and hypotension. β -blockers should be used with caution in patients with obstructive pulmonary disease or congestive heart failure.\nCaution is advised when encountering pre-excited atrial fibrillation or flutter that conducts to the ventricles via both the AV node and an accessory pathway. Treatment with an AV nodal blocking agent (including adenosine, calcium blockers, β -blockers, or digoxin) is unlikely to slow the ventricular rate and in some instances may accelerate the ventricular response.\n\n【5】Therefore, AV nodal blocking drugs should not be used for pre-excited atrial fibrillation or flutter (Class III, LOE C).\nCaution is also advised to avoid the combination of AV nodal blocking agents that have a longer duration of action. For example, the short elimination half-life of adenosine affords follow-up treatment, if required, with a calcium channel blocker or b -blocker. Conversely the longer half-life of a calcium channel or β -blocker means their effects will overlap; profound bradycardia can develop if they are given serially.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": "\nYet another group of SVTs is referred to as automatic tachycardias.

If adenosine or vagal maneuvers fail to convert PSVT (Figure 4, Box 7), PSVT recurs after such treatment, or these treatments disclose a different form of SVT (such as atrial fibrillation or flutter), it is reasonable to use longer-acting AV nodal blocking agents, such as the nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil and diltiazem) (Class IIa, LOE B) or β -blockers (Class IIa, LOE\nC). These drugs act primarily on nodal tissue either to terminate the reentry PSVTs that depend on conduction through the AV node or to slow the ventricular response to other SVTs by blocking conduction through the AV node. The alternate mechanism of action and longer duration of these drugs may result in more sustained termination of PSVT or afford more sustained rate control of atrial arrhythmias (such as atrial fibrillation or flutter). A number of studies have established the effectiveness of verapamil 381,383,384,386,394, 398,402–405 and diltiazem 402,406,407 in converting PSVT to normal sinus rhythm.\nFor verapamil, give a 2.5 mg to 5 mg IV bolus over 2 minutes (over 3 minutes in older patients). If there is no therapeutic response and no drug-induced adverse event, repeated doses of 5 mg to 10 mg may be administered every 15 to 30 minutes to a total dose of 20 mg. An alternative dosing regimen is to give a 5  mg bolus every 15 minutes to a total dose of 30  mg.\nVerapamil should be given only to patients with narrowcomplex reentry SVT or arrhythmias known with certainty to be of supraventricular origin. Verapamil should not be given to patients with wide-complex tachycardias. It should not be given to patients with impaired ventricular function or heart failure.\nFor diltiazem, give a dose of 15 mg to 20 mg (0.25 mg/kg) IV over 2 minutes; if needed, in 15 minutes give an additional IV dose of 20 mg to 25 mg (0.35 mg/kg). The maintenance infusion dose is 5 mg/hour to 15 mg/hour, titrated to heart rate.\nA wide variety of IV β -blockers are available for treatment of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. These include metoprolol, atenolol, propranolol, esmolol, and labetolol (the latter more commonly used for acute management of hypertension than for arrhythmias). In principle these agents exert their effect by antagonizing sympathetic tone in nodal tissue, resulting in slowing of conduction. Like calcium channel blockers, they also have negative inotropic effects and further reduce cardiac output in patients with heart failure. More detailed information is provided below. Side effects of β -blockers can include bradycardias, AV conduction delays, and hypotension. β -blockers should be used with caution in patients with obstructive pulmonary disease or congestive heart failure.\nCaution is advised when encountering pre-excited atrial fibrillation or flutter that conducts to the ventricles via both the AV node and an accessory pathway. Treatment with an AV nodal blocking agent (including adenosine, calcium blockers, β -blockers, or digoxin) is unlikely to slow the ventricular rate and in some instances may accelerate the ventricular response.\n\nTherefore, AV nodal blocking drugs should not be used for pre-excited atrial fibrillation or flutter (Class III, LOE C).\nCaution is also advised to avoid the combination of AV nodal blocking agents that have a longer duration of action.

If the adult victim is unresponsive with no breathing or no normal breathing (ie, only gasping), healthcare providers can check for a pulse, but should start CPR if a pulse is not definitely felt within 10 seconds. Do not wait to check the victim's temperature and do not wait until the victim is rewarmed to start CPR. To prevent further heat loss, remove wet clothes from the victim; insulate or shield the victim from wind, heat, or cold; and if possible, ventilate the victim with warm, humidified oxygen.\nAvoid rough movement, and transport the victim to a hospital as soon as possible. If VF is detected, emergency personnel should deliver shocks using the same protocols used for the normothermic cardiac arrest victim (see Part 12: \"Cardiac Arrest in Special Situations\").\nFor the hypothermic patient in cardiac arrest, continue resuscitative efforts until the patient is evaluated by advanced care providers.

The choking event is therefore commonly witnessed, and the rescuer usually intervenes while the victim is still responsive. Treatment is usually successful, and survival rates can exceed 95%.删除26_2:<u></u>\n\n【6】#删除26_4:<u>\n</u>ecognition Of Foreign-Body Airway Obstruction\n\n【7】Because recognition of FBAO is the key to successful outcome, it is important to distinguish this emergency from fainting, heart attack, seizure, or other conditions that may cause sudden respiratory distress, cyanosis, or loss of consciousness.\nForeign bodies may cause either mild or severe airway obstruction. The rescuer should intervene if the choking victim shows signs of severe airway obstruction. These include signs of poor air exchange and increased breathing difficulty, such as a silent cough, cyanosis, or inability to speak or breathe. The victim may clutch the neck, demonstrating the universal choking sign. Quickly ask, \"Are you choking?\" If the victim indicates \"yes\" by nodding his head without speaking, this will verify that the victim has severe airway obstruction.\n\n【8】Relief of Foreign-Body Airway Obstruction When FBAO produces signs of severe airway obstruction, rescuers must act quickly to relieve the obstruction. If mild obstruction is present and the victim is coughing forcefully, do not interfere with the patient's spontaneous coughing and breathing efforts. Attempt to relieve the obstruction only if signs of severe obstruction develop: the cough becomes silent, respiratory difficulty increases and is accompanied by stridor, or the victim becomes unresponsive. Activate the EMS system quickly if the patient is having difficulty breathing. If more than one rescuer is present, one rescuer should phone 911 while the other rescuer attends to the choking victim.\nThe clinical data about effectiveness of maneuvers to relieve FBAO are largely retrospective and anecdotal. For responsive adults and children > 1 year of age with sever删除26_4:<u>\n</u>BAO, case reports show the feasibility and effectiveness of back blows or \"slaps,\" 删除2:<u>276 – 278</u>abdominal thrusts, 删除2:<u>275 – 277 , 279 , 280</u>and chest thrusts. 删除2:<u>276 , 281</u>In 1 case series of 513 choking episodes for which EMS was summoned, 275 approximately 50% of the episodes of airway obstruction were relieved prior to arrival of EMS. EMS intervention with abdominal thrusts successfully relieved the obstruction in more than 85% of the remaining cases. The few patients with persistent obstruction usually responded to suction or the use of Magill forceps.\nLess than 4% died.删除26_2:<u></u删除26_4:<u>\n</u>lthough chest thrusts, back slaps, and abdominal thrusts are feasible and effective for relieving severe FBAO in conscious (responsive) adults and children ≥ 1 year of age, for simplicity in training it is recommended that abdominal thrusts be applied in rapid sequence until the obstruction is relieved (Class IIb, LO删除26_4:<u>\n</u>). If abdominal thrusts are not effective, the rescuer may consider chest thrusts (Class IIb, LOE B). It is important to note that abdominal thrusts are not recommended for infants < 1 year of age because thrusts may cause injuries.\nChest thrusts should be used for obese patients if the rescuer is unable to encircle the victim's abdomen. If the choking victim is in the late stages of pregnancy, the rescuer should use chest thrusts instead of abdominal thrusts.\nIf the adult victim with FBAO becomes unresponsive, the rescuer should carefully support the patient to the ground, immediately activate (or send someone to activate) EMS, and then begin CPR.  The healthcare provider should carefully lower the victim to the ground, send someone to activate the emergency response system and begin CPR (without a pulse check). After 2 minutes, if someone has not already done so, the healthcare provider should activate the emeregency response system.

Simply looking into the mouth should not significantly increase the time needed to attempt the ventilations and proceed to the 30 chest compressions.\nNo studies have evaluated the routine use of the finger sweep to clear an airway in the absence of visible airway obstruction.

Studies indicate that parents desire a larger role in decisions to initiate resuscitation and continue life support of severely compromised newborns.\nOpinions among neonatal providers vary widely regarding the benefits and disadvantages of aggressive therapies in such newborns.\n\n【3】#删除26_4:<u>\n</u>ithholding Resuscitation\n\n【4】It is possible to identify conditions associated with high mortality and poor outcome in which withholding resuscitative efforts may be considered reasonable, particularly when there has been the opportunity for parental agreement (Class IIb, LOE C 删除2:<u>101 , 102</u>).\n\n【5】A consistent and coordinated approach to individual cases by the obstetric and neonatal teams and the parents is an important goal. Noninitiation of resuscitation and discontinuation of life-sustaining treatment during or after resuscitation are ethically equivalent, and clinicians should not hesitate to withdraw support when functional survival is highly unlikely.删除26_2:<u></u> The following guidelines must be interpreted according to current regional outcomes:\n•When gestation, birth weight, or congenital anomalies are associated with almost certain early death and when unacceptably high morbidity is likely among the rare survivors, resuscitation is not indicated. Examples include extreme prematurity (gestational age < 23 weeks or birth weight < 400 g), anencephaly, and some major chromosomal abnormalities, such as trisomy 13 (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【6】In conditions associated with a high rate of survival and acceptable morbidity, resuscitation is nearly always indicated. This will generally include babies with gestational age ≥ 25 weeks and those with most congenital malformations (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【7】•In conditions associated with uncertain prognosis in which survival is borderline, the morbidity rate is relatively high, and the anticipated burden to the child is high, parental desires concerning initiation of resuscitation should be supported (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【8】Assessment of morbidity and mortality risks should take into consideration available data, and may be augmented by use of published tools based on data from specific populations. Decisions should also take into account changes in medical practice that may occur over time.\nMortality and morbidity data by gestational age compiled from data collected by perinatal centers in the US and several other countries may be found on the Neonatal\n删除10:<u>Resuscitation Program (NRP) website (www.aap.org/nrp).</u删除26_4:<u>\n</u> link to a computerized tool to estimate mortality and morbidity from a population of extremely low-birth-weight babies born in a network of regional perinatal centers may be found at that site. However, unless conception occurred via in vitro fertilization, techniques used for obstetric dating are accurate to only ±3 to 4 days if applied in the first trimester and to only ±1 to 2 weeks subsequently.\nEstimates of fetal weight are accurate to only ±15% to 20%. Even small discrepancies of 1 or 2 weeks between estimated and actual gestational age or a 100- to 200-g difference in birth weight may have implications for survival and long-term morbidity. Also, fetal weight can be misleading if there has been intrauterine growth restriction, and outcomes may be less predictable. These uncertainties underscore the importance of not making firm commitments about withholding or providing resuscitation until you have the opportunity to examine the baby after birth.\n\n【9】#删除26_4:<u>\n</u>iscontinuing Resuscitative Efforts\n\n【10】In a newly born baby with no detectable heart rate, it is appropriate to consider stopping resuscitation if the heart rate remains undetectable for 10 minutes (Class IIb, LO删除26_4:<u>\n</u> 删除2:<u>104 – 106</u>). The decision to continue resuscitation efforts beyond 10 minutes with no heart rate should take into consideration factors such as the presumed etiology of the arrest, the gestation of the baby, the presence or absence of complications, the potential role of therapeutic hypothermia, and the parents' previously expressed feelings about acceptable risk of morbidity.\n\n【11】#删除26_4:<u>\n</u>tructure Of Educational Programs To Teac删除26_4:<u>\n</u>eonatal Resuscitation\n\n【12】Studies have demonstrated that use of simulation-based learning methodologies enhances performance in both real-life clinical situations and simulated resuscitations, 删除2:<u>107– 110</u>although a few studies have found no differences when compared to standard or other nonsimulated training. 删除2:<u>111 , 112</u>Also, studies examining briefings or debriefings of resuscitation team performance have generally shown improved knowledge or skills. 删除2:<u>113–118</u>Interpretation of data is complicated by the heterogeneity and limitations of the studies, including a paucity of data about clinical outcomes.

Target inflation pressures and long inspiratory times are more consistently achieved in mechanical models when T-piece devices are used rather than bags, 60.61 although the clinical implications of these findings are not clear (Class IIb, LOE C). It is likely that inflation pressures will need to change as compliance improves following birth, but the relationship of pressures to delivered volume and the optimal volume to deliver with each breath as FRC is being established have not been studied.

There are limited data on the use of these devices in small preterm infants, ie, < 2000 g or < 34 weeks (Class IIb, LOE C 删除2:<u>65 – 67</u>). A laryngeal mask should be considered during resuscitation if facemask ventilation is unsuccessful and tracheal intubation is unsuccessful or not feasible (Class IIa, LOE B). The laryngeal mask has not been evaluated in cases of meconium-stained fluid, during chest compressions, or for administration of emergency intratracheal medications.\n\n【5】#删除26_4:<u>\n</u>ndotracheal Tube Placement\n\n【6】Endotracheal intubation may be indicated at several points during neonatal resuscitation:\n•Initial endotracheal suctioning of nonvigorous meconiumstained newborns\n•If bag-mask ventilation is ineffective or prolonged\n•When chest compressions are performed\n•For special resuscitation circumstances, such as congenital diaphragmatic hernia or extremely low birth weight\n\n【7】The timing of endotracheal intubation may also depend on the skill and experience of the available providers.\nAfter endotracheal intubation and administration of intermittent positive pressure, a prompt increase in heart rate is the best indicator that the tube is in the tracheobronchial tree and providing effective ventilation.删除26_2:<u></u> Exhaled CO 2 detection is effective for confirmation of endotracheal tube placement in infants, including very low-birth-weight infants (Class IIa, LOE B 删除2:<u>68 – 71</u>). A positive test result (detection of exhaled CO 2 ) in patients with adequate cardiac output confirms placement of the endotracheal tube within the trachea, whereas a negative test result (ie, no CO 2 detected) strongly suggests esophageal intubation. 删除2:<u>68–72</u>Exhaled CO 2 detection is the recommended method of confirmation of endotracheal tube placement (Class IIa, LOE B). However, it should be noted that poor or absent pulmonary blood flow may give false-negative results (ie, no CO 2 detected despite tube placement in the trachea). A false-negative result may thus lead to unnecessary extubation and reintubation of critically ill infants with poor cardiac output.\nOther clinical indicators of correct endotracheal tube placement are condensation in the endotracheal tube, chest movement, and presence of equal breath sounds bilaterally, but these indicators have not been systematically evaluated in neonates (Class 11b, LOE C).\n\n【8】#删除26_4:<u>\n</u>hest Compressions\n\n【9】Chest compressions are indicated for a heart rate that is < 60 per minute despite adequate ventilation with supplementary oxygen for 30 seconds. Because ventilation is the most effective action in neonatal resuscitation and because chest compressions are likely to compete with effective ventilation, rescuers should ensure that assisted ventilation is being delivered optimally before starting chest compressions.\nCompressions should be delivered on the lower third of the sternum to a depth of approximately one third of the anteriorposterior diameter of the chest (Class IIb, LOE C 删除2:<u>73 – 75</u>). Two techniques have been described: compression with 2 thumbs with fingers encircling the chest and supporting the back (the 2 thumb–encircling hands technique) or compression with 2 fingers with a second hand supporting the back. Because the 2 thumb–encircling hands technique may generate higher peak systolic and coronary perfusion pressure than the 2-finger technique, 删除2:<u>76–80</u>the 2 thumb–encircling hands technique is recommended for performing chest compressions in newly born infants (Class IIb, LOE C). The 2-finger technique may be preferable when access to the umbilicus is required during insertion of an umbilical catheter, although it is possible to administer the 2 thumb–encircling hands technique in intubated infants with the rescuer standing at the baby's head, thus permitting adequate access to the umbilicus (Class IIb, LOE C).\nCompressions and ventilations should be coordinated to avoid simultaneous delivery.删除26_2:<u></u> The chest should be permitted to reexpand fully during relaxation, but the rescuer's thumbs should not leave the chest (Class IIb, LOE C). There should be a 3:1 ratio of compressions to ventilations with 90 compressions and 30 breaths to achieve approximately 120 events per minute to maximize ventilation at an achievable rate.

This process is best known from the manufacturing of glass, which is an amorphous form of silica. Although rapid cooling works for making amorphous silica, it does not work for liquid water. Water droplets tend to crystallize even when cooled rapidly. As a result, amorphous ice was discovered only when, in 1935, scientists investigated the behavior of water vapor deposited slowly in a vacuum.\nThis discovery was of special interest to astronomers, because they knew that water behaves differently in the vacuum of space than it does on Earth. Most people know that a water molecule consists of one oxygen atom chemically bonded to two atoms of hydrogen. But what makes water such a mutable substance is that the oxygen atom has two negatively charged, paired electrons that can form weak bonds with the positively charged hydrogen atoms of a nearby water molecule. At temperatures below freezing, the water molecules move into their most stable configurations, thus strengthening the so-called hydrogen bonds, and the resulting ice becomes neatly organized over many hundreds of molecules.\nThe particular stacking pattern that develops as water freezes depends on pressure. The pattern forms one of 12 known phases of crystalline water ice, but only one—hexagonal ice—occurs naturally on Earth. The oxygen atoms form a sixfold pattern, which we see in the shape of snowflakes.\nAt temperatures well below freezing, the oxygen atoms can stack in a cubic pattern or, as in the case of amorphous ice, can even be prevented from forming any noticeable order at all.\nMuch of the bonding network that is characteristic of crystalline ice also binds molecules of liquid water. The essential difference—and the one that is critical for life—is that the hydrogen bonds in liquid water redistribute rapidly and constantly. Liquid water is thus capable of adjusting its structure to accommodate the physical and chemical requirements of living things. Just as an air bubble can rise through water but not through solid ice, organic molecules must be able to travel between water molecules if they are going to recombine into more complex compounds.\nPerhaps the most exciting property of interstellar amorphous ice is that when exposed to radiation such as that found in deep space, it too can flow—even though its temperature is a scant few degrees above absolute zero (which is equivalent to –273 degrees Celsius). Indeed, the similarity of this ice to liquid water allows it to participate in the creation of organic compounds.

If the donated blood has no identifying information to link it to the donor, there would be no way to prevent it from being used in another child. Stem cells in the umbilical cord blood of a child who later gets leukemia could also cause leukemia in a recipient.

Boyse of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City and their colleagues revived interest in the technique by showing that human cord blood contains as many stem cells as bone marrow does. That same year Broxmeyer, Eliane Gluckman of  Saint- Louis Hospital in Paris and their co-workers reported curing Fanconi anemia—a potentially fatal genetic disorder— in a five-year-old boy using blood from his baby sister's umbilical cord. Since then, approximately 75 percent of umbilical cord blood transplants have used cord blood from a nonrelative obtained from cord blood storage programs.\n\n【2】#删除26_4:<u>\n</u>hat’S Bred In The Bone\n\n【3】UMBILICAL CORD BLOOD transplantation aims to obtain a source of stem cells that is the best possible match for a particular patient's tissue type. Tissue type is determined by a set of genes that make proteins called human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), which are found on the surfaces of all body cells. The immune system recognizes cells bearing the HLA proteins it has encountered since birth as normal, or belonging to the \"self.\" Any other HLA proteins are regarded as \"nonself,\" or foreign; cells carrying them are quickly killed.\nThere are six major HLA genes. Every person has two copies, or alleles, of each— one from each parent. (Each allele can come in more than 30 different types.) For bone marrow transplants, physicians aim to match the six alleles (of the total 12) that are most clinically relevant in transplantation. But because cord blood cells are immunologically different from bone marrow cells, doctors can use donor cord blood samples that match five—or even three—HLA alleles.\nThe genetic blueprints for makin删除26_4:<u>\n</u>LA proteins are found on chromosome 6.

Wolpe says that this is a good trade-off but that risks will always be associated with donor cord blood, just as they are with donor adult blood. \"You try to keep it as safe as you can,\" he says, \"but people take a chance.\" — Carol Ezzell, staff writer", "raw_context": [{"text": "LAST SEPTEMBER a little girl from California named Molly received a lifesaving", "bbox": [64.0, 164.0, 429.0, 186.0]}, {"text": "transplant of umbilical cord blood from her newborn brother, Adam.

However, the 2010 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC also take into consideration local resources, training and education issues, available healthcare systems, and cost-effectiveness. That translation often must balance an acknowledgment of the limitations of systems with an effort to advocate for the care most likely to improve survival from cardiac arrest.\n\n【6】In summary, the evidence review process has attempted to provide a systematic review of the scientific literature using a priori defined methods. The details and steps of the literature review are transparent and replicable.

Biological reactions require nitrogen in the form of ammonia, but the only common nitrogen compound thought to have been available on the primitive earth is nitrogen gas. Perhaps, Brandes thought, the environment at hydrothermal vents mimics an industrial process in which ammonia is synthesized by passing nitrogen and hydrogen over a hot metallic surface. Sure enough, when we subjected hydrogen, nitrogen and the iron oxide mineral magnetite to the pressures and temperatures characteristic of a seafloor vent, the mineral catalyzed the synthesis of ammonia [ see box on page 80 ].\nThe idea that minerals may have triggered life's first crucial steps has emerged most forcefully from the landmark theory of chemist Günter Wächtershäuser, a German patent lawyer with a deep interest in life's origins. In 1988 Wächtershäuser advanced a sweeping theory of organic evolution in which minerals—mostly iron and nickel sulfides that abound at deepsea hydrothermal vents—could have served as the template, the catalyst and the energy source that drove the formation of biological molecules. Indeed, he has argued that primitive living entities were molecular coatings that adhered to the positively charged surfaces of pyrite  , a mineral composed of iron and sulfur.\nThese entities, he further suggests, obtained energy from the chemical reactions that produce pyrite.

This principle is applied to all intraoral elastics that are used to co-assist in the orthodontic treatment. \"Z\" elastics are an important auxiliary that we use in orthodontic therapy to uncross a tooth or a group of teeth. The elastics are placed on the palatine aspects of the upper teeth to be uncrossed to the buccal hooks of the lower teeth. The elastics must be 1/8\" in diameter. The effect and activation of these elastics are incremented by the mandibular movements. 删除1:<u>(29)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": "\n## Recommendations\n", "block_text_old": "\n## Recommendations\n", "raw_context": [{"text": "Recommendations", "bbox": [64.0, 83.0, 194.0, 99.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [63.0, 82.0, 193.0, 98.0], "position": 1, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n\n1.1.1.

Because CO 2 is a trace gas in atmospheric air, CO 2 detected by capnography in exhaled air is produced in the body and delivered to the lungs by circulating blood. Under normal conditions P ETCO 2 is in the range of 35 to 40 mm Hg.\n\nDuring untreated cardiac arrest CO 2 continues to be produced in the body, but there is no CO 2 delivery to the lungs. Under these conditions P ETCO 2 will approach zero with continued ventilation. With initiation of CPR, cardiac output is the major determinant of CO 2 delivery to the lungs. If ventilation is relatively constant, P ETCO 2 correlates well with cardiac output during CPR. The correlation between P ETCO 2 and cardiac output during CPR can be transiently altered by giving IV sodium bicarbonate. 208 This is explained by the fact that the bicarbonate is converted to water and CO 2 , causing a transient increase in delivery of CO 2 to the lungs. Therefore, a transient rise in P ETCO 2 after sodium bicarbonate therapy is expected and should not be misinterpreted as an improvement in quality of CPR or a sign of ROSC. Animal and human studies have also shown that P ETCO 2 correlates with CPP and cerebral perfusion pressure during CPR. 209 . 210 The correlation of P ETCO 2 with CPP during CPR can be altered by vasopressor therapy, especially at high doses (ie, > 1 mg of epinephrine). 211–214 Vasopressors cause increased afterload, which will increase blood pressure and myocardial blood flow during CPR but will also decrease cardiac output. Therefore, a small decrease in Petco 2 after vasopressor therapy may occur but should not be misinterpreted as a decrease in CPR quality.\n\nPersistently low Petco 2 values (<10 mm Hg) during CPR in intubated patients suggest that ROSC is unlikely 171,173,174,190,191,215,216 Similar data using quantitative monitoring of P ETCO 2 are not available for patients with a supraglottic airway or those receiving bag-mask ventilation during CPR.  One study using colorimetic end-tidal CO 2 detection in nonintubated patients during CPR found that low end-tidal CO 2 was not a reliable predictor of failure to achieve ROSC. 217 An air leak during bag-mask ventilation or ventilation with a supraglottic airway could result in lower measured P ETCO 2 values. Although a P ETCO 2 value of < 10 mm Hg in intubated patients indicates that cardiac output is inadequate to achieve ROSC, a specific target P ETCO 2 value that optimizes the chance of ROSC has not been established. Monitoring P ETCO 2 trends during CPR has the potential to guide individual optimization of compression depth and rate and to detect fatigue in the provider performing compressions. 201,218,219 In addition, an abrupt sustained increase in P ETCO 2 during CPR is an indicator of ROSC. 91,177,196,198– 201 Therefore, it is reasonable to consider using quantitative waveform capnography in intubated patients to monitor CPR quality, optimize chest compressions, and detect ROSC during chest compressions or when rhythm check reveals an organized rhythm (Class IIb, LOE C). If P ETCO 2 is <10 mm Hg, it is reasonable to consider trying to improve CPR quality by optimizing chest compression parameters (Class IIb, LOE C). If P etco, abruptly increases to a normal value (35 to 40 mm Hg), it is reasonable to consider that this is an indicator of ROSC (Class IIa, LOE B).

Some people without lung disease who have a type of heart dysfunction called \"congestive heart failure\" can wheeze if they take in too much fluid. Still others might wheeze after a severe allergy, such as to a bee sting, for example. Gastric reflux, called \"GERD\" (gastro-esophageal reflux disease), is a disease of the digestive system and is an example of a nonpulmonary condition that can mimic asthma. Similarly, vocal cord dysfunction syndrome, or \"VCD,\" affects the voice box (larynx) and is often confused with asthma.

Once these stimuli disappear when the orthodontic treatment is over and normal function is reestablished, the tissues affected by the dental movements will recuperate their structure in a new position. Teeth must be considered potentially unstable and must be contained in their new position.

For example, restoration of blood pressure and gas exchange does not ensure survival and functional recovery.\nSignificant cardiovascular dysfunction can develop, requiring support of blood flow and ventilation, including intravascular volume expansion, vasoactive and inotropic drugs, and invasive devices. Therapeutic hypothermia and treatment of the underlying cause of cardiac arrest impacts survival and neurological outcomes. Protocolized hemodynamic optimization and multidisciplinary early goal-directed therapy protocols have been introduced as part of a bundle of care to improve survival rather than single interventions. 删除2:<u>10–12</u>The data suggests that proactive titration of post–cardiac arrest hemodynamics to levels intended to ensure organ perfusion and oxygenation may improve outcomes. There are multiple specific options for acheiving these goals, and it is difficult to distinguish between the benefit of protocols or any specific component of care that is most important.\nA comprehensive, structured, multidisciplinary system of care should be implemented in a consistent manner for the treatment of post–cardiac arrest patients (Class I, LOE B).\nPrograms should include as part of structured interventions therapeutic hypothermia; optimization of hemodynamics and gas exchange; immediate coronary reperfusion when indicated for restoration of coronary blood flow with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI); glycemic control; and neurological diagnosis, management, and prognostication.\n\n【11】#删除26_4:<u>\n</u>verview Of Post–Cardiac Arrest Care\n\n【12】The provider of CPR should ensure an adequate airway and support breathing immediately after ROSC.

That's the sensory-deprived state of personal computing today. PCs communicate with their users almost exclusively via images and sounds, ignoring all the other cues that humans rely on to perceive the world. Admittedly, interacting with your computer through the senses of smell and taste may not be absolutely essential. But now PC users can try the iFeel mouse, a device from peripherals manufacturer Logitech that adds the all-important sense of touch to desktop computing.\nThe human brain is exquisitely hardwired for touch. Anatomy textbooks often include a grotesque-looking diagram known as the homunculus, which distorts the human figure to show how much of the brain's sensory processing is devoted to each body part. Because large areas of the cortex interpret signals from the palms and fingers, the hands of the homunculus are enormous. This generous neural capacity allows us to sense minute variations in pressure and to detect barely perceptible vibrations, contributing to our remarkable dexterity.\nOver the past two decades, computer scientists have struggled to build electromechanical contraptions that could provide the same kind of tactile feedback. The task has proved difficult: a touch-feedback peripheral must be small enough to fit in a hand, yet it must also offer substantial resistance to the hand's motion. In fact, accurately synthesizing tactile sensations in real time became possible only after recent advances in miniaturization and the introduction of faster microprocessors.\n TOUCH-FEEDBACK MOUSE allows PC users to feel a virtual surface. As the user moves the cursor across the screen, a small motor in the mouse responds to software signals embedded in the program or Web page.\n\n【3】The first tactile devices to hit the market were designed for medical training.\nDoctors-to-be use the instruments to virtually feel the right way to perform a catheterization or a spinal injection. Engineers and architects employ similar devices for computer-assisted design, allowing them to \"touch\" the contours of their three-dimensional models. And for a few years now, computer gamers have been playing with force-feedback joysticks that can simulate a machine gun's recoil or the stresses on an airplane's controls. But no touch-feedback device for general-purpose computing was available until the introduction of the iFeel mouse last year.\n\n【4】The iFeel looks like an ordinary mouse (albeit one attractively finished in iridescent teal blue). And its retail price is modest—only $10 more than a comparable mouse without touch feedback. There are two models available: a simple symmetrical design that sells for $39 and a $59 premium version that has a contoured shape intended to fit the hand more comfortably.\nBoth are optical devices that detect movement with reflected light rather than with a less precise trackball.\nAt the pulsating heart of the new mouse is technology licensed from Immersion Corporation, which pioneered the development of touch-feedback sys-\n\n【5】PHILIP ANDERSON", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": "# Technicalities\n", "block_text_old": "# Technicalities\n", "raw_context": [{"text": "TECHNICALITIES", "bbox": [44.0, 51.0, 363.0, 99.0]}], "block_type": "Title", "full_blocks": [43.0, 50.0, 362.0, 98.0], "position": 0, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n## Touchy-Feely Computing A New Mouse Picks Up Good Vibrations   By Steve Ditlea\n", "block_text_old": "\n## Touchy-Feely Computing A New Mouse Picks Up Good Vibrations   By Steve Ditlea\n", "raw_context": [{"text": "Touchy-Feely Computing", "bbox": [44.0, 222.0, 509.0, 274.0]}, {"text": "A NEW MOUSE PICKS UP GOOD VIBRATIONS   BY STEVE DITLEA", "bbox": [44.0, 272.0, 429.0, 294.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [43.0, 221.0, 508.0, 293.0], "position": 1, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n\nImagine living with just two of your five senses: vision and hearing.

A significant number of cardiac arrest victims for whom EMS is summoned have a terminal illness, and many have written advance directives. Laws detailing the actions of a prehospital provider in response to an out-of-hospital DNAR order vary across jurisdictions. In general, EMS professionals should initiate CPR and advanced life support if there is reasonable doubt about the validity of a DNAR order, if there is concern that the victim may have had a change of mind, or if there is a question about whether the patient intended the advance directive to be applied under the actual conditions for which EMS has been called.\n\n【4】The DNAR order should be shown to EMS responders as soon as they arrive on the scene. If the EMS professional cannot obtain clear information about the victim's wishes, they should not hesitate to start resuscitation. Sometimes within a few minutes of starting resuscitation, relatives or other medical personnel will arrive and confirm that the victim had clearly expressed a wish that resuscitation not be attempted. CPR or other life-support measures may be discontinued by following local directives or protocols, which may include real-time consultation with medical direction.\n\n【5】#删除26_4:<u>\n</u>erminating Resuscitative Efforts In Ohca\n\n【6】#删除26_4:<u>\n</u>erminating Resuscitative Efforts In Neonatal Or Pediatric Ohca\n\n【7】No predictors of neonatal or pediatric (infant or child) out-ofhospital resuscitation success or failure have been established.\nNo validated clinical decision rules have been derived and evaluated.

During arrest a brief disconnection from the bag mask or ventilator may be considered, and compression of the chest wall to relieve air-trapping can be effective (Class IIa, LOE C).\nFor all asthmatic patients with cardiac arrest, and especially for patients in whom ventilation is difficult, the possible diagnosis of a tension pneumothorax should be considered and treated (Class I, LOE C).\n\n【2】#删除26_4:<u>\n</u>art 12.2: Cardiac Arrest Associate删除26_4:<u>\n</u>ith Anaphylaxi删除26_4:<u>\n</u>naphylaxis Is An Allergic Reaction Characterized By Multisystem involvement, including skin, airway, vascular system, and gastrointestinal tract. Severe cases may result in complete obstruction of the airway and cardiovascular collapse from vasogenic shock. Anaphylaxis accounts for about 500 to 1000 deaths per year in the United States.删除26_2:<u></u删除26_4:<u>\n</u>he term classic anaphylaxis refers to hypersensitivity reactions mediated by the immunoglobulins IgE and IgG.  Prior sensitization to an allergen produces antigen-specific immunoglobulins. Subsequent reexposure to the allergen provokes the anaphylactic reaction, although many anaphylactic reactions occur with no documented prior exposure. Pharmacological agents, latex, foods, and stinging insects are among the most common causes of anaphylaxis described.\n\n【3】#删除26_4:<u>\n</u>igns And Symptoms\n\n【4】The initial symptoms of anaphylaxis are often nonspecific and include tachycardia, faintness, cutaneous flushing, urticaria, diffuse or localized pruritus, and a sensation of impending doom. Urticaria is the most common physical finding.\nThe patient may be agitated or anxious and may appear either flushed or pale.\nA common early sign of respiratory involvement is rhinitis.\nAs respiratory compromise becomes more severe, serious upper airway (laryngeal) edema may cause stridor and lower airway edema (asthma) may cause wheezing. Upper airway edema can also be a sign in angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitorinduced angioedema or C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency with spontaneous laryngeal edema. 删除2:<u>58 – 60</u>Cardiovascular collapse is common in severe anaphylaxis. If not promptly corrected, vasodilation and increased capillary permeability, causing decreased preload and relative hypovolemia of up to 37% of circulating blood volume, can rapidly lead to cardiac arrest. 删除2:<u>61, 62</u>Myocardial ischemia and acute myocardial infarction, malignant arrhythmias, and cardiovascular depression can also contribute to rapid hemodynamic deterioration and cardiac arrest.删除26_2:<u></u> Additionally, cardiac dysfunction may result from underlying disease or development of myocardial ischemia due to hypotension or following administration of epinephrine. 删除2:<u>64,65</u>There are no randomized controlled trials evaluating alternative treatment algorithms for cardiac arrest due to anaphylaxis.\nEvidence is limited to case reports and extrapolations from nonfatal cases, interpretation of pathophysiology, and consensus opinion.

In addition, the anesthetic effect of these drugs increases the ease of mechanical ventilation and reduces oxygen demand and carbon dioxide production. This therapy requires expert consultation in an intensive care setting, and its effectiveness has not been evaluated in randomized clinical studies.\n\n【6】#删除26_4:<u>\n</u>ssisted Ventilation\n\n【7】Noninvasive Positive-Pressure Ventilatio删除26_4:<u>\n</u>oninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (NIPPV) may offer short-term support for patients with acute respiratory failure and may delay or eliminate the need for endotracheal intubation. 删除2:<u>33–35</u>This therapy requires that the patient is alert and has adequate spontaneous respiratory effort. Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), the most common method of delivering NIPPV, allows for separate control of inspiratory and expiratory pressures.\n\n【8】Endotracheal Intubation With Mechanical Ventilatio删除26_4:<u>\n</u>ndotracheal intubation is indicated for patients who present with apnea, coma, persistent or increasing hypercapnia, exhaustion, severe distress, and depression of mental status. Clinical judgment is necessary to assess the need for immediate endotracheal intubation for these critically ill patients. Endotracheal intubation does not solve the problem of small airway constriction in patients with severe asthma; thus, therapy directed toward relief of bronchoconstriction should be continued. Mechanical ventilation in the asthmatic patient can be difficult and associated risks require careful management. Intubation and positivepressure ventilation can trigger further bronchoconstriction and complications such as breath stacking that result from incomplete expiration, air trapping, and buildup of positive endexpiratory pressure (ie, intrinsic or auto-PEEP). This breath stacking can cause barotrauma. Decreasing tidal volume may avoid auto-PEEP and high peak airway pressures. Optimal ventilator management requires expert consultation and ongoing careful review of ventilation flow and pressure curves. Although endotracheal intubation introduces risks, it should be performed when necessary based on clinical condition.\nRapid sequence intubation is the technique of choice and should be performed by an expert in airway management. The provider should use the largest endotracheal tube available (usually 8 or 9 mm) to decrease airway resistance. Immediately after intubation, endotracheal tube placement should be confirmed by clinical examination and waveform capnography. A chest radiograph should then be performed.\n\n【9】#删除26_4:<u>\n</u>roubleshooting After Intubation\n\n【10】When severe bronchoconstriction is present, breath stacking (so-called auto-PEEP) can develop during positive-pressure ventilation, leading to complications such as hyperinflation, tension pneumothorax, and hypotension. During manual or mechanical ventilation, a slower respiratory rate should be used with smaller tidal volumes (eg, 6 to 8 mL/kg), 36 shorter inspiratory time (eg, adult inspiratory flow rate 80 to 100 mL/min), and longer expiratory time (eg, inspiratory to expiratory ratio 1:4 or 1:5) than generally would be provided to patients without asthma.删除26_2:<u></u> Management of mechanical ventilation will vary based on patient-ventilation characteristics. Expert consultation should be obtained.\nMild hypoventilation (permissive hypercapnia) reduces the risk of barotrauma. Hypercapnia is typically well tolerated.删除26_2:<u></u> .删除26_2:<u></u删除26_4:<u>\n</u>edation is often required to optimize ventilation, decrease ventilator dyssynchrony (and therefore auto-PEEP), and minimize barotrauma after intubation. Because delivery of inhaled medications may be inadequate before intubation, the provider should continue to administer inhaled albuterol treatments through the endotracheal tube.\nFour common causes of acute deterioration in any intubated patient are recalled by the mnemonic DOPE (tube Displacement, tube Obstruction, Pneumothorax, Equipment failure).\nAuto-PEEP is another common cause of deterioration in patients with asthma. If the asthmatic patient's condition deteriorates or if it is difficult to ventilate the patient, check the ventilator for leaks or malfunction; verify endotracheal tube position; eliminate tube obstruction (eliminate any mucous plugs and kinks); evaluate for auto-PEEP; and rule out a pneumothorax.\nHigh-end expiratory pressure can be reduced quickly by separating the patient from the ventilator circuit; this will allo删除26_4:<u>\n</u>EEP to dissipate during passive exhalation. If auto-PEEP results in significant hypotension, assisting with exhalation by pressing on the chest wall after disconnection of the ventilator circuit will allow active exhalation and should lead to immediate resolution of hypotension.

Our demand for bandwidth varies with the scene and application; a more complex scene requires more bandwidth. We can assume that much of the scene, particularly the background walls and such, is unchanging and does not need to be resent with each frame.

Archaeologists from around the world might experience being present during a crucial dig. Rarefied experts in building inspection or engine repair might be able to visit locations without losing time to air travel.\nIn fact, tele-immersion might come to be seen as real competition for air travel—unlike videoconferencing. Although few would claim that tele-immersion will be absolutely as good as \"being there\" in the near term, it might be good enough for business meetings, professional consultations, training sessions, trade show exhibits and the like. Business travel might be replaced to a significant degree by tele-immersion in 10 years.

For instance, those who worry about how artists, musicians and authors will make a living as copyrights become harder and harder to enforce (as a result of widespread file copying on the Internet) have often suggested that paid personal appearances are a solution, because personal interaction has more value in the moment than could be reproduced afterward from a file or recording. Tele-immersion could make aesthetic interactions practical and cheap enough to provide a different basis for commerce in the arts. It is worth remembering that before the 20th century, all the arts were interactive. Musicians interacted directly with audience members, as did actors on a stage and poets in a garden. Tele-immersive forms of all these arts that emphasize immediacy, intimacy and personal responsiveness might appear in answer to the crisis in copyright enforcement.\nUndoubtedly tele-immersion will pose new challenges as well. Some early users have expressed a concern that teleimmersion exposes too much, that telephones and videoconferencing tools make it easier for participants to control their exposure—to put the phone down or move offscreen. I am hopeful that with experience we will discover both user-interface designs (such as the virtual mirror depicted in the illustration on pages 72 and 73) and conventions of behavior that address such potential problems.\nI am often asked if it is frightening to work on new technologies that are likely to have a profound impact on society without being able to know what that impact will be. My answer is that because tele-immersion is fundamentally a tool to help people connect better, the question is really about how optimistic one should be about human nature. I believe that communications technologies increase the opportunities for empathy and thus for moral behavior. Consequently, I am optimistic that whatever role tele-immersion ultimately takes on, it will mostly be for the good. a", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": " across the country.

Minimal Anchorage\n\n【15】When we place this type of anchorage in molars, they migrate in a mesial direction up to 70% of the space, giving us 30% of anchorage; minimal anchorage is also helpful in anchoring the anterior segment. According to Nanda this type of anchorage is called C Anchorage or \"non-critical -anchorage\", where 75% of space closure is obtained by mesial displacement of posterior teeth. We elaborate this type of anchorage in the arch wire (stops, tip back, arch wire tie back, toe-in, toe-out, in-bend, out-bend) or with accessory elements (retro-ligature, intermaxillary elastics, lip bumper) or a combination of both. 删除1:<u>(19.24)</u>\n\n【16】Types of Minimal Anchorage:\n\n【17】1.

It is a multipurpose anchorage appliance since it can be used solely as minimal anchorage (placing the arch wire in all the slots of the braces) or to correct an anterior cross bite (placing the arch wire separated 2 or 3 mm from the slot), provoking the proclination of the anterior sector and molar distalization (forward arch).\n\n【33】1.

By moving the schedule, Intel has attempted to rally the industry around EUV and to eliminate electron projection lithography (EPL).\n\n【1】\"We fervently believe that there are not enough resources in the industry to develop both technologies,\" he says.\nSilverman is also ready to blast ahead by placing an order with ASML for a $30- million EUV prototype machine, forcing the equipment manufacturer to commit to a delivery schedule. It behooves Intel to push. Although AMD, Motorola, Infineon and Micron are partners, Intel negotiated contract terms that let it get the first machines produced and, because it is the largest investor in the $250-million program, the greatest number of tools.\nSuppliers have to implement fully two crushingly difficult generations of technology before they finish making an investment of perhaps $750 million to start producing EUV machines. Getting them to buy into the breakneck schedule set by Intel may be a bigger challenge than creating angstrom-smooth mirrors.\n\n【2】Even ASML, which dropped its involvement with EPL, is cautious, saying existing optical technologies may last longer than the industry expects. \"It's too early to decide whether EUV will happen in the time frame Intel is pushing,\" says Jos\n\n【3】Benschop, research manager at ASML.\nIntel would also like to bring Nikon  , its other main supplier, into the fold. But the industry's largest equipment manufacturer, which is researching EUV outside of the U.S. consortium, is not ready to commit to a single technology—and it continues work on EPL with IBM. Other chipmakers, such as Motorola and Texas Instruments, have voiced support for the EUV competitor. \"It's still a horse race between EPL and EUV,\" says Gilbert L. Varnell, president and chief operating officer of Nikon Research Corporation of America. \"Intel has taken the position that there's only one technology and they want to get rid of the competition. I'm not convinced that's the best approach for the industry. What if [EUV] fails? We're a toolmaker and they're a chipmaker, and there's a lot of other things we have to consider, such as manufacturability of the lithography equipment and profitability.\" Adds Lloyd R.\nHarriott, a former Bell Labs employee who headed the EPL program and worked on\n\n【4】#删除26_4:<u>\n</u>he Collaborative Structure Of The Euv Program May Serve As A Model For How The Semiconductor Industry Conducts Future Research. the early EUV program: \"I think a lot of progress has been made with EUV. But they've got a really long way to go. There's a lot of marketing hype about how this is a done deal.\"\nVarnell also believes that the current schedule—making commercial chips wit删除26_4:<u>\n</u>UV in 2005—is unrealistic, citing the nine years it took Nikon to develop the laser used in the current generation of lithography, a much less ambitious project. Says Varnell: \"You're going from an image to full-up production system by 2005, and it is going to come from the national labs. I've been around the toolmaking business for a long time. I don't believe that's going to happen.\"\nAlong the way, another hurdle Intel and company have faced is convincin删除26_4:<u>\n</u>ashington to let a foreign company, the Dutch supplier ASML, enter the con- sortium. Four years ago the only majo删除26_4:<u>\n</u>merican tool supplier in the consortium was SVG. Ultratech Stepper, an earl删除26_4:<u>\n</u>.S. partner in EUV research, had to settle grudgingly for a minor role when it was viewed as lacking the necessary financial resources to develop an EUV product line. ASML, moreover, has subsequently bought SVG, which would leave ASML as the primary beneficiary of this technology transfer. Intel has \"done everything in their power to give the technology on a silver platter to ASML,\" says David A.

If the infant or child is unresponsive and not breathing, give 30 chest compressions.\nThe following are characteristics of high-quality CPR:\n•Chest compressions of appropriate rate and depth. \"Push fast\": push at a rate of at least 100 compressions per minute. \"Push hard\": push with sufficient force to depress at least one third the anterior-posterior (AP) diameter of the chest or approximately 1 ½ inches (4 cm) in infants and 2 inches (5 cm) in children (Class I, LOE C).

Rescuers should compress at least one third the depth of the chest, or about 4 cm (1.5 inches).\nFor a child, lay rescuers and healthcare providers should compress the lower half of the sternum at least one third of the AP dimension of the chest or approximately 5 cm (2 inches) with the heel of 1 or 2 hands. Do not press on the xiphoid or the ribs. There are no data to determine if the 1- or 2-hand method produces better compressions and better outcome (Class IIb, LOE C). In a child manikin study, higher chest compression pressures were obtained 42 with less rescuer fatigue 43 with the 2-hand technique. Because children and rescuers come in all sizes, rescuers may use either 1 or 2 hands to compress the child's chest. Whichever you use, make sure to achieve an adequate compression depth with complete release after each compression.\nAfter each compression, allow the chest to recoil completely (Class IIb, LOE B) because complete chest re- expansion improves the flow of blood returning to the heart and thereby blood flow to the body during CPR.删除26_2:<u></u> -46\nDuring pediatric CPR incomplete chest wall recoil is common, particularly when rescuers become fa删除16:<u>¬ </u>tigued. 删除2:<u>32, 47, 48</u>Incomplete recoil during CPR is associated with higher intrathoracic pressures and significantly decreased venous return, coronary perfusion, blood flow, and cerebral perfusion.删除26_2:<u></u>删除26_2:<u></u> Manikin studies suggest that techniques to lift the heel of the hand slightly, but completely, off the chest can improve chest recoil, but this technique has not been studied in humans.删除26_2:<u></u> .删除26_2:<u></u> Automated CPR feedback devices hold promise as monitors of CPR quality parameters, including chest recoil, by providing real-time, corrective feedback to the rescuer. However, there is currently insufficient evidence for or against their use in infants and children.\nRescuer fatigue can lead to inadequate compression rate, depth, and recoil. 删除2:<u>32,47,30</u>The quality of chest compressions may deteriorate within minutes even when the rescuer denies feeling fatigued.删除26_2:<u>52</u> Rescuers should therefore rotate the compressor role approximately every 2 minutes to prevent compressor fatigue and deterioration in quality and rate of chest compressions. Recent data suggest that when feedback devices are used and compressions are effective, some rescuers may be able to effectively continue past the 2-minute interval.删除26_2:<u></u> The switch should be accomplished as quickly as possible (ideally in less than 5 seconds) to minimize interruptions in chest compressions.\nResuscitation outcomes in infants and children are best if chest compressions are combined with ventilations (see below), but if a rescuer is not trained in providing ventilations, or is unable to do so, the lay rescuer should continue with chest compressions (\"Hands-Only\" or compression-only CPR) until help arrives.\n\n【8】#删除26_4:<u>\n</u>pen The Airway And Give Ventilations\n\n【9】For the lone rescuer a compression-to-ventilation ratio of 30:2 is recommended. After the initial set of 30 compressions, open the airway and give 2 breaths. In an unresponsive infant or child, the tongue may obstruct the airway and interfere with ventilations. 删除2:<u>53–55</u>Open the airway using a head tilt–chin lift maneuver for both injured and noninjured victims (Class I, LOE B).\nTo give breaths to an infant, use a mouth-to-mouth-andnose technique; to give breaths to a child, use a mouth-tomouth technique.56 Make sure the breaths are effective (ie, the chest rises). Each breath should take about 1 second. If the chest does not rise, reposition the head, make a better seal, and try again.删除26_2:<u></u> It may be necessary to move the child's head through a range of positions to provide optimal airway patency and effective rescue breathing.\nIn an infant, if you have difficulty making an effective seal over the mouth and nose, try either mouth-to-mouth or mouth-to-nose ventilation (Class IIb, LOE C). 删除2:<u>57–59</u>If you use the mouth-to-mouth technique, pinch the nose closed. If you use the mouth-to-nose technique, close the mouth. In either case make sure the chest rises when you give a breath.
