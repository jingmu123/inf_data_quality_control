Alteration of the mandibular mechanics during aperture: during this movement, the condyle of the side of the deviation will suffer a rotation movement; meanwhile the other side has a downward and forward movement. This alteration can induce asymmetric growth of the mandible, therefore this problem must be immediately treated as soon as it is detected.
The most frequent presentation of this malocclusion  is a unilateral posterior cross bite, generally associated to a functional mandibular deviation.
From the cephalometric point of view we can find:

【1】In the sagittal sense, there is a slight tendency to a osseo-dental Class III, a distal position of the upper molar, more linguoversion and retrusion of the upper incisors and moderate protrusion of the lower incisors.
In the vertically, we can find a dolychofacial tendency.  To make this diagnosis, we must manipulate the mandible to centric relation without dental occlusion. If the cross bite is functional, the midlines will coincide, the chin deviation will disappear and unstable transversal cusp to cusp relation becomes evident.  Treatment: sometimes they are corrected by eliminating the interference with occlusal grinding or crown remodeling of one or more teeth. In some cases the use of a dento alveolar expander will be needed.

【2】##2. Dentoalveolar Cross Bite

【3】It can affect one tooth or a group of them.

【4】In this malocclusion, there is an alteration in the di-  rection of the longer axis of the upper and/or lower teeth, but the basal bone is not altered.

【5】The buccal cusps of the upper premolars and/or molar n occlude in the fossas of the opposing lower teeth.
They are very frequent, in the primary and in the  mixed and permanent dentition.
Generally, unilateral dento alveolar cross bites are l functional, they are the most frequent alterations that affect a single tooth.  Treatment: Expanders like the Quad Helix, the Tandem or the palatine expander are used.

【6】##3. Skeletal Cross Bites

【7】They are produced by alterations in the transversal  dimensions of the maxilla or the mandible, provoked by a growth alteration in some or both of them and can be observed in any stage of development.
The most frequent alteration is the insufficient growth of the upper maxilla. If the cross bite is unilateral it is usually a transversal hypo-expansion of the maxilla, capable of premature cuspid contacts, that can result in a lateral deviation of the mandible.
The etiological factors can be mouth breathing habits,  atypical deglutition and thumb sucking, and can only be treated with orthopedics, only if the patient still has growth potential; if not, it must be corrected by surgical disjunction or surgically assisted orthopedic disjunction.
The most frequent cause for this type of cross bite is  mouth breathing, where we can observe a notorious compression of the maxilla that shortens the distance between molars, premolars and canines.
It can also occur as a consequence of an asymmetry  of the shape of the mandible (laterognatia). Mandibular焦瀚远
