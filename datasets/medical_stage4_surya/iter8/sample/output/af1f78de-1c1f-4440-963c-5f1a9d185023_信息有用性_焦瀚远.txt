#Crank It Up!

【2】Just shake the flashlight , and it shines. Crank the radio's handle, and it plays. Unlike earlier generations of human-powered electronics, which quit the instant you did, a new breed stores your muscle energy in springs, batteries and capacitors that provide lasting returns.
Freeplay Energy in London has sold more than 2.5 million hand-cranked radios and flashlights since 1995. In its original products, turning a crank wound a tight 33-foot steel ribbon, which slowly uncoiled. In its new line, the crank turns a mini transmission that drives an alternator to charge onboard batteries.
Thirty seconds of human effort will yield 40 minutes of play or eight minutes of light, and the products will be one fifth the size and weight, addressing a primary consumer complaint: human-powered electronics tend to be big and heavy.
People buy human-powered electronics, which typically cost $50 to $80, because they're tired of spending money on batteries or because they want surety during storms or just because the gizmos are cool. But a mass market won't open "until prices drop to the $29 range," says Vaughan Wiles, Freeplay's marketing director. New deals may help. This fall, outdoor-gear giant Coleman will sell a Freeplay flashlight under its brand name, as well as the radio.
Freeplay also plans a hand-powered generator laden with electronics that can recharge certain popular cell phones. AladdinPower in Tampa markets a Stepcharger that works like a foot pump to recharge cellphone, laptop-computer and video-camera batteries.
Designing practical devices requires "very small, very strong, very efficient components that can produce power when an elderly woman turns the crank and yet can handle a tough guy cranking the thing like crazy," says Freeplay technical director John Hutchinson. Minimizing mechanical wear is also paramount.
A number of start-up companies have jumped on the bandwagon, but some products simply don't work well. Ultimately, success depends on maximizing a user's reward. "If someone is stranded at sea, he'll crank all day" to keep his two-way radio working so he can be rescued, Hutchinson says. "But for the average guy in his garage, 60 seconds of effort is all he's willing to give." -Mark Fischetti TURNING THE CRANK on Freeplay's Bravo AM/FM radio spins gears in a tiny transmission that drives an alternator.
It sends current to a 3.6-volt nickel–metal hydride rechargeable battery. A 30-second wind of sufficient torque will provide 45 minutes of lowvolume play or 25 minutes of boom-box sound. Further cranking will extend RECHARGEABLE
BATTERY play. An amorphous thin-film solar cell can provide added current for lazy listeners.
