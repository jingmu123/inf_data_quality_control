During Bell's palsy, the eyebrow may droop, and the upper eyelid may not close completely. Similarly, the lower eyelid may sag. This exposes your eye to the environment making it more susceptible to damage, discomfort and visual impairment. The main aim of eye surgery is to reduce discomfort. The surgery is also very effective in preserving vision.

【1】As with any surgical procedure, there are certain risks associated with eye surgery. Remember, there are various other treatments, surgeries and therapies that are helpful for people suffering from Bell's palsy. You can discuss possible options with your doctor before making a final decision.

【7】The risk of upper eyelid surgery is that it can be difficult to control the position of the upper lid. If the eyelid still remains high, a repeat surgery may be required. Sometimes the weight may be too heavy, which will be seen as a bulky mass through the upper eyelid. The use of heavy weights can also blur your vision.
