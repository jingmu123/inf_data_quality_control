More recently, prehospital 12-lead ECGs have also been shown to reduce the time to primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and can facilitate triage to specific hospitals when PCI is the chosen strategy.  When EMS or ED physicians activate the cardiac care team, including the cardiac catheterization laboratory, significant reductions in reperfusion times are observed.\n\n【1】The ACS guidelines also make new recommendations for triage of patients to PCI centers after cardiac arrest. The performance of PCI has been associated with favorable outcomes in adult patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest, and it is reasonable to include cardiac catheterization in standardized post–cardiac arrest protocols as part of an overall strategy to improve neurologically intact survival in this patient group. In patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to VF, emergent angiography with prompt revascularization of the infarct-related artery is recommended. The ECG may be insensitive or misleading following cardiac arrest, and coronary angiography after ROSC in subjects with arrest of presumed ischemic cardiac etiology may be reasonable, even in the absence of a clearly defined STEMI. Clinical findings of coma in patients before PCI are common following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and should not be a contraindication to consideration of immediate angiography and PCI.\n\n【2】##Adult Stroke\n\n【3】Part 11 emphasizes the early management of acute ischemic stroke in adult patients. It summarizes out-of-hospital care through the first hours of therapy. Approximately  people suffer a new or repeat stroke each year, and stroke remains the third leading cause of death in the United States. By integrating public education, 911 dispatch, prehospital detection and triage, hospital stroke system development, and stroke unit management, significant improvements in stroke care have been made. Important components of the stroke system of care are summarized in Part 11. As with STEMI patients, prearrival hospital notification by the transporting EMS unit has been found to significantly increase the percentage of patients with acute stroke who receive fibrinolytic therapy. The  AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC recommend that every hospital with an ED have a written plan that is communicated to EMS systems describing how patients with acute stroke are to be managed in that institution. Triage of patients with acute stroke directly to designated stroke centers is a new Class I recommendation, which has been added to the Stroke Algorithm. Another new Class I recommendation is admission of the stroke patient to a dedicated stroke unit managed by a multidisciplinary team experienced in stroke care.\nSince publication of the  AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC , additional data have emerged extending the time window for administration of IV rtPA to select patients with acute ischemic stroke. These guidelines now recommend IV rtPA for patients who meet the eligibility criteria for the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) or the Third European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study (ECASS-3) if rtPA is administered by physicians in the setting of a clearly defined protocol with a knowledgeable team and institutional commitment. However, it is important to emphasize the continued time-dependent reperfusion window and that earlier treatment is better and is associated with improved outcome. Patients ineligible for standard IV fibrinolytic therapy may be considered for intra-arterial fibrinolytic therapy or mechanical revascularization at selected centers with specialized capabilities.\nFinally these guidelines recommend admission to a stroke unit within 3 hours of presentation to the ED. Recent studies establish that stroke unit care is superior to care in general medical wards, and positive effects of stroke unit care can persist for years. The benefits from treatment in a stroke unit are comparable to the beneficial effects achieved with IV rtPA.\nOverall stroke care has progressed dramatically since it was first incorporated into the ECC mission. Improvements in education, prehospital management, hospital system development, and acute treatments have lead to significant improvements in patient outcomes.\n\n【4】##Special Situations\n\n【5】Cardiac arrest in special situations may require special treatments or procedures beyond those provided during standard BLS or ACLS. Because of difficulty in conducting randomized clinical trials in these areas or their infrequent occurrence, these unique situations call for an experienced provider to go \"beyond basics,\" using clinical consensus and extrapolation from typical circumstances. The topics covered in the  AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC have been reviewed, updated, and expanded to 15 specific cardiac arrest situations. These guidelines emphasize the \"above and beyond\" knowledge required as well as the anticipatory clinical acumen to provide timely care and unique interventions.\nTopics include significant periarrest features that may be important to prevent cardiac arrest or that require special post–cardiac arrest care and intervention beyond the usual care defined in these guidelines. Topics with these potentially unique features include asthma, anaphylaxis, pregnancy, morbid obesity, pulmonary embolism, electrolyte imbalance, ingestion of toxic substances, trauma, accidental hypothermia, avalanche, drowning, electric shock/lightning strikes, and special procedural situations affecting the heart, including PCI, cardiac tamponade, and cardiac surgery.\n\n【6】##Pediatric Basic Life Support\n\n【7】The majority of pediatric cardiac arrests are asphyxial, with only approximately 5% to 15% attributable to VF.\nAnimal studies  have shown that resuscitation from asphyxial arrest is best accomplished by a combination of ventilations and chest compressions. This has recently been confirmed in a large community pediatric study,  which not only showed that the best resuscitation results from asphyxial arrest were from a combination of ventilations and chest compressions but also that the small number of children with asphyxial arrest who received compression-only CPR had no better results than those who received no bystander CPR.\nAlthough animal studies and pediatric series support the importance of ventilation for asphyxial arrest, data in adults suggest that chest compressions are critical for resuscitation from VF arrest, with ventilations being less important.

        "text": "【0】页码:143\nSteroids are considered safe when taken body's steroid requirements. The steroids produced by the adrenal glands are referred to as the body's \"endogenous steroids.\" When the adrenal glands detect \"extra\" steroid medication in the bloodstream over time, they reduce their own endogenous steroid production. If the adrenal glands are exposed to a significant amount of steroid medication, they will fairly quickly respond by completely shutting down the body's own vital manufacture of steroids. As long as a person continues to take his or her prescribed steroid medication, the adrenals remain \"lazy\" and cease the production of endogenous steroids. When steroid medication is gradually reduced, the adrenal glands have time to \"wake up,\" and will eventually resume producing endogenous steroids for the body's needs. If, on the other hand, long-term steroid pills are not tapered and are stopped abruptly, the adrenal glands will not have sufficient time to recover and to restart the manufacture of endogenous steroids. The body will be left without any steroids at all, and an \"adrenal crisis\"—a true medical emergency—may ensue. The treatment of adrenal crisis includes steroid administration.\n\n【1】Steroids are considered safe when taken exactly as prescribed, for bona fide medical indications. Let's say that your asthma has become more active. Despite the fact that you are using inhaled, long-acting β  agonists, along with an inhaled, high-dose corticosteroid, you are also requiring a short-acting rescue inhaled β  agonist every 4 to 6 hours for relief of breathlessness. Your peak flow values have decreased. You are experiencing nocturnal awakenings because of respiratory difficulty. You feel rotten. Your physician will undoubtedly prescribe a \"steroid burst\" for you. A \"steroid burst\" is a prescription",

There are many ways to intrude the anterior segment;\nBegg, Ricketts and Burstone employ the same principle: the molar tip back bend. The wire materials used for intrusion with these techniques are diverse, but they all recognize the need to employ a continuous light force.  Nickel Titanium alloys (NiTi) are a good option to produce these continuous and light forces. These alloys have high memory and a low load-deflection ratio that translates into less wire activation appointments.  The Connecticut Intrusion Arch (CIA) is more commonly used for intrusion of the anterior teeth, but it has other uses, including molar tip back for Class II correction, for anchorage preparation of the posterior segment, correction of minor anterior open bites, occlusal plane leveling and detailing.\n\n【2】The CIA is manufactured and distributed by Orto Organizers and made out of NiTi wire. There are two available arch sizes: \" x \" and \" x \". The upper and lower have an anterior dimension of 34 mm and 28 mm respectively.  In the majority of cases the CIA is not placed in the slots of the anterior braces. In the anterior segment, a sectional rectangular arch is placed in the slots from lateral to lateral.\n\n【3】Over this wire the anterior segment of the CIA arch wire is ligated to the sectional wire. This is the reason why the use of triple tubes in the upper molars and the use of double tubes in the lower molars are recommended. (.\n\n【4】The CIA exerts an intrusive force of 40 g to 60 g due to the \"V\" bend placed mesial to the molar tube. With this arch we can achieve pure intrusion, because the intrusion force is directed apically through the center of resistance of the tooth, producing mm of intrusion in 6 weeks.",

Biofeedback involves using sensors placed strategically over the human body. These sensors help receive feedback about the body, hence, the term biofeedback. This feedback assists people in making minor changes to their body over time, such as relaxing specific muscles to reduce the intensity of pain.\nIn short, biofeedback allows you to use your thoughts to control certain aspects of your body, such as muscles.\n\n【2】During recovery, Bell's palsy patients reach a stage where their face feels incredibly tight. The eye may shut without any indication while eating or talking.\nSome patients also feel that they are making funny faces when smiling. It is the faulty communication system between your face and brain that is letting you down. Biofeedback allows you to learn how to control muscles to display the expression you want.\n\n【3】##What Are The Different Types Of Biofeedback?\n\n【4】There are three most commonly used forms of biofeedback therapy including:\n\n【5】1. Electromyography (EMG) used to measure muscle tension.\n\n【6】2. Thermal biofeedback used to measure skin temperature.\n\n【7】3. Electroencephalography (EEG) or neuro-feedback used to measure brain wave activity.\n\n【8】##What Happens During Biofeedback Therapy?\n\n【9】A typical biofeedback session will involve attaching tiny electrodes to your skin.\nThese electrodes then send information to a small box that translates the signals your body is giving out. You will see lines that vary in pitch on a computer screen. The biofeedback therapist in charge will then guide you through some mental exercises. Soon, with trial and error, you will learn exercises that can bring about the activity you want on the affected side of your face.\n\n【10】You will also be taught relaxation techniques and exercises that need to be done at home for at least 5 - 10 minutes every day.\n\n【11】Are There Any Risks Associated with Biofeedback Sessions?",

Fast and easy fabrication.\nWe do not depend upon patient cooperation.\nNot only it can be used to uncross anterior cross bites, but also in cases in which we want to slightly increase the overjet.\n\n【2】##Disadvantages\n\n【3】1. The patient can refer momentary pain in the upper incisors while the proclination is taking place.\nSometimes when the wire is forced in the slots of the braces, the wire can bulge slightly at the premolar level and this can lacerate the mucosa of the cheeks.\n\n【4】This will avoid possible brace debonding of this sector.\n\n【5】3. If there is a lot of separation between the braces and the wire, some braces can debond.\nThere is no torque control of the upper incisors.\n\n【6】##Recommendations\n\n【7】1. In order to uncross an anterior cross bite, the activations must be paused and not exceed 2 mm of separation from the braces.\nUse Class III elastics.\nUse anterior box elastics.\nOnce the anterior bite has been uncrossed, we can use the arch as minimal anchorage.\nStripping in the anteroinferior sector. l. With this arch we can procline all the anterosuperior sector, uncrossing the anterior bite.\nNot only the anteosuperior sector is proclined, but also the upper molars are slightly distalized.\nEconomic.",

HORSCH, vice president of product and technology cooperation at Monsanto Company, received the  National Medal of Technology for his pioneering experiments in the genetic modification of plant cells. He talks about the promise of GM crops.\n\n【3】Two leading figures in the debate over genetic engineering defēnd their stances Interviews by Sasha Nemecek How did you become interested in the genetic modification of plants?\nI started in this field with a strong interest in plants but with what you might call an academic interest in agriculture. I had this vague, naive notion that if we could genetically improve plants with the new tools of molecular biology, we would find a way to make biotechnology relevant to agriculture.\nThat has now happened. Biotechnology is a great tool that will allow us to produce more food on less land and with less depletion or damage to water resources and biodiversity. I am convinced that biotechnology is not just relevant but imperative for helping us meet the rapidly growing demand for food and other agricultural products. The combination of more people and rising incomes will increase the demand for food by at least 50 percent in the next 25 years.\n\n【4】But critics of genetically modified foods point out that companies are not going to start giving products away. Can a corporation like Monsanto make biotechnology affordable for farmers in the developing world?\nCultivating commercial markets and applying technology to help the developing world are not mutually exclusive at all. One approach that works very well is to segment the market into three different areas. One is the pure commercial market. It makes economic sense, as a forprofit company, for us to invest in products and market developments in places where we can sell our products and where we think we can make a profit.\nThe other end of the spectrum is noncommercial technology transfer, which is largely focused on public-sector collaboration. Take, for example, our collaboration to put virus-resistance genes in the sweet potato. We will never have a commercial business in the sweet potato because it's just not a market economy crop. But by sharing our intellectual property and our technical knowledge with scientists from Kenya, we have helped them develop sweet potatoes that show resistance to the most serious sweet potato disease in Africa, which can cause the loss of 20 to 80 percent of the crop.\nThen there's a third area, what I call a transitional market, where we have less experience related to biotechnology but that in the long run I think may be more powerful and beneficial for development efforts. We have used this approach with our older, nonbiotech products, PHOTOGRAPHS BY TOM WOLFF",

Indeed, scientists say,\nGM crops in many countries could end up growing near their ancestral plants—and sharing more than the sunshine overhead. \"Almost every crop has weedy relatives somewhere in the world,\" says Stephen Duke, a USDA plant physiologist in Oxford, Miss. \"How do you keep GM crops out of places where they're not supposed to be?\"\n\n【1】##Taking Refuge\n\n【2】finally, one risk follows GM crops wherever they're planted: evolution. Over time, insect pests and weeds can become resistant to killing by routine chemical sprays. The same is bound to happen in the biotech age: eventually, impervious insects will munch away on GM insect-resistant plants, and the weeds surrounding herbicide-tolerant crops will shrug off the herbicide of choice. \"Agriculture is an evolutionary arms race between plant protections and pests,\" comments botanist Jonathan Wendel of Iowa State University. \"And GM crops are just one more way that we're trying to outsmart pests—temporarily.\"\n\n【3】##U.S. Landscape Logistics Make It Unlikely That Herbicide-Tolerant Or Bt Crops Will Spread Their Biotech Genes.\nIt May Be Harder To Avoid Creating Superweeds Elsewhere.\n\n【4】To keep weeds vulnerable to herbicides, Monsanto and other companies urge growers to use the sprays responsibly, only when necessary. To slow insect resistance to the Bt toxin, the EPA requires Bt crop growers to set aside some part of their farmland for crops that have not been genetically modified.\nThese \"refuges\" may be a corner of a field outside a Bt crop, for instance, or rows of standard plants that break up a Bt plot.\nInside the refuges, insects that have acquired some Bt resistance breed with those that have not, diluting the resistance trait.\n\n【5】##More To Explore\n\n【6】Transgenic Plants and World Agriculture. Royal Society of London, U.S. National Academy of Sciences, Brazilian Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Indian National Science Academy, Mexican Academy of Sciences,\nThird World Academy of Sciences. National Academy Press, July 2000. The Ecological Risks and Benefits of Genetically Engineered Plants.\n\n【7】Virus-resistant GM crops have escaped widespread public concern, but they, too, pose some of the same risks as other GM crops. Some scientists worry that viruses will pick up resistance traits from virus-fighting GM crops and evolve into hard-tobeat strains that infect a newly expanded repertoire of plants.\nSome critics also question the ecological safety of emerging crops designed to resist drought, tolerate salt or deliver an extra nutritional punch. For example, Margaret Mellon of the Union of Concerned Scientists notes that salt-tolerant rice could potentially behave like a disruptive weed if it found its way into vulnerable wetlands.\n\n【8】\"I don't think it's fair to say that every single GM crop is going to be a problem,\" Rissler remarks. \"But we need to devote the research to risks now, rather than deal with repercussions later.\"\nStill, some farmers are confident that GM technology can revolutionize agriculture for the better. For 30 years, Ryland Utlaut of Grand Pass, Mo., has been sowing and reaping  acres along the Missouri River. Last year, for the first time, he planted only herbicide-tolerant corn and soybeans across his entire, soil-friendly, no-till farm. As a result, he claims, he sprayed the crops half as often as he did before and got bigger yields. \"If even the strongest environmentalist could see my farming practices now, I think they'd understand the benefits,\" Utlaut says. \"I'm a fervent believer in this technology.\" Now he has to wait and see whether science confirms that belief. a Kathryn Brown is a science writer based in Alexandria , Va.",

This is why these muscles are so important, since they help us understand each other better and decipher non-verbal cues. These muscles are controlled by the facial nerve, also known as the 7th cranial nerve.\n\n【4】The 7th nerve branches out from the brainstem into an extremely narrow canal in your skull called the Fallopian canal. It then exits the skull at a point right behind your ear. The anatomy, as you can guess is not so simple. The 7th nerve then spreads out from behind the ear and splits into several branches to control the muscles on each side of the face.\n\n【5】##What Are The Known Causes?\n\n【6】Some viruses are thought to cause Bell's palsy but what exactly triggers the response is unknown. Studies suggest that environmental factors, trauma, stress and metabolic disorders might contribute to the reactivation of the already existing 'dormant virus.' The nerve swells and becomes inflamed in response to the viral infection – this is one of the reasons steroids are known to reduce inflammation and swelling, and are useful in treating Bell's palsy.\n\n【7】Other popular treatment methods include:\n\n【8】1. Antiviral medications to treat viral infection . Analgesics or painkillers to relieve pain (if present)\n3. Physical therapy to stimulate the affected facial nerve Alternative treatments used include:\n\n【9】1. Electrical stimulation . Acupuncture",

Some types of exercise are especially advisable in the setting of asthma, while others are viewed as more likely to trigger asthma. In the latter category, distance running or cross-country skiing, for example, can cause symptoms of cough, breathlessness, or wheezing. Distance running, cycling, and skiing involve very good aerobic conditioning, but the activity is steady, without breaks or interruption, and includes exposure to the outdoors, with extremes of temperature, aeroallergens, and sometimes atmospheric pollutants as well. Athletic activity that incorporates breaks in the intensity of exertion is less likely to cause asthma symptoms by, in a very real sense, allowing time for you to \"catch your breath.\" Examples include competitive sports such as tennis, soccer, field hockey, basketball, baseball, and lacrosse, among others. I encourage exercise and sports for all of my patients. The fact that distance activities have been shown in research studies to be more likely to provoke exercise-induced asthma symptoms in no way leads me to discourage my patients with asthma from cycling, running in a marathon, or cross-country skiing, if they so desire. My patients tell me what athletics they want",

Athletic activity that incorporates breaks in the intensity of exertion is less likely to cause asthma symptoms by, in a very real sense, allowing time for you to \"catch your breath.\" Examples include competitive sports such as tennis, soccer, field hockey, basketball, baseball, and lacrosse, among others. I encourage exercise and sports for all of my patients. The fact that distance activities have been shown in research studies to be more likely to provoke exercise-induced asthma symptoms in no way leads me to discourage my patients with asthma from cycling, running in a marathon, or cross-country skiing, if they so desire.

Quite often, only the lower half of the face is affected. At times, Bell's palsy can affect the whole side of the face or even worse, both sides of the face can become paralyzed. Bell's palsy on both sides of the face, however, is extremely rare. Now moving forward, let's see what the muscles in our face can do.\n\n【2】##The Muscles Used For Facial Expressions\n\n【3】You will be surprised with the long list of functions your facial muscles perform.\nThe 7th cranial nerve is responsible for controlling the following muscles and their corresponding functions.\n\n【4】1. Occipitofrontalis muscle – raising the eyebrows . Zygomaticus – raises the corners of the mouth during 'open mouth' smiling. Surprisingly, a variation in the structure of this muscle causes 'dimples.' 3. Risorius – Closed mouth smiling . Corrugator supercilii – frowning . Orbicularis oculi – closing the eyes . Orbicularis oris – used for closing the mouth and 'pouting' 7. Levator labii – lifting upper lip",

You will begin with higher doses, in order to get your asthma under control, followed by gradually decreasing doses, before finally tapering off the medicine. You can expect to begin to feel an improvement in your asthma exacerbation, with lessening of symptoms in as little as 6 to 12 hours after the first dose of steroid pills. When used properly, steroids are truly miraculous in their effectiveness. Prednisone and medrol are two different steroids in pill (or oral) form that are frequently prescribed in the treatment of asthmatic exacerbations and of severe allergic reactions. They are also sometimes given as controller therapy in very small daily doses in the treatment of severe persistent asthma. A 5 mg dose of prednisone is equivalent to a 4 mg dose of medrol. I usually advise my patients who require steroids to \"start them early and get off them quickly,\" so they can take advantage of the beneficial qualities when treating an exacerbation and minimize potential side effects.\n\n【1】##72. What Are Possible Steroid Side Effects?\n\n【2】The potential side effects of steroids are well described in the medical literature and are related to:  the daily dose of steroid taken,  the total duration of steroid therapy, and  individual characteristics. A person who requires 60 mg of prednisone daily for 6 weeks, for example (an admittedly unusually high and prolonged dose in asthma treatment), can expect to develop different side effects as compared to a person taking 40 mg of prednisone for one day, 35 mg the next day, then 30 mg the day after, and so forth, tapering down by 5 mg each",

Depending on the transversal requirements of the patient we can choose among 8 mm, 11 mm and 13 mm screws.\nIt is a very effective appliance.\nThe addition of acrylic on the occlusal aspects of the molars and premolars will prevent the over-inclination of the teeth that serve as anchorage.\n\n【1】5. Expansions up to 10 mm to 12 mm are possible.\nExtremely strong.\nWe can obtain orthopedic effects even in patients in which growth has almost ceased.\n\n【2】8. It modifies the mandibular posture, placing it in a lower and backward position, due to the extrusion of the palatine cusps of the upper molars and premolars.\n9. It improves the respiratory capacity of the patients due to the descent of the nasal cavity.\n\n【3】##Disadvantages\n\n【4】1. A wrong appliance design can provoke the self impingement of the appliance on the palatal mucosa.\n\n【5】2. The manufacture of this appliance consumes laboratory time.\nWe depend 100% upon patient and parent cooperation for the correct activation of the appliance.\nThe appliance is very rigid and difficult to bend.\n\n【6】##Recommendations\n\n【7】1. In a treatment for maxillary constriction, we must always resolve the transversal problem and then the sagittal problem.\n\n【8】2. We suggest a daily aperture of 0.5 mm (2/4 of a turn per day, one activation in the morning and another in the night) which is a tolerable measure for the patient (1/4 of a turn=0.25 mm).\n\n【9】3. Begin activating the screw 30 minutes after the appliance has been cemented to allow the complete hardening of the cement.\n\n【10】4. Provide the patient with an activation schedule and a list of possible effects.\nMonitor the patient clinically and radio-graphically during the disjunction.\n\n【11】6. Once the expansion has ended, use the appliance as a fixed retainer for 3 to 6 months. According to Hass in 1961, the mid palatal suture re ossifies in 3 months, for this motive, we must retain the patient that same time.  )",

Philadelphialı seçkin Doktor Silas Weir Mitchell, \"Hayalet uzuv\" tanımlamasını ilk kez İç savaş sırasında kullandı. Bu antibiyotik öncesi günlerde, yaralanmaların yaygın görülen sonuçlarından biri de kangrendi ve binlerce yaralı askerin iltihaplı uzvunu kesen cerrahlar da evlerine hayalet uzuvlar ve bunlara neyin neden olabileceği konusunda düzinelerce yeni açıklamayla döndüler. Silas Weir Mitchell bu fenomene çok şaşırmıştı ve ilk makalesini, profesyonel bir tıp dergisinde yayımlayıp arkadaşlarının alaylarına maruz kalmak yerine Lippincott's Journal adlı popüler bir dergide takma isimle yayımladı. Hayaletler, düşündüğünüzde, daha ziyade ürkütücü bir fenomendir.\n\n【1】Silas Weir Mitchell döneminden beri hayalet uzuvlar hakkında çok güzel olanlardan son derece saçma olanlara dek her tür spekülasyon ortaya atılmıştır. Geçenlerde, yirmi yıl kadar önce, Canadian Journal of Psychiatry' de çıkan bir yazı, hayalet uzuvların sadece hüsnükuruntu yüzünden olduğunu belirtti. Yazarlar, hastanın umutsuzca kolunu geri istediğini ve bu yüzden hayalet uzuv deneyimi yaşadığını söylediler – kısa süre önce kaybedilen anne veya babayı rüyada sık görmeye, hatta \"hayalet\"lerini görmeye benzer bir durummuş bu. Böylesi bir sav, ilerde göreceğimiz gibi çok saçmadır.\n\n【2】Hayalet uzuvlar için ikinci ve daha popüler bir açıklama, güdükteki (kesilen uzuvdan kalan parça) yıpranıp kıvrılmış sinir uçlarının (nöromalar) ateşlendiği ve harekete geçtiği, böylece kaybedilen uzvun hala oradaymış gibi düşünülmesini sağlayacak şekilde yüksek beyin merkezlerinin aldandığı şeklindedir. Bu harekete geçen sinirler kuramıyla ilgili birçok sorun olmasına rağmen, basit ve uygun bir açıklama oluşu yüzünden çoğu doktor buna sarılmaktadır.\n\n【3】Çoğu doktor gibi, ilk karşılaştığım andan itibaren hayalet uzuvlar dikkatimi çekti ve o andan beri bunlara şaşırıyorum. Ampüteler arasında çok yaygın olan hayalet kol ve bacaklara ek olarak radikal mastektomi sonrası hayalet memeleri olan kadınlar, hatta hayalet apandisiti olan bir hasta gördüm. Ameliyatla çıkarılmasına rağmen tipik spazmodik apandisit ağrısı azalmamıştı, öyle ki hasta, cerrahın onu kesip aldığını kabul etmiyordu! Bir bilim öğrencisi olarak, bu duruma hastalar kadar şaşırmıştım ve başvurduğum kitaplar sadece gizemi daha da derinleştirdi. Penisi kesilip alındıktan sonra bir hastanın hayalet ereksiyonlar yaşadığını,\n\n【4】##Hayalet Uzuv",

Unlike earlier generations of human-powered electronics, which quit the instant you did, a new breed stores your muscle energy in springs, batteries and capacitors that provide lasting returns.\nFreeplay Energy in London has sold more than 2.5 million hand-cranked radios and flashlights since 1995. In its original products, turning a crank wound a tight 33-foot steel ribbon, which slowly uncoiled. In its new line, the crank turns a mini transmission that drives an alternator to charge onboard batteries.\nThirty seconds of human effort will yield 40 minutes of play or eight minutes of light, and the products will be one fifth the size and weight, addressing a primary consumer complaint: human-powered electronics tend to be big and heavy.\nPeople buy human-powered electronics, which typically cost $50 to $80, because they're tired of spending money on batteries or because they want surety during storms or just because the gizmos are cool. But a mass market won't open \"until prices drop to the $29 range,\" says Vaughan Wiles, Freeplay's marketing director. New deals may help. This fall, outdoor-gear giant Coleman will sell a Freeplay flashlight under its brand name, as well as the radio.\nFreeplay also plans a hand-powered generator laden with electronics that can recharge certain popular cell phones. AladdinPower in Tampa markets a Stepcharger that works like a foot pump to recharge cellphone, laptop-computer and video-camera batteries.\nDesigning practical devices requires \"very small, very strong, very efficient components that can produce power when an elderly woman turns the crank and yet can handle a tough guy cranking the thing like crazy,\" says Freeplay technical director John Hutchinson. Minimizing mechanical wear is also paramount.\nA number of start-up companies have jumped on the bandwagon, but some products simply don't work well. Ultimately, success depends on maximizing a user's reward. \"If someone is stranded at sea, he'll crank all day\" to keep his two-way radio working so he can be rescued, Hutchinson says. \"But for the average guy in his garage, 60 seconds of effort is all he's willing to give.\" -Mark Fischetti TURNING THE CRANK on Freeplay's Bravo AM/FM radio spins gears in a tiny transmission that drives an alternator.\nIt sends current to a 3.6-volt nickel–metal hydride rechargeable battery. A 30-second wind of sufficient torque will provide 45 minutes of lowvolume play or 25 minutes of boom-box sound. Further cranking will extend RECHARGEABLE\nBATTERY play. An amorphous thin-film solar cell can provide added current for lazy listeners.\n\n【3】WEARING a Seiko Kinetic watch during daily activity provides enough motion to power its mechanism. When the watch is still, memory cells can keep time for four years.\n\n【4】WINDER HANDLE",

An ulcer is more commonly seen if the patient is unable to shut their eye completely. Dry eyes occur as a result of reduced tear production. Both corneal ulceration and dry eyes may lead to further eye infections.\n\n【1】##6. Excessive Tear Production\n\n【2】Some people experience excessive tear production. Tearing is initiated spontaneously while eating and laughing and is also known as 'crocodile tears.'\n\n【3】##7.  Ramsay Hunt Syndrome\n\n【4】If Bell's palsy is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, there is a possibility that patients may develop Ramsay Hunt syndrome. This condition is extremely rare, and only less than 2% of patients with Bell's palsy are at risk of being affected. Ramsay Hunt syndrome is characterized by the presence of blisters on the tongue and inside the ears. The condition generally responds to steroids and antiviral medication.\n\n【5】Long-term complications of Bell's palsy are more likely if:\n\n【6】1.

This exposes your eye to the environment making it more susceptible to damage, discomfort and visual impairment. The main aim of eye surgery is to reduce discomfort. The surgery is also very effective in preserving vision.\n\n【1】As with any surgical procedure, there are certain risks associated with eye surgery. Remember, there are various other treatments, surgeries and therapies that are helpful for people suffering from Bell's palsy. You can discuss possible options with your doctor before making a final decision.\n\n【2】I've come across many people who live a very happy life even though they decided against having any surgical corrections. It really depends on what makes you happy as a person. If you can live with the fact that you have a droopy eye, then more power to you. However, if you don't want to deal with a droopy eye for life, you may choose to go under the knife.\n\n【3】##Upper Eyelid Surgery\n\n【4】This surgery helps the upper lid cover more of the cornea and patients can close over 75% of their eye. Usually, it involves the surgical implantation of gold eyelid weights. The weights help the eyelid close with the help of gravity.\n\n【5】Gold eyelid weights can be implanted in an outpatient procedure. You can go back home the very same day. Once gold weights are attached to the eyelid, you can close the eyelid immediately. Minor bruising and swelling of the area is quite common, but it goes away in a few weeks.\n\n【6】There can be a slight bump on the eyelid where the weights are implanted. A qualified surgeon may place the gold implants in a place where they remain hidden. The reason gold weights are used is that the metal does not irritate a patient's skin. Gold weights are also safe to be used during an MRI.\n\n【7】The risk of upper eyelid surgery is that it can be difficult to control the position of the upper lid. If the eyelid still remains high, a repeat surgery may be required. Sometimes the weight may be too heavy, which will be seen as a bulky mass through the upper eyelid. The use of heavy weights can also blur your vision.\n\n【8】##Lower Eyelid Surgery\n\n【9】Surgical correction of the lower eyelid is done to reduce watering and allow the",

Resuscitation involves a broad spectrum of individual stakeholders and groups. Individuals include victims, family mem- bers, rescuers, and healthcare providers. Key stakeholder groups include the public, emergency medical dispatchers, public safety organizations, EMS systems, hospitals, civic groups, and policy makers at the local, state, and federal levels.\n\n【4】Because the links in the Chain of Survival are interdependent, an effective resuscitation strategy requires these individuals and groups to work in an integrated fashion and function as a system of care .Fundamental to a successful resuscitation system of care is the collective appreciation of the challenges and opportunities presented by the Chain of Survival. Thus individuals and groups must work together, sharing ideas and information, to evaluate and improve their resuscitation system. Leadership and accountability are important components of this team approach.\nA conceptual appreciation of the system and its working components is only a starting point. Improving care requires assessment of performance. Only when performance is evaluated can participants in a system effectively sequence of CPR steps. Laypersons can learn these skills online and in courses.\nIn contrast, in a highly specialized environment, such as a critical care unit of a hospital, many of the individual components of CPR (compression-ventilation-defibrillation) may be managed simultaneously. This approach requires choreography among many highly-trained rescuers who work as an integrated team.\nIn the prehospital setting, the order of the CPR components performed by the healthcare provider may switch between a sequenced and choreographed model depending on the proficiency of the provider and the availability of resources.",

This is done by bending the arch ° gingivally at the end of the molar tube; in order to do this it necessary to let the arch wire  mm in excess from the distal end of the molar tube. This can be used in the initial stage of treatment (during alignment and leveling with NiTi or stainless steel wires) or in the space closure phase for anchorage control. Also helps to \"stall\" the anterior segment from the distal part of the tube and prevent proclination in the anterior segment.  We have to bear in mind that before we tie back the NiTi arch wire we must flame the ends. This way it will lose its resilience and will be bent with precision.\n\n【2】##Advantages\n\n【3】2. It is done directly on the arch wire.\n\n【4】1.1.13. Cheap and easy to do.\n\n【5】4. Helps prevent the mesial movement of anterior teeth in the aligning, leveling and space closure treatment phases.\n\n【6】##Disadvantages\n\n【7】19. If the bend is not made correctly, lacerations and ulcers can occur in the oral mucosa.\n\n【8】2. We could debond the molar tube if we were not careful enough when making the bend.\n\n【9】3. More than necessary anchorage loss if we do not have a strict appointment control.\n\n【10】##Recommendations\n\n【11】1. The tie back of the lower arch wire is recommended in Class III patients with the use of Class III elastics, in order to prevent proclination of the anteroinferior segment.\n\n【12】2. The tie back of the upper arch wire is recommended in Class II patients with the use of Class II elastics, in order to prevent proclination of the anterosuperior segment.\n\n【13】3. In cases where we want more dental arch length during the leveling and alignment treatment phase, the tie back must be done 1 or 2 mm behind the end of the molar tube.",

Overbite has great impact upon treatment and retention of the teeth evolved in the cross bite.\nWhen an anterior cross bite presents a deep anterior overbite, a posterior bite plane will be needed so the upper incisor can move forward without any occlusal interference from the lower incisors. Once this is corrected, the stability of the retention will depend upon the presence of an adequate overbite. So, patients with incisor cross bite, associated with little or no overbite, are more difficult to treat and to retain. (5.\n\n【2】If the horizontal overbite is - mm to - mm and only one tooth is involved, the tongue can be used to correct the anterior cross bite when the patient is in the primary or mixed dentition, only if there is enough space for the tooth. Once this has been corrected, the occlusion itself will prevent the relapse of the cross bite.\n3. Anterior arch length. A crossed upper incisor must have enough space to be moved. If there is not enough available arch length, we must create the sufficient space before trying to uncross it. In straight wire mechanics, open coils are regularly used to create enough arch length to move the tooth to its appropriate position. In patients with a lot of overcrowding the extraction of a premolar and lengthy orthodontic treatment may be needed.\n\n【3】4. Upper incisor root torque. Many upper incisors that are crossed have their root in a palatal position. At the moment in which the crown is moved forward, the long axis of the tooth remains with an increased buccal inclination. After the tooth has been uncrossed, a buccally inclined tooth is prone to go back again. This is the reason why we should give negative torque to the root to move buccally. To accomplish this movement we can bond an inverted brace (°) and place \" x \" or \" x \" stainless steel wires.\nAnother way to apply negative torque is to make a third order bend in the arch wire.",

The condyle on the side of the cross bite is deviated to the posterosuperior side, meanwhile the condyle on the normal side places itself in the anteroinferior side of the temporal glenoid cavity. o If these deviations are corrected at an early age, we will obtain adequate eruption of the permanent teeth.\nThe skeletal relation of the osseous bases is improved. o It provides mouth closure without deviations. o\n\n【1】The treatment for posterior cross bite must commence as soon as the malocclusion is diagnosed, being conditioned to the maturity and cooperation degree of the patient.\nThe most indicated treatment for the correction of skeletal type cross bite is through maxillary disjunction.\n\n【2】##Disjunction\n\n【3】We usually require palatal expansion for the correction of skeletal transversal discrepancies with the combination of orthodontic and orthopedic movements.  Rapid maxillary expansion (disjunction) is done to increase the transversal dimension to correct skeletal cross bites, and at the same time, to increase dental arch length. For this purpose we utilize expanders that produce intense transversal forces on the lateral dentoalveolar sectors of the upper dental arch.  Initially, the transverse forces will buccaly incline the lateral segments, and if the forces are strong enough, the disjunction of the mid palatal suture can occur (disjunction), the same happens with all the suture complex of the maxilla.\nRapid maxillary expansion (RME), is indicated when the expansion necessities are greater than 4 mm or 5 mm and when the origin of the discrepancy is skeletal.  The objective of RME is to reduce orthodontic movements and undesired inclinations. RME requires activations and generates heavy forces that range between kg to kg per activation, in contrast with slow expansion that generates forces that range between 450 g and 900 g that may be insufficient to separate a mature midpalatal suture.  Some authors recommend slow expansion (0.5 mm to 1 mm per week), because they say that a physiologic suture adjustment occurs.  But other studies indicate that if the expansion is slow, all that we are going to obtain is a dental expansion (teeth in a buccal position) rather than a basal expansion. Those who support RME have as theoretical fundament that applying a rapid force to the posterior teeth, these teeth would not have enough time to incline and that the force will transfer to the suture and the suture will open, meanwhile the teeth will minimally move. We can obtain  mm to 0.5 mm per day with inter molar length increment of up to 8 mm.  RME is obtained in 10 to 30 days, but the expander must remain in the mouth during six months to allow new bone to form in the suture.  The goal of palatal disjunction is to maximize skeletal movement and to minimize dental movement, meanwhile the physiologic midpalatal suture adjustment takes place.\n\n【4】##Effects Of Disjunction\n\n【5】1. Effects on the maxillary complex. When the forces applied to the teeth and the maxillary alveolar processes exceed the necessary limits for orthodontic dental movement, a disjunction is produced. ( The pressure that orthopedic force exerts, is going to act upon the midpalatal suture splitting it. A compression of the periodontal ligament that will incline the alveolar processes and a gradual aperture of the mid palatal suture will occur. From the frontal point of view, the separation occurs in a pyramid form, the base is located toward the anterior dental sector and the fulcrum is on the Nasion point. Occlusally, the expansion is greater in the anterosuperior sector at the incisor level (fan aperture) than at the posterior edge of the suture at the molar level, where the transversal dimension is maintained by the pterygoid processes that, being of endochondral origin, have structures that are hardly modifiable with this therapy. All this provokes a descent and forward position of the \"A\" point of approximately mm to 2 mm,  II.\n\n【6】Effects on the alveolar processes. Because the bone is resilient, the inclination of the alveolar processes occurs early during disjunction. The majority of the forces applied tend to dissipate within 5 to 6 months and once the stabilization is terminated, any residual force can provoke a rebound effect, which makes overcorrection necessary. The slower we make the expansion, the more dental expansion effect and less basal expansion we will have. When an osseous or basal expansion is done, a force that produces hyalinization anchors the teeth to the bone and the aperture",

It is important to mention that the majority of intents to eradicate this conduct with strong words, punishments or any other aggressive conduct towards a child that has this habit have been counterproductive because far from eliminating it, it has only reinforced this conduct making it stronger and more frequent.\n\n【1】##Correction\n\n【2】We must be very careful if we want to eliminate the habit.\nFrom the Freudian point of view an abrupt interference can provoke the appearance of antisocial behavior, much more difficult to live with than the habit itself. For this motive, the general practitioner must have enough psychological training in order to refer the patient with a specialist for adequate treatment.  A simple Hawley plate will impede the introduction of a finger against the palate; this will take the pleasure out of the suction habit, and gradually the child will drop the habit. A grill can be added to the plate just as a reminder, but the child must know the purpose of the appliance.\n\n【3】We must keep in mind that the malocclusion can be corrected at any time, but a serious psychological problem can persist a lifetime, with much more serious sequels than the malocclusion itself.\n\n【4】The decision to interfere with a non-nutritive suction habit in the primary dentition must be based upon the following factors:\n\n【5】1. If the finger habit is tied to a developing Class II malocclusion, the skeletal malocclusion will worsen while the habit continues.\n\n【6】2. It is believed that finger habits are less detrimental or ever benefit dental development if the child is developing a Class III malocclusion or if the child is prognathic.\n\n【7】3. Anterior open bites derived from finger sucking habits usually do not need to be treated because there is a spontaneous correction after the habit is abandoned, especially if it ceases before the patient reaches three years of age.\n4. The attitude of the child: the child must always be part of the decision-making process, this way the child will not consider the intervention as a punishment.",

Repeated bouts of cough and wheezing in school-age children—boys as well as girls—are almost always due to asthma. Children may catch many colds each year, especially when school is in session. Asthma is often underdiagnosed, especially in children, so it is important to distinguish between repeated infections such as bronchitis or pneumonia, and asthma. Don't assume that your child is experiencing a \"bad winter\" if she seems to suffer from multiple chest colds. It may be that she has asthma. If so, make sure you get appropriate medical care, establish the correct diagnosis, and allow your daughter to receive asthma treatment if required.\n\n【2】##92. Do Milk Products Cause Increased Mucus In Asthmatics, Especially In Children?\n\n【3】Milk is not a cause of increased mucus production, nor is it considered to be an asthma trigger .\nConsumption of milk has no effect on lung capacity, either deleterious or beneficial. It is a myth that milk is somehow harmful to children with asthma. Milk can, however, be an allergen in sensitized children. Cow's milk allergy is a true food allergy and is due to an allergy to the protein constituents of the milk. Like many food allergies, milk allergy usually manifests as gastrointestinal symptoms, or as a skin reaction such as hives or eczema, but not as increased mucus. If you suspect that milk does not agree with your child, bring it to your physician's attention. Do not automatically eliminate milk and milk products from the child's diet without medical consultation and advice. I clearly",

With the use of intermaxillary elastics we can force an over eruption of the posterior teeth, this way we can level the Spee curve, increase the height of the inferior third of the face and we can lessen the depth of the anterior bite. It is important to make these procedures with rectangular wires in the braces in order to avoid brace rotation around the wire, which can happen with round wires, because this rotation may lingually incline the premolars.\n\n【4】The results obtained with this technique are generally very stable, the facial height and the depth of the bite are usually well maintained.  posteroinferior segment.\n\n【5】##Advantages\n\n【6】The extrusion of the posterior segment is fast.\n\n【7】2.

Mucus can also be produced in increased quantities as a consequence of irritation of the mucus-producing glands, as often occurs transiently in asthma exacerbations, and on a more long-term basis in chronic smokers. Doctors often use the phrase \"mucus hypersecretion\" when extra mucus develops.\n\n【1】NAEPP: The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program, abbreviated NAEPP, was founded in 1989 under the auspices of the National Institute of Health's National Heart Lung and Blood Institute. The NAEPP aims to improve asthma care in the U.S. by teaching health professionals, asthma patients, and the general public about asthma. The NEAPP's panel of experts has published several \"expert panel reports\" with guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma.\n\n【2】Nebulizer: A nebulizer is a device that transforms a respiratory drug in liquid form into a fine mist of medicine particles that are easily inhaled into the respiratory passages. It is powered by a machine or compressor that runs off electrical current or batteries. Nebulizers are used in babies and very young children with asthma who cannot use an MDI or DPI.\nThey are also often used in an emergency setting. Several different classes of asthma medicines are available for nebulization, including β  agonists and inhaled corticosteroid preparations.\n\n【3】Nocturnal: Taking place or occurring during the night. Asthmatic exacerbations, for example, usually include nocturnal symptoms.\n\n【4】NSAIDs:        Non-steroidal      antiinflammatory drugs are often referred to as NSAIDs. The different types of NSAIDs are all potent anti-inflammatory drugs, widely prescribed for the treatment of pain, fever, and conditions such as arthritis. Some NSAIDs are available over the counter; others require a physician's prescription. As a rule, NSAIDs \"cross react\" with aspirin, and are contraindicated in persons with aspirin-sensitive asthma.\nObesity: Obesity refers to the condi- tion of being significantly overweight, or obese. A person is obese is they weight more than 30% above their ideal body weight for their given age, height, and gender.\nAnother definition of obesity involves computation of the BMI.\nAn overweight adult has a BMI of between 25 and 30, while an obese adult has a BMI of 30 or greater.\n\n【5】Obstructive dysfunction: A pattern of abnormality detected by pulmonary function testing. Several different lung conditions lead to obstructive dysfunction on spirometry, one of the PFTs. Asthma is one of the conditions that, on testing, demonstrates obstructive dysfunction. A key element of the obstructive dysfunction uniquely seen in asthma is that, by definition, the obstruction (or abnormality) is completely reversible.",

Attach a monitor to the patient, evaluate blood pressure, and establish IV access. If possible, obtain a 12-lead ECG to better define the rhythm. While initiating treatment, evaluate the patient's clinical status and identify potentially reversible causes.\nThe provider must identify signs and symptoms of poor perfusion and determine if those signs are likely to be caused by the bradycardia . If the signs and symptoms are not due to bradycardia, the provider should reassess the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.\nRemember that signs and symptoms of bradycardia may be mild; asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients do not necessarily require treatment  unless there is suspicion that the rhythm is likely to progress to symptoms or become life-threatening (eg, Mobitz type II second-degree AV block in the setting of acute myocardial infarction [AMI]). If the bradycardia is suspected to be the cause of acute altered mental status, ischemic chest discomfort, acute heart failure, hypotension, or other signs of shock, the patient should receive immediate treatment.\n\n【1】Atrioventricular (AV) blocks are classified as first-, second-, and third-degree. Blocks may be caused by medications or electrolyte disturbances, as well as structural problems resulting from AMI or other myocardial diseases. A first-degree AV block is defined by a prolonged PR interval ( > 0.20 second) and is generally benign. Second-degree AV block is divided into Mobitz types I and II. In Mobitz type I block, the block is at the AV node; the block is often transient and asymptomatic. In Mobitz type II block, the block is usually below the AV node within the His-Purkinje system; this block is often symptomatic, with the potential to progress to complete (third-degree) AV block. Third-degree AV block may occur at the AV node, bundle of His, or bundle branches. When third-degree AV block is present, no impulses pass between the atria and ventricles.\n\n【2】Third-degree AV block can be permanent or transient, depending on the underlying cause.\n\n【3】##Therapy\n\n【4】Atropine Atropine remains the first-line drug for acute symptomatic bradycardia (Class IIa, LOE B). Clinical trials in adultsshowed that IV atropine improved heart rate, symptoms, and signs associated with bradycardia. Atropine sulfate reverses cholinergic-mediated decreases in heart rate and should be considered a temporizing measure while awaiting a transcutaneous or transvenous pacemaker for patients with symptomatic sinus bradycardia, conduction block at the level of the AV node, or sinus arrest.The recommended atropine dose for bradycardia is 0.5 mg IV every 3 to 5 minutes to a maximum total dose of 3 mg.\nDoses of atropine sulfate of <0.5 mg may paradoxically result in further slowing of the heart rate.Atropine administration should not delay implementation of external pacing for patients with poor perfusion.\nUse atropine cautiously in the presence of acute coronary ischemia or MI; increased heart rate may worsen ischemia or increase infarction size. Atropine will likely be ineffective in Figure 3. Bradycardia Algorithm.",

BURCH HE TEMPEST BEGAN ON A DATE KNOWN FOR ITS VIOLENT EVENTS:\nBastille Day, the anniversary of the beginning of the French Revolution.\nOn the morning of July  last year, the Space Environment Center in Boulder, Colo., detected a warning sign from the GOES-8 satellite, which monitors x-rays from the sun as well as weather conditions on the earth.\nAt 10: Universal Time the center's forecasters saw a sharp jump in the intensity of x-rays emanating from active region , a section of the sun's surface that had been roiling for the past week. The data indicated the onset of a solar flare, a brief but powerful burst of radiation.\nThe flare, which reached its maximum intensity at : UT, was also sighted by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), a spacecraft stationed between the sun and the earth, about 1.5 million VIOLENT ERUPTION in the sun's outer atmosphere on November 8, 2000, spewed billions of tons of charged particles toward the earth. The event was observed by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO); the spacecraft's coronagraph uses a disk ( dark circle ) to block direct light from the sun ( white circle ) so that its atmosphere can be seen.\n\n【4】STO",

        "text": "【0】页码:179\n##Unfractionated Heparin Versus Low-Molecular-Weight\nHeparin With Ppci In Stemi\n\n【1】Two registry studiesand other studies demonstrated similar or improved outcomes when enoxaparin was compared to UFH in patients undergoing PPCI combined with a GP IIb/IIIa antagonist and thienopyridine inhibitor.\nOne large clinical trial  demonstrated better outcomes in terms of acute cardiac events and bleeding using fondaparinux and PPCI. Thrombus formation on catheter material in patients on fondaparinux, however, required the addition of UFH during PCI.Two large randomized clinical trials resulted in less bleeding and a short- and long-term reduction in cardiac events and overall mortality with bivalirudin compared to UFH plus a glycoprotein inhibitor in patients with STEMI and PPCI.For patients with STEMI undergoing contemporary PCI (ie, additional broad use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors and a thienopyridine) enoxaparin may be considered a safe and effective alternative to UFH (Class IIb, LOE B). Patients initially treated with enoxaparin should not be switched to UFH and vice versa to avoid increased risk of bleeding.\nFondaparinux may be considered as an alternative to UFH, however, there is an increased risk of catheter thrombi with fondaparinux alone. Additional UFH (50 to 100 U/kg bolus) may help to avoid this complication (Class IIb, LOE B), but using these two agents is not recommended over UFH alone.\nFor fondaparinux and enoxaparin it is necessary to adjust the dose in patients with renal impairment. Bivalirudin may be considered as an alternative to UFH and GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors (Class IIb, LOE A).\n\n【2】##Calcium Channel Blockers\n\n【3】There is little evidence that calcium channel blocking agents can be safely used as an alternative or additional therapy to b -blockers when the later are contraindicated or their maximum dose has been achieved.\nCalcium channel blocking agents have not been shown to reduce mortality after acute MI, and in certain patients with cardiovascular disease there are data to suggest that they are harmful. β -blockers have been used much more broadly, have a much safer profile, and appear to be a more appropriate choice for patients presenting with myocardial infarction compared to calcium channel blockers.\n\n【4】##Ace Inhibitor Therapy\n\n【5】ACE Inhibitors and ARBs in the Hospital ACE inhibitor therapy has improved survival rates in patients with AMI, particularly when started early after the initial hospitalization.Evidence from  large clinical trials,  meta-analyses,  minor trialsdocuments consistent improvement in mortality when oral ACE inhibitors are administered in the hospital setting to patients with AMI with or without early reperfusion therapy. In these studies ACE inhibitors were not administered in the presence of hypotension (SBP < 100 mm Hg or ≥ 30 mm Hg below baseline). The beneficial effects are most pronounced in patients with anterior infarction, pulmonary congestion, or LV ejection fraction <40%.\n\n【6】Administration of an oral ACE inhibitor is recommended within the first 24 hours after onset of symptoms in STEMI patients with pulmonary congestion or LV ejection fraction < 40%, in the absence of hypotension (SBP < 100 mm Hg or ≥ 30 mm Hg below baseline) (Class I, LOE A). Oral ACE inhibitor therapy can also be useful for all other patients with AMI with or without early reperfusion therapy (Class IIa, LOE B). IV administration of ACE inhibitors is contraindicated in the first 24 hours because of risk of hypotension (Class III, LOE C).\n\n【7】ACE Inhibitors in the Prehospital Setting Despite multiple studies that have shown a benefit of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in patients with a myocardial infarction when therapy is started during the first 24 hours of the index hospitalization, no trial specifically evaluates patients in the ED or prehospital settings. An older randomized trial showed a reduction in mortality with an increased risk of hypotension in patients treated soon after presentation in the inpatient setting.Several trials showed a reduction in the rate of heart failure and mortality in patients treated soon after fibrinolysis,  and several others showed no benefit with the early or prehospital use of angiotensin converting enzyme.\nIn conclusion, although ACE inhibitors and ARBs have been shown to reduce long-term risk of mortality in patients suffering an AMI, there is insufficient evidence to support the routine initiation of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in the prehospital or ED setting (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【8】##Hmg Coenzyme A Reductase Inhibitors (Statins)\n\n【9】A variety of studies documented consistent reduction in indicators of inflammation and complications such as reinfarction, recurrent angina, and arrhythmias when statin treatment is administered within a few days after onset of an ACS.  There is little data to suggest that this therapy should be initiated within the ED; however, early initiation (within 24 hours of presentation) of statin therapy is recommended in patients with an ACS or AMI (Class I, LOE C). If patients are already on statin therapy, continue the therapy (Class IIb, LOE C).\nAn increase in short-term mortality and incidence of major adverse cardiac events have been reported with discontinuation of statin treatment in ACS patients at hospital admission.\nStatins should not be discontinued during the index hospitalization unless contraindicated (Class III, LOE C).Pretreatment with statins in patients undergoing elective percutaneous angioplasty for stable angina or hemodynamicaly stable ACS has been shown to significantly reduce biomarkers of myocardial necrosis or inflammation compared to placebo when given between 3 and 7 days prior to the procedure.Furthermore, pretreatment with atorvastatin 80 mg 12 hours before and an additional 40 mg immediately before PCI for NSTEMI or documented ischemia has been shown to significantly decrease the 30 day composite of death, MI, and unplanned revascularization compared to placebo in a prospective randomized trial. There were no deaths in any of the two groups and the primary end point was driven by peripro-",

The indiscriminate use of a pacifier, feeding bottle and finger sucking can increase the chance of development of an open bite in the infant. This suction reflex disappears around the seventh month after birth.\n\n【1】##Breathing\n\n【2】Nasal obstruction and mouth breathing habit have been linked to this type of malocclusion, due to this obstruction,the patient beguines to breathe through the mouth so the patient must lower his tongue in order to let air pass through (mouth breathing habit) provoking a muscular unbalance between the tongue and the maxillary bones; the persistence of half open mouth stimulates the growth of the alveolar processes altering the craniofacial growth and provoking an open bite.\n\n【3】The etiology that initiates mouth breathing has many factors, like allergies, adenoid tissue, enlarged tonsils, chronic inflammation of the air ways, tumoral processes, nasal septum deviation, nasal polyps, nasal orifices narrowing, among others.\n\n【4】##Muscular Hipotonicity\n\n【5】Teeth receive and support the mechanical loads of the muscles that maintain teeth in a vertical position in their osseous bases. Hypotonicity tends to stimulate molar overeruption and to separate the maxillary bone bases.\n\n【6】##Dentition Development\n\n【7】In certain children the eruption of permanent teeth is sometimes altered chronologically; this contributes to the lack of vertical contact. This results in a transitory open bite aggravated by the tongue interposition.  o\n\n【8】##General\n\n【9】Genetics. The genetic influence in the development of bone and teeth is evident, this is why we can say there are hereditary malocclusions; the size, form of teeth and bone are inherited and this leads us to established morphologic patterns.  o Congenital defects. There are congenital defects that can lead to an alteration of the growth of the maxilla and the mandible; palatine fissures, for example.  o Muscular alterations. When our mouth is in repose, teeth do not occlude and lips are in contact producing a lip seal, that is necessary for swallowing and to avoid saliva leakage. In the absence of this seal, the tongue can produce an unbalance between the lips and the teeth producing a malocclusion. Lip and tongue morphology have influence on this, so does the muscle tone of the lips.",

If CPR is in progress, stop chest compressions briefly, administer the medications, and follow with a flush of at least 5 mL of normal saline and 5 consecutive positive-pressure ventilations.Optimal endotracheal doses of medications are unknown; in general expert consensus recommends doubling or tripling the dose of lidocaine, atropine or naloxone given via the ETT. For epinephrine, a dose ten times the intravenous dose (0.1 mg/kg or 0.1 mL/kg of 1: concentration) is recommended .\nThe effectiveness of endotracheal epinephrine during cardiac arrest is controversial. Some studies showed it to be as effective as vascular administrationwhile other studies have not found it to be as effective.Animal studiessuggested that a higher dose of epinephrine is required for endotracheal than for intravascular administration because the lower epinephrine concentrations achieved when the drug is delivered by the endotracheal route may produce predominant transient peripheral β  -adrenergic vasodilating effects. These effects can be detrimental, and cause hypotension, lower coronary artery perfusion pressure and flow, and a reduced potential for ROSC.\nNon-lipid-soluble drugs (eg, sodium bicarbonate and calcium) may injure the airway; they should not be administered via the endotracheal route.\n\n【3】##Emergency Fluids And Medications\n\n【4】##Estimating Weight\n\n【5】In the out-of-hospital setting, a child's weight is often unknown, and even experienced personnel may not be able to estimate it accurately.Tapes with precalculated doses printed at various patient lengths have been clinically validated  and are more accurate than age-based or observer (parent or provider) estimate-based methods in the prediction of body weight.  Body habitus may also be an important consideration.",

It has been observed that the risk is highest during the third trimester and several weeks after delivery. Luckily, the prognosis for expecting moms is generally good. If a woman is affected with Bell's palsy during pregnancy, there is no effect on the developing fetus.\n\n【2】The symptoms among expecting mothers are the same as described earlier in this book.\n\n【3】##Treating Bell'S Palsy During Pregnancy\n\n【4】We will look at the treatment methods in more detail later in this book, but for now, let's take a quick look at how Bell's palsy can be treated during pregnancy.\nYou can address symptoms such as pain with pain killers; however, steroids and popular antiviral medication are not recommended.\n\n【5】##How Long Will It Take For The Symptoms To Go Away Completely?\n\n【6】Well, you will notice a gradual improvement, but recovery times can vary depending on the extent of nerve damage. Most pregnant women who develop Bell's palsy recover completely in less than six months. In some cases, the recovery time may be longer – this often happens if the patient develops complete facial paralysis.\n\n【7】Pregnant women who develop Bell's palsy are monitored closely for changes in blood pressure. This is because expecting moms suffering from Bell's palsy are also at an increased risk of developing preeclampsia.\n\n【8】Preeclampsia is a serious complication in pregnant women and is characterized by high blood pressure. The increase in blood pressure can cause tremendous damage to vital organs, particularly the kidneys. Preeclampsia is usually spotted after 20 weeks of pregnancy. It can even happen in women who had normal blood pressure during the early weeks of pregnancy.\n\n【9】If left untreated, preeclampsia might lead to serious complications for both the mother and the baby. This condition only has one cure – delivering the baby.\nThat being said; the pregnancy obviously has to be in its final stage for the delivery to take place.",

Grossman\n\n【3】ONDON —For the past couple of years, everyone has assumed that the next big technological thing would be wireless data services. WAP, the wireless application protocol put together by a huge group of companies, permits Web surfing over mobile phones. It's going to really come into its own, the firms insist, when third-generation, highspeed mobile telephony rolls out, perhaps as soon as year's end. Simultaneously,\nBluetooth, a standard developed by a different huge set of companies, is expected to enable all kinds of personal networking—for instance, writing with a pen that can later transmit the data to your PC.\nYet neither WAP nor Bluetooth has taken over the world; in fact, there's a chance that neither will, considering the rise of a dark-horse challenger: the cryptically named b. The standard, developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), was embraced first by Apple Computer in 1999, in the form of its AirPort base station. The \"b\" indicates that this second version of , originally ratified in 1997, is faster than the first: b transmits data at up to 11 megabits per second. It is, in other words, wireless broadband, and it operates in a part of the spectrum (roughly, near microwaves) that, unlike thirdgeneration, or G, mobile telephony, requires no license.\nMany compatible products are available.\nSet up one of those flying-saucer-like AirPort devices and a card in your desktop or laptop, and you have a local-area network without all those wires. Stick the saucer in your window, and you can go work in a nearby café. This year's Computers, Freedom and Privacy conference placed an b access point in its Internet room. \"What I love about it,\" says Dan O'Brien, editor of the U.K.'s satirical ezine Need to Know (Now) , \"is that it makes the Net into what it should be: something that's all around you all the time, and you can just tap into it.\"\nSuch enthusiasm is making b one of the fastest-growing wireless standards. Local scuttlebutt has it that the entire Massachusetts Institute of Technology campus will be outfitted with b within the next year. The commercial service MobileStar is setting up wireless Internet access nodes in airports and hotel chains. For $2.95 for the first 15 minutes and $0.20 a minute thereafter, you can sit in the American Airlines terminal at JFK and browse the Net at broadband speeds on your laptop. Now. Today. No squinting at mobilephone screens. The securities brokerage company Nomura stated in March that it views b as a serious threat to 3G mobile telephony's hopes to make serious money out of wireless data services.\nThe London-based hacker group Consume.net is trying to line up enough publicspirited folks to paint the town wireless. So far it's in just a few spots, but the dream is that if everyone sticks a base station in the window, anyone will be able to access the Net from anywhere in town. Moreover, b enables machines to communicate directly. \"It puts control into the hands of the public,\" observes James Stevens, one of the group's leaders. \"It's not just about wireless. It's the broader idea that you can share what you've got.\"\nIf, he says, you're sending local e-mail, why not do it locally? On the Internet, e-mail for your next-door neighbor might go via Auckland and Singapore.\nIt's hard to tell how far b and its successors (with different letters and higher speeds, such as g) can go. Critics argue that such systems can't hand off connections the way mobile networks transfer calls. But that feature is pointless to many Web surfers: unlike talking, clicking on links and scrolling are hard to do while you're walking. Bluetooth may be a lot cheaper—manufacturers expect to embed the technology on a chip costing less than $5—but at  kilobits per second, it moves data comparatively slowly.\nWhat b has is momentum that these other standards can only dream of. Given a ubiquitous broadband wireless connection, anything, from voice calls to large chunks of data, can be transmitted. At the moment, b is still a geek thing, requiring fiddling, configuring and tolerance for imperfections.\nBut in 1990, so was the Internet.\n\n【4】Wendy M.

There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the routine administration of magnesium during cardiac arrest.\n\n【5】##Precautions\n\n【6】Magnesium produces vasodilation and may cause hypotension if administered rapidly.\n\n【7】##Procainamide\n\n【8】Procainamide prolongs the refractory period of the atria and ventricles and depresses conduction velocity.\n\n【9】Precautions There is limited clinical data on using procainamide in infants and children.  Infuse procainamide very slowly (over 30 to 60 minutes) while monitoring the ECG and blood pressure.\nDecrease the infusion rate if there is prolongation of the QT interval, or heart block; stop the infusion if the QRS widens to > 50% of baseline or hypotension develops. Do not administer together with another drug causing QT prolongation, such as amiodarone, without expert consultation. Prior to using procainamide for a hemodynamically stable patient, expert consultation is strongly recommended.\n\n【10】##Sodium Bicarbonate\n\n【11】Routine administration of sodium bicarbonate is not recommended in cardiac arrest (Class III, LOE B).  Sodium bicarbonate may be administered for treatment of some toxidromes  or special resuscitation situations such as hyperkalemic cardiac arrest.\n\n【12】##Precautions\n\n【13】During cardiac arrest or severe shock, arterial blood gas analysis may not accurately reflect tissue and venous acidosis.Excessive sodium bicarbonate may impair tissue oxygen delivery;  cause hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypernatremia, and hyperosmolality;decrease the VF threshold;  and impair cardiac function.\n\n【14】##Vasopressin\n\n【15】There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against the routine use of vasopressin during cardiac arrest.\nPediatricand adultcase series/reports suggested that vasopressin  or its long-acting analog, terlipressin,may be effective in refractory cardiac arrest when standard therapy fails. A large pediatric NRCPR case series, however, suggested that vasopressin is associated with lower ROSC, and a trend toward lower 24-hour and discharge survival.A preponderance of controlled trials in adults do not demonstrate a benefit.In the text below, box numbers identify the corresponding step in the algorithm .\n\n【16】•(Step 1) As soon as the child is found to be unresponsive with no breathing, call for help, send for a defibrillator (manual or AED), and start CPR (with supplementary oxygen if available). Attach ECG monitor or AED pads as soon as available. Throughout resuscitation, emphasis should be placed on provision of high-quality CPR (providing chest compressions of adequate rate and depth, allowing complete chest recoil after each compression, minimizing interruptions in compressions and avoiding excessive ventilation).\n\n【17】While CPR is being given, determine the child's cardiac rhythm from the ECG or, if you are using an AED, the device will tell you whether the rhythm is \"shockable\" (eg, VF or rapid VT) or \"not shockable\" (eg, asystole or PEA).\nIt may be necessary to temporarily interrupt chest compressions to determine the child's rhythm. Asystole and bradycardia with a wide QRS are most common in asphyxial arrest.VF and PEA are less common  but VF is more likely to be present in older children with sudden witnessed arrest.\n\n【18】##\"Nonshockable Rhythm\": Asystole/Pea (Step 9)\n\n【19】PEA is an organized electric activity—most commonly slow, wide QRS complexes—without palpable pulses. Less frequently there is a sudden impairment of cardiac output with an initially normal rhythm but without pulses and with poor perfusion. This subcategory, formerly known as electromechanical dissociation (EMD), may be more reversible than asystole. For asystole and PEA:\n\n【20】•(Step 10) Continue CPR with as few interruptions in chest compressions as possible. A second rescuer obtains vascular access and delivers epinephrine, 0.01 mg/kg (0.1 mL/kg of 1: solution) maximum of 1 mg (10 mL), while CPR is continued. The same epinephrine dose is repeated every 3 to 5 minutes (Class I, LOE B). There is no survival benefit from high-dose epinephrine, and it may be harmful, particularly in asphyxia (Class III, LOE B).Highdose epinephrine may be considered in exceptional circumstances, such as β -blocker overdose (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【21】•Once an advanced airway is in place,  rescuer should give continuous chest compressions at a rate of at least 100 per minute without pause for ventilation. The second rescuer delivers ventilations at a rate of 1 breath every 6 to 8 seconds (about 8 to 10 breaths per minute). Rotate the compressor role approximately every 2 minutes to prevent compressor fatigue and deterioration in quality and rate of chest compressions. Check rhythm every 2 minutes with minimal interruptions in chest compressions. If the rhythm is \"nonshockable\" continue with cycles of CPR and epinephrine administration until there is evidence of ROSC or you decide to terminate the effort. If at any time the rhythm\n\n【22】##Pulseless Arrest",

The same epinephrine dose is repeated every 3 to 5 minutes (Class I, LOE B). There is no survival benefit from high-dose epinephrine, and it may be harmful, particularly in asphyxia (Class III, LOE B). 257 – 261 Highdose epinephrine may be considered in exceptional circumstances, such as β -blocker overdose (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n• Once an advanced airway is in place, 1 rescuer should give continuous chest compressions at a rate of at least 100 per minute without pause for ventilation.

High serum IgE levels have, for example, been associated with persistent wheezing, allergy, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness.\nIgE plays a pivotal role in allergy, in asthma, and in the other \"atopic diseases,\" such as eczema, seasonal allergic rhinitis, peanut allergy, anaphylaxis, and hives. To better understand the central role of IgE, it is important to first review our understanding of the body's allergic response.\n\n【1】When a person has an allergy to a specific allergen, the allergy has developed over time. In order for an allergy to emerge, a person must first be exposed to an allergen.

The genesis of a specific allergy in an individual with certain innate genetic characteristics requires at least two successive steps: a preliminary exposure to an allergen, followed by sensitization to that same allergen. Many individuals are not \"allergy prone,\" meaning that even though they may have repeated, frequent allergen exposure, their immune system does not become sensitized, and allergic symptoms never develop.

A micrometeorite impact, a snag, a wayward tool or even a misstep can spell doom for an astronaut. As the station takes shape, however, construction and repair will demand more of these extravehicular activities (EVAs). One remedy: let the android do it. At least that's the plan of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration scientists working on Robonaut.\nThe idea of maintenance robots originated after a  study concluded that an orbital station would require 75 percent more space-walking time than originally planned.\nKeeping the station operational \"would take more time than we had astronauts,\" explains Chris Culbert, chief of the robotic systems technology branch at the NASA Johnson Space Center. \"That sent us on a path of finding robotic ways to do the maintenance.\"\nThe first stop for NASA's roboheads was DART, or Dexterous Anthropomorphic Ro- botic Testbed. \"It had two arms and two hands,\" Culbert says, \"but it was built using commercial, off-the-shelf products.\" The engineers controlled DART through \"telepresence\": an operator would don virtual-reality helmet and gloves, and the robot would mimic the operator's motions.\nBut it was too bulky ever to fly into space.\n\n【3】So three years ago the robotics crew began to build Robonaut, designed to be the size of a suited astronaut and to be just as dexterous.\n\n【4】\"The biggest problem is that the operator has no sense of touch,\" comments Chris Lovchik, a NASA senior engineer working on the hands. \"To some degree, it's like operating on Novocain, but at the same time the tools fit into your hand as you would expect them to. Visual feedback helps quite a bit.\" \"It can pick up an object and manipulate something on that object,\" adds Robert Ambrose, Robonaut project leader at the Johnson center. \"It can use a pistol-grip drill designed for a human, and it can articulate the trigger.\nThat's very unusual for a robot.\" Engineers plan to have Robonaut function beyond telepresence, operating on voice command.\nThen, too, some Robonaut technology might come in handy down here on Earth. In Somerset, England, scientists have developed a robot that incorporates the brain of the primitive sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus .\nWhen fed information through light sensors, the brain sends signals to the robot's motors, telling it how to respond. Such technology could allow prosthetics to be controlled directly from the brain. Developing prosthetics from Robonaut, however, is not in NASA's immediate future. \"It is not impossible,\" Culbert explains.\n\n【5】\"But to interface it to the human nervous system—we don't have that capability.\"\nIn fact, only late last year did the NASA team install Robonaut's left hand and torso. The best prediction is that it will be two years before the robot is ready for launch. The slow pace stems in large part from the project's minimal funding. \"A lot of the attitude will change as the station becomes more and more of a burden on the astronauts,\" Lovchik says. \"Systems like this will look much, much better.\"\n\n【6】Phil Scott is a technology writer based in New York City .\n\n【7】##Robonaut\"S\n\n【8】Has more than 47 degrees of freedom,  in each hand alone; human hands have  Has half the grip strength of a human, and arm can lift only  pounds—still strong enough for space work Incorporates various sensors, including thermal, positional, tactile, force and torque instrumentation; each arm has more than 150 sensors Relies on software written in C and C++ Why Robonaut resembles bounty hunter Boba Fett from Star Wars: \"The face had to meet a couple of characteristics: it had to support the cameras— the eyes—and have room for additional cameras, small ones pointing down through the chin. It just happened to look like a character out of Star Wars.\" —Chris Culbert, NASA",

This alteration can induce asymmetric growth of the mandible, therefore this problem must be immediately treated as soon as it is detected.\nThe most frequent presentation of this malocclusion  is a unilateral posterior cross bite, generally associated to a functional mandibular deviation.\nFrom the cephalometric point of view we can find:\n\n【1】In the sagittal sense, there is a slight tendency to a osseo-dental Class III, a distal position of the upper molar, more linguoversion and retrusion of the upper incisors and moderate protrusion of the lower incisors.\nIn the vertically, we can find a dolychofacial tendency.  To make this diagnosis, we must manipulate the mandible to centric relation without dental occlusion. If the cross bite is functional, the midlines will coincide, the chin deviation will disappear and unstable transversal cusp to cusp relation becomes evident.  Treatment: sometimes they are corrected by eliminating the interference with occlusal grinding or crown remodeling of one or more teeth. In some cases the use of a dento alveolar expander will be needed.\n\n【2】##2. Dentoalveolar Cross Bite\n\n【3】It can affect one tooth or a group of them.\n\n【4】In this malocclusion, there is an alteration in the di-  rection of the longer axis of the upper and/or lower teeth, but the basal bone is not altered.\n\n【5】The buccal cusps of the upper premolars and/or molar n occlude in the fossas of the opposing lower teeth.\nThey are very frequent, in the primary and in the  mixed and permanent dentition.\nGenerally, unilateral dento alveolar cross bites are l functional, they are the most frequent alterations that affect a single tooth.  Treatment: Expanders like the Quad Helix, the Tandem or the palatine expander are used.\n\n【6】##3. Skeletal Cross Bites\n\n【7】They are produced by alterations in the transversal  dimensions of the maxilla or the mandible, provoked by a growth alteration in some or both of them and can be observed in any stage of development.\nThe most frequent alteration is the insufficient growth of the upper maxilla. If the cross bite is unilateral it is usually a transversal hypo-expansion of the maxilla, capable of premature cuspid contacts, that can result in a lateral deviation of the mandible.\nThe etiological factors can be mouth breathing habits,  atypical deglutition and thumb sucking, and can only be treated with orthopedics, only if the patient still has growth potential; if not, it must be corrected by surgical disjunction or surgically assisted orthopedic disjunction.\nThe most frequent cause for this type of cross bite is  mouth breathing, where we can observe a notorious compression of the maxilla that shortens the distance between molars, premolars and canines.\nIt can also occur as a consequence of an asymmetry  of the shape of the mandible (laterognatia).

Use heavy rectangular arch wires to avoid posterior sector lingualization.\n\n【3】3. Use  Oz force elastics.\nThe elastics must be changed every 24 hours.\nPerform posterior segment stripping to facilitate extrusion.\nTell the patient to chew gum with the intermaxillary elastics in place. This will accelerate the extrusion of the posterior segment.\n\n【4】##Individual Bypass\n\n【5】This form of intrusion is very simple and fast. We just have to place a brace or a button to the tooth that we want to intrude and pass an elastic wire (NiTi or TMA ) on the incisal portion of the tooth. This will intrude the tooth. l. The bypass provokes an intrusive movement immediately.\n\n【6】##Advantages\n\n【7】2. The intrusive movement is 2 mm per month.\nWe do not depend upon patient compliance.\nWe can produce individual or in block intrusion.\n\n【8】##Disadvantages\n\n【9】1. There is no tip or torque control of the tooth.\nTeeth with intrusive bypass tend to incline buccally.\n\n【10】3. Because it is a violent movement, it provokes periodontal inflammation and pain.\n\n【11】##Recommendations\n\n【12】1. Make the by-pass with elastic wires like NiTi or TMA.\n\n【13】2. The diameter of the arches can range from \" to \".\n\n【14】3. After dental intrusion, we must give tip and torque to the tooth.\nWe must lace the teeth adjacent to the bypass.\nAfter dental intrusion, all arches must have an intrusion bend or we must change the position of the brace in order to place a straight wire and facilitate horizontal movements if necessary.",

If there is an anterior open bite present, the traction hook must be placed in a high position to produce an oblique force direction and to favor the closure of the bite.\n\n【1】6. Whenever we want alveolar dental forwarding, the traction hooks must be placed at the canine level.\nIn deep bite cases, the traction hook must be placed at the permanent upper molar level to extrude this tooth and to open the bite.\nSuspend the use of the face mask if TMJ problems arise.\nThe elastics used for the protraction of the upper maxilla can be 5/16\", which will generate heavy forces, following this sequence:\n\n【2】9.1. 8 ounces at the beginning of treatment ( g).\n\n【3】9.2. 14 ounces at the end of treatment ( g).\n\n【4】10. We recommend periodic appointments to inspect the expander and to evaluate the changes in soft tissues (every 4 to 6 weeks).\nWe must indicate to the patient that the mask should be used all day except during meals or during the practice of a sport.\nIf the patient tolerates the use of the face mask during sleep hours, we must encourage the patient to use the appliance during these hours because the growth hormone is liberated in this time period and the skeletal changes will be most favorable.\nWe do not consider appropriate to direct our efforts in inhibiting mandibular growth, because the mandible grows influenced by a genetic hormonal mechanism that cannot be influenced by functional stimuli or appliances.\n\n【5】##Modified Tandem\n\n【6】The modified Tandem is an anterior maxillary traction device, indicated in cases where the patient presents maxillary hypoplasia with an anterior cross bite and when the patient is still growing (Class III patients due to a maxillary skeletal deficiency).

Sterling, J. Salmon, D. J. Becker and D. F. Savarese. MIT Press, 1999. More information about Beowulf computing can be found at the following Web sites: stonesoup.esd.ornl.gov/ extremelinux.esd.ornl\n\n【4】##The Future Of Clusters\n\n【5】THE TRADITIONAL MEASURE OF SU- percomputer performance is benchmark speed: how fast the system runs a standard program. As scientists, however, we prefer to focus on how well the system can handle practical applications. To evaluate the Stone SouperComputer, we fed the same ecoregion mapping problem to ORNL's Intel Paragon supercomputer shortly before it was retired. At one time, this machine was the laboratory's fastest, with a peak performance of  gigaflops.\nOn a per-processor basis, the run time on the Paragon was essentially the same as that on the Stone SouperComputer. We have never officially clocked our cluster (we are loath to steal computing cycles from real work), but the system has a theoretical peak performance of about  gigaflops. Ingenuity in parallel algorithm design is more important than raw speed or capacity: in this young science, David and Goliath (or Beowulf and Grendel!) still compete on a level playing field.\nThe Beowulf trend has accelerated since we built the Stone SouperComputer.\nNew clusters with exotic names—Grendel, Naegling, Megalon, Brahma, Avalon,\nMedusa and theHive, to mention just a few—have steadily raised the performance curve by delivering higher speeds at lower costs. As of last November,  clusters of PCs, workstations or servers were on the list of the world's  fastest computers. The LosLobos cluster at the University of New Mexico has  Intel Pen- tium III processors and is the 80th-fastest system in the world, with a performance of  gigaflops. The Cplant cluster at Sandia National Laboratories has \nCompaq Alpha processors and is ranked 84th. The National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy are planning to build even more advanced clusters that could operate in the teraflops range (one trillion floating-point operations per second), rivaling the speed of the fastest supercomputers on the planet.\nBeowulf systems are also muscling their way into the corporate world. Major computer vendors are now selling clusters to businesses with large computational needs. IBM, for instance, is building a cluster of  servers for NuTec Sciences, a biotechnology firm that plans to use the system to identify disease-causing genes. An equally important trend is the development of networks of PCs that contribute their processing power to a collective task. An example is SETI@home, a project launched by researchers at the University of California at Berkeley who are analyzing deep-space radio signals for signs of intelligent life. SETI@home sends chunks of data over the Internet to more than three million PCs, which process the radio-signal data in their idle time. Some experts in the computer industry predict that researchers will eventually be able to tap into a \"computational grid\" that will work like a power grid: users will be able to obtain processing power just as easily as they now get electricity.\nAbove all, the Beowulf concept is an empowering force. It wrests high-level computing away from the privileged few and makes low-cost parallel-processing systems available to those with modest resources. Research groups, high schools, colleges or small businesses can build or buy their own Beowulf clusters, realizing the promise of a supercomputer in every basement\nM positions, fewer iterations are needed to map the ecoregions.\nThe result of all our work was a series of maps of the continental U.S. showing each ecoregion in a different color [ see illustrations B and C on page ]. We produced maps showing the country divided into as few as four ecoregions and as many as 5,000. The maps with fewer ecoregions divided the country into recognizable zones—for example, the Rocky Mountain states and the desert Southwest. In contrast, the maps with thousands of ecoregions are far more complex than any previous classification of the country's environments. Because many plants and animals live in only one or two ecoregions, our maps may be useful to ecologists who study endangered species.\nIn our first maps the colors of the ecoregions were randomly assigned, but we later produced maps in which the colors of the ecoregions reflect the similarity of their respective environments. We statistically combined nine of the environmental variables into three composite characteristics, which we represented on the map with varying levels of red, green and blue. When the map is drawn this way, it shows gradations of color instead of sharp borders: the lush Southeast is mostly green, the cold Northeast is mainly blue, and the arid West is primarily red .",

Sometimes the affected muscles are overworked in this 'tug of war' resulting in short, stiff muscle fibers.\n\n【1】##Synkinesis: Basics You Need To Know\n\n【2】1. Symptoms of synkinesis only show on the side of the face affected by Bell's palsy.\n2. Facial palsy patients notice symptoms largely in the cheek, chin, and eye and neck area.\n\n【3】3. Even the mild symptoms appear more prominent when the good side is compared to the affected side of the face.\n\n【4】##The Look And Feel\n\n【5】The condition may show up in different ways. The most common observations include:\n\n【6】1. The eye squints whenever you smile.\n2. Your cheek might rise as you try to close your eyes.\n\n【7】3. Your neck feels tight when you try to whistle.\n\n【8】4. Facial twitching, especially in the neck and chin area becomes more common.\n5. Facial muscles typically in the forehead and eyebrow area become tight, causing discomfort. You may find it difficult to move tight and stiff muscles.\n6. Even when the affected side of the face is relaxed, the mouth appears to be pulled up. Your cheek may appear bulky, and the eyes might squint.\n\n【9】##What Are The Common Symptoms Of Synkinesis?\n\n【10】Most patients who develop synkinesis believe that their muscles are weak, especially if they become too tight. Following are the characteristic symptoms you would notice during synkinesis.\n\n【11】Facial muscles on the affected side become tighter than the muscles on the good",

Slow, steady and balanced seems to win the race when it comes to weight control.\n\n【4】Unfortunately this isn't what most people want to hear. The four pounds per week and up to 15 pounds in the first two weeks that Atkins promises sounds much more impressive.\n\n【5】There are two things you really need to know about rapid weight loss:  What kind of weight was lost? How much of it was body fat and how much was water, glycogen and lean tissue?  Are you going to you keep the weight off for good?\n\n【6】Most low carbers won't keep the weight off for more than a year, and many will fall off the wagon long before that.\n\n【7】Keith Ayoob, a spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association, said in an official ADA statement about the  NEJM studies: \"Twelve months is an equalizer; you hit a wall. Your lifestyle starts to be affected and you get bored. A high dropout rate is a sign that extreme diets can be difficult to maintain.\n\n【8】Truth is, despite Dr. Atkin's claims and the new research apparently supporting them, we still don't know what will happen in the long run. Based on the results of the recent three, six, and twelve month studies, researchers have begun to organize longer trials. One of them will be five years in length.\n\n【9】What I believe you will see in long term studies is that Atkins and other low carb diets, while effective for weight loss in the short term, will be found no more effective for long term fat loss than any other restrictive diet (and that's NOT very effective).\n\n【10】##Lie #5: Calories Don’T Count And You Can Eat As Much As You Want While On The Atkins Diet.\n\n【11】Dr. Atkins proposed that calories don't count and he advised his clients to eat as much as they want while on his program. Atkins wrote, \"The so called calorie theory has been a millstone around the necks of dieters and a miserable and malign influence on their efforts to lose.\"\n\n【12】Here's the truth about calories and low carb diets:",

If protein formation can indeed occur, this result becomes even more exciting, because recent experiments by other investigators indicate that some proteins can self-replicate. In the earth's early history, perhaps a self-replicating protein formed on the face of a calcite crystal.\nLeft- and right-handed crystal faces occur in roughly equal numbers, so chiral selection of L amino acids probably did not happen everywhere in the world at suggest that the first successful set of selfreplicating molecules—the precursor to all the varied life-forms on the earth today— arose at a specific time and place. It was purely chance that the successful molecule developed on a crystal face that preferentially selected left-handed amino acids over their right-handed counterparts.\nMinerals undoubtedly could have acted as containers, scaffolds and templates that helped to select and organize the molecular menagerie of the primitive earth. But many of us in origins research suspect that minerals played much more active roles, catalyzing key synthesis steps that boosted the earth's early inventory of complex biological molecules.\n\n【1】##Getting A Jump On The Action\n\n【2】EXPERIMENTS LED  by Carnegie researcher Brandes in  illustrate this idea. Biological reactions require nitrogen in the form of ammonia, but the only common nitrogen compound thought to have been available on the primitive earth is nitrogen gas. Perhaps, Brandes thought, the environment at hydrothermal vents mimics an industrial process in which ammonia is synthesized by passing nitrogen and hydrogen over a hot metallic surface. Sure enough, when we subjected hydrogen, nitrogen and the iron oxide mineral magnetite to the pressures and temperatures characteristic of a seafloor vent, the mineral catalyzed the synthesis of ammonia [ see box on page  ].\nThe idea that minerals may have triggered life's first crucial steps has emerged most forcefully from the landmark theory of chemist Günter Wächtershäuser, a German patent lawyer with a deep interest in life's origins. In 1988 Wächtershäuser advanced a sweeping theory of organic evolution in which minerals—mostly iron and nickel sulfides that abound at deepsea hydrothermal vents—could have served as the template, the catalyst and the energy source that drove the formation of biological molecules. Indeed, he has argued that primitive living entities were molecular coatings that adhered to the positively charged surfaces of pyrite  , a mineral composed of iron and sulfur.\nThese entities, he further suggests, obtained energy from the chemical reactions that produce pyrite. This hypothesis makes sense in part because some metabolic enzymes—the molecules that help living cells process energy—have at their core a cluster of metal and sulfur atoms.\nFor much of the past three years,\nWächtershäuser's provocative theory has influenced our experiments at Carnegie.\nOur team, including geochemist George Cody and petrologist Hatten S. Yoder, has focused on the possibility that metabolism can proceed without enzymes in the presence of minerals—especially oxides and sulfides. Our simple strategy,",

Unfortunately, perfect oracles are hard to come by (the stock market comes to mind, again). This puzzle considers how to take advantage of the flaky oracles one is likely to find.\nYou have $100 to start with and  bets to make. Each bet turns on the result of a coin flip. The oracle will tell you which way the coin will fall but may lie on just one occasion and may do so after seeing your bet for that flip. You can find a counterparty who will give you even odds on any bet you make, so placing an x -dollar bet means he will return  x dollars to you if the oracle tells the truth about that flip and will pocket your bet if the oracle lies. How do you end up with the greatest possible final amount, no matter when the oracle chooses to lie?\nHere is a second problem: suppose you have to decide the amount of all your bets in advance without knowing when the oracle will lie. What should your bets be in that case, and what final amount can you be sure to get no matter when (and if) the oracle chooses to lie?\nJust one more thing: you lose everything if you plan to make a bet on a particular move but end up having too little money at that time.\nWarm-up for the first problem: Suppose there are three flips and at most one lie. You have $100. How much should you bet the first time? Given the outcome, how much should you bet the second and third times? The figure shows some good alternatives.\nE Answer to Last Month's Puzzle For a circle with a radius of 10 centimeters or more, any pattern of red and blue must satisfy the 10-centimeter bicoloration condition\n\n【3】If Q is red, then the line segment B-Q is 10 centimeters long and bicolored. If Q is blue, then the segment R-Q is 10 centimeters long and bicolored.\nEither way the pattern satisfies the 10-centimeter rule.",

Unfortunately, perfect oracles are hard to come by (the stock market comes to mind, again). This puzzle considers how to take advantage of the flaky oracles one is likely to find.\nYou have $100 to start with and 10 bets to make. Each bet turns on the result of a coin flip. The oracle will tell you which way the coin will fall but may lie on just one occasion and may do so after seeing your bet for that flip. You can find a counterparty who will give you even odds on any bet you make, so placing an x -dollar bet means he will return 2 x dollars to you if the oracle tells the truth about that flip and will pocket your bet if the oracle lies. How do you end up with the greatest possible final amount, no matter when the oracle chooses to lie?\nHere is a second problem: suppose you have to decide the amount of all your bets in advance without knowing when the oracle will lie. What should your bets be in that case, and what final amount can you be sure to get no matter when (and if) the oracle chooses to lie?\nJust one more thing: you lose everything if you plan to make a bet on a particular move but end up having too little money at that time.\nWarm-up for the first problem: Suppose there are three flips and at most one lie. You have $100. How much should you bet the first time? Given the outcome, how much should you bet the second and third times? The figure shows some good alternatives.\nE",

The extrusion is fast.\nThere is control and stability in anterior teeth extrusion.\n\n【2】4. Making a double helix loop will produce less root resorption, because the arch wire will be more flexible and the force is reduced. (Please refer to Space Closure in Orthodontics chapter).\n\n【3】##Disadvantages\n\n【4】1. It may cause pain to the patient.\n\n【5】2. The extrusive force can range from 800 g to 1000 g.\n3. Due to the excessive extrusion force root resorption may occur.\nMay cause gingival inflammation because of the loops.\n\n【6】5. Chair time increase.\nIf the bend is too marked and if it exerts too much force, we may debond the anterior braces.\n\n【7】##Recommendations\n\n【8】1. Preferably, they should be placed after we finished the alignment and leveling treatment phase.\n\n【9】2. Place 0.5 mm to 1 mm increments to the extrusive step in order to avoid pain and root resorption.\nAfter bite closure, leave the arch 2 to 4 months to stabilize and to lessen rebound.\nThe most recommended wire is the rectangular wire, because it controls torque better.\nLace with ligature (in a sectional manner) the anterior and posterior teeth.\n\n【10】##Second Order Or Individual Extrusion Bend\n\n【11】This bend can also be made on round or rectangular arch wire. These bends are designed for individual movements, not for in block movements. It is made with Tweed pliers or with intrusive and extrusive step",

You can also add green tea to your diet plan as it is known to protect the myelin sheath.\n\n【2】##Vitamin C\n\n【3】Vitamin C is one of the most potent natural immune system boosters, so get your hands on those juicy lemons and oranges. You can also try guava and grapefruits to ensure that your body gets an adequate supply of vitamin C. Surprisingly; generous intake of this vitamin also protects the myelin sheath as this nutrient is also a powerful anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidizing agent.\n\n【4】Vitamin A and D are valuable supports for your immune system. You can go for orange fruits and veggies such as papaya, carrots and oranges that are rich sources of vitamin A. Cod liver oil is another good source of vitamin A, D and essential fatty acids.\n\n【5】##Essential Fatty Acids\n\n【6】Your brain is composed of 60% fat, and you require good fats like fat omega-3 and omega-6 to maintain a healthy brain. Be sure you include rich sources of omega-6 in your diet such as chicken, fish, walnuts and extra virgin olive oil.\nBoth omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids help reduce nerve inflammation and improve electrical transmission.\n\n【7】##Fruits\n\n【8】Bananas are an excellent choice as they are packed with several nutrients like potassium. Citrus fruits, grapes and tropical fruits, not only are an ideal substitute for sweets and candies but are full of powerful immune boosters especially Vitamin C, which is essential for those suffering from Bell's palsy.\nEating a cup of blueberries daily can also alleviate symptoms of facial palsy as the berries have incredible anti-inflammatory and healing properties.\n\n【9】Here's another friendly reminder: Try to eat raw veggies and fresh fruits as they are loaded with vital nutrients. You also need to drink plenty of water as it is one of the best conductors of electrical impulses. Also try substituting sugary drinks and caffeine with plain water and try to drink at least 2 liters of water per day.",

Said in another way, every free body has a point known as mass center, therefore, every time that the line of action of a force passes through de mass center of a free body will suffer a translation movement.  A tooth in the mouth is not a free body because periodontal support tissue does not let it move freely. The center of resistance is equivalent to the mass center for free bodies.\nAny force that acts through the center of resistance of a tooth makes it translate in a bodily manner.  The center of resistance of a tooth depends on the length and morphology of the root, the number of roots and the level of support of the alveolar bone.  The center of resistance for a single root tooth with a normal level of alveolar bone is situated between the middle and cervical third part of the root, meanwhile in a multiple root tooth the center of resistance is located at one or two millimeters apical from the furcate.  Because braces can only be bonded on the crowns of teeth, there are very few opportunities in which it is possible to apply a force that can act through the center of resistance of the tooth to produce pure dental translation (excepting power arms.

One headline in the San Francisco Chronicle said that the battle between the low and high carbers had become so heated since mid 2002 that \"Knives had been drawn.\"\n\n【1】From my vantage point (as a health and fitness professional down in the trenches), it looks more like tanks, artillery and machine guns have been drawn! Tragically, the people being hurt the most by these \"diet wars\" are not the experts, but the dieters.\n\n【2】After its original publication in 1972, The Atkins Diet was regurgitated in 1992 as \"Dr. Atkins New Diet Revolution,\" creating a new surge of interest in low carbohydrate dieting. Then, in July of , the controversy reached an all time high when the New York Times Magazine published an essay by Gary Taubes titled, \"What if it's all been a big fat lie?\"  The article suggested that new research was now proving the late Dr. Atkins had been right all along.\n\n【3】More research in  seemed to corroborate the Taubes story: Two studies in the New England Journal of Medicine in May of , and another in June 2003 in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, suggested that Atkins was equally, if not more effective for weight loss than conventional diets – at least in the short term.\n\n【4】With the publication of this new information, Atkins supporters boasted, \"See, I told you so,\" while their opponents fired back in defense of their high carb, low fat positions. Meanwhile, low carb foods and supplements became all the rage, bread and pasta sales took a nosedive and the wheat industry cried the blues.\n\n【5】With differences in opinion as opposite as the North and South Poles, it's become unbearably confusing and frustrating to know which weight loss method is best and safest. At the date of this writing, in late 2003, obesity has reached an all time high −AGAIN!  According to the Journal of the American Medical Association, 64% of Americans are overweight and 31% are obese, and it's still getting worse.\n\n【6】Obviously, the popular weight loss methods today – including the low carb diet – are still missing something…but what?\n\n【7】If you're confused by the whole high carb, low carb thing and if you're frustrated with your attempts at trying to lose weight and keep it off, then this may be the most important report you will ever read. In the next few minutes, you'll discover the real truth about low carb diets and a real solution to the problem of excess body fat that is beautiful in its simplicity, yet powerful in effectiveness. Read on to learn the  Lies about the Atkins diet and the truth that will set you free...\n#10 Lies About The Atkins Diet\n\n【8】#And The Shocking Truth The Low Carb \"Gurus\"\nDon’T Want You To Know About",

Well done Coregg retainers can maintain teeth well aligned for many years.\n\n【4】5. Teeth tip and torque is maintained.\nIn block space closure is obtained.\nThese are excellent long term retainers.\nIt allows syndesmothomy.\nIt is a lasting retainer. i. It takes a long time to make.\n\n【5】##Disadvantages\n\n【6】2. It is not esthetic.\n\n【7】3. Absorbs foul odors.\n\n【8】4. With continuous use the acrylic changes color.\n\n【9】5. The acrylic can fracture under occlusion pressure.\nIf it is not well made it can provoke an open bite.\nUnadjusted loops can hurt the oral mucosa.\n\n【10】##Recommendations\n\n【11】1. To take off pull the loops by the distal side.\nThe occlusal acrylic must be 0.5 mm to 1 mm thick.\nThe premature contact points of the posterior zone must be eliminated in order to avoid an open bite and to obtain a balanced occlusion.\n\n【12】4. All the antagonist teeth must occlude on all the acrylic.\n\n【13】5. The loops must be placed as close as possible to the center of resistance of the teeth.\nThe loops must be activated each month with a three prong plier.\n\n【14】7. The retainer must be worn 24 hours a day. Except during meal time.\nAs long term retention, we recommend only night use.",

The technique may cause problems if it is carried out without adequate supervision.\n\n【2】It's important to keep in mind that the facial nerve is capable of recovering naturally. Therefore, therapists and medical experts give time for the nerve to heal without any intervention. Meanwhile, patients are encouraged to carry out facial massages tenderly that will assist blood circulation and maintain muscle health. At the start of the recovery phase, patients must try to focus more on massaging their face and protecting their eye. They can gently massage their face in a circular motion by using their fingers.\n\n【3】Once the facial nerve starts recovering, it begins to emit electrical signals in the facial muscles.\n\n【4】If the facial muscles are unable to regain their natural tone, patients can go ahead with electrical stimulation after consulting a certified healthcare professional.\n\n【5】As mentioned earlier, the technique has to be carried out very carefully. Failure to do so can result in overstimulation of the muscles. This can be a painful experience for patients since muscles become stiff and can twitch uncontrollably.\n\n【6】Electrical stimulation helps improve the contraction of muscles, which helps achieve facial symmetry.\n\n【7】##Biofeedback Therapy\n\n【8】Facial paralysis, at some point, causes a disruption in nerve signals sent to the facial muscles. When this confusion continues to exist, there are interruptions in the feedback sent to the brain about the affected side of the face. Since your mind is always busy, it ultimately forgets about the lack of communication on the affected side of the face. It only relies on the good side and you may notice that the facial muscles that remain unaffected slowly begin to dominate.\n\n【9】##What Is Biofeedback?\n\n【10】Bell's palsy rehabilitation via biofeedback is all about getting your entire face",

Also refers to the time when reproductive organs develop to allow reproduction.\n\n【2】Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs):\nInclude the measurement of lung volumes, spirometry, diffusion, and sometimes ABGs.\n\n【3】Pulmonary embolus: A clot, usually originating in the leg veins that becomes lodged in the lung circulation. The diagnosis of pulmonary embolus can be very difficult. Pulmonary embolus leads to a variety of symptoms which can include breathlessness and wheezing. A large or massive pulmonary embolus can be a cause of sudden death.\n\n【4】Pulmonary symptomatology:  Symptoms experienced by an individual and related to the lungs and to the act of breathing. Wheezing, cough, breathlessness, mucus production are examples of pulmonary symptomatology.\n\n【5】Pulmonologist: A physician specialist with extra training and qualifications in the diagnosis and treatment of the different lung diseases. Some pulmonologists are pediatric specialists, as well; such specialists are known as \"pediatric pulmonologists,\" Pediatric pulmonologists treat babies, children, and adolescents with lung diseases.\nThe other \"type\" of pulmonologist is an internist, who limits their practice to adults with respiratory conditions.\n\n【6】RAST: RAST is a laboratory allergy test that detects and measures the level of IgE antibodies directed against specific antigens in a blood sample. Measuring blood RAST is one way of assessing the possible presence of an allergy. If a person is suspected of being allergic to grass, for example, their doctor might send a blood sample for RAST testing.\nThe doctor would request a test that would detect significant levels of IgE directed against grasses. The absence of any detectable IgE to grasses would argue against a grass allergy. RAST is an abbreviation for \"RadioAllergoSorbentTest,\" a trademark of Pharmacia Diagnostics that originated and developed the first RAST test.\nRDA: Refer to the Recommended Dietary Allowance, guidelines established by the United States National Academy of Sciences' National Research Council. The RDAs advise what nutrients males and females should eat at different ages. In 1997,\nThe National Academy of Science'\nInstitute of Medicine report introduced the concept of Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) which have supplanted the RDAs.\nRemission: When used in a medical context, a remission refers to the subsiding of disease symptoms. A person with asthma who enters a period in which they experience no asthma symptoms has entered a period of asthma remission. The disease is still",

The book has a stock of more than 1,000 clinical photographs in which we explain \"different methods to do the same thing\" meaning that we point out many ways to close, open or uncross a bite. We include different molar distalizers, how to provide anchorage or how to close spaces; in this manner, multiple treatment options are shown for an identical problem, orthodontic or orthopedic in nature.\n\n【1】Our book consists of ten chapters, which we will describe briefly:\n\n【2】Chapter 1. Action and reaction. In an informative and straightforward approach we: .\n\n【3】Describe how and why teeth move orthodontically, and the effects at bone and dental levels.\nThe three laws of Newton and their clinical application during orthodontic treatment.\nA simple and easy description on how to understand the physics laws that we utilize in an orthodontic treatment. The use of forces, resultant forces, coplanar forces, center of resistance, center of rotation, moment, types of dental movements and their physiology, dental equilibrium and first, second and third order bends are clearly explained. . .\n\n【4】Chapter 2. Anchorage. In this chapter we examine the different types of anchorage utilized during orthodontic treatment, such as when to use minimal, moderate, maximum or absolute anchorage, their advantages, disadvantages and recommendations for each one.\n\n【5】Chapter 3. Space closure in orthodontics. We present a whole array of different modalities for dental space closure, from the classical elastic chain to the use of coils, wire bends and retroligatures. We also describe the forces produced by each of these additions, in the case they can be used, the advantages, disadvantages and recommendations of each one.\n\n【6】Chapter 4. Deep bite. Description of the different types of deep bites and their etiology, and the possible treatment plans for correction. We mention here why and how to use a bite plane, the use of bite ramps, bypass, why should braces be bonded near the incisal edge to help correct this problem, when to use an intrusion bend or a Tip back, how to use and how can reverse curves help us to correct a deep bite, the use of in-block intrusion arch wires like the intrusion arch of Dr. Oscar Quiroz, the utility arch wire, the CIA and intrusive arches with loops. All these additions have advantages, disadvantages and recommendations, which are clearly explained.\n\n【7】Chapter 5. Open bite. This is one of the most difficult types of malocclusions to treat because it has a high relapse rate. As in the deep bite chapter, we describe the different causes and the different types of open bite, and their possible treatments. We discuss how we use in block extrusion bends or in an individual manner, the benefits of palatal plates and the advantages of using reverse curves on the maxilla and a curve on the mandible in order to close an anterior open bite; why brace bonding near the gingival margin helps us, cases in which we can use an individual or In block By-pass, the use of an inverted",

Liquids are important because, once substances . are dissolved, their molecules can readily come together to react. But many substances prove to be hard, if not impossible, to dissolve.\nNow a growing number of chemists believe they have discovered the correct solution—ionic liquids, peculiar combinations of salts that are liquid at room temperature. These new solvents can be tailor-made to dissolve a variety of substances, including coal, crude oil, inks, plastics, DNA and even some rocks.\n\n【3】Kenneth R. Seddon, chair of inorganic chemistry at Queen's University Belfast in Northern Ireland, estimates that there are, in theory, more than a trillion different ionic liquids, millions of which are extremely stable (they remain liquid over a range of about 300 degrees Celsius) and nonvolatile (they can be used over and over). They may replace toxic, flammable and polluting volatile organic solvents, such as toluene, hexane and dichloromethane, for which the worldwide annual market is about $6 billion.\nChemists make ionic liquids by combining large organic positive ions—with unfriendly names such as 1-ethyl-3-methyl imidazolium [emim]+—and smaller inorganic negative ions, like aluminum tetrachloride.\nThis combination of large and small ions is very different from most ionic salts, such as table salt (NaCl).\nTable salt is a solid at room temperature because positively charged sodium clings to negatively charged chlorine; thus stuck, the ions stack up to form a regular lattice. But in ionic liquids, the positive charge is less focused: because the positive ions are large, the total charge is smeared out across several atoms. In addition, the big, irregular shapes don't form crystal structures at room temperature. \"It's like trying to stack bananas instead of oranges. Bananas just don't stack well,\" comments chemist James H. Davis, Jr., of the University of South Alabama. Unable to crystallize, the substance remains a liquid.\nServing as a new kind of solvent, however, may be just the start. \"This feels like a revolution in the making,\" says Robert B. Morland, an organic chemist at BP Amoco Chemicals in Naperville, Ill. He predicts that ionic liquids will revolutionize the use of catalysts in industrial chemistry. This is because, for a particular reaction, chemists can make an ionic liquid with the right positive and negative charge combination to dissolve the catalyst and the chemicals involved in a reaction; the liquid, however, does not affect the product of the reaction. The catalyst stays in the ionic liquid to be reused, and the product may even rise to the surface, where it can be skimmed off, he says. The French Petroleum Institute is getting ready to license for commercial use a dimer manufacturing process that exploits these very properties, according to Davis.\nDespite chemists' enthusiasm  ,  \" for industry to adopt ionic liquids there will have to be a unique advantage. It's not enough to be a bit more green,\" cautions Robin D. Rogers, director of the Center for Green Manufacturing at the University of Alabama. Expense is a major hurdle: right now a pound of ionic liquid costs about $4,000 to $5,000. The amount could drop to about $200 a pound, depending on composition and quantity, Morland says. But it is still pricey compared with organic solvents—per pound, acetone sells for about $0.15 and toluene about $0.10. Of course, because ionic liquids can be recycled, a few tons would replace many tons of organic solvent.\nToxicity and environmental tests also need to be conducted, Seddon says. Initial animal test results look good, but the generous bounty of possible ionic liquids creates a catch-22 situation, points out Albert Robertson, a senior chemist with specialty chemical maker Cytec Canada. Toxicity tests cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, so manufacturers are playing a waiting game, unwilling to start testing until they are certain they have the right ionic liquid. But proponents say the hurdles will just slow down the inevitable.\nSeddon and Rogers believe that major applications are some seven to 10 years away. A small-scale industrial application could emerge much sooner, in less than three years.\n\n【4】Rebecca Renner is a geologist turned science writer based in Williamsport, Pa.\n\n【5】IONIC CRYSTAL called 1-octadecyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, as seen through polarizing filters. Textures result from the molecular formation of hydrocarbon- and ion-rich regions.\n\n【6】##Breaking\nSolution Rules\n\n【7】Substances dissolve when their molecules are similar to the molecules of the solvent, a fact embodied in the chemist's rule of thumb that \"like dissolves like.\" In other words, covalent molecules, which have no overall electric charge—substances that include fat, oil and many organic compounds—dissolve in covalent volatile organic solvents.\nBut they don't dissolve in water, which is slightly charged. In contrast, ionic solids, which consist of positively and negatively charged ions, dissolve readily in water. Ionic liquids break the solution rules: they manage to dissolve organic covalent molecules. Chemists don't understand why.",

Bananas just don't stack well,\" comments chemist James H. Davis, Jr., of the University of South Alabama. Unable to crystallize, the substance remains a liquid.\n\nServing as a new kind of solvent, however, may be just the start. \"This feels like a revolution in the making,\" says Robert B. Morland, an organic chemist at BP Amoco Chemicals in Naperville, Ill. He predicts that ionic liquids will revolutionize the use of catalysts",

A recommendation with Level of Evidence B or C does not imply that the recommendation is weak.\nMany important clinical questions addressed in the guidelines do not lend themselves to clinical trials. Even though randomized trials are not available, there may be a very clear clinical consensus that a particular test or therapy is useful or effective.\n\n【2】In 2003, the ACCF/AHA Task Force on Practice Guidelines developed a list of suggested phrases to use when writing recommendations. All guideline recommendations have been written in full sentences that express a complete thought, such that a recommendation, even if separated and presented apart from the rest of the document (including headings above sets of recommendations), would still convey the full intent of the recommendation. It is hoped that this will increase readers' comprehension of the guidelines and will allow queries at the individual recommendation level. agreed on common treatment recommendations, those recommendations were included with the Consensus on Science statements.\n\n【3】##Development Of The Aha Guidelines\n\n【4】##Aha Writing Groups\n\n【5】In 2009 the chairs and writing group members for each chapter of the  AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC were nominated and required to complete an AHA conflict of interest disclosure that was reviewed by AHA staff and the AHA officers. Writing group chairs and most of the writing group members were required to be free of relevant conflicts of interest.\nAfter the  Consensus Conference, seventeen AHA writing groups developed the  AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC based on the ILCOR Consensus on Science state- ments, citations, and treatment recommendations. In essence, the 2010 ILCOR International Consensus on CPR and ECC\nScience With Treatment Recommendations summarizes what is known in each subject area. The ILCOR Treatment Recommendations present the evidence-supported treatment approach for each problem. The  AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC expand on the details of how and when to provide treatment, and they address the training requirements for treatment providers. Other resuscitation councils around the world performed a similar process to develop their versions of the  guidelines.\nIn developing these guidelines, the writing groups used a recommendation system consistent with that used by the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association (ACCF/AHA) collaboration on evidence-based guidelines .These classes represent the inte-",

The company said I'd get even better speeds if I had a Universal Serial Bus on my laptop.\n\n【4】Now I was ready to give Ricochet a road test. I tucked the laptop under my arm, left the office and hailed a taxi. The modem is designed to work in cars and trains moving up to 70 miles per hour, but this was impossible to confirm in New York traffic. Traveling at half that speed through Manhattan's Upper West Side, I got a connection of  kbps. I have to admit, it was exhilarating to be checking stock quotes while cruising down Columbus Avenue. I scrolled through a financial news Web site and learned that the Nasdaq index was falling again. I read an article about the woes of the semiconductor industry, then hopped over to a stock-trading Web site. But then I asked myself, What good is this? Am I really going to start trading stocks from the backseat of a cab? Who am I kidding?\nUltimately, the value of a wireless connection depends on how much you use it. If you want nonstop Internet access for buying stocks, sending e-mail, reading the news or booking airline reservations, then Ricochet may be for you. The modem may also come in handy if you travel frequently. But if you're a homebody and a schlemiel like me, you may not find the system very useful.\n\n【5】20 Mark Alpert is a member of Scientific American's board of editors .\n\n【6】UDIO FARNIN the language source Our 29th year  Broad St Guilford,C  U.S.A.",

Here, we've cleared three of the most common myths about this condition. Remember, it's important that we clear up inaccuracies about Bell's palsy to make a better effort at understanding the problem and helping others learn about it.\n\n【3】##Bell’S Palsy Myth #1\n\n【4】Every case of facial paralysis must be Bell’s palsy Fact:\n\n【5】If you recall the section on Bell's palsy causes and symptoms, we've seen that many other conditions such as stroke, tumor, Lyme disease and congenital birth defects can also cause facial paralysis.\n\n【6】So the doctor will tell the patient they have Bell's palsy when facial paralysis or muscle weakness occurs because of an unknown cause.\n\n【7】##Bell’S Palsy Myth #2\n\n【8】Influenza immunization can trigger Bell’s palsy\n\n【9】##Fact:\n\n【10】There is no scientific evidence that the flu vaccine triggers Bell's palsy.\nHowever, some individuals claim that Bell's palsy was caused after flu vaccination in their case. Medical experts suggest that flu vaccination might trigger antibodies that attack normal cells. The 7th cranial nerve may also be affected, which then causes facial paralysis. Research is underway to see if this is actually the cause.\n\n【11】##Bell’S Palsy Myth #3\n\n【12】All Bell's palsy patients are infected by the herpes simplex virus.\n\n【13】Fact:",

Cigarette smoking is a significant risk factor for the development of emphysema.\n\n【2】Endogenous steroids: Steroids normally produced in health by the body's adrenal glands. See Corticosteroids.\n\n【3】Endotracheal intubation: Refers to the procedure in which a specialized breathing tube is placed into the trachea through the mouth or the nasal passages to allow airway support and the administration of extra oxygen.\nEndotracheal intubation can be life saving in cases of respiratory failure. It is also performed for major surgery, typically in the operating room when a person is to receive general anesthesia.\nEosiniphilic pneumonia: a rare type of lung disease characterized by breathlessness, and elevated eosinophil counts like asthma, but with abnormal X-ray studies, unlike asthma.\n\n【4】Epidemiological: Based on the study of populations or of large groups of people.\n\n【5】Exacerbation: A flare of disease activity or of disease symptoms. An exacerbation of asthma can be caused by a viral infection, for example, and would lead to increased symptoms of cough, mucus, chest tightness and wheezing.\n\n【6】Expiration: The action of breathing air out of your lungs, called exhaling.\n\n【7】The respiratory cycle has two parts: inspiration and expiration.\n\n【8】Expiratory: Breathing out.\n\n【9】Family practitioner: A type of physician specialized in the treatment of persons of all ages. May be qualified to perform minor surgical procedures, set fractures, and deliver babies in addition to providing medical care and prescribing medicines.\n\n【10】Flexible bronchoscopy: A type of bronchoscopy  performed on a with a specialized fiberoptic instrument called a flexible bronchoscope.\n\n【11】Gas exchange: Refers to the process by which O  and CO  enter and leave the body, via the lungs' alveolar capillary membrane.\n\n【12】GERD: An acronym for Gastro- Esophageal Reflux Disease. GERD is a condition that, when present, may lead to abdominal symptoms and heartburn, and may also significantly worsen underlying asthma.\nGERD, or more simply \"reflux,\" is usually treated with a combination of dietary changes and medicine.\n\n【13】Gestation: Another word for pregnancy, gestation is derived from the Latin verb gestare , which means \"to carry.\"\n\n【14】HEPA filter: Stands for High Efficiency Particulate Air. HEPA filters are air filters that meet very stringent filtration requirements. They are capable of trapping particles of very small size, including common indoor allergens, and even certain microorganisms that pose a risk to human",

The chin cup serves as geniomolar anchorage to facilitate the forward movement of the maxilla. The direction of the elastics must be downward and forward, from the upper protraction hooks to the horizontal rod of the protraction arch, following the normal path of maxillary growth.\n\n【1】##Advantages\n\n【2】##1. It Is Economic.\n\n【3】2. Easy to make.\n\n【4】3. It is more esthetic than a face mask so it is more likely to be used by the patient.\nCorrects the malocclusion and has a positive effect upon the profile on the patient.\nProduces consistent results in a brief time period.\nProduces between 2 mm to 3 mm of protraction.\nThe Mini-maxillar protractor is an effective tool for the correction of mild to moderate skeletal Class III malocclusions, with a retrusive maxilla and a hypo divergent growth pattern.\nThe use of the Mini-maxillar protractor produces an increase of the lower third of the face, this is due to the downward movement of the maxilla and a downward and backward rotation of the mandible.\nIt reduces the possibility of a future surgical procedure.\n\n【5】10. In general, skeletal Class III patients present a concave profile, depression of the nasomaxillar region, lower lip protrusion and a prominent mandible. With the protraction effect of the appliance the facial profile and the position of the lower lip is rectified.\nClinically the anterior crossed bites can be corrected in 3 to 4 months of treatment , depending on the severity of the case.\nThe maxilla can be brought forward 2 mm to 4 mm in about 8 to 12 months of protraction, but the majority of orthopedic changes will be observed in the first 3 to 6 months of continuous treatment.  )\n\n【6】##Disadvantages\n\n【7】A faulty design of the chin cup can irritate the skin of the chin and root resoption of the lower incisors.\nThe expander can accumulate food particles and cause gingival irritation.\nWe must invest laboratory time to fabricate the appliance.\n\n【8】4. The force produced by the elastics can debond the upper skidding surface.\nWe need 100 % cooperation of the patient.\nThe elastics can irritate the skin of the chin and the corners of the mouth.\n\n【9】7. The patient can refer sharp pain in the retromolar zone because the pterygo-maxillary suture opens.\n\n【10】##Recommendations\n\n【11】1. Following the maxillary protraction protocol, we must begin with the upper expansion in order to disarticulate the sutures and to facilitate the advance of the maxilla, so we must indicate to the patient that",

The \"wheezy chest\" is not an early manifestation of asthma.\n\n【1】Infants who exhibit the second, allergic, pattern also wheeze when infected with an acute upper respiratory virus. But because they fall into the allergic wheezing category, they are more likely to have \"real\" asthma that continues throughout childhood. They are also more likely to have diagnosed allergies such as rhinitis, eczema, or food allergies. Their airways will also grow larger as they become toddlers, but the wheezing persists. They have asthma, not a narrowed, \"immature\" airway as a cause of wheezing in infancy during upper respiratory viral infections.\n\n【2】##94.

During her early years, my daughter's allergies and asthma symptoms were repeatedly overlooked by the busy pediatricians who saw her only for a few overbooked minutes in a crowded office full of crying babies and frazzled moms.\n\n【4】You should take your child to an asthma specialist if your child's asthma is active for most days, if there are frequent night-time asthma symptoms that interfere",

As noted above, successful treatment with β  -agonists may cause an initial decrease in oxygen saturation because the resultant bronchodilation can initially increase the ventilation-perfusion mismatch.\n\n【2】##Inhaled Β 2 -Agonists\n\n【3】Short-acting β -agonists provide rapid, dose-dependent bronchodilation with minimal side effects. Because the dose delivered depends on the patient's lung volume and inspiratory flow rate, the same dose can be used in most patients regardless of age or size. Studies have shown no difference in the effects of continuous versus intermittent administration of nebulized albuterol  ; however, continuous administration was more effective in a subset of patients with severe exacerbations of asthma.A Cochrane meta-analysis showed no overall difference between the effects of albuterol delivered by metered-dose inhaler spacer or nebulizer.If prior use of a metered-dose inhaler has not been effective, use of a nebulizer is reasonable.\nAlthough albuterol is sometimes administered intravenously (IV) in severe asthma, a systematic review of  clinical trials found that IV β  -agonists, administered by either bolus or infusion, did not lead to significant improvements in any clinical outcome measure.Levalbuterol is the R-isomer of albuterol. Comparisons with albuterol have produced mixed results, with some studies showing a slightly improved bronchodilator effect in the treatment of acute asthma in the ED.There is no evidence that levalbuterol should be favored over albuterol.\nOne of the most common adjuncts used with β -agonist treatment, particularly in the first hours of treatment, include anticholinergic agents . When combined with short-acting β -agonists, anticholinergic agents such as ipratropium can produce a clinically modest improvement in lung function compared with short-acting β -agonists alone.\n\n【4】##Corticosteroids\n\n【5】Systemic corticosteroids are the only treatment for the inflammatory component of asthma proven to be effective for acute asthma exacerbations. Because the antiinflammatory effects after administration may not be apparent for 6 to 12 hours, corticosteroids should be administered early. The early use of systemic steroids hastens the resolution of airflow obstruction and may reduce admission to the hospital.Although there may be no difference in clinical effects between oral and IV formulations of corticosteroids,  the IV route is preferable in patients with severe asthma. In adults a typical initial dose of methylprednisolone is  mg (dose range: 40 mg to 250 mg); a typical dose of dexamethasone is 10 mg.\n\n【6】##Adjunctive Therapies\n\n【7】##Anticholinergics\n\n【8】Ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic bronchodilator pharmacologically related to atropine. The nebulizer dose is  mcg.  Ipratropium bromide has a slow onset of action (approximately 20 minutes), with peak effectiveness at 60 to 90 minutes and no systemic side effects. The drug is typically given only once because of its prolonged onset of action, but some studies have shown that repeat doses of  mcg or  mcg every 20 minutes may be beneficial.A recent meta-analysis indicated a reduced number of hospital admissions associated with treatment with ipratropium bromide, particularly in patients with severe exacerbations.\n\n【9】##Magnesium Sulfate\n\n【10】When combined with nebulized β -adrenergic agents and corticosteroids, IV magnesium sulfate can moderately improve pulmonary function in patients with asthma.Magnesium causes relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle independent of serum magnesium level, with only minor side effects (flushing, lightheadedness). A Cochrane meta-analysis of  studies concluded that IV magnesium sulfate improves pulmonary function and reduces hospital admissions, particularly for patients with the most severe exacerbations of asthma.The use of nebulized magnesium sulfate as an adjunct to nebulized β -adrenergic agents has been reported in a small case series to improve FEV and Spo 2 , 21 although a prior meta-analysis demonstrated only a trend toward improved pulmonary function with nebulized magnesium.For those with severe refractory asthma, providers may consider IV magnesium at the standard adult dose of 2 g administered over 20 minutes.\n\n【11】##Epinephrine Or Terbutaline\n\n【12】Epinephrine and terbutaline are adrenergic agents that can be given subcutaneously to patients with acute severe asthma. The dose of subcutaneous epinephrine (concentration :) is 0.01 mg/kg, divided into 3 doses of approximately 0.3 mg administered at 20-minute intervals. Although the nonselective adrenergic properties of epinephrine may cause an increase in heart rate, myocardial irritability, and increased oxygen demand, its use is well-tolerated, even in patients > 35 years of age.Terbutaline is given in a subcutaneous dose of 0.25 mg, which can be repeated every 20 minutes for 3 doses. There is no evidence that subcutaneous epinephrine or terbutaline has advantages over inhaled β  -agonists. Epinephrine has been administered IV (initiated at  mcg/min to  mcg/min continuous infusion) in severe asthma; however,  retrospective investigation indicated a 4% incidence of serious side effects. There is no evidence of improved outcomes with IV epinephrine compared with selective inhaled β  -agonists.\n\n【13】##Ketamine\n\n【14】Ketamine is a parenteral, dissociative anesthetic with bronchodilatory properties that also can stimulate copious bronchial secretions. One case series  suggested substantial efficacy, whereas  published randomized trials in childrenfound no benefit of ketamine when compared with standard care. Ketamine has sedative and analgesic properties that may be useful if intubation is planned.\n\n【15】##Heliox\n\n【16】Heliox is a mixture of helium and oxygen (usually a : helium to oxygen ratio mix) that is less viscous than ambient air.\nHeliox has been shown to improve the delivery and deposition of nebulized albuterol  ; however, a recent meta-analysis of clinical trials did not support its use as initial treatment for",

In order to obtain more stability during bonding, we can pour some acrylic on the occlusal surfaces of the premolars and the molars, this way we will obtain a occlusal guide that will help us bond the retainer.\n\n【1】4. Then we place the wire and the acrylic in the mouth and we bond the retainer. If we want a stronger bond we can sand blast the areas of the wire that are going to be covered with the dabs of resin.\n\n【2】Upper fixed retainers are not as frequently used as lower ones, because they are prone to fracture because of the occlusal contact. But in some adult cases they are essential if we want to assure good retention.\n\n【3】Some patients present persistent spacing (especially in the midline) or other movements of the upper incisors.\nIn these cases, the advantages of the upper fixed retainers surpass the risk of fracture. Before placing them we must evaluate the overbite and overjet of the patient. We must be careful not placing the wire near the incisal contact area. We can use twisted wire or preformed bars from central incisor to central incisor (1 to 1) and it is placed",

False-positive readings (ie, CO  is detected but the tube is located in the esophagus) have been observed in animals after ingestion of large amounts of carbonated liquids before the arrest; however, the waveform does not continue during subsequent breaths.False-negative readings (defined in this context as failure to detect CO  despite tube placement in the trachea) may be present during cardiac arrest for several reasons. The most common is that blood flow and delivery of CO  to the lungs is low. False-negative results also have been reported in association with pulmonary embolus because pulmonary blood flow and delivery of CO  to the lungs are reduced. If the detector is contaminated with gastric contents or acidic drugs (eg, endotracheally administered epinephrine), a colorimetric device may display a constant color rather than breath-to-breath color change. In addition, elimination and detection of CO  can be drastically reduced with severe airway obstruction (eg, status asthmaticus) and pulmonary edema.  For these reasons, if CO  is not detected, we recommend that a second method be used to confirm endotracheal tube placement, such as direct visualization or the esophageal detector device.\nUse of CO  -detecting devices to determine the correct placement of other advanced airways (eg, Combitube, laryngeal mask airway) has not been studied; their utility will depend on airway design. However, effective ventilation through a supraglottic airway device should result in capnograph waveform during CPR and after ROSC.\nEsophageal Detector Devices.  The EDD consists of a bulb that is compressed and attached to the endotracheal tube. If the tube is in the esophagus (positive result for an EDD), the suction created by the EDD will collapse the lumen of the esophagus or pull the esophageal tissue against the tip of the tube, and the bulb will not re-expand. The EDD may also consist of a syringe that is attached to the endotracheal tube; the provider attempts to pull the barrel of the syringe. If the tube is in the esophagus, it will not be possible to pull the barrel (aspirate air) with the syringe.\nHowever, studies of the syringe aspiration EDD and the self-inflating bulb EDD  indicate that the accuracy of these devices does not exceed that of auscultation and direct visualization for confirming the tracheal position of an endotracheal tube in victims of cardiac arrest. Given the simplicity of the EDD, it can be used as the initial method for confirming correct tube placement in addition to clinical assessment in the victim of cardiac arrest when waveform capnography is not available (Class IIa, LOE B).\n\n【1】The EDD may yield misleading results in patients with morbid obesity, late pregnancy, or status asthmaticus, or when there are copious endotracheal secretions,  because the trachea tends to collapse in the presence of these conditions. There is no evidence that the EDD is accurate for the continued monitoring of endotracheal tube placement.\n\n【2】Thoracic Impedance. Transthoracic impedance is slightly but significantly higher during inspiration than during exhalation.Air is a poor electric conductor. Preliminary studies suggest that changes in thoracic impedance, as measured through standard defibrillation pads, may distinguish tracheal from esophageal intubations.There are  published reports involving  patients where ventilation-induced changes in thoracic impedance disappeared after esophageal intubation.There is little evidence for the use of thoracic impedance in diagnosing adequacy of ventilation during CPR.  Treatment decisions should not be based solely on thoracic impedance measurements until further study has confirmed its utility and accuracy in this population.\n\n【3】Postintubation Airway Management After inserting and confirming correct placement of an endotracheal tube, the provider should record the depth of the tube as marked at the front teeth or gums and secure it.\nThere is significant potential for endotracheal tube movement with head flexion and extension  and when the patient is moved from one location to another.\nContinuous monitoring of endotracheal tube placement with waveform capnography is recommended as discussed above. The endotracheal tube should be secured with tape or a commercial device (Class I, LOE C). Devices and tape should be applied in a manner that avoids compression of the front and sides of the neck, which may impair venous return from the brain.\nOne out-of-hospital study  studies in an intensivecare settingindicate that backboards, commercial devices for securing the endotracheal tube, and other strategies provide equivalent methods for preventing inadvertent tube displacement when compared with traditional methods of securing the tube (tape). These devices may be considered during patient transport (Class IIb, LOE C). After tube confirmation and fixation, obtain a chest x-ray (when feasible) to confirm that the end of the endotracheal tube is properly positioned above the carina.\n\n【4】##Ventilation After Advanced Airway Placement\n\n【5】Except for respiratory rate, it is unknown whether monitoring ventilatory parameters (eg, minute ventilation, peak pressure) during CPR will influence outcome. However, positivepressure ventilation increases intrathoracic pressure and may reduce venous return and cardiac output, especially in patients with hypovolemia or obstructive airway disease. Ventilation at high respiratory rates (> 25 breaths per minute) is common during resuscitation from cardiac arrest.  In animal models, slower ventilation rates (6 to 12 breaths per minute) are associated with improved hemodynamic parameters and short-term survival.\nBecause cardiac output is lower than normal during cardiac arrest, the need for ventilation is reduced. Following placement of an advanced airway, the provider delivering ventilations should perform  breath every 6 to 8 seconds (8 to 10 breaths per minute) without pausing in applying chest compressions (unless ventilation is inadequate when compressions are not paused) (Class IIb, LOE C). Monitoring respiratory rate coupled with real-time feedback during CPR may result in better compliance with ventilation guidelines.",

Another way to obtain an asymmetrical force is cutting a piece of wire of an external arm. This is sectioned at the first molar level. On the side that has been cut we will have less force, so the contra lateral side (the side that has not been cut) will exert almost triple the force compared to the side in which wire of the external arm was cut off.",

This disjunction consists in surgically disarticulating the upper maxilla with a series of osteotomies; after this is preformed a Hyrax expansion screw is placed. The osteotomies are done on the lateral walls of the maxilla, and on the medial palatine suture, then the Hyrax screw with 4 turns is placed.  Once the osteotomy is done, we indicate two activations twice a day to the patient until the posterior cross bite is completely uncrossed.\n\n【4】Surgical assisted expansion produces very stable results in patients that are no longer growing up.\n\n【5】##Advantages",

I felt uncomfortable, and, therefore, avoided getting photographs taken since I had trouble controlling my facial expressions.\n\n【1】It might seem bizarre to you, but not all people want to befriend a person with a collapsed face. The impact Bell's palsy has on a person's self-confidence, and self-esteem is undoubtedly devastating. With this condition, you always stand out from the crowd, and many people don't fully understand it, which is why they may try to avoid it or you altogether.\n\n【2】Because I grew up with the condition, I want others with the same ailment to know that there is light at the end of the tunnel. There is no need to feel isolated because I'll teach you how to cope with Bell's palsy, from understanding the condition, to managing and treating  it, and knowing how to act and react around others.\n\n【3】Don’t be saddened by any negative comments thrown your way. Remember, you can still stand strong without the validation of others. It is comforting to know that people who suffer from Bell's palsy can completely recover from the condition. This means they can fully control their facial expressions again.\nHowever, there's a lot to learn about this ailment before making an effort to cure it or deal with it. So let's get going and develop a clearer picture about the causes, symptoms, treatment and management of Bell's palsy.",

Fortunately, he recovered from the condition within a year. However, while recalling his time with the condition; the actor described it as the worst time of his life.\n\n【3】His schoolmates laughed at and mocked him. It was devastating as his left eye closed and he also faced difficulty eating and drinking properly. He got the nickname 'Frankenstein' during this period because of his face. But his experience with this condition made him stronger.\n\n【4】##Pierce Brosnan\n\n【5】Famous for his dapper good looks and his role in the 'James Bond' film franchise, the Irish actor Pierce Brosnan had to battle Bell's palsy as well. He fell victim to the condition in 1984.\n\n【6】Facial paralysis occurred in the dressing room just before his appearance on an American show, namely the 'Tonight Show'. He failed to close one of his eyes and felt his face go numb, but the actor recovered from the condition within a few months.\n\n【7】##Sylvester Stallone:\n\n【8】One of the greatest action stars of all times and best known for portraying Rocky, Sylvester Stallone is also a sufferer of Bell's palsy since birth. The condition was caused due to birth complications resulting in facial disfigurement and slurred speech. However, Stallone is an inspiration as he not only overcame his adversity, but also achieved greatness.\n\n【9】The use of forceps at birth had injured his nerve, paralyzing the lower left half of his face. However, this action hero used this to his advantage and today he is distinguished for his snarling look that has become his trademark.\n\n【10】##Roseanne Barr\n\n【11】#Facing The Camera",

Lung function testing in mild persistent asthma will demonstrate FEV  and peak flow values greater than or equal to 80% of predicted, and peak flow variability between 20 and 30% from prior personal best values.\n\n【1】All patients with asthma (of any severity) should be prescribed inhaled, \"quick-relief\" bronchodilator therapy to be used when and if symptoms develop, on an asneeded basis. A short-acting, inhaled β  agonist is the recommended quick-relief agent for older children and adults. Very young children and infants might instead be placed on a short-acting β  agonist medication taken by mouth (orally) in liquid or syrup form as an alternative, especially if inhalation of medication is unfeasible.\n\n【2】\"Step 2\" medical therapy is advocated in the treatment of mild persistent asthma. \"Step 2\" requires the use of daily \"controller\" medication prescribed in addition to the quick-relief, short-acting β  agonist medication used as needed. Inhaled, low-dose corticosteroids are the preferred daily \"controller\" medicine in mild persistent asthma. A number of alternate \"controller\" maintenance medicines can be prescribed for daily use in \"Step 2\" therapy and considered on an individual basis. They include, in alphabetical order, cromolyn, leukotriene modifiers, nedocromil, and sustainedrelease theophylline. Consultation with an asthma specialist should be considered for infants and children younger than 5 years of age, and can also be considered for older children and adults who require alternative treatment. It is important to remember that inhaled, low-dose corticosteroids are first-line, Step 2 treatment because they specifically target the inflammatory response that characterizes mild persistent asthma.",

The emphasis is on the concept of well-controlled asthma.\nThe goals of asthma treatment in pregnancy parallel those of asthma treatment in general. Compliance with prescribed medication is emphasized along with peak flow (PEF) monitoring. Avoidance of known asthma triggers is encouraged as much as possible. Influenza vaccination is recommended for women who have no contraindication to the vaccine, and who will be in their third trimester of pregnancy during the fall and winter influenza season.

The townspeople are skeptical at first but soon bring small offerings: a head of cabbage, a bunch of carrots, a bit of beef. In the end, the cauldron is filled with enough hearty soup to feed everyone. The moral: cooperation can produce significant achievements, even from meager, seemingly insignificant contributions.\n\n【1】Researchers are now using a similar cooperative strategy to build supercomputers, the powerful machines that can perform billions of calculations in a second. Most conventional supercomputers employ parallel processing: they contain arrays of ultrafast microprocessors that work in tandem to solve complex problems such as forecasting the weather or simulating a nuclear explosion. Made by IBM, Cray and other computer vendors, the machines typically cost tens of millions of dollars—far too much for a research team with a modest budget. So over the past few years, scientists at national laboratories and universities have learned how to construct their own supercomputers by linking inexpensive PCs and writing software that allows these ordinary computers to tackle extraordinary problems.\nIn 1996 two of us (Hargrove and Hoffman) encountered such a problem in our work at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Tennessee. We were trying to draw a national map of ecoregions, which are defined by environmental conditions: all areas with the same climate, landforms and soil characteristics fall into the same ecoregion. To create a high-resolution map of the continental U.S., we divided the country into  million square cells, each with an area of one square kilometer. For each cell we had to consider as many as 25 variables, ranging from average monthly precipitation to the nitrogen content of the soil. A single PC or workstation could not accomplish the task. We needed a parallel-processing supercomputer—and one that we could afford!\nOur solution was to construct a com- puting cluster using obsolete PCs that ORNL would have otherwise discarded.\nDubbed the Stone SouperComputer because it was built essentially at no cost, our cluster of PCs was powerful enough to produce ecoregion maps of unprecedented detail. Other research groups have devised even more capable clusters that rival the performance of the world's best supercomputers at a mere fraction of their cost. This advantageous price-toperformance ratio has already attracted the attention of some corporations, which plan to use the clusters for such complex tasks as deciphering the human genome. In fact, the cluster concept\n\n【2】##A Computing Cluster\n\n【3】The Stone SouperComputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory consists of more than 130 PCs linked in a computing cluster. One of the machines serves as the front-end node for the cluster; it has two Ethernet cards, one for communicating with users and outside networks, and the other for talking with the rest of the nodes in the cluster. The system solves problems through promises to revolutionize the computing field by offering tremendous processing power to any research group, school or business that wants it.\n\n【4】##Beowulf And Grendel\n\n【5】THE NOTION OF LINKING COMPUT- ers together is not new. In the 1950s and 1960s the U.S. Air Force established a network of vacuum-tube computers called SAGE to guard against a Soviet nuclear attack. In the mid-1980s Digital Equipment Corporation coined the term \"cluster\" when it integrated its mid-range VAX minicomputers into larger systems.\nNetworks of workstations—generally",

In light of this uncertainty, all pediatric and adult patients who suffer cardiac arrest in the hospital setting should have resuscitative attempts initiated unless the patient has a valid DNAR order or has objective signs of irreversible death (eg, dependent lividity).\n\n【2】##Dnar Orders In Ihca\n\n【3】Unlike other medical interventions, CPR is initiated without a physician's order, based on implied consent for emergency treatment. A licensed physician's order is necessary to withhold CPR in the hospital setting. Physicians should initiate a discussion about the use of CPR with all patients admitted for medical and surgical care or with their surrogates. Terminally ill patients may fear abandonment and pain more than death, so physicians should also reassure the patient and family that control of pain and other symptoms as well as other aspects of support will continue even if resuscitation is withheld.\nThe attending physician should write the DNAR order in accordance with local policy in the patient's chart, with a note explaining the rationale for the DNAR order, other specific limitations of care, and documenting discussions with the patient, surrogate, and family. Oral DNAR orders are not acceptable. The limitation-of-treatment order should provide explicit instructions for specific emergency interventions that may arise, including the use of vasopressor agents, mechanical ventilation, blood products, or antibiotics. The scope of a DNAR order should specify which interventions are to be withheld.\nIt is important to emphasize that all other care should be administered without delay and as appropriate for all patients. A DNAR order does not automatically preclude interventions such as administration of parenteral fluids, nutrition, oxygen, analgesia, sedation, antiarrhythmics, or vasopressors, unless these are included in the order. Some patients may choose to accept defibrillation and chest compressions but not intubation and mechanical ventilation. DNAR orders carry no implications about other forms of treatment, and other aspects of the treatment plan should be documented separately and communicated to members of the healthcare team. DNAR orders should be reviewed periodically as per local protocol, particularly if the patient's condition changes.DNAR orders should also be reviewed before surgery by the anesthesiologist, attending surgeon, and patient or surrogate to determine their applicability in the operating suite and during the immediate postoperative recovery period.\n\n【4】##Terminating Resuscitative Efforts In Ihca\n\n【5】##Terminating Cardiac Arrest Resuscitative Efforts In Neonatal Ihca\n\n【6】Noninitiation of resuscitation and discontinuation of lifesustaining treatment during or after resuscitation are ethically equivalent, and clinicians should not hesitate to withdraw support when functional survival is highly unlikely.The following guidelines must be interpreted according to current regional outcomes.In a newly bom infant with no detectable heart rate, it is appropriate to consider stopping resuscitation if the heart rate remains undetectable for 10 minutes (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【7】The decision to continue resuscitative efforts beyond 10 minutes with no heart rate should take into consideration factors such as presumed etiology of arrest, gestational age, presence or absence of complications, and the parents' previous expressed feelings about the acceptable risk of morbidity.\nIn the absence of clinical decision rules to guide the termination of resuscitation in the neonatal patient, the responsible clinician should stop the resuscitative attempt if there is a high degree of certainty that the newborn will not respond to further advanced life support.\n\n【8】##Terminating Cardiac Arrest Resuscitative Efforts In Pediatric Ihca\n\n【9】No predictors of pediatric (infant or child) resuscitative success or failure have been established.  No validated clinical decision rules to guide the termination of resuscitative efforts in pediatric cardiac arrest have been reported, and the decision to stop resuscitation may vary considerably across physicians and institutions. Further research in this area is needed.\nIn the absence of clinical decision rules, the responsible clinician should stop the resuscitative attempt if there is a high degree of certainty that the patient will not respond to further pediatric advanced life support. Arrest characteristics to be considered by physicians making decisions may include duration of CPR, witnessed event, number of doses of epinephrine, etiology of arrest, first and subsequent rhythm, and age.-- \nProlonged efforts are typically made for infants and children with recurring or refractory VF or VT, those who demonstrate some ROSC, those with drug toxicity, or those experiencing an event causing primary hypothermia. Prolonged efforts are also indicated when a decision to employ extracorporeal CPR (ECPR) has been made .\n\n【10】##Terminating Cardiac Arrest Resuscitative Efforts In\n\n【11】Adult IHCA\nIn the hospital the decision to terminate resuscitative efforts rests with the treating physician and is based on consideration of many factors, including witnessed versus unwitnessed arrest, time to CPR, initial arrest rhythm, time to defibrillation, comorbid disease, prearrest state, and whether there is ROSC at some point during the resuscitative efforts. Clinical decision rules for in-hospital termination of resuscitation may be helpful in reducing variability in decision making  ; however, the evidence for their reliability is limited, and rules should be prospectively validated before adoption.\n\n【12】##Providing Emotional Support To The Family\n\n【13】##Providing Emotional Support To The Family\nDuring Resuscitative Efforts In Cardiac Arrest\n\n【14】In the past, family members have often been excluded from being present during the attempted resuscitation of a child or other relative. Surveys suggest that healthcare providers hold a range of opinions about the presence of family members during resuscitative attempts.  One theoretical concern is the potential for family members to become disruptive, interfere with resuscitative procedures, or develop syncope, and another is the possibility of increased exposure to legal liability; however, these are not reported in the literature.\nSeveral surveys suggested that most family members wish to be present during a resuscitative attempt.

Naloxone has no role in the management of cardiac arrest.\nIn the patient with known or suspected opioid overdose with respiratory depression who is not in cardiac arrest, ventilation should be assisted by a bag mask,  followed by administration of naloxone and placement of an advanced airway if there is no response to naloxone (Class I, LOE A).\nAdministration of naloxone can produce fulminate opioid withdrawal in opioid-dependent individuals, leading to agitation, hypertension, and violent behavior. For this reason, naloxone administration should begin with a low dose ( mg), with repeat dosing or dose escalation to 2  mg if the initial response is inadequate.Some patients may require much higher doses to reverse intoxication with atypical opioids, such as propoxyphene, or following massive overdose ingestions.  Naloxone can be given IV.  IM  intranasally,and into the trachea.The duration of action of naloxone is approximately 45 to 70 minutes, but respiratory depression caused by ingestion of a long-acting opioid (eg, methadone) may last longer. Thus, the clinical effects of naloxone may not last as long as those of the opioid, and repeat doses of naloxone may be needed.\nPatients with life-threatening central nervous system or respiratory depression reversed by naloxone administration should be observed for resedation. Although a brief period of observation may be appropriate for patients with morphine or heroin overdose,  a longer period of observation may be required to safely discharge a patient with life-threatening overdose of a longacting or sustained-release opioid.\n\n【2】##Benzodiazepines\n\n【3】There are no data to support the use of specific antidotes in the setting of cardiac arrest due to benzodiazepine overdose. Resuscitation from cardiac arrest should follow standard BLS and ACLS algorithms.\n\n【4】Flumazenil is a potent antagonist of the binding of benzodiazepines to their central nervous system receptors. Administration of flumazenil can reverse central nervous system and respiratory depression caused by benzodiazepine overdose.\nFlumazenil has no role in the management of cardiac arrest.\nThe administration of flumazenil to patients with undifferentiated coma confers risk and is not recommended (Class III, LOE B). Flumazenil administration can precipitate seizures in benzodiazepine-dependent patients and has been associated with seizures, arrhythmia, and hypotension in patients with coingestion of certain medications, such as tricyclic antidepressants.  However, flumazenil may be used safely to reverse excessive sedation known to be due to the use of benzodiazepines in a patient without known contraindications (eg, procedural sedation).\n\n【5】##Β -Blockers\n\n【6】There are no data to support the use of specific antidotes in the setting of cardiac arrest due to β -blocker overdose. Resuscitation from cardiac arrest should follow standard BLS and ACLS algorithms. β -Blocker medication overdose may cause such severe inhibition of β -adrenergic receptors that high-dose vasopressors cannot effectively restore blood pressure, cardiac output, or perfusion. Therapeutic options in the treatment of refractory hemodynamic instability due to β -blocker overdose include administration of glucagon, high-dose insulin, or IV calcium salts.\n\n【7】##Glucagon\n\n【8】Administration of glucagon may be helpful for severe cardiovascular instability associated with β -blocker toxicity that is refractory to standard measures, including vasopressors. The recommended dose of glucagon is a bolus of 3 to 10 mg, administered slowly over 3 to 5 minutes, followed by an infusion of 3 to 5 mg/h (0.05 to 0.15 mg/kg followed by an infusion of 0.05 to 0.10 mg/kg per hour) (Class IIb, LOE C).  The infusion rate is titrated to achieve an adequate hemodynamic response (appropriate mean arterial pressure and evidence of good perfusion). Because the amount of glucagon required to sustain this therapy may exceed 100 mg in a 24-hour period, plans should be made early to ensure that an adequate supply of glucagon is available. Glucagon commonly causes vomiting. In patients with central nervous system depression, the airway must be protected before glucagon administration. Animal studies have suggested that the concomitant use of dopamine alone or in combination with isoproterenol and milrinone may decrease the effectiveness of glucagon.\n\n【9】##Insulin\n\n【10】Animal studies suggest that high-dose IV insulin, accompanied by IV dextrose supplementation and electrolyte monitoring, may improve hemodynamic stability and survival in β -blocker overdose by improving myocardial energy utilization.  A single human case report  showed improved hemodynamic stability",

                            " and respiratory depression caused by opioid overdose. Naloxone has no role in the management of cardiac arrest.\nIn the patient with known or suspected opioid overdose with respiratory depression who is not in cardiac arrest, ventilation should be assisted by a bag mask, 232 -238 followed by administration of naloxone and placement of an advanced airway if there is no response to naloxone (Class I, LOE A).\nAdministration of naloxone can produce fulminate opioid withdrawal in opioid-dependent individuals, leading to agitation, hypertension, and violent behavior. For this reason, naloxone administration should begin with a low dose (0.04 to 0.4 mg), with repeat dosing or dose escalation to 2  mg if the initial response is inadequate. 239 Some patients may require much higher doses to reverse intoxication with atypical opioids, such as propoxyphene, or following massive overdose ingestions. 240,241 Naloxone can be given IV. 235,236,242,243 IM 232,235,236 intranasally, 232 , 242 and into the trachea. 244\nThe duration of action of naloxone is approximately 45 to 70 minutes, but respiratory depression caused by ingestion of a long-acting opioid (eg, methadone) may last longer. Thus, the clinical effects of naloxone may not last as long as those of the opioid, and repeat doses of naloxone may be needed.\nPatients with life-threatening central nervous system or respiratory depression reversed by naloxone administration should be observed for resedation. Although a brief period of observation may be appropriate for patients with morphine or heroin overdose, 245 a longer period of observation may be required to safely discharge a patient with life-threatening overdose of a longacting or sustained-release opioid. 239,246",

The bite opens rapidly because the arches exert 300 to 400 g continuously.\nThe intrusion of the anterior segment is slow, so the patient experiences no pain\n\n【1】##Disadvantages\n\n【2】1. Distal molar angulation.\n\n【3】Possible TMJ alterations due to molar contact points.\nPositive torque effect in the anterior and posterior segments.\nPosterior anchorage diminishes.\nIncisor proclination.\n\n【4】##Recommendations\n\n【5】1. Use as anchorage an upper transpalatine arch and a lower lingual arch. This will decrease molar positive torque and distal inclination.\nWe can place the anterior braces  mm toward the incisal edge; this will accelerate the intrusion of the anterior segment.\nIn case the patient does not have a deep Spee curve, lace the posterior segment with \"or \" stainless steel wire.\n\n【6】##The Intrusion Arch Of Quirós\n\n【7】In deep bite cases due to anterior teeth over-eruption, anterior bite planes are not recommended because they produce mandibular rotation and an increase of the lower third of the face; the intrusion of the upper incisors would be the best option. To achieve this we can use reverse curves, intrusive bends and arches with intrusive loops.\n\n【8】The presence of deep bites is one of the problems that we encounter frequently, to which we apply all our knowledge, but sometimes the resources we posses are inefficient. Not many arches with loops can help us achieve an effective intrusion of the anterior teeth, and the existing ones generally wear off before achieving their objective. The intrusion arch of Dr. Oscar Quiros is an excellent option for anterior segment intrusion.\n\n【9】For its fabrication, preform stainless steel \" x \" rectangular arches or \" x \" TMA rectangular arches can be used. We recommend a tweed plier or a plier that does not mark acute bends.  The arch is made with the anterior segment placed more gingivally than the posterior segment of the arch, this will make the intrusion of the anterior teeth possible; the difference in levels will be established by the amount of intrusion needed, 3 mm is an acceptable measure. Due to its design it acts like a very elastic spring that will physiologically intrude the anterior teeth, painlessly and without adverse effects upon teeth and support tissue.  Steps for construction of the Quiros intrusion arch:\n\n【10】1. Mark the wire between the lateral and the cuspid.\n\n【11】2. First make the initial bend and then the helicoidal bend.\n\n【12】3. Then make the intrusion loops.\n\n【13】4. Make the same operation on the other side, try on and then ligate it conventionally.\n\n【14】The anterior segment of the arch is gingivally oriented 3 mm in order to provoke the intrusion of this segment.",

Once placed in the mouth, dental traction can start in the initial leveling and alignment phases.\n\n【8】2. We can combine the use of power chain on the palatal side and closed NiTi coils on the buccal side for dental traction.\n\n【9】3. The removable version is not recommended because the necessary traction force applied over the teeth may dislodge the appliance from the lingual sheaths.\n\n【10】4. We recommend the direct bonded version of the appliance because it is easier to clean.\n\n【11】##B)\n\n【12】##Transpalanance\n\n【13】Transpalanance is the fusion of the transpalatine arch with the Nance Button. This anchorage is used, as the chromosome Arch, in cases of dental overcrowding and facial change as an objective. It is a good maximum anchorage option for the upper maxilla, where the Nance button has an acrylic dab reclined on the anterior, superior and medial region of the palate; the transpalatine arch, the dentally",

In reviewing the medical literature, members of the International First Aid Science Advisory Board once again found a paucity of evidence to guide first aid interventions. Very little research is being conducted in first aid, and many of the following recommendations are extrapolated from the experience of healthcare professionals. It is important to recognize the limitations of the evidence that supports many of these guidelines so that research can be undertaken and future guidelines can be based on a larger body of scientific evidence.\n\n【3】##Definition Of First Aid\n\n【4】We define first aid as the assessments and interventions that can be performed by a bystander (or by the victim) with minimal or no medical equipment. A first aid provider is defined as someone with formal training in first aid, emergency care, or medicine who provides first aid. First aid assessments and interventions should be medically sound and based on scientific evidence or, in the absence of such evidence, on expert consensus. Administration of first aid must not delay activation of the emergency medical services (EMS) system or other medical assistance when required. We strongly believe that education in first aid should be universal: everyone can learn first aid and everyone should.\nThe scope of first aid is not purely scientific; it is influenced by both training and regulatory issues. The definition of scope is therefore variable, and should be defined according to circumstances, need, and regulatory requirements.\n\n【5】A first aid provider must be able to recognize when help is needed and how to get it. First aid providers should learn how and when to access the EMS system, how to activate the on-site emergency response plan (ERP), and how to contact the Poison Control Center .\n\n【6】##Positioning The Victim\n\n【7】As a general rule a victim should not be moved, especially if you suspect, from the victim's position or the nature of the injury, that the victim may have a spinal injury . There are times, however, when the victim should be moved:\n•If the area is unsafe for the rescuer or the victim, move the victim to a safe location if it is safe to do so.\n\n【8】•If the victim is face down and is unresponsive, turn the victim face up.\n•If the victim has difficulty breathing because of copious secretions or vomiting, or if you are alone and have to leave an unresponsive victim to get help, place the victim in a modified High Arm IN Endangered Spine (HAINES) recovery position:  Extend one of the victim's arms above the head and roll the body to the side so the victim's head rests on the extended arm. Bend both legs to stabilize the victim (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【9】•If a victim shows evidence of shock, have the victim lie supine. If there is no evidence of trauma or injury, raise the feet about 6 to 12 inches (about 30° to 45°) (Class IIb, LOE C). Do not raise the feet if the movement or the position causes the victim any pain.\n\n【10】The evidence for a benefit to raising the feet is extrapolated from leg raising studies on volume expansion; there are no studies on the effect of leg raising as a first aid maneuver for shock. The results of the volume expansion studies are contradictory with some showing an increase in cardiac output,  while others show no change in cardiac output or mean arterial pressurewith leg raising.\n\n【11】There is insufficient evidence to recommend routine use of supplementary oxygen by a first aid provider for victims complaining of chest discomfortor shortness of breath  .\n\n【12】##Calling For Help\n\n【13】##Oxygen",

I have found it very useful to watch my patient's MDI technique during an office visit. A well-placed \"pointer\" can make a world of difference. Remember that mastering good MDI technique involves a learning curve, and with proper instruction and supervision, even young children can use MDI-delivered asthma medication.\n\n【2】##66. Why Does My Doctor Say I Should Rinse My Mouth After Using My Metereddose Inhaler (Mdi)?\n\n【3】Your doctor has likely requested that you rinse your mouth after using your inhaler in order to gently wash away any medicine particles that were not inhaled into the lungs and may have remained behind in the throat.\nIn particular, it is important to always rinse your mouth after using any inhaled corticosteroid preparation, whether administered by MDI, DPI, or jet nebulizer. The inhaled corticosteroid medications in particular can, if they \"land\" in your throat, cause",

Two vocal cords allow for speech as inhaled air passes between them, and sets up vibrations within the larynx located in the mid-neck.\n\n【2】Leptin: Leptin is a human protein identified in 1994, and named after leptos the Greek word for \"thin.\"\nLeptin seems to play a role in the regulation of fat accumulation. In humans, increasing body fat appears to correlate with increased leptin levels.\n\n【3】Leukotriene:      Leukotrienes are inflammatory molecules. There are two families of leukotrienes. One in particular, called the cysteinyl-leukotriene, is important in asthma and allergy. Cysteinyl-leukotrienes are released in increased number during asthma exacerbations. Drugs, known as \"leukotriene modifiers,\" have been developed based on current knowledge of leukotrienes. The leukotriene modifiers include:  receptor antagonists or blockers, and  synthesis inhibitors. The first class blocks the effects of leukotrienes (blockers), while the second interferes with their formation (synthesis inhibitors).\nMedicines in the first category are very safe and widely used in the maintenance treatment of allergic rhinitis and asthma.\n\n【4】MDI: Stands for metered dose inhaler. MDIs are devices that allow the delivery of a precise and accurate dose of medicine to the lungs by inhalation. MDIs are reliable, portable, and very convenient. Many different types of respiratory medicines come in MDI form, including short-acting \"rescue\" bronchodilators, inhaled steroids, and antiinflammatory medicines, as well as inhaled anticholinergics. Medicines in MDI form are used in the treatment of asthma and COPD. The newer MDIs use a CFC-free propellant, usually HFA.\n\n【5】Methacholine challenge test: The methacholine challenge test is a type of bronchoprovocation test. It is a specialized PFT used in the evaluation of suspected asthma, when the diagnosis is otherwise uncertain.\n\n【6】Morbidity: A measure of illness in a given population. The yearly morbidity rate from a disease is defined as the proportion of people affected by that disease per year, per given unit of population.\n\n【7】Mortality: A measure of illness; the rate of death from a disease in a given community or population at a precise point in time. The yearly mortality rate from a disease is defined as the ratio of deaths due to that disease, to the total number of persons in that community or population.\n\n【8】Mucus: Mucus is a mixture composed of water, salt, and proteins produced by specialized cells in the nose  , sinuses, and lung passages.

The preferred treatment for moderate persistent asthma in children older than 5 years of age and for adults is a combination of a long-acting, inhaled β  agonist and low-to-medium doses of inhaled corticosteroids. The combination has been shown to lead to improvements in lung function and in symptoms, while allowing for reduction in required doses of quick-relief, short-acting β  agonists. Alternative therapy consists of a combination of either a leukotriene modifier, or sustained-release theophylline, and low-to-medium doses of inhaled corticosteroids.\n\n【1】Exacerbations are best identified early and treated aggressively as in mild persistent asthma. Oral steroid bursts are commonly required.\n\n【2】##36. What Constitutes “Severe Persistent Asthma\"?\n\n【3】The category of severe persistent asthma is the most serious form of asthma in the NAEPP's expert panel report. Symptoms in severe persistent asthma occur continually; nocturnal symptoms are frequent . Lung function testing yields compromised FEV  and peak flow values of less than or equal to 60% of predicted. The peak flow varies by more than 30% from personal best baseline values.\n\n【4】All patients with asthma (of any severity) should be prescribed inhaled \"quick-relief\" bronchodilator therapy to be used when and if symptoms develop, on an as-needed basis. A short-acting, inhaled β  agonist is the recommended quick-relief agent for older children and adults. Very young children and infants might",

Why Do I Wake Up Around  Am To Use My Inhaler Before Going Back To Sleep?\n\n【2】If you are waking in the early morning hours with uncomfortable breathing or respiratory symptoms, you are experiencing what asthma specialists refer to as \"nocturnal awakenings,\" or \"nocturnal symptoms.\"\nNocturnal awakenings due to asthma are not normal and are undesirable from many points of view. Apart from interfering with sleep and rest, they indicate that your asthma is not adequately controlled and that your asthma is becoming more active. Nocturnal awakenings should always be reported to your treating physician. In the NAEPP classification, a person with mild, intermittent asthma experiences no more than two nocturnal awakenings in a month. If an asthmatic develops nocturnal symptoms more than twice monthly, the asthma is considered to be \"persistent.\"\nWeekly nocturnal awakenings are seen in moderate persistent disease and in severe disease as well.\n\n【3】When you awaken with asthma symptoms, it is a good idea to use your quick-relief, short-acting, inhaled bronchodilator.
