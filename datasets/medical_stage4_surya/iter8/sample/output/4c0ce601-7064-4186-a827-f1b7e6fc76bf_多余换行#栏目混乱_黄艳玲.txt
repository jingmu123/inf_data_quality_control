In cases of functional cross bites, these show a lato eral mandibular shift due to the presence of occlusal interferences with condyle position alterations. The condyle on the side of the cross bite is deviated to the posterosuperior side, meanwhile the condyle on the normal side places itself in the anteroinferior side of the temporal glenoid cavity. o If these deviations are corrected at an early age, we will obtain adequate eruption of the permanent teeth.
The skeletal relation of the osseous bases is improved. o It provides mouth closure without deviations. o

【1】The treatment for posterior cross bite must commence as soon as the malocclusion is diagnosed, being conditioned to the maturity and cooperation degree of the patient.
The most indicated treatment for the correction of skeletal type cross bite is through maxillary disjunction.

【2】##Disjunction

【3】We usually require palatal expansion for the correction of skeletal transversal discrepancies with the combination of orthodontic and orthopedic movements.  Rapid maxillary expansion (disjunction) is done to increase the transversal dimension to correct skeletal cross bites, and at the same time, to increase dental arch length. For this purpose we utilize expanders that produce intense transversal forces on the lateral dentoalveolar sectors of the upper dental arch.  Initially, the transverse forces will buccaly incline the lateral segments, and if the forces are strong enough, the disjunction of the mid palatal suture can occur (disjunction), the same happens with all the suture complex of the maxilla.
Rapid maxillary expansion (RME), is indicated when the expansion necessities are greater than 4 mm or 5 mm and when the origin of the discrepancy is skeletal.  The objective of RME is to reduce orthodontic movements and undesired inclinations. RME requires activations and generates heavy forces that range between kg to kg per activation, in contrast with slow expansion that generates forces that range between 450 g and 900 g that may be insufficient to separate a mature midpalatal suture.  Some authors recommend slow expansion (0.5 mm to 1 mm per week), because they say that a physiologic suture adjustment occurs.  But other studies indicate that if the expansion is slow, all that we are going to obtain is a dental expansion (teeth in a buccal position) rather than a basal expansion. Those who support RME have as theoretical fundament that applying a rapid force to the posterior teeth, these teeth would not have enough time to incline and that the force will transfer to the suture and the suture will open, meanwhile the teeth will minimally move. We can obtain  mm to 0.5 mm per day with inter molar length increment of up to 8 mm.  RME is obtained in 10 to 30 days, but the expander must remain in the mouth during six months to allow new bone to form in the suture.  The goal of palatal disjunction is to maximize skeletal movement and to minimize dental movement, meanwhile the physiologic midpalatal suture adjustment takes place.

【4】##Effects Of Disjunction

【5】1. Effects on the maxillary complex. When the forces applied to the teeth and the maxillary alveolar processes exceed the necessary limits for orthodontic dental movement, a disjunction is produced. ( The pressure that orthopedic force exerts, is going to act upon the midpalatal suture splitting it. A compression of the periodontal ligament that will incline the alveolar processes and a gradual aperture of the mid palatal suture will occur. From the frontal point of view, the separation occurs in a pyramid form, the base is located toward the anterior dental sector and the fulcrum is on the Nasion point. Occlusally, the expansion is greater in the anterosuperior sector at the incisor level (fan aperture) than at the posterior edge of the suture at the molar level, where the transversal dimension is maintained by the pterygoid processes that, being of endochondral origin, have structures that are hardly modifiable with this therapy. All this provokes a descent and forward position of the "A" point of approximately mm to 2 mm,  II.

【6】Effects on the alveolar processes. Because the bone is resilient, the inclination of the alveolar processes occurs early during disjunction. The majority of the forces applied tend to dissipate within 5 to 6 months and once the stabilization is terminated, any residual force can provoke a rebound effect, which makes overcorrection necessary. The slower we make the expansion, the more dental expansion effect and less basal expansion we will have. When an osseous or basal expansion is done, a force that produces hyalinization anchors the teeth to the bone and the aperture黄艳玲
