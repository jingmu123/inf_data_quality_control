if treatment begins at a young age, and can sometimes culminate in maxillofacial surgery.

【1】2. Overbite. Overbite has great impact upon treatment and retention of the teeth evolved in the cross bite.
When an anterior cross bite presents a deep anterior overbite, a posterior bite plane will be needed so the upper incisor can move forward without any occlusal interference from the lower incisors. Once this is corrected, the stability of the retention will depend upon the presence of an adequate overbite. So, patients with incisor cross bite, associated with little or no overbite, are more difficult to treat and to retain. (5.

【2】If the horizontal overbite is - mm to - mm and only one tooth is involved, the tongue can be used to correct the anterior cross bite when the patient is in the primary or mixed dentition, only if there is enough space for the tooth. Once this has been corrected, the occlusion itself will prevent the relapse of the cross bite.
3. Anterior arch length. A crossed upper incisor must have enough space to be moved. If there is not enough available arch length, we must create the sufficient space before trying to uncross it. In straight wire mechanics, open coils are regularly used to create enough arch length to move the tooth to its appropriate position. In patients with a lot of overcrowding the extraction of a premolar and lengthy orthodontic treatment may be needed.

【3】4. Upper incisor root torque. Many upper incisors that are crossed have their root in a palatal position. At the moment in which the crown is moved forward, the long axis of the tooth remains with an increased buccal inclination. After the tooth has been uncrossed, a buccally inclined tooth is prone to go back again. This is the reason why we should give negative torque to the root to move buccally. To accomplish this movement we can bond an inverted brace (°) and place " x " or " x " stainless steel wires.
Another way to apply negative torque is to make a third order bend in the arch wire.王磊
