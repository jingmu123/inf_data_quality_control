Once tip and torque have expressed themselves completely at incisor and molar levels, the slight extrusion that is produced with the mesial angulation of the molar is going to aid in the correction of the deep bite together with the intrusion of the anterior segment.  Now then we can apply this same bend in the lower arch when the deep bite is a product of the extrusion of the anteroinferior segment, and the biomechanics of the movement will be exactly the same.

【1】In both cases the moment that is produced in the anterior sector, product of the intrusive force, projects the incisal edges of the incisors in a buccal manner increasing the arch length and correcting the deep overbite.黄艳玲
