reperfusion with fibrinolytic therapy.  More recently, prehospital 12-lead ECGs have also been shown to reduce the time to primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and can facilitate triage to specific hospitals when PCI is the chosen strategy.  When EMS or ED physicians activate the cardiac care team, including the cardiac catheterization laboratory, significant reductions in reperfusion times are observed.

【1】The ACS guidelines also make new recommendations for triage of patients to PCI centers after cardiac arrest. The performance of PCI has been associated with favorable outcomes in adult patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest, and it is reasonable to include cardiac catheterization in standardized post–cardiac arrest protocols as part of an overall strategy to improve neurologically intact survival in this patient group. In patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to VF, emergent angiography with prompt revascularization of the infarct-related artery is recommended. The ECG may be insensitive or misleading following cardiac arrest, and coronary angiography after ROSC in subjects with arrest of presumed ischemic cardiac etiology may be reasonable, even in the absence of a clearly defined STEMI. Clinical findings of coma in patients before PCI are common following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and should not be a contraindication to consideration of immediate angiography and PCI.

【2】##Adult Stroke

【3】Part 11 emphasizes the early management of acute ischemic stroke in adult patients. It summarizes out-of-hospital care through the first hours of therapy. Approximately  people suffer a new or repeat stroke each year, and stroke remains the third leading cause of death in the United States. By integrating public education, 911 dispatch, prehospital detection and triage, hospital stroke system development, and stroke unit management, significant improvements in stroke care have been made. Important components of the stroke system of care are summarized in Part 11. As with STEMI patients, prearrival hospital notification by the transporting EMS unit has been found to significantly increase the percentage of patients with acute stroke who receive fibrinolytic therapy. The  AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC recommend that every hospital with an ED have a written plan that is communicated to EMS systems describing how patients with acute stroke are to be managed in that institution. Triage of patients with acute stroke directly to designated stroke centers is a new Class I recommendation, which has been added to the Stroke Algorithm. Another new Class I recommendation is admission of the stroke patient to a dedicated stroke unit managed by a multidisciplinary team experienced in stroke care.
Since publication of the  AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC , additional data have emerged extending the time window for administration of IV rtPA to select patients with acute ischemic stroke. These guidelines now recommend IV rtPA for patients who meet the eligibility criteria for the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) or the Third European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study (ECASS-3) if rtPA is administered by physicians in the setting of a clearly defined protocol with a knowledgeable team and institutional commitment. However, it is important to emphasize the continued time-dependent reperfusion window and that earlier treatment is better and is associated with improved outcome. Patients ineligible for standard IV fibrinolytic therapy may be considered for intra-arterial fibrinolytic therapy or mechanical revascularization at selected centers with specialized capabilities.
Finally these guidelines recommend admission to a stroke unit within 3 hours of presentation to the ED. Recent studies establish that stroke unit care is superior to care in general medical wards, and positive effects of stroke unit care can persist for years. The benefits from treatment in a stroke unit are comparable to the beneficial effects achieved with IV rtPA.
Overall stroke care has progressed dramatically since it was first incorporated into the ECC mission. Improvements in education, prehospital management, hospital system development, and acute treatments have lead to significant improvements in patient outcomes.

【4】##Special Situations

【5】Cardiac arrest in special situations may require special treatments or procedures beyond those provided during standard BLS or ACLS. Because of difficulty in conducting randomized clinical trials in these areas or their infrequent occurrence, these unique situations call for an experienced provider to go "beyond basics," using clinical consensus and extrapolation from typical circumstances. The topics covered in the  AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC have been reviewed, updated, and expanded to 15 specific cardiac arrest situations. These guidelines emphasize the "above and beyond" knowledge required as well as the anticipatory clinical acumen to provide timely care and unique interventions.
Topics include significant periarrest features that may be important to prevent cardiac arrest or that require special post–cardiac arrest care and intervention beyond the usual care defined in these guidelines. Topics with these potentially unique features include asthma, anaphylaxis, pregnancy, morbid obesity, pulmonary embolism, electrolyte imbalance, ingestion of toxic substances, trauma, accidental hypothermia, avalanche, drowning, electric shock/lightning strikes, and special procedural situations affecting the heart, including PCI, cardiac tamponade, and cardiac surgery.

【6】##Pediatric Basic Life Support

【7】The majority of pediatric cardiac arrests are asphyxial, with only approximately 5% to 15% attributable to VF.
Animal studies  have shown that resuscitation from asphyxial arrest is best accomplished by a combination of ventilations and chest compressions. This has recently been confirmed in a large community pediatric study,  which not only showed that the best resuscitation results from asphyxial arrest were from a combination of ventilations and chest compressions but also that the small number of children with asphyxial arrest who received compression-only CPR had no better results than those who received no bystander CPR.
Although animal studies and pediatric series support the importance of ventilation for asphyxial arrest, data in adults suggest that chest compressions are critical for resuscitation from VF arrest, with ventilations being less important. Therefore焦瀚远
