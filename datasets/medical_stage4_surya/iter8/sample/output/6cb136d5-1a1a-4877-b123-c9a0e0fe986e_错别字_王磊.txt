symptoms. Lung function testing in mild persistent asthma will demonstrate FEV  and peak flow values greater than or equal to 80% of predicted, and peak flow variability between 20 and 30% from prior personal best values.

【1】All patients with asthma (of any severity) should be prescribed inhaled, "quick-relief" bronchodilator therapy to be used when and if symptoms develop, on an asneeded basis. A short-acting, inhaled β  agonist is the recommended quick-relief agent for older children and adults. Very young children and infants might instead be placed on a short-acting β  agonist medication taken by mouth (orally) in liquid or syrup form as an alternative, especially if inhalation of medication is unfeasible.

【2】"Step 2" medical therapy is advocated in the treatment of mild persistent asthma. "Step 2" requires the use of daily "controller" medication prescribed in addition to the quick-relief, short-acting β  agonist medication used as needed. Inhaled, low-dose corticosteroids are the preferred daily "controller" medicine in mild persistent asthma. A number of alternate "controller" maintenance medicines can be prescribed for daily use in "Step 2" therapy and considered on an individual basis. They include, in alphabetical order, cromolyn, leukotriene modifiers, nedocromil, and sustainedrelease theophylline. Consultation with an asthma specialist should be considered for infants and children younger than 5 years of age, and can also be considered for older children and adults who require alternative treatment. It is important to remember that inhaled, low-dose corticosteroids are first-line, Step 2 treatment because they specifically target the inflammatory response that characterizes mild persistent asthma.王磊
