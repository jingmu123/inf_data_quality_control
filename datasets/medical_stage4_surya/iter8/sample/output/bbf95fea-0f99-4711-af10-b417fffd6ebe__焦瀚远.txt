【1】##59. Why Do I Wake Up Around  Am To Use My Inhaler Before Going Back To Sleep?

【2】If you are waking in the early morning hours with uncomfortable breathing or respiratory symptoms, you are experiencing what asthma specialists refer to as "nocturnal awakenings," or "nocturnal symptoms."
Nocturnal awakenings due to asthma are not normal and are undesirable from many points of view. Apart from interfering with sleep and rest, they indicate that your asthma is not adequately controlled and that your asthma is becoming more active. Nocturnal awakenings should always be reported to your treating physician. In the NAEPP classification, a person with mild, intermittent asthma experiences no more than two nocturnal awakenings in a month. If an asthmatic develops nocturnal symptoms more than twice monthly, the asthma is considered to be "persistent."
Weekly nocturnal awakenings are seen in moderate persistent disease and in severe disease as well.
