Truth is, all the information we have available at this time indicates the "fat phobia" and "fat makes you fat" scare has been unfounded because not all fat is the same.
However, claims that diets very high in overall and saturated fat are healthy and safe for long term use are still premature.

【1】##Lie #4: The Atkins Diet Will Help You Keep Fat Off For Good

【2】Dr. Atkins writes that his diet "Is so perfectly adapted to use as a lifetime diet that, unlike most diets, the weight won't come back."

【3】It's a weight loss axiom that the more extreme a diet and the faster the weight loss, the more difficult it usually is to maintain the results.  Slow, steady and balanced seems to win the race when it comes to weight control.

【8】Truth is, despite Dr. Atkin's claims and the new research apparently supporting them, we still don't know what will happen in the long run. Based on the results of the recent three, six, and twelve month studies, researchers have begun to organize longer trials. One of them will be five years in length.

【9】What I believe you will see in long term studies is that Atkins and other low carb diets, while effective for weight loss in the short term, will be found no more effective for long term fat loss than any other restrictive diet (and that's NOT very effective).

【10】##Lie #5: Calories Don’T Count And You Can Eat As Much As You Want While On The Atkins Diet.

【11】Dr. Atkins proposed that calories don't count and he advised his clients to eat as much as they want while on his program. Atkins wrote, "The so called calorie theory has been a millstone around the necks of dieters and a miserable and malign influence on their efforts to lose."
