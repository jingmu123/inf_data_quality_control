##91. If My 7-Year-Old Daughter Wheezes, Does It Mean That She Has Asthma?

【1】Maybe not, but asthma is very likely. Repeated bouts of cough and wheezing in school-age children—boys as well as girls—are almost always due to asthma.

Don't assume that your child is experiencing a "bad winter" if she seems to suffer from multiple chest colds. It may be that she has asthma. If so, make sure you get appropriate medical care, establish the correct diagnosis, and allow your daughter to receive asthma treatment if required.

Do not automatically eliminate milk and milk products from the child's diet without medical consultation and advice. I clearly焦瀚远
