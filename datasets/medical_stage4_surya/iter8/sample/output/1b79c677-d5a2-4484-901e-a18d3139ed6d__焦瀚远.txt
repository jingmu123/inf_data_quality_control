back into action, but you need a little help from outside.

【1】Biofeedback is a method through which people can learn to control their body's functions. Biofeedback involves using sensors placed strategically over the human body. These sensors help receive feedback about the body, hence, the term biofeedback. This feedback assists people in making minor changes to their body over time, such as relaxing specific muscles to reduce the intensity of pain.
In short, biofeedback allows you to use your thoughts to control certain aspects of your body, such as muscles.

【2】During recovery, Bell's palsy patients reach a stage where their face feels incredibly tight. The eye may shut without any indication while eating or talking.
Some patients also feel that they are making funny faces when smiling. It is the faulty communication system between your face and brain that is letting you down. Biofeedback allows you to learn how to control muscles to display the expression you want.

【3】##What Are The Different Types Of Biofeedback?

【4】There are three most commonly used forms of biofeedback therapy including:

【5】1. Electromyography (EMG) used to measure muscle tension.

【6】2. Thermal biofeedback used to measure skin temperature.

【7】3. Electroencephalography (EEG) or neuro-feedback used to measure brain wave activity.

【8】##What Happens During Biofeedback Therapy?

【9】A typical biofeedback session will involve attaching tiny electrodes to your skin.
These electrodes then send information to a small box that translates the signals your body is giving out. You will see lines that vary in pitch on a computer screen. The biofeedback therapist in charge will then guide you through some mental exercises. Soon, with trial and error, you will learn exercises that can bring about the activity you want on the affected side of your face.

【10】You will also be taught relaxation techniques and exercises that need to be done at home for at least 5 - 10 minutes every day.
