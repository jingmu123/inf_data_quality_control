Any indicated medication should be prescribed and taken as directed. An effective asthma regimen will succeed in achieving a minimal requirement for shortacting β  agonist "rescue" medication. An effective asthma regimen will also ensure minimal, if any, side effects from the prescribed medicines. Lung function should normalize with proper asthma care. Symptoms should be absent or minimal during the daytime, as well as at night . Sleep should be restful and uninterrupted. There should be no absences from work or school due to asthma. Exacerbations should also be few (or none), and far between. When an exacerbation does develop, it should be recognized immediately and treated aggressively. When people can "forget" that they have asthma, except for the fact that they have to take medicine, and when they can fully participate in work, play, and sports, and enjoy life without limitation, then the principal goal of asthma treatment has been successfully met.

【1】##Table 21  Major Goals Of Asthma Treatment

【2】•Daytime symptoms should be absent or minimal.

【3】•Nocturnal symptoms should be absent or minimal; sleep should be restful and uninterrupted.
•Elimination of absences from work or school because of asthma; parents of children with asthma should similarly not have any missed days of work because of the child's asthma.
•Full participation in sports and team competitions; regular aerobic exercise is an important component of good asthma management, as well as a key feature of a healthy lifestyle.
Exacerbations should be nonexistent or "few and far between." They should be addressed and treated promptly and effectively.

【4】Requirement for "rescue treatment," usually in the form of a shortacting inhaled β  agonist (inhaled or oral, in the case of young children), should be minimal.
Medicines for asthma treatment should be associated with minimal, if any, side effects.王磊
