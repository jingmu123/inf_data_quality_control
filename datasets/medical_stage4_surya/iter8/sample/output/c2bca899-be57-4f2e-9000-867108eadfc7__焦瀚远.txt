When used properly, steroids are truly miraculous in their effectiveness. Prednisone and medrol are two different steroids in pill (or oral) form that are frequently prescribed in the treatment of asthmatic exacerbations and of severe allergic reactions. They are also sometimes given as controller therapy in very small daily doses in the treatment of severe persistent asthma. A 5 mg dose of prednisone is equivalent to a 4 mg dose of medrol. I usually advise my patients who require steroids to "start them early and get off them quickly," so they can take advantage of the beneficial qualities when treating an exacerbation and minimize potential side effects.

【1】##72. What Are Possible Steroid Side Effects?

【2】The potential side effects of steroids are well described in the medical literature and are related to:  the daily dose of steroid taken,  the total duration of steroid therapy, and  individual characteristics. A person who requires 60 mg of prednisone daily for 6 weeks, for example (an admittedly unusually high and prolonged dose in asthma treatment), can expect to develop different side effects as compared to a person taking 40 mg of prednisone for one day, 35 mg the next day, then 30 mg the day after, and so forth, tapering down by 5 mg each焦瀚远
