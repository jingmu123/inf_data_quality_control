##Advantages

【1】4. Fast and easy fabrication.
We do not depend upon patient cooperation.
Not only it can be used to uncross anterior cross bites, but also in cases in which we want to slightly increase the overjet.

【2】##Disadvantages

【3】1. The patient can refer momentary pain in the upper incisors while the proclination is taking place.
Sometimes when the wire is forced in the slots of the braces, the wire can bulge slightly at the premolar level and this can lacerate the mucosa of the cheeks.

【4】This will avoid possible brace debonding of this sector.

【5】3. If there is a lot of separation between the braces and the wire, some braces can debond.
There is no torque control of the upper incisors.

【6】##Recommendations

【7】1. In order to uncross an anterior cross bite, the activations must be paused and not exceed 2 mm of separation from the braces.
Use Class III elastics.
Use anterior box elastics.
Once the anterior bite has been uncrossed, we can use the arch as minimal anchorage.
Stripping in the anteroinferior sector. l. With this arch we can procline all the anterosuperior sector, uncrossing the anterior bite.
Not only the anteosuperior sector is proclined, but also the upper molars are slightly distalized.
