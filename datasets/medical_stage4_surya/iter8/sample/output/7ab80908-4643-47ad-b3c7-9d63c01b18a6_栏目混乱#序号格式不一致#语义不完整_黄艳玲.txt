##Recommendations

【1】1. Bond the bite ramps on the cingulum of the upper incisors.

【2】2. Use heavy rectangular arch wires to avoid posterior sector lingualization.

【3】3. Use  Oz force elastics.
The elastics must be changed every 24 hours.
Perform posterior segment stripping to facilitate extrusion.
Tell the patient to chew gum with the intermaxillary elastics in place. This will accelerate the extrusion of the posterior segment.

【4】##Individual Bypass

【5】This form of intrusion is very simple and fast. We just have to place a brace or a button to the tooth that we want to intrude and pass an elastic wire (NiTi or TMA ) on the incisal portion of the tooth. This will intrude the tooth. l. The bypass provokes an intrusive movement immediately.

【6】##Advantages

【7】2. The intrusive movement is 2 mm per month.
We do not depend upon patient compliance.
We can produce individual or in block intrusion.

【8】##Disadvantages

【9】1. There is no tip or torque control of the tooth.
Teeth with intrusive bypass tend to incline buccally.

【10】3. Because it is a violent movement, it provokes periodontal inflammation and pain.

【11】##Recommendations

【12】1. Make the by-pass with elastic wires like NiTi or TMA.

【13】2. The diameter of the arches can range from " to ".

【14】3. After dental intrusion, we must give tip and torque to the tooth.
We must lace the teeth adjacent to the bypass.
After dental intrusion, all arches must have an intrusion bend or we must change the position of the brace in order to place a straight wire and facilitate horizontal movements if necessary.黄艳玲
