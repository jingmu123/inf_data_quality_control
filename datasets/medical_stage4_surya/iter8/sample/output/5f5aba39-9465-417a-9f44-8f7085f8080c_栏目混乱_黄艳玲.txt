nutritive sucking has a close relation with the seeking reflex that is present at birth. The indiscriminate use of a pacifier, feeding bottle and finger sucking can increase the chance of development of an open bite in the infant. This suction reflex disappears around the seventh month after birth.

【1】##Breathing

【2】Nasal obstruction and mouth breathing habit have been linked to this type of malocclusion, due to this obstruction,the patient beguines to breathe through the mouth so the patient must lower his tongue in order to let air pass through (mouth breathing habit) provoking a muscular unbalance between the tongue and the maxillary bones; the persistence of half open mouth stimulates the growth of the alveolar processes altering the craniofacial growth and provoking an open bite.

【3】The etiology that initiates mouth breathing has many factors, like allergies, adenoid tissue, enlarged tonsils, chronic inflammation of the air ways, tumoral processes, nasal septum deviation, nasal polyps, nasal orifices narrowing, among others.

【4】##Muscular Hipotonicity

【5】Teeth receive and support the mechanical loads of the muscles that maintain teeth in a vertical position in their osseous bases. Hypotonicity tends to stimulate molar overeruption and to separate the maxillary bone bases.

【6】##Dentition Development

【7】In certain children the eruption of permanent teeth is sometimes altered chronologically; this contributes to the lack of vertical contact. This results in a transitory open bite aggravated by the tongue interposition.  o

【8】##General

【9】Genetics. The genetic influence in the development of bone and teeth is evident, this is why we can say there are hereditary malocclusions; the size, form of teeth and bone are inherited and this leads us to established morphologic patterns.  o Congenital defects. There are congenital defects that can lead to an alteration of the growth of the maxilla and the mandible; palatine fissures, for example.  o Muscular alterations. When our mouth is in repose, teeth do not occlude and lips are in contact producing a lip seal, that is necessary for swallowing and to avoid saliva leakage. In the absence of this seal, the tongue can produce an unbalance between the lips and the teeth producing a malocclusion. Lip and tongue morphology have influence on this, so does the muscle tone of the lips.黄艳玲
