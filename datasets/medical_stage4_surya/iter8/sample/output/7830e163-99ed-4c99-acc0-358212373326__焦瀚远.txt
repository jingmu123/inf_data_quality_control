Immunoglobulin E, abbreviated IgE, is a protein produced by the body and was first identified in the mid- 1960s. IgE is an antibody. IgE is produced by the body in minute quantities and normally circulates in the bloodstream in very small amounts. Under certain conditions however, the body's (and blood or serum) level of IgE can rise significantly. High serum IgE levels have, for example, been associated with persistent wheezing, allergy, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness.
IgE plays a pivotal role in allergy, in asthma, and in the other "atopic diseases," such as eczema, seasonal allergic rhinitis, peanut allergy, anaphylaxis, and hives. To better understand the central role of IgE, it is important to first review our understanding of the body's allergic response.

【1】When a person has an allergy to a specific allergen, the allergy has developed over time. In order for an allergy to emerge, a person must first be exposed to an allergen. With continued exposure, "sensitization" to the allergen takes place, and only then, with continued exposure to the allergen, will an allergic response develop. The genesis of a specific allergy in an individual with certain innate genetic characteristics requires at least two successive steps: a preliminary exposure to an allergen, followed by sensitization to that same allergen. Many individuals are not "allergy prone," meaning that even though they may have repeated, frequent allergen exposure, their immune system does not become sensitized, and allergic symptoms never develop. Consider, for example, two siblings who live in a home with a cat. One child has no allergic symptoms. The other child experiences itchy eyes, runny nose, chest tightness, and wheezing upon any exposure焦瀚远
