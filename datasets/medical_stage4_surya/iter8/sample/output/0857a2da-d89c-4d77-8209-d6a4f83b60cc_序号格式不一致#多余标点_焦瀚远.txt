2. Depending on the transversal requirements of the patient we can choose among 8 mm, 11 mm and 13 mm screws.
It is a very effective appliance.
The addition of acrylic on the occlusal aspects of the molars and premolars will prevent the over-inclination of the teeth that serve as anchorage.

【1】5. Expansions up to 10 mm to 12 mm are possible.
Extremely strong.
We can obtain orthopedic effects even in patients in which growth has almost ceased.

【2】8. It modifies the mandibular posture, placing it in a lower and backward position, due to the extrusion of the palatine cusps of the upper molars and premolars.
9. It improves the respiratory capacity of the patients due to the descent of the nasal cavity.

【3】##Disadvantages

【4】1. A wrong appliance design can provoke the self impingement of the appliance on the palatal mucosa.

【5】2. The manufacture of this appliance consumes laboratory time.
We depend 100% upon patient and parent cooperation for the correct activation of the appliance.
The appliance is very rigid and difficult to bend.

【6】##Recommendations

【7】1. In a treatment for maxillary constriction, we must always resolve the transversal problem and then the sagittal problem.

【8】2. We suggest a daily aperture of 0.5 mm (2/4 of a turn per day, one activation in the morning and another in the night) which is a tolerable measure for the patient (1/4 of a turn=0.25 mm).

【9】3. Begin activating the screw 30 minutes after the appliance has been cemented to allow the complete hardening of the cement.

【10】4. Provide the patient with an activation schedule and a list of possible effects.
Monitor the patient clinically and radio-graphically during the disjunction.

【11】6. Once the expansion has ended, use the appliance as a fixed retainer for 3 to 6 months. According to Hass in 1961, the mid palatal suture re ossifies in 3 months, for this motive, we must retain the patient that same time.  )焦瀚远
