In other words, if you are not taking your prescribed asthma medicine and you are experiencing flares in your asthma symptoms, then going outdoors to snowshoe through the woods on your winter vacation, for example, will undoubtedly provoke additional symptoms! Make sure that your asthma is under satisfactory control before exercising. Apart from taking your medicines, you may find it useful to measure your peak flow, and use the PEF value to make an objective decision about participation in sports that day.

【1】The third factor in exercise-induced asthma relates to the type of exercise itself. Some types of exercise are especially advisable in the setting of asthma, while others are viewed as more likely to trigger asthma. In the latter category, distance running or cross-country skiing, for example, can cause symptoms of cough, breathlessness, or wheezing. Distance running, cycling, and skiing involve very good aerobic conditioning, but the activity is steady, without breaks or interruption, and includes exposure to the outdoors, with extremes of temperature, aeroallergens, and sometimes atmospheric pollutants as well. Athletic activity that incorporates breaks in the intensity of exertion is less likely to cause asthma symptoms by, in a very real sense, allowing time for you to "catch your breath." Examples include competitive sports such as tennis, soccer, field hockey, basketball, baseball, and lacrosse, among others. I encourage exercise and sports for all of my patients. The fact that distance activities have been shown in research studies to be more likely to provoke exercise-induced asthma symptoms in no way leads me to discourage my patients with asthma from cycling, running in a marathon, or cross-country skiing, if they so desire. My patients tell me what athletics they want焦瀚远
