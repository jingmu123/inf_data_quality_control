##Advantages

【1】1.1.1. It is a very easy technique.
We do not depend upon patient cooperation.
The bite can be corrected in 2 to 3 weeks; taking into account that the optimal force to move an upper first molar is around 120 g (with this force the molar will move 1 mm per month), and the force generated by the Bioforce arch is around  g in the posterior sector, which means that the movement will take half of the required time.

【2】4. Because it is a rectangular wire the molar torque can be controlled during the dentoalveolar expansion.

【3】##Disadvantages

【4】1:

【5】We must have a strict control of the appointments in patients that need to correct their posterior cross will be placed active and the movement that will be generated is constant and very fast, if we do not have this control, non-desired movements can happen.

【6】2. The patient can refer pain, because this is a fast movement.

【7】3. The tubes and the posterior braces can debond due to the force generated by the arch.

【8】4. The arch will produce an excessive proclination of the anterior sector.焦瀚远
