##Cia (Connecticut Intrusion Arch)

【1】The correction of a deep bite (deep overbite) can be accomplished with the intrusion of the anterior sector, the extrusion of the posterior sector or a combination of both.
This decision must be based in the ideal position of the upper incisor, considering the lip-teeth relation (nasolabial angle) and the vertical dimension of the lower third of the face.  There are many ways to intrude the anterior segment;
Begg, Ricketts and Burstone employ the same principle: the molar tip back bend. The wire materials used for intrusion with these techniques are diverse, but they all recognize the need to employ a continuous light force.  Nickel Titanium alloys (NiTi) are a good option to produce these continuous and light forces. These alloys have high memory and a low load-deflection ratio that translates into less wire activation appointments.  The Connecticut Intrusion Arch (CIA) is more commonly used for intrusion of the anterior teeth, but it has other uses, including molar tip back for Class II correction, for anchorage preparation of the posterior segment, correction of minor anterior open bites, occlusal plane leveling and detailing.

【2】The CIA is manufactured and distributed by Orto Organizers and made out of NiTi wire. There are two available arch sizes: " x " and " x ". The upper and lower have an anterior dimension of 34 mm and 28 mm respectively.  In the majority of cases the CIA is not placed in the slots of the anterior braces. In the anterior segment, a sectional rectangular arch is placed in the slots from lateral to lateral.

【3】Over this wire the anterior segment of the CIA arch wire is ligated to the sectional wire. This is the reason why the use of triple tubes in the upper molars and the use of double tubes in the lower molars are recommended. (.

【4】The CIA exerts an intrusive force of 40 g to 60 g due to the "V" bend placed mesial to the molar tube. With this arch we can achieve pure intrusion, because the intrusion force is directed apically through the center of resistance of the tooth, producing mm of intrusion in 6 weeks.王磊
