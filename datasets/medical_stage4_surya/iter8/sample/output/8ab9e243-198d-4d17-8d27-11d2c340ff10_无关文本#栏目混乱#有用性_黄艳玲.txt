more than 30 percent faster than the advertised speed. I hadn't moved the modem at all (it was still sitting on my office desk), so I wondered what was causing the variation in transmission rates. The technical experts at Wireless WebConnect! speculated that the most likely

But the folks at Metricom said the real culprit was heavier usage of the network during peak times, which reduces everyone's transmission rate. After learning about my problem, Metricom upgraded my modem's software by sending a few ther- : a foreign language fluently on your own and at your own pace with what are considered the finest in-depth courses available.

The modem is designed to work in cars and trains moving up to 70 miles per hour, but this was impossible to confirm in New York traffic. Traveling at half that speed through Manhattan's Upper West Side, I got a connection of  kbps. I have to admit, it was exhilarating to be checking stock quotes while cruising down Columbus Avenue. I scrolled through a financial news Web site and learned that the Nasdaq index was falling again. I read an article about the woes of the semiconductor industry, then hopped over to a stock-trading Web site. But then I asked myself, What good is this?

The modem may also come in handy if you travel frequently. But if you're a homebody and a schlemiel like me, you may not find the system very useful.
