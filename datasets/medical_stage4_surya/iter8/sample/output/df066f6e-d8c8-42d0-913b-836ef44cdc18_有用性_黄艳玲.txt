Steroids are considered safe when taken body's steroid requirements. The steroids produced by the adrenal glands are referred to as the body's "endogenous steroids." When the adrenal glands detect "extra" steroid medication in the bloodstream over time, they reduce their own endogenous steroid production. If the adrenal glands are exposed to a significant amount of steroid medication, they will fairly quickly respond by completely shutting down the body's own vital manufacture of steroids. As long as a person continues to take his or her prescribed steroid medication, the adrenals remain "lazy" and cease the production of endogenous steroids. When steroid medication is gradually reduced, the adrenal glands have time to "wake up," and will eventually resume producing endogenous steroids for the body's needs. If, on the other hand, long-term steroid pills are not tapered and are stopped abruptly, the adrenal glands will not have sufficient time to recover and to restart the manufacture of endogenous steroids. The body will be left without any steroids at all, and an "adrenal crisis"—a true medical emergency—may ensue. The treatment of adrenal crisis includes steroid administration.

【1】Steroids are considered safe when taken exactly as prescribed, for bona fide medical indications. Let's say that your asthma has become more active. Despite the fact that you are using inhaled, long-acting β  agonists, along with an inhaled, high-dose corticosteroid, you are also requiring a short-acting rescue inhaled β  agonist every 4 to 6 hours for relief of breathlessness. Your peak flow values have decreased. You are experiencing nocturnal awakenings because of respiratory difficulty. You feel rotten. Your physician will undoubtedly prescribe a "steroid burst" for you. A "steroid burst" is a prescription黄艳玲
