##Chapter Four: Bell'S Palsy During Pregnancy

【1】Expecting mothers develop Bell's palsy more frequently, and the reasons are not completely understood. It has been observed that the risk is highest during the third trimester and several weeks after delivery. Luckily, the prognosis for expecting moms is generally good. If a woman is affected with Bell's palsy during pregnancy, there is no effect on the developing fetus.

【2】The symptoms among expecting mothers are the same as described earlier in this book.

【3】##Treating Bell'S Palsy During Pregnancy

【4】We will look at the treatment methods in more detail later in this book, but for now, let's take a quick look at how Bell's palsy can be treated during pregnancy.
You can address symptoms such as pain with pain killers; however, steroids and popular antiviral medication are not recommended.

【5】##How Long Will It Take For The Symptoms To Go Away Completely?

【6】Well, you will notice a gradual improvement, but recovery times can vary depending on the extent of nerve damage. Most pregnant women who develop Bell's palsy recover completely in less than six months. In some cases, the recovery time may be longer – this often happens if the patient develops complete facial paralysis.

【7】Pregnant women who develop Bell's palsy are monitored closely for changes in blood pressure. This is because expecting moms suffering from Bell's palsy are also at an increased risk of developing preeclampsia.

【8】Preeclampsia is a serious complication in pregnant women and is characterized by high blood pressure. The increase in blood pressure can cause tremendous damage to vital organs, particularly the kidneys. Preeclampsia is usually spotted after 20 weeks of pregnancy. It can even happen in women who had normal blood pressure during the early weeks of pregnancy.

【9】If left untreated, preeclampsia might lead to serious complications for both the mother and the baby. This condition only has one cure – delivering the baby.
That being said; the pregnancy obviously has to be in its final stage for the delivery to take place.焦瀚远
