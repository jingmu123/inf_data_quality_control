##Anti-Inflammatory Herbs

【1】Adding herbs such as turmeric and ginger in your diet is a great way to reduce inflammation of the facial nerve. You can also add green tea to your diet plan as it is known to protect the myelin sheath.

【2】##Vitamin C

【3】Vitamin C is one of the most potent natural immune system boosters, so get your hands on those juicy lemons and oranges. You can also try guava and grapefruits to ensure that your body gets an adequate supply of vitamin C. Surprisingly; generous intake of this vitamin also protects the myelin sheath as this nutrient is also a powerful anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidizing agent.

【4】Vitamin A and D are valuable supports for your immune system. You can go for orange fruits and veggies such as papaya, carrots and oranges that are rich sources of vitamin A. Cod liver oil is another good source of vitamin A, D and essential fatty acids.

【5】##Essential Fatty Acids

【6】Your brain is composed of 60% fat, and you require good fats like fat omega-3 and omega-6 to maintain a healthy brain. Be sure you include rich sources of omega-6 in your diet such as chicken, fish, walnuts and extra virgin olive oil.
Both omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids help reduce nerve inflammation and improve electrical transmission.

【7】##Fruits

【8】Bananas are an excellent choice as they are packed with several nutrients like potassium. Citrus fruits, grapes and tropical fruits, not only are an ideal substitute for sweets and candies but are full of powerful immune boosters especially Vitamin C, which is essential for those suffering from Bell's palsy.
Eating a cup of blueberries daily can also alleviate symptoms of facial palsy as the berries have incredible anti-inflammatory and healing properties.

【9】Here's another friendly reminder: Try to eat raw veggies and fresh fruits as they are loaded with vital nutrients. You also need to drink plenty of water as it is one of the best conductors of electrical impulses. Also try substituting sugary drinks and caffeine with plain water and try to drink at least 2 liters of water per day.王磊
