pregnancy is sufficiently advanced to permit the birth of a healthy, fully developed infant, and is defined as anytime after  weeks of gestation. A baby's "due date" is calculated so that it falls exactly 40 weeks after the first day of the mother's last menstrual period. The developing infant is carried in the mother's uterus (or womb). The intrauterine environment is an ideal environment for the fetus, with controlled temperature, oxygen, nutrients, and stimuli. The fetus' oxygen is supplied via the mother's bloodstream through the placenta. The mother's blood oxygen, in turn, reflects her lung function. The overriding principle of asthma treatment in pregnancy is the provision of adequate oxygen to the developing fetus by careful and aggressive treatment of maternal asthma. The risks of uncontrolled asthma to the mother and infant are far greater than the possible or potential risks of medication .

【1】The outcome of pregnancy for a woman who has wellcontrolled asthma can be expected to be no different from the outcome of a woman without asthma. The emphasis is on the concept of well-controlled asthma.
The goals of asthma treatment in pregnancy parallel those of asthma treatment in general. Compliance with prescribed medication is emphasized along with peak flow (PEF) monitoring. Avoidance of known asthma triggers is encouraged as much as possible. Influenza vaccination is recommended for women who have no contraindication to the vaccine, and who will be in their third trimester of pregnancy during the fall and winter influenza season. Influenza vaccination is safe in pregnancy. The vaccine should not be administered if the patient is allergic to eggs or is allergic to any of the constituents of the vaccine.黄艳玲
