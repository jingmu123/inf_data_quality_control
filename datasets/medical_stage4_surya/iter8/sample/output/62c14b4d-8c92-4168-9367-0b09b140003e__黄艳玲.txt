Internist: A physician specialized in the non-surgical medical care of adults.

【1】Larynx: The voice box. Two vocal cords allow for speech as inhaled air passes between them, and sets up vibrations within the larynx located in the mid-neck.

【2】Leptin: Leptin is a human protein identified in 1994, and named after leptos the Greek word for "thin."
Leptin seems to play a role in the regulation of fat accumulation. In humans, increasing body fat appears to correlate with increased leptin levels.

【3】Leukotriene:      Leukotrienes are inflammatory molecules. There are two families of leukotrienes. One in particular, called the cysteinyl-leukotriene, is important in asthma and allergy. Cysteinyl-leukotrienes are released in increased number during asthma exacerbations. Drugs, known as "leukotriene modifiers," have been developed based on current knowledge of leukotrienes. The leukotriene modifiers include:  receptor antagonists or blockers, and  synthesis inhibitors. The first class blocks the effects of leukotrienes (blockers), while the second interferes with their formation (synthesis inhibitors).
Medicines in the first category are very safe and widely used in the maintenance treatment of allergic rhinitis and asthma.

【4】MDI: Stands for metered dose inhaler. MDIs are devices that allow the delivery of a precise and accurate dose of medicine to the lungs by inhalation. MDIs are reliable, portable, and very convenient. Many different types of respiratory medicines come in MDI form, including short-acting "rescue" bronchodilators, inhaled steroids, and antiinflammatory medicines, as well as inhaled anticholinergics. Medicines in MDI form are used in the treatment of asthma and COPD. The newer MDIs use a CFC-free propellant, usually HFA.

【5】Methacholine challenge test: The methacholine challenge test is a type of bronchoprovocation test. It is a specialized PFT used in the evaluation of suspected asthma, when the diagnosis is otherwise uncertain.

【6】Morbidity: A measure of illness in a given population. The yearly morbidity rate from a disease is defined as the proportion of people affected by that disease per year, per given unit of population.

【7】Mortality: A measure of illness; the rate of death from a disease in a given community or population at a precise point in time. The yearly mortality rate from a disease is defined as the ratio of deaths due to that disease, to the total number of persons in that community or population.

【8】Mucus: Mucus is a mixture composed of water, salt, and proteins produced by specialized cells in the nose  , sinuses, and lung passages. Mucus黄艳玲
