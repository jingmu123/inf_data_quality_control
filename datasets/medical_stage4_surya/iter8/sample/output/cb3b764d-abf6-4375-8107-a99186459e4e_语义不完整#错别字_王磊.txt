position in the trachea. False-positive readings (ie, CO  is detected but the tube is located in the esophagus) have been observed in animals after ingestion of large amounts of carbonated liquids before the arrest; however, the waveform does not continue during subsequent breaths.False-negative readings (defined in this context as failure to detect CO  despite tube placement in the trachea) may be present during cardiac arrest for several reasons. The most common is that blood flow and delivery of CO  to the lungs is low. False-negative results also have been reported in association with pulmonary embolus because pulmonary blood flow and delivery of CO  to the lungs are reduced. If the detector is contaminated with gastric contents or acidic drugs (eg, endotracheally administered epinephrine), a colorimetric device may display a constant color rather than breath-to-breath color change. In addition, elimination and detection of CO  can be drastically reduced with severe airway obstruction (eg, status asthmaticus) and pulmonary edema.  For these reasons, if CO  is not detected, we recommend that a second method be used to confirm endotracheal tube placement, such as direct visualization or the esophageal detector device.
Use of CO  -detecting devices to determine the correct placement of other advanced airways (eg, Combitube, laryngeal mask airway) has not been studied; their utility will depend on airway design. However, effective ventilation through a supraglottic airway device should result in capnograph waveform during CPR and after ROSC.
Esophageal Detector Devices.  The EDD consists of a bulb that is compressed and attached to the endotracheal tube. If the tube is in the esophagus (positive result for an EDD), the suction created by the EDD will collapse the lumen of the esophagus or pull the esophageal tissue against the tip of the tube, and the bulb will not re-expand. The EDD may also consist of a syringe that is attached to the endotracheal tube; the provider attempts to pull the barrel of the syringe. If the tube is in the esophagus, it will not be possible to pull the barrel (aspirate air) with the syringe.
However, studies of the syringe aspiration EDD and the self-inflating bulb EDD  indicate that the accuracy of these devices does not exceed that of auscultation and direct visualization for confirming the tracheal position of an endotracheal tube in victims of cardiac arrest. Given the simplicity of the EDD, it can be used as the initial method for confirming correct tube placement in addition to clinical assessment in the victim of cardiac arrest when waveform capnography is not available (Class IIa, LOE B).

【1】The EDD may yield misleading results in patients with morbid obesity, late pregnancy, or status asthmaticus, or when there are copious endotracheal secretions,  because the trachea tends to collapse in the presence of these conditions. There is no evidence that the EDD is accurate for the continued monitoring of endotracheal tube placement.

【2】Thoracic Impedance. Transthoracic impedance is slightly but significantly higher during inspiration than during exhalation.Air is a poor electric conductor. Preliminary studies suggest that changes in thoracic impedance, as measured through standard defibrillation pads, may distinguish tracheal from esophageal intubations.There are  published reports involving  patients where ventilation-induced changes in thoracic impedance disappeared after esophageal intubation.There is little evidence for the use of thoracic impedance in diagnosing adequacy of ventilation during CPR.  Treatment decisions should not be based solely on thoracic impedance measurements until further study has confirmed its utility and accuracy in this population.

【3】Postintubation Airway Management After inserting and confirming correct placement of an endotracheal tube, the provider should record the depth of the tube as marked at the front teeth or gums and secure it.
There is significant potential for endotracheal tube movement with head flexion and extension  and when the patient is moved from one location to another.
Continuous monitoring of endotracheal tube placement with waveform capnography is recommended as discussed above. The endotracheal tube should be secured with tape or a commercial device (Class I, LOE C). Devices and tape should be applied in a manner that avoids compression of the front and sides of the neck, which may impair venous return from the brain.
One out-of-hospital study  studies in an intensivecare settingindicate that backboards, commercial devices for securing the endotracheal tube, and other strategies provide equivalent methods for preventing inadvertent tube displacement when compared with traditional methods of securing the tube (tape). These devices may be considered during patient transport (Class IIb, LOE C). After tube confirmation and fixation, obtain a chest x-ray (when feasible) to confirm that the end of the endotracheal tube is properly positioned above the carina.

【4】##Ventilation After Advanced Airway Placement

【5】Except for respiratory rate, it is unknown whether monitoring ventilatory parameters (eg, minute ventilation, peak pressure) during CPR will influence outcome. However, positivepressure ventilation increases intrathoracic pressure and may reduce venous return and cardiac output, especially in patients with hypovolemia or obstructive airway disease. Ventilation at high respiratory rates (> 25 breaths per minute) is common during resuscitation from cardiac arrest.  In animal models, slower ventilation rates (6 to 12 breaths per minute) are associated with improved hemodynamic parameters and short-term survival.
Because cardiac output is lower than normal during cardiac arrest, the need for ventilation is reduced. Following placement of an advanced airway, the provider delivering ventilations should perform  breath every 6 to 8 seconds (8 to 10 breaths per minute) without pausing in applying chest compressions (unless ventilation is inadequate when compressions are not paused) (Class IIb, LOE C). Monitoring respiratory rate coupled with real-time feedback during CPR may result in better compliance with ventilation guidelines.王磊
