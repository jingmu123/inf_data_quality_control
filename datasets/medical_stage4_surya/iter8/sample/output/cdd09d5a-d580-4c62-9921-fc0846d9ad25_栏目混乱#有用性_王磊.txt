【1】##Does The World Need Gm Foods?

【2】ROBERT B. HORSCH, vice president of product and technology cooperation at Monsanto Company, received the  National Medal of Technology for his pioneering experiments in the genetic modification of plant cells. He talks about the promise of GM crops.

【3】Two leading figures in the debate over genetic engineering defēnd their stances Interviews by Sasha Nemecek How did you become interested in the genetic modification of plants?
I started in this field with a strong interest in plants but with what you might call an academic interest in agriculture. I had this vague, naive notion that if we could genetically improve plants with the new tools of molecular biology, we would find a way to make biotechnology relevant to agriculture.
That has now happened. Biotechnology is a great tool that will allow us to produce more food on less land and with less depletion or damage to water resources and biodiversity. I am convinced that biotechnology is not just relevant but imperative for helping us meet the rapidly growing demand for food and other agricultural products. The combination of more people and rising incomes will increase the demand for food by at least 50 percent in the next 25 years.

【4】But critics of genetically modified foods point out that companies are not going to start giving products away. Can a corporation like Monsanto make biotechnology affordable for farmers in the developing world?
Cultivating commercial markets and applying technology to help the developing world are not mutually exclusive at all. One approach that works very well is to segment the market into three different areas. One is the pure commercial market. It makes economic sense, as a forprofit company, for us to invest in products and market developments in places where we can sell our products and where we think we can make a profit.
The other end of the spectrum is noncommercial technology transfer, which is largely focused on public-sector collaboration. Take, for example, our collaboration to put virus-resistance genes in the sweet potato. We will never have a commercial business in the sweet potato because it's just not a market economy crop. But by sharing our intellectual property and our technical knowledge with scientists from Kenya, we have helped them develop sweet potatoes that show resistance to the most serious sweet potato disease in Africa, which can cause the loss of 20 to 80 percent of the crop.
Then there's a third area, what I call a transitional market, where we have less experience related to biotechnology but that in the long run I think may be more powerful and beneficial for development efforts. We have used this approach with our older, nonbiotech products, PHOTOGRAPHS BY TOM WOLFF王磊
