##43. What Are Asthma "Triggers"?
Gemma'S Comment:

【1】My daughter and I seem to be especially sensitive to certain foods, like soy and nuts. My daughter feels that if she has a cold, the skin of some foods (e.g., peaches and eggplant) make her throat "close up." I, too, have had such symptoms, but I think that food sensitivities, which are quite different from taste preferences, change over time.

【2】Asthma triggers are exposures that precipitate or worsen a person's asthma . Some triggers are nearly universal. Most people with asthma will notice that a respiratory infection, bronchitis, or a chest cold will worsen their asthma. Inhalation of very cold air
