are going to exert a force between 230 g to 400 g per side, and are going to be inserted from the protraction hooks of the Hass type expander to the horizontal rod of the anterior arch.  The chin cup serves as geniomolar anchorage to facilitate the forward movement of the maxilla. The direction of the elastics must be downward and forward, from the upper protraction hooks to the horizontal rod of the protraction arch, following the normal path of maxillary growth.

【1】##Advantages

【2】##1. It Is Economic.

【3】2. Easy to make.

【4】3. It is more esthetic than a face mask so it is more likely to be used by the patient.
Corrects the malocclusion and has a positive effect upon the profile on the patient.
Produces consistent results in a brief time period.
Produces between 2 mm to 3 mm of protraction.
The Mini-maxillar protractor is an effective tool for the correction of mild to moderate skeletal Class III malocclusions, with a retrusive maxilla and a hypo divergent growth pattern.
The use of the Mini-maxillar protractor produces an increase of the lower third of the face, this is due to the downward movement of the maxilla and a downward and backward rotation of the mandible.
It reduces the possibility of a future surgical procedure.

【5】10. In general, skeletal Class III patients present a concave profile, depression of the nasomaxillar region, lower lip protrusion and a prominent mandible. With the protraction effect of the appliance the facial profile and the position of the lower lip is rectified.
Clinically the anterior crossed bites can be corrected in 3 to 4 months of treatment , depending on the severity of the case.
The maxilla can be brought forward 2 mm to 4 mm in about 8 to 12 months of protraction, but the majority of orthopedic changes will be observed in the first 3 to 6 months of continuous treatment.  )

【6】##Disadvantages

【7】A faulty design of the chin cup can irritate the skin of the chin and root resoption of the lower incisors.
The expander can accumulate food particles and cause gingival irritation.
We must invest laboratory time to fabricate the appliance.

【8】4. The force produced by the elastics can debond the upper skidding surface.
We need 100 % cooperation of the patient.
The elastics can irritate the skin of the chin and the corners of the mouth.

【9】7. The patient can refer sharp pain in the retromolar zone because the pterygo-maxillary suture opens.

【10】##Recommendations

【11】1. Following the maxillary protraction protocol, we must begin with the upper expansion in order to disarticulate the sutures and to facilitate the advance of the maxilla, so we must indicate to the patient that王磊
