ered for specialty care, particularly if their asthma control is inadequate. The preferred treatment for moderate persistent asthma in children older than 5 years of age and for adults is a combination of a long-acting, inhaled β  agonist and low-to-medium doses of inhaled corticosteroids. The combination has been shown to lead to improvements in lung function and in symptoms, while allowing for reduction in required doses of quick-relief, short-acting β  agonists. Alternative therapy consists of a combination of either a leukotriene modifier, or sustained-release theophylline, and low-to-medium doses of inhaled corticosteroids.

【1】Exacerbations are best identified early and treated aggressively as in mild persistent asthma. Oral steroid bursts are commonly required.

【2】##36. What Constitutes “Severe Persistent Asthma"?

【3】The category of severe persistent asthma is the most serious form of asthma in the NAEPP's expert panel report. Symptoms in severe persistent asthma occur continually; nocturnal symptoms are frequent . Lung function testing yields compromised FEV  and peak flow values of less than or equal to 60% of predicted. The peak flow varies by more than 30% from personal best baseline values.

【4】All patients with asthma (of any severity) should be prescribed inhaled "quick-relief" bronchodilator therapy to be used when and if symptoms develop, on an as-needed basis. A short-acting, inhaled β  agonist is the recommended quick-relief agent for older children and adults. Very young children and infants might黄艳玲
