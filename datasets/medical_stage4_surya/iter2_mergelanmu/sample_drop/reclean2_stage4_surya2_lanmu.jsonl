The book has a stock of more than 1,000 clinical photographs in which we explain \"different methods to do the same thing\" meaning that we point out many ways to close, open or uncross a bite. We include different molar distalizers, how to provide anchorage or how to close spaces; in this manner, multiple treatment options are shown for an identical problem, orthodontic or orthopedic in nature.\n\n【1】Our book consists of ten chapters, which we will describe briefly:\n\n【2】Chapter 1. Action and reaction. In an informative and straightforward approach we:\n\n【3】Describe how and why teeth move orthodontically, and the effects at bone and dental levels.\n\n【4】The three laws of Newton and their clinical application during orthodontic treatment.\n\n【5】A simple and easy description on how to understand the physics laws that we utilize in an orthodontic treatment. The use of forces, resultant forces, coplanar forces, center of resistance, center of rotation, moment, types of dental movements and their physiology, dental equilibrium and first, second and third order bends are clearly explained.\n\n【6】Chapter 2. Anchorage. In this chapter we examine the different types of anchorage utilized during orthodontic treatment, such as when to use minimal, moderate, maximum or absolute anchorage, their advantages, disadvantages and recommendations for each one.\n\n【7】Chapter 3. Space closure in orthodontics. We present a whole array of different modalities for dental space closure, from the classical elastic chain to the use of coils, wire bends and retroligatures. We also describe the forces produced by each of these additions, in the case they can be used, the advantages, disadvantages and recommendations of each one.\n\n【8】Chapter 4. Deep bite. Description of the different types of deep bites and their etiology, and the possible treatment plans for correction. We mention here why and how to use a bite plane, the use of bite ramps, bypass, why should braces be bonded near the incisal edge to help correct this problem, when to use an intrusion bend or a Tip back, how to use and how can reverse curves help us to correct a deep bite, the use of in-block intrusion arch wires like the intrusion arch of Dr. Oscar Quiroz, the utility arch wire, the CIA and intrusive arches with loops. All these additions have advantages, disadvantages and recommendations, which are clearly explained.\n\n【9】Chapter 5. Open bite. This is one of the most difficult types of malocclusions to treat because it has a high relapse rate. As in the deep bite chapter, we describe the different causes and the different types of open bite, and their possible treatments. We discuss how we use in block extrusion bends or in an individual manner, the benefits of palatal plates and the advantages of using reverse curves on the maxilla and a curve on the mandible in order to close an anterior open bite; why brace bonding near the gingival margin helps us, cases in which we can use an individual or In block By-pass, the use of an inverted\n\n【10】.\n\n【11】.\n\n【12】.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "' he book 1,001 Tips For Orthodontics and its Secrets has been written in a simple and", "bbox": [238.0, 250.0, 721.0, 267.0]}, {"text": "didactic way for easy reading and understanding, ideal for the dental student, orth-", "bbox": [259.0, 266.0, 721.0, 282.0]}, {"text": "odontic resident or specialist.

In other words, we needed a parallel-processing system. So in 1996 we wrote a proposal to buy 64 new PCs containing Pentium II microprocessors and construct a Beowulf-class supercomputer. Alas, this idea sounded implausible to the reviewers at ORNL, who turned down our proposal.\n\n【1】Undeterred, we devised an alternative plan. We knew that obsolete PCs at the U.S. Department of Energy complex at Oak Ridge were frequently replaced with newer models. The old PCs were advertised on an internal Web site and auctioned off as surplus equipment. A quick check revealed hundreds of outdated computers waiting to be discarded this way.\n\n【2】cation among the nodes and therefore can be solved very quickly by parallel-processing systems.\n\n【3】Anyone building a Beowulf cluster must make several decisions in designing the system. To connect the PCs, researchers can use either standard Ethernet networks or faster, specialized networks, such as Myrinet. Our lack of a budget dictated that we use Ethernet, which is free. We chose one PC to be the front-end node of the cluster and installed two Ethernet cards into the machine. One card was for communicating with outside users, and the other was for talking with the rest of the nodes, which would be linked in their own private network. The PCs coordinate their tasks by sending messages to one another. The two disk, lots of memory or (best of all) an upgraded motherboard donated to us by accident? Often all we found was a tired old veteran with a fan choked with dust.\n\n【4】Our room at Oak Ridge turned into a morgue filled with the picked-over carcasses of dead PCs. Once we opened a machine, we recorded its contents on a \"toe tag\" to facilitate the extraction of its parts later on. We developed favorite and least favorite brands, models and cases and became adept at thwarting passwords left by previous owners. On average, we had to collect and process about five PCs to make one good node.\n\n【5】As each new node joined the cluster, we loaded the Linux operating system onto the machine. We soon figured out how to eliminate the need to install a key-\n\n【6】Our room at Oak Ridge TURNED INTO A MORGUE filled with\n\n【7】## The Picked-Over Carcasses Of Dead Pcs.\n\n【8】Perhaps we could build our Beowulf cluster from machines that we could collect and recycle free of charge. We commandeered a room at ORNL that had previously housed an ancient mainframe computer. Then we began collecting surplus PCs to create the Stone SouperComputer.\n\n【9】## A Digital Chop Shop\n\n【10】THE STRATEGY BEHIND parallel computing is \"divide and conquer.\" A parallel-processing system divides a complex problem into smaller component tasks.\n\n【11】The tasks are then assigned to the system's nodes—for example, the PCs in a Beowulf cluster—which tackle the components simultaneously. The efficiency of parallel processing depends largely on the nature of the problem. An important consideration is how often the nodes must communicate to coordinate their work.\n\n【12】and to share intermediate results. Some problems must be divided into myriad minuscule tasks; because these finegrained problems require frequent internode communication, they are not well suited for parallel processing. Coarsegrained problems, in contrast, can be divided into relatively large chunks. These problems do not require much communi- most popular message-passing libraries are message-passing interface (MPI) and parallel virtual machine (PVM), which are both available at no cost on the Internet. We use both systems in the Stone SouperComputer.\n\n【13】Many Beowulf clusters are homogeneous, with all the PCs containing identical components and microprocessors.\n\n【14】This uniformity simplifies the management and use of the cluster but is not an absolute requirement. Our Stone Souper- Computer would have a mix of processor types and speeds because we intended to use whatever surplus equipment we could find. We began with PCs containing Intel 486 processors but later added only Pentium-based machines with at least 32 megabytes of RAM and 200 megabytes of hard-disk storage.\n\n【15】It was rare that machines met our minimum criteria on arrival; usually we had to combine the best components from several PCs. We set up the digital equivalent of an automobile thief's chop shop for converting surplus computers into nodes for our cluster. Whenever we opened a machine, we felt the same anticipation that a child feels when opening a birthday present: Would the computer have a big board or monitor for each node. We created mobile \"crash carts\" that could be wheeled over and plugged into an ailing node to determine what was wrong with it. Eventually someone who wanted space in our room bought us shelves to consolidate our collection of hardware. The Stone SouperComputer ran its first code in early 1997, and by May 2001 it contained 133 nodes, including 75 PCs with Intel 486 microprocessors, 53 faster Pentium-based machines and five still faster Alpha workstations, made by Compaq.\n\n【16】Upgrades to the Stone SouperComputer are straightforward: we replace the slowest nodes first. Each node runs a simple speed test every hour as part of the cluster's routine housekeeping tasks. The ranking of the nodes by speed helps us to fine-tune our cluster. Unlike commercial machines, the performance of the Stone SouperComputer continually improves, because we have an endless supply of free upgrades.\n\n【17】## Parallel Problem Solving\n\n【18】PARALLEL PROGRAMMING requires skill and creativity and may be more challenging than assembling the hardware of a Beowulf system.

The popular press sensationalized the findings by suggesting that synthetic bugs might soon be crawling out of test tubes. The scientific community was more restrained, but many workers sensed that the major obstacle to creating life in the laboratory had been solved.\n\n【1】It did not take long to disabuse researchers of that notion. Miller may have discovered a way to make many of life's building blocks out of the earth's early supply of water and gas, but he had not discovered how or where these simple units would have linked into the complex molecular structures—such as proteins and DNA—that are intrinsic to life.\n\n【2】To answer that riddle, Miller and other origins scientists began proposing rocks as props. They speculated that organic molecules, floating in seawater, might have splashed into tidal pools along rocky coastlines. These molecules would have become increasingly concentrated through repeated cycles of evaporation, like soup thickening in a heated pot.\n\n【3】In recent years, however, researchers have envisioned that life's ingredients might have accumulated in much smaller containers. Some rocks, like gray volcanic pumice, are laced with air pockets created when gases expanded inside the rock while it was still molten. Many common minerals, such as feldspar, develop microscopic pits during weathering. Each tiny chamber in each rock on the early earth could have housed a separate experiment in molecular self-organization.\n\n【4】Given enough time and enough chambers, serendipity might have produced a combination of molecules that would eventually deserve to be called \"living.\" Underlying much of this speculation was the sense that life was so fragile that it depended on rocks for survival. But in 1977 a startling discovery challenged conventional wisdom about life's fragility and, perhaps, its origins. Until then, most scientists had assumed that life spawned at or near the benign ocean surface as a result of chemistry powered by sunlight.\n\n【5】That view began to change when deepocean explorers first encountered diverse ecosystems thriving at the superheated mouths of volcanic vents on the seafloor.\n\n【6】These extreme environments manage to support elaborate communities of living creatures in isolation from the sun. In these dark realms, much of the energy that organisms need comes not from light but from the earth's internal heat.

When Mbeki, after consulting with Duesberg and other AIDS experts, told the International AIDS Conference last year that he felt \"we could not blame everything on a single virus,\" more than 5,000 scientists and physicians felt it necessary to sign the Durban Declaration, devoutly affirming their belief that HIV is the one true cause of AIDS.\n\n【5】Duesberg's arguments ultimately converted no more than a tiny minority of scientists to his view that \"the various AIDS diseases are brought on by the long-term consumption of recreational drugs and anti-HIV drugs, such as the DNA chain terminator AZT, which is prescribed to prevent or treat AIDS.\" Or, as he puts it more bluntly in Milan, in rich countries it is the toxicity of the very drugs that are prescribed to save HIV-infected people that kills them.\n\n【6】The hypothesis has never been tested directly, although Duesberg claims it could be done ethically by comparing 3,000 HIV- positive army recruits with 3,000 HIV-negative recruits matched for disease and drug use. And so his idea has died as most failed theories do, never fully disproved but convincingly rebutted—in this case by a 40-page treatise from the National Institute for Allergic and Immune Disease—and ultimately ignored by nearly everyone working in the field.\n\n【7】But Duesberg didn't even know AIDS existed in 1983, when he wrote the paper that he says first marked him as a troublemaker. The title seems innocuous: \"Retroviral Transforming Genes in Normal Cells?\" But in Duesberg papers the question mark often signals that he is about to yank on the loose threads of a popular theory. This time the theory concerned cancer.\n\n【8】He and others had shown that when certain retroviruses insinuate their genes into the cells of mice, the cells turn malignant.\n\n【9】Weinberg, Baltimore and others in the field speculated that perhaps similar genes, which they called \"proto-oncogenes,\" lie dormant in the human genome, like time bombs that turn on only if a random mutation flips some sort of genetic switch. This hypothesis spawned a cottage industry to search for oncogenes, so-called tumor suppressor genes and, most recently, cancer \"predisposition\" genes.\n\n【10】As two decades passed, human genes with sequences similar to the viral oncogenes were found, and support for this story of cancer's origin solidified. \"If you were to poll researchers,  ROLLER-COASTER CAREER of Peter H.

It is the stuff of headlines and horror films, drawing people in and mesmerizing them despite their aversion. Cannibalism represents the ultimate taboo for many in Western societies—something to relegate to other cultures, other times, other places.\n\n【2】Yet the understanding of cannibalism derived from the past few centuries of anthropological investigation has been too unclear and incomplete to allow either a categorical rejection of the practice or a fuller appreciation of when, where and why it might have taken place.\n\n【3】New scientific evidence is now bringing to light the truth about cannibalism.\n\n【4】It has become obvious that long before the invention of metals, before Egypt's pyramids were built, before the origins of agriculture, before the explosion of Upper Paleolithic cave art, cannibalism could be found among many different peoples—as well as among many of our ancestors. Broken and scattered human bones, in some cases thousands of them, have been discovered from the prehistoric pueblos of the American Southwest to the islands of the Pacific. The osteologists and archaeologists studying these ancient occurrences are using increasingly sophisticated analytical tools and methods. In the past several years, the re- sults of their studies have finally provided convincing evidence of prehistoric cannibalism.\n\n【5】Human cannibalism has long intrigued anthropologists, and they have worked for decades to classify the phenomenon. Some divide the behavior according to the affiliation of the consumed. Thus, endocannibalism refers to the consumption of individuals within a group, exocannibalism indicates the consumption of outsiders, and autocannibalism covers everything from nail biting to torture-induced self-consumption. In addition, anthropologists have come up with classifications to describe perceived or known motivations. Survival cannibalism is driven by starvation. Historically documented cases include the Donner Party— whose members were trapped during the harsh winter of 1846–47 in the Sierra Nevada—and people marooned in the Andes or the Arctic with no other food. In contrast, ritual cannibalism occurs when members of a family or community consume their dead during funerary rites in order to inherit their qualities or honor their memory. And pathological\n\n【6】A U T H O R\n\n【7】cannibalism is generally reserved for criminals who consume their victims or, more often, for fictional characters such as Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs.\n\n【8】Despite these distinctions, however, most anthropologists simply equate the term \"cannibalism\" with the regular, culturally encouraged consumption of human flesh. This dietary, customary, gourmet, gustatory or gastronomic cannibalism, as it is variously called, is the phenomenon on which ethnographers have focused much of their attention. In the age of ethnographic exploration—which lasted from the time of Greek historian Herodotus in about 400 B.C. to the early 20th century—the non-Western world and its inhabitants were scrutinized by travelers, missionaries, military personnel and anthropologists. These observers told tales of gastronomic human cannibalism in different places, from Mesoamerica to the Pacific islands to central Africa.\n\n【9】Controversy has often accompanied these claims. Professional anthropologists participated in only the last few waves of\n\n【10】TIM D.

Manufactured by EADS, the liners, which are similar in appearance to gardeners' seed trays, cost around $2.1 million each to install. Technicians are laboriously fi tting about 150 of the individually molded liner sections, jigsaw-fashion, into the tight spaces of the fuel reservoirs of each jet. In an approach already employed in military helicopters and Formula 1 racing cars, the cardboard-thin liners are designed to contain the flow of escaping fuel by being sucked into the breach should the wing skin be pierced. During the accident, kerosene gushed out at a rate of around 100 liters per second, which created a sufficiently rich fuel-air mixture to allow the fuel to burst into flames. \"The liners will stem that kind of flow, limiting it to something like a liter per second, which would not ignite,\" explains Peter Middleton, a British Airways spokesperson.\n\n【2】New puncture-resistant tires from Michelin should go a long way toward reducing the risks as well. The Concorde's original nylon bias-ply tires—the standard aviation industry design in which woven reinforcing fabric plies are stacked with their weaves set at crisscrossing angles—could be replaced by special radial tires, which have rim-to-rim reinforcement. In tests the new radials not only stand up better to incisions but when severely damaged are designed to break apart into pieces too tiny to rupture a fuel tank, says Jean Couratier, research-and-development director for Michelin Aviation Products. The tires are constructed using a proprietary high-strength reinforcement material in the belts and sidewalls that limits the expansion of the tires' diameter under pressure. \"This reduces the degree to which the rubber tread is elongated, which in turn improves its resistance to cuts and tears,\" Couratier explains. The NZG (which stands for \"near zero growth\") technology also halves the number of plies in the tire, thereby cutting tire weight by 20 percent, he notes, an attribute that will help offset the additional weight of the other safety modifications.\n\n【3】Once the refitting is complete, the modified Concorde will undergo a series of proving flights. Then civil aviation authorities will have to recertify the craft for airworthiness.\n\n【4】If everything goes smoothly, supersonic service may resume sometime this fall. The Concorde's main clientele—international bankers and business executives, transatlantic jet-setters and celebrities—will be relieved.\n\n【5】Safety modifications under way are:\n\n【6】删除0:<u>■</u> Lining fuel tanks with a Kevlarrubber compound to limit leaks ( photograph above )\n\n【7】删除0:<u>■</u> Encasing electrical wiring in the undercarriage in steel braiding\n\n【8】删除0:<u>■</u> Arranging shutdown of power to the cooling fans for the landinggear brakes during takeoff\n\n【9】删除0:<u>■</u> Installing improved fire-detection and warning systems\n\n【10】= Adopting puncture-resistant, lighter-weight tires\n\n【11】In contrast to Mercator projections, a flat-mapping technique called CARET (computerized anatomical, reconstruction and editing toolkit) preserves the area and length of objects, instead of their angles.\n\n【12】## Road Map For The Mind Old Mathematical Theorems Unfold The Human Brain   By Diane Martindale\n\n【13】II those folds and fissures make life difficult for a neuroscientist: they bury I two thirds of the brain's surface, or cortex, where most of the information processing takes place. With so much of the brain hidden, researchers have a hard time seeing exactly which parts of the cortex are doing what and how they are related to one another. \"People want to see what's in the folds,\" says Monica K. Hurdal, a computer scientist at Florida State University, who has created a computer program to flat-map the brain.\n\n【14】Conventional imaging techniques usually display cross sections of the brain, making it difficult to view the entire surface. For example, an MRI scan might show areas that look to be adjacent but are, if they have a deep fold between them, actually far apart.\n\n【15】\"Converting a sphere into a plane is not so difficult,\" Hurdal explains, \"but it does require that certain compromises be made.\" The Mercator projection of the earth, for instance, preserves shapes and angles at the expense of areas, so that the polar regions look far too large in relation to the equatorial ones.\n\n【16】The mathematical basis for the Mercator projection is an 1851 law of geometry known as the Riemann mapping theorem (although the 16th-century cartographer himself wasn't aware of it, of course).

In 1987, 24 countries, as well as the European Economic Community, negotiated and signed The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer . The initial protocol aimed to decrease the use of ozone-depleting, man-made chemicals by 50% by the year 1999. Additional supplements to the Montreal Protocol, known as the London, Copenhagen, and Beijing Amendments, were adopted in 1990, 1992, and 1999, respectively, and further addressed the use and production of various ozone-depleting chemicals, as well as a timetable for their phaseout.</u>\n\n【3】Ozone is a molecule made up of three oxygen atoms and is a essential constituent of our atmosphere. About 90% of the ozone resides in a layer between 6 and 25 miles above the Earth's surface in a zone called the stratosphere.

Open and maintain the airway with a jaw thrust, and do not tilt the head.\n\n【7】• If the airway cannot be opened with a jaw thrust, use a head tilt–chin lift because you must establish a patent airway.\n\n【8】Because of the disproportionately large head of infants and young children, optimal positioning may require recessing the occiput 336 or elevating the torso to avoid undesirable backboard-induced cervical flexion. 336 , 337 • Do not routinely hyperventilate even in case of head injury (Class III, LOE C删除6:<u>).</u>ntentional brief hyperventilation may be used as a temporizing rescue therapy if there are signs of impending brain herniation (eg, sudden rise in measured intracranial pressure, dilation of one or both pupils with decreased response to light, bradycardia, and hypertension).\n\n【9】• Suspect thoracic injury in all thoraco-abdominal trauma, even in the absence of external injuries.

Like the other signs, hypotension must be interpreted within the context of the entire clinical picture.\n\n【2】There are several sources of data that use large populations to identify the 5th percentile for systolic blood pressure at various age删除6:<u>s.</u>or purposes of these guidelines, hypotension is defined as a systolic blood pressure:  •  <60 mm Hg in term neonates (0 to 28 days) • <70 mm Hg in infants (1 month to 12 months) • < 70 mm Hg + (2 × age in years) in children 1 to 10 years •   <90 mm Hg in children ≥ 10 years of age\n\n【3】## Airway\n\n【4】Oropharyngeal and Nasopharyngeal Airways Oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal airways help maintain an open airway by displacing the tongue or soft palate from the pharyngeal air passages. Oropharyngeal airways are used in unresponsive victims who do not have a gag reflex. Make sure to select the correct size: an oropharyngeal airway that is too small may push the base of the tongue farther into the airway; one that is too large may obstruct the airway.\n\n【5】Nasopharyngeal airways can be used in children who do have a gag reflex. Pay careful attention to proper diameter and length. A nasopharyngeal airway that is too short may not maintain an open airway, while one that is too long may obstruct it. A small-diameter nasopharyngeal airway may be obstructed easily by secretions. It may therefore require frequent suctioning.\n\n【6】Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) Although several supraglottic devices have been used in children, clinical studies of devices other than the LMA in pediatric patients are limited. When bag-mask ventilation (see \"Bag-Mask Ventilation,\" below) is unsuccessful and when endotracheal intubation is not possible, the LMA is acceptable when used by experienced providers to provide a patent airway and support ventilation (Class IIa, LOE C删除6:<u>).</u>MA insertion is associated with a higher incidence of complications in young children compared with older children and adults. 38 – 43\n\n【7】## Oxygen\n\n【8】It is reasonable to ventilate with 100% oxygen during CPR because there is insufficient information on the optimal inspired oxygen concentration (Class IIa, LOE C). Once the circulation is restored, monitor systemic oxygen saturation. It may be reasonable, when the appropriate equipment is available, to titrate oxygen administration to maintain the oxyhemoglobin saturation ≥ 94%. Provided appropriate equipment is available, once ROSC is achieved, adjust the F IO 2 to the minimum concentration needed to achieve an arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation at least 94%, with the goal of avoiding hyperoxia while ensuring adequate oxygen delivery. Since an arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation of 100%\n\n【9】may correspond to a PaO 2 anywhere between ~80 and 500 mmHg, in general it is appropriate to wean the F IO 2 when saturation is 100%, provided the oxyhemoglobin saturation can be maintained ≥ 94% (Class IIb, LOE C). Remember that adequate oxygen delivery requires not only adequate arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation but also adequate hemoglobin concentration and cardiac output.\n\n【10】## Pulse Oximetry\n\n【11】If the patient has a perfusing rhythm, monitor oxyhemoglobin saturation continuously with a pulse oximeter because clinical recognition of hypoxemia is not reliabl删除6:<u>e.</u>ulse oximetry may, however, also be unreliable in patients with poor peripheral perfusion, carbon monoxide poisoning, or methemoglobinemia.\n\n【12】## Bag-Mask Ventilation\n\n【13】Bag-mask ventilation can be as effective, and may be safer, than endotracheal tube ventilation for short periods during out-of-hospital resuscitatio删除6:<u>n.</u>n the prehospital setting it is reasonable to ventilate and oxygenate infants and children with a bag-mask device, especially if transport time is short (Class IIa, LOE B). Bag-mask ventilation requires training and periodic retraining in selecting a correct mask size, maintaining an open airway, providing a tight seal between mask and face, providing ventilation, and assessing effectiveness of ventilation (see Part 13, \"Pediatric Basic Life Support\").\n\n【14】Precautions Use only the force and tidal volume needed to just make the chest rise visibly (Class I, LOE C); avoid delivering excessive ventilation during cardiac arrest (Class III, LOE C). Evidence shows that cardiac arrest victims frequently receive excessive ventilatio删除6:<u>n.</u>xcessive ventilation during cardiac arrest increases intrathoracic pressure, which impedes venous return, thus reducing cardiac output and cerebral and coronary blood flow. These effects will reduce the likelihood of ROS删除6:<u>C.</u>n addition, excessive ventilation may cause air trapping and barotrauma in patients with small airway obstruction. It also increases the risk of stomach inflation, regurgitation, and aspiration.\n\n【15】If the infant or child is not intubated, pause after 30 chest compressions (1 rescuer) or after 15 chest compressions (2 rescuers) to give 2 ventilations (mouth-to-mouth, mouth-tomask, or bag-mask). Deliver each breath with an inspiratory time of approximately 1 second. If the infant or child is intubated, ventilate at a rate of about 1 breath every 6 to 8 seconds (8 to 10 times per minute) without interrupting chest compressions (Class I, LOE C). It may be reasonable to do the same if an LMA is in place (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【16】In the victim with a perfusing rhythm but absent or inadequate respiratory effort, give 1 breath every 3 to 5 seconds (12 to 20 breaths per minute), using the higher rate for the younger child (Class I, LOE C).

Both rescuers should observe the victim's chest to ensure chest rise.\n\n【1】## Gastric Inflation\n\n【2】Gastric inflation may interfere with effective ventilation 59 and cause regurgitation, aspiration of stomach contents, and further ventilatory compromise. The risk of gastric inflation can be decreased by  • Avoiding excessive peak inspiratory pressures by ventilating slowly and giving only enough tidal volume to just achieve visible chest rise. 45 • Applying cricoid pressure in an unresponsive victim to reduce air entry into the stomach (Class IIa, LOE B删除6:<u>).</u>his may require a third rescuer if cricoid pressure cannot be applied by the rescuer who is securing the bag to the face. Avoid excessive cricoid pressure so as not to obstruct the trachea (Class III, LOE B). 63 • Passing a nasogastric or orogastric tube to relieve gastric inflation, especially if oxygenation and ventilation are compromised. Pass the tube after intubation because a gastric tube interferes with gastroesophageal sphincter function, allowing regurgitation during intubation. If a gastrostomy tube is present, vent it during bag-mask ventilation to allow gastric decompression.\n\n【3】## Ventilation With An Endotracheal Tube\n\n【4】Endotracheal intubation in infants and children requires special training because the pediatric airway anatomy differs from that of the adult. The likelihood of successful endotracheal tube placement with minimal complications is related to the length of training, supervised experience in the operating room and in the field, 64.65 adequate ongoing experience, 66 and use of rapid sequence intubation (RSI删除2:<u> 67.68</u>\n\n【5】## Rapid Sequence Intubation (Rsi)\n\n【6】To facilitate emergency intubation and reduce the incidence of complications, skilled, experienced providers may use sedatives, neuromuscular blocking agents, and other medications to rapidly sedate and neuromuscularly block the pediatric patien删除6:<u>t.</u>se RSI only if you are trained, and have experience using these medications and are proficient in the evaluation and management of the pediatric airway.

In the operating room, cuffed endotracheal tubes are associated with a higher likelihood of correct selection of tube size, thus achieving a lower reintubation rate with no increased risk of perioperative complication删除6:<u>s.</u>n intensive care settings the risk of complications in infants and in children is no greater with cuffed tubes than with noncuffed tube删除6:<u>s.</u>uffed endotracheal tubes may decrease the risk of aspiratio删除6:<u>n.</u>f cuffed endotracheal tubes are used, cuff inflating pressure should be monitored and limited according to manufacturer's instruction (usually less than 20 to 25 cm H 2 O).\n\n【12】In certain circumstances (eg, poor lung compliance, high airway resistance, or a large glottic air leak) a cuffed endotracheal tube may be preferable to an uncuffed tube, provided that attention is paid to endotracheal tube size, position, and cuff inflation pressure (Class IIa, LOE B删除2:<u>88,91,92</u>\n\n【13】## Endotracheal Tube Size\n\n【14】Length-based resuscitation tapes are helpful and more accurate than age-based formula estimates of endotracheal tube size for children up to approximately 35 kg, 77 . 95 . 96 even for children with short statur删除6:<u>e.</u>n preparation for intubation with either a cuffed or an uncuffed endotracheal tube, confirm that tubes with an internal diameter (ID) 0.5  mm smaller and 0.5  mm larger than the estimated size are available. During intubation, if the endotracheal tube meets resistance, place a tube 0.5 mm smaller instead.\n\n【15】Following intubation, if there is a large glottic air leak that interferes with oxygenation or ventilation, consider replacing the tube with one that is 0.5 mm larger, or place a cuffed tube of the same size if an uncuffed tube was used originally. Note that replacement of a functional endotracheal tube is associated with risk; the procedure should be undertaken in an appropriate setting by experienced personnel.\n\n【16】If an uncuffed endotracheal tube is used for emergency intubation, it is reasonable to select a 3.5-mm ID tube for infants up to one year of age and a 4.0-mm ID tube for patients between 1 and 2 years of age. After age 2, uncuffed endotracheal tube size can be estimated by the following formula:\n\n【17】## Uncuffed Endotracheal Tube Id (Mm)=4+(Age/4)\n\n【18】If a cuffed tube is used for emergency intubation of an infant less than 1 year of age, it is reasonable to select a 3.0 mm ID tube. For children between 1 and 2 years of age, it is reasonable to use a cuffed endotracheal tube with an internal diameter of 3.5 mm (Class IIa, LOE B删除6:<u>).</u>fter age 2 it is reasonable to estimate tube size with the following formula (Class IIa, LOE B: 89,98–101 ):\n\n【19】Cuffed endotracheal tube ID (mm)=3.5+(age/4)\n\n【20】## Verification Of Endotracheal Tube Placement\n\n【21】There is a risk of endotracheal tube misplacement (ie, in the esophagus, the pharynx above the vocal cords, or a mainstem bronchus) and an ongoing risk of displacement or obstruction, 45 . 102 especially during patient transpor删除6:<u>t.</u>ince no single confirmation technique, including clinical signs104 or\n\n【22】删除13:<u>删除12:<u>Downloaded from http://circ.ahajournals.org/ by guest on September 4, 2011</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "airway obstruction, poor lung compliance, or the rescuer has", "bbox": [60.0, 84.0, 376.0, 99.0]}, {"text": "difficulty in creating a tight mask-to-face seal. 57. 58 One", "bbox": [60.0, 100.0, 376.0, 113.0]}, {"text": "rescuer uses both hands to maintain an open airway with a", "bbox": [60.0, 115.0, 376.0, 129.0]}, {"text": "jaw thrust and a tight mask-to-face seal while the other", "bbox": [60.0, 131.0, 376.0, 145.0]}, {"text": "compresses the ventilation bag.

These arrhythmias are not due to a circulating circuit but to an excited automatic focus. Unlike the abrupt pattern of reentry, the characteristic onset and termination of these tachyarrhythmias are more gradual and analogous to how the sinus node behaves in gradually accelerating and slowing heart rate. These automatic arrhythmias include ectopic atrial tachycardia, MAT, and junctional tachycardia. These arrhythmias can be difficult to treat, are not responsive to cardioversion, and are usually controlled acutely with drugs that slow conduction through the AV node and thereby slow ventricular rate.\n\n【1】## Therapy\n\n【2】Vagal Maneuvers.  Vagal maneuvers and adenosine are the preferred initial therapeutic choices for the termination of stable PSVT 删除5:<u>(Figure 4, Box 7)</u>. Vagal maneuvers alone (Valsalva maneuver or carotid sinus massage) will terminate up to 25% of PSVT删除6:<u>s.</u>or other SVTs, vagal maneuvers and adenosine may transiently slow the ventricular rate and potentially assist rhythm diagnosis but will not usually terminate such arrhythmias.\n\n【3】Adenosine.  If PSVT does not respond to vagal maneuvers, give 6 mg of IV adenosine as a rapid IV push through a large (eg, antecubital) vein followed by a 20 mL saline flush (Class I, LOE B). If the rhythm does not convert within 1 to 2 minutes, give a 12 mg rapid IV push using the method above.\n\n【4】Because of the possibility of initiating atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rates in a patient with WPW, a defibrillator should be available when adenosine is administered to any patient in whom WPW is a consideration. As with vagal maneuvers, the effect of adenosine on other SVTs (such as atrial fibrillation or flutter) is to transiently slow ventricular rate (which may be useful diagnostically) but not afford their termination or meaningful lasting rate control.\n\n【5】A number of studies 381–398 support the use of adenosine in the treatment of stable PSVT. Although 2 randomized clinical trials 383 , 386 documented a similar PSVT conversion rate between adenosine and calcium channel blockers, adenosine was more rapid and had fewer severe side effects than verapamil. Amiodarone as well as other antiarrhythmic agents can be useful in the termination of PSVT, but the onset of action of amiodarone is slower than that of adenosine, 399 and the potential proarrhythmic risks of these agents favor the use of safer treatment alternatives.\n\n【6】Adenosine is safe and effective in pregnanc删除6:<u>y.</u>owever, adenosine does have several important drug interactions.\n\n【7】Larger doses may be required for patients with a significant blood level of theophylline, caffeine, or theobromine. The initial dose should be reduced to 3  mg in patients taking dipyridamole or carbamazepine, those with transplanted hearts, or if given by central venous access. Side effects with adenosine are common but transient; flushing, dyspnea, and chest discomfort are the most frequently observe删除6:<u>d.</u>denosine should not be given to patients with asthma.\n\n【8】After conversion, monitor the patient for recurrence and treat any recurrence of PSVT with adenosine or a longeracting AV nodal blocking agent (eg, diltiazem or β -blocker).\n\n【9】If adenosine or vagal maneuvers disclose another form of SVT (such as atrial fibrillation or flutter), treatment with a longer-acting AV nodal blocking agent should be considered to afford more lasting control of ventricular rate.\n\n【10】Calcium Channel Blockers and β -Blockers.  If adenosine or vagal maneuvers fail to convert PSVT 删除5:<u>(Figure 4, Box 7)</u>, PSVT recurs after such treatment, or these treatments disclose a different form of SVT (such as atrial fibrillation or flutter), it is reasonable to use longer-acting AV nodal blocking agents, such as the nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil and diltiazem) (Class IIa, LOE B) or β -blockers (Class IIa, LOE C). These drugs act primarily on nodal tissue either to terminate the reentry PSVTs that depend on conduction through the AV node or to slow the ventricular response to other SVTs by blocking conduction through the AV node. The alternate mechanism of action and longer duration of these drugs may result in more sustained termination of PSVT or afford more sustained rate control of atrial arrhythmias (such as atrial fibrillation or flutter). A number of studies have established the effectiveness of verapamil 381,383,384,386,394, 398,402–405 and diltiazem 402,406,407 in converting PSVT to normal sinus rhythm.\n\n【11】For verapamil, give a 2.5 mg to 5 mg IV bolus over 2 minutes (over 3 minutes in older patients). If there is no therapeutic response and no drug-induced adverse event, repeated doses of 5 mg to 10 mg may be administered every 15 to 30 minutes to a total dose of 20 mg. An alternative dosing regimen is to give a 5  mg bolus every 15 minutes to a total dose of 30  mg.\n\n【12】Verapamil should be given only to patients with narrowcomplex reentry SVT or arrhythmias known with certainty to be of supraventricular origin. Verapamil should not be given to patients with wide-complex tachycardias. It should not be given to patients with impaired ventricular function or heart failure.\n\n【13】For diltiazem, give a dose of 15 mg to 20 mg (0.25 mg/kg) IV over 2 minutes; if needed, in 15 minutes give an additional IV dose of 20 mg to 25 mg (0.35 mg/kg). The maintenance infusion dose is 5 mg/hour to 15 mg/hour, titrated to heart rate.\n\n【14】A wide variety of IV β -blockers are available for treatment of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. These include metoprolol, atenolol, propranolol, esmolol, and labetolol (the latter more commonly used for acute management of hypertension than for arrhythmias). In principle these agents exert their effect by antagonizing sympathetic tone in nodal tissue, resulting in slowing of conduction. Like calcium channel blockers, they also have negative inotropic effects and further reduce cardiac output in patients with heart failure. More detailed information is provided below. Side effects of β -blockers can include bradycardias, AV conduction delays, and hypotension. β -blockers should be used with caution in patients with obstructive pulmonary disease or congestive heart failure.\n\n【15】Caution is advised when encountering pre-excited atrial fibrillation or flutter that conducts to the ventricles via both the AV node and an accessory pathway. Treatment with an AV nodal blocking agent (including adenosine, calcium blockers, β -blockers, or digoxin) is unlikely to slow the ventricular rate and in some instances may accelerate the ventricular response.\n\n【16】Therefore, AV nodal blocking drugs should not be used for pre-excited atrial fibrillation or flutter (Class III, LOE C).\n\n【17】Caution is also advised to avoid the combination of AV nodal blocking agents that have a longer duration of action. For example, the short elimination half-life of adenosine affords follow-up treatment, if required, with a calcium channel blocker or b -blocker. Conversely the longer half-life of a calcium channel or β -blocker means their effects will overlap; profound bradycardia can develop if they are given serially.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "Yet another group of SVTs is referred to as automatic", "bbox": [76.0, 85.0, 375.0, 100.0]}, {"text": "tachycardias.

In light of this uncertainty, all pediatric and adult patients who suffer cardiac arrest in the hospital setting should have resuscitative attempts initiated unless the patient has a valid DNAR order or has objective signs of irreversible death (eg, dependent lividity).\n\n【7】Unlike other medical interventions, CPR is initiated without a physician's order, based on implied consent for emergency treatment. A licensed physician's order is necessary to withhold CPR in the hospital setting. Physicians should initiate a discussion about the use of CPR with all patients admitted for medical and surgical care or with their surrogates. Terminally ill patients may fear abandonment and pain more than death, so physicians should also reassure the patient and family that control of pain and other symptoms as well as other aspects of support will continue even if resuscitation is withheld.\n\n【8】The attending physician should write the DNAR order in accordance with local policy in the patient's chart, with a note explaining the rationale for the DNAR order, other specific limitations of care, and documenting discussions with the patient, surrogate, and family. Oral DNAR orders are not acceptable. The limitation-of-treatment order should provide explicit instructions for specific emergency interventions that may arise, including the use of vasopressor agents, mechanical ventilation, blood products, or antibiotics. The scope of a DNAR order should specify which interventions are to be withheld.\n\n【9】It is important to emphasize that all other care should be administered without delay and as appropriate for all patients. A DNAR order does not automatically preclude interventions such as administration of parenteral fluids, nutrition, oxygen, analgesia, sedation, antiarrhythmics, or vasopressors, unless these are included in the order. Some patients may choose to accept defibrillation and chest compressions but not intubation and mechanical ventilation. DNAR orders carry no implications about other forms of treatment, and other aspects of the treatment plan should be documented separately and communicated to members of the healthcare team. DNAR orders should be reviewed periodically as per local protocol, particularly if the patient's condition change删除6:<u>s.</u>NAR orders should also be reviewed before surgery by the anesthesiologist, attending surgeon, and patient or surrogate to determine their applicability in the operating suite and during the immediate postoperative recovery perio删除2:<u> 43</u>\n\n【10】No predictors of pediatric (infant or child) resuscitative success or failure have been establishe删除6:<u>d.</u>o validated clinical decision rules to guide the termination of resuscitative efforts in pediatric cardiac arrest have been reported, and the decision to stop resuscitation may vary considerably across physicians and institutions. Further research in this area is needed.\n\n【11】In the absence of clinical decision rules, the responsible clinician should stop the resuscitative attempt if there is a high degree of certainty that the patient will not respond to further pediatric advanced life support. Arrest characteristics to be considered by physicians making decisions may include duration of CPR, witnessed event, number of doses of epinephrine, etiology of arrest, first and subsequent rhythm, and age. 49 , 52 -- 56 Prolonged efforts are typically made for infants and children with recurring or refractory VF or VT, those who demonstrate some ROSC, those with drug toxicity, or those experiencing an event causing primary hypothermia. Prolonged efforts are also indicated when a decision to employ extracorporeal CPR (ECPR) has been made (see Part 14: \"Pediatric Advanced Life Support\").\n\n【12】Adult IHCA In the hospital the decision to terminate resuscitative efforts rests with the treating physician and is based on consideration of many factors, including witnessed versus unwitnessed arrest, time to CPR, initial arrest rhythm, time to defibrillation, comorbid disease, prearrest state, and whether there is ROSC at some point during the resuscitative efforts. Clinical decision rules for in-hospital termination of resuscitation may be helpful in reducing variability in decision making 57 ; however, the evidence for their reliability is limited, and rules should be prospectively validated before adoption.\n\n【13】In the past, family members have often been excluded from being present during the attempted resuscitation of a child or other relative.

Such processor clusters should be available later this year. Although we expect computer prices to continue to fall as they have for the past few decades, it will still be a bit of a wait before tele-immersion becomes inexpensive enough for widespread use. The cost of an eightprocessor cluster is anticipated to be in the $30,000 to $50,000 range at introduction, and a number of those would be required for each site (one for each trio of cameras)—and this does not even account for ## More To Explore\n\n【5】删除10:<u>## National Tele-Immersion Initiative Web Site: Www.Advanced.Org/Teleimmersion.Html</u>\n\n【6】删除13:<u>删除10:<u>Tele-immersion at Brown University: www.cs.brown.edu/~lsh/telei</u>.删除13:<u>html Tele-immersion at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill: www.cs.unc.edu/Research/stc/ teleimmersion/ Tele-immersion at the University of Pennsylvania: www</u>删除13:<u>.cis.upenn.edu/~sequence/teleim1</u>.删除13:<u>html Tele-immersion site at Internet2: www.internet2.edu/html/tele-immersion</u>.删除13:<u>html Information about an autostereoscopic display: www.mrl.nyu.edu/projects/autostereo the processing needed for other tasks</u>. We don't yet know how many cameras will be required for a given use of tele-immersion, but currently a good guess is that seven is the minimum adequate for casual conversation, whereas 60 cameras might be needed for the most demanding applications, such as long-distance surgical demonstration, consultation and training.</u>\n\n【7】Our computational needs go beyond processing the image streams from the sea of cameras. Still more processors are required to resynthesize and render the scene from shifting perspectives as a participant's head moves during a session.\n\n【8】Initially we used a large custom graphics computer, but more recently we have been able instead to draft commodity processors with low-cost graphics cards, using one processor per eye. Additional processors are required for other tasks, such as combining the results from each of the camera trios, running the imperceptible structured light, measuring the head motion of the user, maintaining the user interface, and running virtual-object simulations.\n\n【9】Furthermore, because minimizing ap- parent latency is at the heart of tele-immersion engineering, significant processing resources will eventually need to be applied to predictive algorithms. Information traveling through an optical fiber reaches a destination at about two thirds the speed of light in free space because it is traveling through the fiber medium instead of a vacuum and because it does not travel a straight path but rather bounces around in the fiber channel. It therefore takes anywhere from 25 to 50 milliseconds for fiber-bound bits of information to cross the continental U.S., without any allowances for other inescapable delays, such as the activities of various network signal routers.\n\n【10】By cruel coincidence, some critical aspects of a virtual world's responsiveness should not be subject to more than 30 to 50 milliseconds of delay. Longer delays result in user fatigue and disorientation, a degradation of the illusion and, in the worst case, nausea. Even if we had infinitely fast computers at each end, we'd still need to use prediction to compensate for lag when conducting conversations", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "SEVEN CAMERAS scrutinize the user in the tele-", "bbox": [44.0, 535.0, 244.0, 549.0]}, {"text": "immersion setup in Chapel Hill.", "bbox": [44.0, 552.0, 175.0, 565.0]}], "block_type": "Caption", "full_blocks": [43.0, 534.0, 243.0, 564.0], "position": 1}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "possible to hasten the day when tele-im-", "bbox": [45.0, 583.0, 260.0, 597.0]}, {"text": "mersion will be reproducible outside the", "bbox": [45.0, 599.0, 261.0, 614.0]}, {"text": "lab.

Instead these 2010 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC are intended to reflect the interpretation of the Consensus on Science by the AHA writing groups and members of the ECC Committee and its subcommittees. Whenever possible, the AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC are consistent with the 2010 ILCOR International Consensus on CPR and ECC Science With Treatment Recommendations statements, and they reference the supporting science publications. However, the 2010 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC also take into consideration local resources, training and education issues, available healthcare systems, and cost-effectiveness. That translation often must balance an acknowledgment of the limitations of systems with an effort to advocate for the care most likely to improve survival from cardiac arrest.\n\n【5】## Summary\n\n【6】In summary, the evidence review process has attempted to provide a systematic review of the scientific literature using a priori defined methods. The details and steps of the literature review are transparent and replicable. External opinions and community critique are highly valued, and the final products represent the combined labor of hundreds of participants.

This 30:2 ratio in adults is based on a consensus among experts and on published case serie删除6:<u>s.</u>urther studies are needed to define the best method for coordinating chest compressions and ventilations during CPR and to define the best compression-ventilation ratio in terms of survival and neurologic outcome in patients with or without an advanced airway in place.\n\n【2】Once an advanced airway is in place, 2 rescuers no longer need to pause chest compressions for ventilations. Instead, the compressing rescuer should give continuous chest compressions at a rate of at least 100 per minute without pauses for ventilation (Class IIa, LOE B). The rescuer delivering ventilation can provide a breath every 6 to 8 seconds (which yields 8 to 10 breaths per minute).\n\n【3】## Hands-Only Cpr\n\n【4】Only about 20% to 30% of adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrests receive any bystander CP删除6:<u>R.</u>ands-Only (compression-only) bystander CPR substantially improves survival following adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrests compared with no bystander CP删除6:<u>R.</u>bservational studies of adults with cardiac arrest treated by lay rescuers showed similar survival rates among victims receiving Hands-Only CPR versus conventional CPR with rescue breath删除6:<u>s.</u>f note, some healthcare providers 114 – 116 and laypersons 116 , 117 indicate that reluctance to perform mouth-to-mouth ventilation for victims of cardiac arrest is a theoretical and potential barrier to performing bystander CPR. When actual bystanders were interviewed, however, such reluctance was not expressed; panic was cited as the major obstacle to laypersons performance of bystander CP删除6:<u>R.</u>he simpler Hands-Only technique may help overcome panic and hesitation to act.\n\n【5】How can bystander CPR be effective without rescue breathing? Initially during SCA with VF, rescue breaths are not as important as chest compressions because the oxygen level in the blood remains adequate for the first several minutes after cardiac arrest. In addition, many cardiac arrest victims exhibit gasping or agonal gasps, and gas exchange allows for some oxygenation and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) eliminatio删除6:<u>n.</u>f the airway is open, passive chest recoil during the relaxation phase of chest compressions can\n\n【6】CPR until an AED arrives, the victim wakes up, or EMS personnel take over CPR (Class IIa, LOE B).\n\n【7】Healthcare providers should interrupt chest compressions as infrequently as possible and try to limit interruptions to no longer than 10 seconds, except for specific interventions such as insertion of an advanced airway or use of a defibrillator (Class IIa, LOE C). Because of difficulties with pulse assessments, interruptions in chest compressions for a pulse check should be minimized during the resuscitation, even to determine if ROSC has occurred.\n\n【8】Because of the difficulty in providing effective chest compressions while moving the patient during CPR, the resuscitation should generally be conducted where the patient is found (Class IIa, LOE C). This may not be possible if the environment is dangerous.\n\n【9】also provide some air exchang删除6:<u>e.</u>owever, at some time during prolonged CPR, supplementary oxygen with assisted ventilation is necessary. The precise interval for which the performance of Hands-Only CPR is acceptable is not known at this tim删除6:<u>e.</u>aypersons should be encouraged to provide chest compressions (either Hands-Only or conventional CPR, including rescue breaths) for anyone with a presumed cardiac arrest (Class I, LOE B). No prospective study of adult cardiac arrest has demonstrated that layperson conventional CPR provides better outcomes than Hands-Only CPR when provided before EMS arrival. A recent large study of out-of-hospital pediatric cardiac arrests showed that survival was better when conventional CPR (including rescue breaths) as opposed to Hands- Only CPR was provided for children in cardiac arrest due to noncardiac cause删除6:<u>s.</u>ecause rescue breathing is an important component for successful resuscitation from pediatric arrests (other than sudden, witnessed collapse of adolescents), from asphyxial cardiac arrests in both adults and children (eg, drowning, drug overdose) and from prolonged cardiac arrests, conventional CPR with rescue breathing is recommended for all trained rescuers (both in hospital and out of hospital) for those specific situations (Class IIa, LOE C 109 , 123 , 127 – 129 ).\n\n【10】## Managing The Airway\n\n【11】As previously stated, a significant change in these Guidelines is to recommend the initiation of chest compressions before ventilations (CAB rather than ABC). This change reflects the growing evidence of the importance of chest compressions and the reality that setting up airway equipment takes time.\n\n【12】The ABC mindset may reinforce the idea that compressions should wait until ventilations have begun. This mindset can occur even when more than 1 rescuer is present because \"airway and breathing before ventilations\" is so ingrained in many rescuers. This new emphasis on CAB helps clarify that airway maneuvers should be performed quickly and efficiently so that interruptions in chest compressions are minimized and chest compressions should take priority in the resuscitation of an adult.\n\n【13】## Open The Airway: Lay Rescuer\n\n【14】The trained lay rescuer who feels confident that he or she can perform both compressions and ventilations should open the airway using a head tilt–chin lift maneuver (Class IIa, LOE B).\n\n【15】For the rescuer providing Hands-Only CPR, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of any specific passive airway (such as hyperextending the neck to allow passive ventilation).\n\n【16】Open the Airway: Healthcare Provider A healthcare provider should use the head tilt–chin lift maneuver to open the airway of a victim with no evidence of head or neck trauma. Although the head tilt–chin lift technique was developed using unconscious, paralyzed adult volunteers and has not been studied in victims with cardiac arrest, clinical 130 and radiographic evidence 131 . 132 and a case series 133 have shown it to be effective (Class IIa, LOE B).\n\n【17】Between 0.12 and 3.7% of victims with blunt trauma have a spinal injury, 134–136 and the risk of spinal injury is increased if the victim has a craniofacial injury, 137 . 138 a Glasgow Coma", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "Compression-Ventilation Ratio (Box 4)", "bbox": [60.0, 324.0, 271.0, 339.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [59.0, 323.0, 270.0, 338.0], "position": 3}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "A compression-ventilation ratio of 30:2 is reasonable in", "bbox": [60.0, 338.0, 376.0, 353.0]}, {"text": "adults, but further validation of this guideline is needed (Class", "bbox": [60.0, 354.0, 376.0, 368.0]}, {"text": "IIb, LOE B83,107–111 ).

By moving the schedule, Intel has attempted to rally the industry around EUV and to eliminate electron projection lithography (EPL).\n\n【1】\"We fervently believe that there are not enough resources in the industry to develop both technologies,\" he says.\n\n【2】Silverman is also ready to blast ahead by placing an order with ASML for a $30- million EUV prototype machine, forcing the equipment manufacturer to commit to a delivery schedule. It behooves Intel to push. Although AMD, Motorola, Infineon and Micron are partners, Intel negotiated contract terms that let it get the first machines produced and, because it is the largest investor in the $250-million program, the greatest number of tools.\n\n【3】Suppliers have to implement fully two crushingly difficult generations of technology before they finish making an investment of perhaps $750 million to start producing EUV machines. Getting them to buy into the breakneck schedule set by Intel may be a bigger challenge than creating angstrom-smooth mirrors.\n\n【4】Even ASML, which dropped its involvement with EPL, is cautious, saying existing optical technologies may last longer than the industry expects. \"It's too early to decide whether EUV will happen in the time frame Intel is pushing,\" says Jos\n\n【5】Benschop, research manager at ASML.\n\n【6】Intel would also like to bring Nikon  , its other main supplier, into the fold. But the industry's largest equipment manufacturer, which is researching EUV outside of the U.S. consortium, is not ready to commit to a single technology—and it continues work on EPL with IBM. Other chipmakers, such as Motorola and Texas Instruments, have voiced support for the EUV competitor. \"It's still a horse race between EPL and EUV,\" says Gilbert L. Varnell, president and chief operating officer of Nikon Research Corporation of America. \"Intel has taken the position that there's only one technology and they want to get rid of the competition. I'm not convinced that's the best approach for the industry. What if [EUV] fails? We're a toolmaker and they're a chipmaker, and there's a lot of other things we have to consider, such as manufacturability of the lithography equipment and profitability.\" Adds Lloyd R.\n\n【7】Harriott, a former Bell Labs employee who headed the EPL program and worked on sortium. Four years ago the only major American tool supplier in the consortium was SVG. Ultratech Stepper, an early U.S. partner in EUV research, had to settle grudgingly for a minor role when it was viewed as lacking the necessary financial resources to develop an EUV product line. ASML, moreover, has subsequently bought SVG, which would leave ASML as the primary beneficiary of this technology transfer. Intel has \"done everything in their power to give the technology on a silver platter to ASML,\" says David A. Markle, chief technology officer of Ultratech Stepper, adding that \"Intel has approached this situation with the attitude that what's good for Intel is good for America.\" Despite the trail of bruised egos, the EUV experience may serve as a case study for future research. It is one of the most successful collaborations between industry and national laboratories. More broadly, it constitutes a model for the creation of virtual laboratories that can undertake major projects on an as-needed basis ## The Collaborative Structure Of The Euv Program May Serve As A Model For How The Semiconductor Industry Conducts Future Research.\n\n【8】the early EUV program: \"I think a lot of progress has been made with EUV. But they've got a really long way to go. There's a lot of marketing hype about how this is a done deal.\" Varnell also believes that the current schedule—making commercial chips with EUV in 2005—is unrealistic, citing the nine years it took Nikon to develop the laser used in the current generation of lithography, a much less ambitious project. Says Varnell: \"You're going from an image to full-up production system by 2005, and it is going to come from the national labs. I've been around the toolmaking business for a long time. I don't believe that's going to happen.\" Along the way, another hurdle Intel and company have faced is convincing Washington to let a foreign company, the Dutch supplier ASML, enter the con- without the huge overhead of a central research facility.\n\n【9】Whether Intel's buy-it-when-you-needit strategy can work more generally remains to be seen. The real test may come in 15 years or so if EUV or EPL gives out and some wholly new substitute for silicon chips is needed. A paradigm shift— using molecules of DNA, nanotubes, quantum dots or other exotic materials to execute computations—may determine whether the virtual-research model can succeed. \"Intel did a magnificent job of picking up the technology, recognizing its worthiness and driving it home,\" Freeman says. \"But they're not putting the same effort into asking the questions about what to do when you get to 100 angstroms [10 nanometers].\" Maybe one of Moore's successors will have to lay down the law for quantum computing.\n\n【10】E", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "machine should be doubled.

In Champassak, a quiet province in southern Laos, Inthavongsy shines a flashlight into the tail section of what she recognizes to be a U.S. MK-81 aerial bomb sitting broadside in a bed of dead leaves. She peruses the bomb, then declares it safe to transport. Of course, not all unexploded bombs are so easy to handle. Some bombs have sensitive mechanical fuses and must be destroyed where they are found. Such diagnoses are easy for the 22-year-old, who leads a team of four technicians that frequently find the 250-pound bombs nosed into the ground or sitting in full view on the jungle floor. U.S. bombing data and reports from villagers help to guide teams such as Inthavongsy's\n\n【2】CLEARANCE TEAM carefully examines an uncovered bomb to determine whether it still poses a danger.\n\n【3】that are taking part in UXO (for \"unexploded ordnance\") Lao, a countrywide program.\n\n【4】UXO Lao finds scores of different types of U.S. aerial bombs, some of which weigh a hulking 2,000 pounds. The millions of unexploded antipersonnel cluster bombs, locally nicknamed \"bombies,\" in Laos can be particularly nettlesome because of centrifugal fuses that were designed to arm the bomb as it fell through the air. Technicians need to examine such fuses closely to determine whether the bomb is armed. Although UXO Lao is familiar with most U.S. bomb designs, some are still classified by the U.S. government. Bomb technicians have also discovered several large aerial bombs that they have not been able to identify.\n\n【5】Inthavongsy's colleagues hoist the rusted bomb into the back of a GPS-equipped Toyota pickup truck and head for a demolition site a few miles away. At the site, a remote jungle grove with a nearby protective log bunker, the crew follows a routine procedure to destroy the battered MK-81 bomb. Its goal is to avoid a socalled high-order detonation, in which the bomb explodes at full force. Instead the team will attempt to set off a low-order detonation that will quickly burn the bomb's contents and produce only a relatively small blast.\n\n【6】As a precaution, Inthavongsy clears the area of villagers and takes cover in a bunker in preparation for a bone-rattling blast that could still blow a five-foot hole in the ground.\n\n【7】To elicit a low-order explosion, the bomb technicians use a device dubbed a baldrick (named for a character on the British television program Black Adder , whose \"cunning plan\" for almost any problem involved a small explosive). The baldrick, a small aluminum tube crammed with 80 grams of plastic explosive and capped with a thin sheet of copper, pierces the outer casing of a bomb and ignites the plasterlike mixture of TNT and other explosive material inside. This action splits the bomb's casing and burns away its contents almost instantaneously, doing relatively little harm to the surrounding area. \"The munition is usually attacked explosively from the outside using a charge sufficiently violent to cause a chemical reaction but not hard enough to cause [a high-order] detonation,\" says Sidney Alford, a British explosives engineer who develops bomb disposal techniques used in Laos.\n\n【8】A member of Inthavongsy's team places the baldrick 80 millimeters from the bomb and inserts a blasting cap wired to an electrical switchbox in a faraway bunker. After a countdown by Inthavongsy, a zipping sound rings out from a hand-cranked switchbox as an electrical charge shoots down the wire and unleashes a thunderous boom. Pieces of shrapnel shriek through the air. Moments later Inthavongsy and her colleagues emerge from the bunker and return to the site. The demolition is successful. The ground is charred, and the grass flickers with small fires, but the area is largely intact.\n\n【9】— D.L.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "Days of Destruction", "bbox": [59.0, 96.0, 335.0, 131.0]}, {"text": "Finding the bombs makes it possible to detonate them safely", "bbox": [59.0, 134.0, 372.0, 150.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [58.0, 95.0, 371.0, 149.0], "position": 0}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "CHANTHAVONG INTHAVONGSY can easily identify her prey on", "bbox": [59.0, 166.0, 358.0, 181.0]}, {"text": "this day.

The results confirmed the existence of the hypothesized plasma tail and revealed an unexpected structure that was dubbed the \"shoulder.\" explosively released into the upper atmosphere. Substorms and the attendant auroral displays continued through the rest of July 15 and into the morning of July 16.\n\n【1】During the storm's main phase, which began four hours after its start, the magnetic field strength on the earth's surface fell precipitously, dropping 300 nanoteslas below its normal value.\n\n【2】This phenomenon, the defining feature of geomagnetic storms, resulted from the rapid growth of the ring current. IMAGE's Energetic Neutral Atom imagers produced vivid pictures of this flow of ions and electrons around the earth as it reached its peak on July 16 and then began to diminish [删除9:<u> see top illustrations on page 91 ]</u>. Once the transfer of energy from the solar wind abates, the flow of plasma into the inner magnetosphere slows, and ions are lost from the ring current more rapidly than new ones arrive. As the current weakens, the magnetic field on the earth's surface rebounds. The return to pre-storm levels usually takes one to a few days but may require more than a month in the case of major tempests.\n\n【3】Geomagnetic storms also change the shape of the plasmasphere. The enhanced flow of plasma from the magnetotail toward the earth erodes the plasmasphere by sweeping its charged particles toward the dayside magnetopause. When a storm subsides, the plasmasphere is refilled by ion outflow from the upper atmosphere. Scientists had hypothesized from modeling studies that the eroded material from the plasmasphere would form a long tail extending to the dayside magnetopause and that from there it would become lost in the solar wind. Global images of the plasmasphere from IMAGE's EUV instrument have now confirmed this 30-year-old hypothesis [ see illustration at left ]. At the same time, the images have revealed structures in the plasmasphere that raise new questions about its dynamic response to magnetospheric disturbances.\n\n【4】## On The Horizon Although Image Has Opened A New Window On The Magne-\n\n【5】tosphere, our view of space weather is still imperfect. Unlike terrestrial clouds, the clouds of plasma seen by IMAGE are completely transparent: nothing is hidden from sight, but depth perception is lacking. Thus, there will always be the need for satellites that make local measurements of the plasmas, as well as the fields and currents that govern their motion.\n\n【6】The next step for space weather observation will involve clusters of satellites acting like hurricane-hunter planes—they will go where the action is. The European Space Agency is conducting the first such mission, called Cluster II, which was launched in the summer of 2000. (A predecessor mission, Cluster I, was destroyed in a rocket explosion just after liftoff in 1996.) Cluster II consists of four closely grouped identical spacecraft designed to probe turbulent plasma phenomena in the magnetosphere and nearby solar wind. NASA is also planning a cluster mission for launch in 2006. The Magnetospheric Multiscale mission will study reconnection, charged particle acceleration, and turbulence at the dayside magnetopause and at specific locations in the magnetotail where substorms are triggered.\n\n【7】The space agencies are considering even more ambitious missions involving constellations of satellites: dozens of tiny spacecraft that will monitor large regions of space, just as the global weather networks now monitor conditions on the earth.\n\n【8】The first constellations will most likely observe the inner magnetosphere and the dayside magnetopause, with each cake-size craft recording the basic characteristics of the plasmas and magnetic fields.\n\n【9】The earth's magnetosphere is at once protective and dangerous. Its strong magnetic field shields humans from penetrating radiation that would otherwise be lethal. But the field is not strong enough to ward off the most powerful shock waves from the sun. Like the tornado belt or the tropical cyclone zone, the magnetosphere is a place of sudden storms. And that's why storm watchers such as the IMAGE satellite are so important.\n\n【10】ed\n\n【11】## More To Explore\n\n【12】From the Sun: Auroras, Magnetic Storms, Solar Flares, Cosmic Rays.\n\n【13】Edited by S.

But apart from any esthetic consideration, malocclusion is the cause of many periodontal problems; fixed orthodontic appliances are the cause of de demise of the oral hygiene conditions of the patient. The lack of an appropriate dental hygiene program is an important factor that can initiate a case of gingivitis or periodontitis.\n\n【2】Some investigations about this topic have demonstrated the relation between periodontal disease and the use of braces. Sadowsky and BeGole demonstrated that there is greater prevalence of moderate periodontitis in patients that wear braces (P<0.05) than in patients that do not wear braces. Furthermore, they showed that the prevalence is greater in extraction cases. Davies, Shaw, Worthington, M.删除4:<u> Anddy, Dummer and Kingdon mention that braces  Figs. 32-34.

Can I Catch Asthma From My Child?\n\n【1】Asthma is not an infectious condition. It cannot be transmitted from person to person, nor can it spread between people. That said, it has been noted for many years that the tendency to develop asthma tends to run in families. There is an inherited component to the development of asthma and allergy. If one parent has asthma or certain allergies, a child has a greater chance of developing asthma and/or allergies than does a child of unaffected parents. The chance of a child developing asthma increases further when both parents have asthma. The inheritance of asthma is poorly understood and is far from \"the whole story.\" Current thinking also attributes a large role to environmental factors in the development of asthma.\n\n【2】## 90. Do More Boys Than Girls Have Asthma?\n\n【3】Yes, but only as children. In young children, boys are almost twice as likely as girls to develop asthma. Interestingly, the pattern is reversed when looking at asthma in older age groups. An article published in the medical journal Chest in October 2003 found that 62% of children with asthma (asthma patients younger than 18 years of age) were male, while 68% of the adult patients with asthma were female. In studies of severe asthma, the preponderance of boys is notable as well: 2 of 3 children with severe asthma are boys. But, among adults with severe asthma, women account for two thirds of those affected. The gender-based differences are not understood.

EMS personnel should routinely acquire a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) as soon as possible for all patients exhibiting signs and symptoms of ACS. The ECG may be transmitted for remote interpretation by a physician or screened for STEMI by properly trained paramedics, with or without the assistance of computerinterpretation. Advance notification should be provided to the receiving hospital for patients identified as having STEMI (Class I, LOE B).\n\n【3】Implementation of 12-lead ECG diagnostic programs with concurrent medically-directed quality assurance is recommended (Class I, LOE B).

If PCI is the chosen method of reperfusion for the prehospital STEMI patient, it is reasonable to transport patients directly to the nearest PCI facility, bypassing closer EDs as necessary, in systems where time intervals between first medical contact and balloon times are <90 minutes and transport times are relatively short (ie, < 30 minutes) (Class IIa, LOE B).\n\n【9】In patients presenting within 2 hours of symptom onset or when delays to PCI are anticipated, fibrinolytic therapy is recommended.

In orthodontics, the orthodontist must make his diagnosis and then select the best appliance design to reach his objectives. In pharmacology, medicines are used to act upon cells, tissues and specific organs. In orthodontics moments and forces are used to act upon cells and specific tissue that support teeth and bone.

Finally, in orthodontic appliances as in medicine the efficiency depends upon the degree of cooperation of the patient. (1.11)\n\n【4】## What Is Force?\n\n【5】Force is an action exerted by a body (wire, coil, elastic, etc.) over another body (teeth or bone). It expresses itself as mass times acceleration (mass x acceleration) and is a vector that presents:\n\n【6】1.\n\n【7】Intensity (measured in g).  Sense/Direction (straight or angular). The latter 2.\n\n【8】is included between the straight line and an axis of reference.\n\n【9】Modulus (sense or direction of the force). (13) 3.\n\n【10】A force is also defined as a vector with magnitude and direction.\n\n【11】The correct unit for force expression is the Newton (N). But in orthodontics forces are expressed normally in g. The conversion factor from g to Newtons is 1g=0.00981N, or 1N=101.937 g. (1.14)\n\n【12】This vector is graphically defined by an arrow, indicating the direction of the force (bucco-lingual, mesio-distal, etc.) and the line of action, (where the force is going). The force direction (from buccal to lingual, from mesial to distal, etc.)\n\n【13】is defined by the point of the arrow. The vector also shows us the force magnitude that is proportional to the length of the body of the arrow; the point of force application is indicated by the origin or tail of the arrow.

The vector is used to represent force graphically.</u>\n\n【16】The units employed in orthodontics are force and distance.\n\n【17】Force is defined, as previously mentioned, as the action of a body (wire) over another body (tooth) that changes or tends to change the way the second body moves, due to a push or traction. In the metric system it is measured in g or g x mm 2 , depending if it is considered shear force or force times surface unit (pressure).

projected on a screen separate from the screen used to display presentation slides.\n\n【16】Immediately following the conference, ILCOR Consensus on Science writing groups compiled, discussed, reviewed

Each system, whether in the hospital or in the community, must assess its performance and implement a strategy for improving care in cases of cardiac arrest. That strategy should support the building blocks of resuscitation: the BLS links of immediate recognition and emergency activation, early CPR, and rapid defibrillation. If we accept this imperative to act, we can achieve the full potential offered by the Chain of Survival and, in turn, improve public health.\n\n【6】## Disclosures\n\n【7】Guidelines Part 4: Overview of CPR Writing Group Disclosures\n\n【8】Guidelines Part 4: Overview of CPR Writing Group Disclosures Writing Other Research Speakers' Consultant/ Group Ownership Member Employment Research Grant Bureau/Honoraria Advisory Board Other Support Interest Andrew H.\n\n【9】Emergency Health None None None None None None Travers Services Nova Scotia- Provincial Medical Director Thomas D.\n\n【10】University of *In the past, I have received modest grants from Philips Inc \"We recently *1 participate None None None Washington: Physician, and PhysioControl to evaluate changes in resuscitation completed an as part of a Real Associate Professor of protocols.

Cross bite. In this chapter we will analyze the different methods of correction of anterior and posterior cross bites, and their etiology. We review in a meticulous manner the ideal moment to implement orthopedic appliances for the correction of a cross bite, in which we mention the Face Mask, the Modified Tandem, the mini maxillary protrac删除16:<u>¬ </u>tor, the Camacho Badillo regulator, the Tandem Loop, the Quad Helix, the Hass and the Hyrax. We also present various orthodontic options to correct a cross bite, like the use of the forward arch wire, the lingual bonding of braces, the overlay, inverted NiTi arch wires and crossed elastics. We mention all the advantages, disadvantages and indications for these additions.\n\n【2】Chapter 7. Distalizers. This is one of the most controversial topics in orthodontics today because these appliances can provoke alterations in the temporomandibular joint. This type of appliances are used in cases where we want to avoid bicuspid extractions. There is an arsenal of distalizers like the CEOB-1, open coils, the Vlock distalizing technique, the GG distal spring, repellant magnets, the pendulum, pendex, distal jet, the Cetlin plate, the K-loop, the Veltri distalizer and the Belussi distalizer. We mention the facial and dental characteristics of the patients that are candidates for this therapy modality; we also cover the advantages, disadvantages and indications for each distalizer.\n\n【3】Chapter 8. Habits. Early detection of a habit in our patients may help us solve many prob删除16:<u>¬ </u>lems and avoid future headaches. So, in this chapter, we propose different appliances in order to correct habits, like cribs, punchers, tridents, labial shields and trainers. Each one of these has advantages, disadvantages and indications which we mention here.\n\n【4】Chapter 9. Lesions and emergencies during orthodontic treatment. In this chapter we mention the possible solutions (analgesics, vibratory stimuli and laser) in order to avoid or diminish pain provoked by dental movement.\n\n【5】Orthodontic and orthopedic appliances tend to retain great amounts of dentobacterial plaque, which can provoke gingival problems; so we give alternatives in order to diminish this inconvenience, and in case they are present, how to eliminate them in a simple way with the use of dental pastes, tooth brushes, creams and topical gels.\n\n【6】Chapter 10. Retention in orthodontics. The success of an orthodontic treatment is based on retention. We cannot place the same retainer in all finished cases, that is why in this chapter we present various retainers (removable, fixed and invisible ones) and their different uses, advantages, disadvantages and indications.

The intrauterine environment is an ideal environment for the fetus, with controlled temperature, oxygen, nutrients, and stimuli. The fetus' oxygen is supplied via the mother's bloodstream through the placenta. The mother's blood oxygen, in turn, reflects her lung function.

The risks of uncontrolled asthma to the mother and infant are far greater than the possible or potential risks of medication (Table 32).\n\n【1】The outcome of pregnancy for a woman who has wellcontrolled asthma can be expected to be no different from the outcome of a woman without asthma. The emphasis is on the concept of well-controlled asthma.\n\n【2】The goals of asthma treatment in pregnancy parallel those of asthma treatment in general. Compliance with prescribed medication is emphasized along with peak flow (PEF) monitoring. Avoidance of known asthma triggers is encouraged as much as possible.

Even in the absence of ST elevation, medical or interventional treatments may be considered for treatment of ACS 14 . 16 . 17 and should not be deferred in the presence of coma or in conjunction with patients usually require an advanced airway for mechanical support of breathing. It may be necessary to replace a supraglottic airway used for initial resuscitation with an endotracheal tube, although the timing of replacement may vary. Methods for securing an advanced airway are discussed in Part 8.1: \"Airway Management,\" but several simple maneuvers deserve consideration. For example, rescuers and long-term hospital providers should avoid using ties that pass circumferentially around the patient's neck, potentially obstructing venous return from the brain. They should also elevate the head of the bed 30° if tolerated to reduce the incidence of cerebral edema, aspiration, and ventilatory-associated pneumonia. Correct placement of an advanced airway, particularly during patient transport, should be monitored using waveform capnography as described in other sections of the 2010 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC .\n\n【6】Oxygenation of the patient should be monitored continuously with pulse oximetry.\n\n【7】Although 100% oxygen may have been used during initial resuscitation, providers should titrate inspired oxygen to the lowest level required to achieve an arterial oxygen saturation of ≥ 94%, so as to avoid potential oxygen toxicity. It is recognized that titration of inspired oxygen may not be possible immediately after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest until the patient is transported to the emergency department or, in the case of in-hospital arrest, the intensive care unit (ICU). Hyperventilation or \"overbagging\" the patient is common after cardiac arrest and should be avoided because of potential adverse hemodynamic effects. Hyperventilation increases intrathoracic pressure and inversely lowers cardiac output. The decrease in Paco 2 seen with hyperventilation can also potentially decrease cerebral blood flow directly.Ventilation may be started at 10 to 12 breaths per minute and titrated to achieve a P ETCO 2 of 35 to 40 mm Hg or a Paco 2 of 40 to 45 mm Hg.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "Figure.

But sometimes cells botch the job, leading to misfolded proteins that are useless or even dangerous. How exactly most cells repair or destroy flawed proteins has remained somewhat elusive—until now. As reported in the January Nature Cell Biology , experiments revealed a component of the repair process that may participate in a cell's decision to fix or destroy a particular protein. Researchers found that a molecule called CHIP first prevented chaperones, which repair proteins, from trying to refold an unsalvageable protein, then subsequently transferred the hopeless case to a proteasome, which destroyed it.\n\n【13】These findings may help researchers develop new treatments for Alzheimer's disease and other kinds of neurogenerative disorders associated with an accumulation of misfolded proteins in cells.\n\n【14】—Alison McCook\n\n【15】## Earth Science\n\n【16】## Take Me To The Ocean\n\n【17】Rivers should dump plenty of organic matter into the sea, replacing all the ocean's carbon in 4,000 to 6,000 years. But geochemical studies have suggested that little of the riverine carbon, derived from plants, actually makes it out. In the January 25 Nature , researchers report a possible solution. Using radiocarbon techniques on sediments collected from four rivers, they determined that bacteria may alter riverine carbon, making it indistinguishable from ocean carbon. Although it fills in details about the carbon cycle, the study deals with timescales too long to affect carbon dioxide– influenced global warming by humans. In fact, in February the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change raised the estimate of the world's temperature rise between 1990 and 2100 from 1.0 to 3.5 degrees Celsius to 1.4 to 5.8 degrees C.\n\n【18】-Philip Yam\n\n【19】## Neuroscience\n\n【20】## You Look Awfully Familiar\n\n【21】with a celebrity's to determine which hemisphere is involved in self-recognition, an ability shared with some  apes and considered to be a hallmark of self-awareness.\n\n【22】Your sense of self may lie in the right side of your brain.

Once the anesthesia wore off  patients had to choose which face they had seen. All five selected their own face when only their right hemispheres were active, but four out of the five said they had seen the famous face when only their left hemispheres were awake. —Alison McCook", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "Amount of antibiotics", "bbox": [112.0, 436.0, 204.0, 448.0]}, {"text": "given annually to hogs, poultry", "bbox": [72.0, 449.0, 204.0, 462.0]}, {"text": "and cattle in the U.S.:", "bbox": [113.0, 463.0, 204.0, 475.0]}, {"text": "In 1985: 18 million pounds", "bbox": [89.0, 476.0, 204.0, 487.0]}, {"text": "In late 1990s: 25 million pounds", "bbox": [66.0, 490.0, 204.0, 501.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [65.0, 435.0, 203.0, 500.0], "position": 3}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Percent of all antibiotics", "bbox": [99.0, 508.0, 204.0, 521.0]}, {"text": "given to livestock that is used", "bbox": [77.0, 523.0, 204.0, 535.0]}, {"text": "to treat disease: 7", "bbox": [126.0, 537.0, 203.0, 548.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [76.0, 507.0, 203.0, 547.0], "position": 4}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Amount of antibiotics", "bbox": [113.0, 555.0, 204.0, 568.0]}, {"text": "used by Americans annually:", "bbox": [81.0, 569.0, 204.0, 581.0]}, {"text": "4.5 million pounds", "bbox": [125.0, 583.0, 204.0, 595.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [80.0, 554.0, 203.0, 594.0], "position": 5}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Amount in topical creams, soaps and", "bbox": [48.0, 602.0, 204.0, 614.0]}, {"text": "disinfectants: 1.5 million pounds", "bbox": [66.0, 616.0, 204.0, 628.0]}, {"text": "Percent of liquid soaps that contain", "bbox": [53.0, 636.0, 204.0, 648.0]}, {"text": "antibacterial ingredients: 76", "bbox": [82.0, 650.0, 204.0, 662.0]}, {"text": "Percent of people who say", "bbox": [92.0, 669.0, 204.0, 681.0]}, {"text": "they wash their hands after using", "bbox": [60.0, 681.0, 204.0, 695.0]}, {"text": "a public restroom: 95", "bbox": [113.0, 696.0, 203.0, 708.0]}, {"text": "Percent observed doing so: 67", "bbox": [75.0, 715.0, 203.0, 728.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [47.0, 601.0, 203.0, 727.0], "position": 6}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Number of Americans infected", "bbox": [75.0, 736.0, 204.0, 748.0]}, {"text": "(after eating chicken) with", "bbox": [89.0, 749.0, 204.0, 761.0]}, {"text": "Campylobacter resistant to", "bbox": [86.0, 764.0, 204.0, 775.0]}, {"text": "antibiotic fluoroquinolone:", "bbox": [91.0, 776.0, 203.0, 788.0]}, {"text": "In 1998: 8,782", "bbox": [139.0, 789.0, 204.0, 800.0]}, {"text": "In 1999: 11,477", "bbox": [133.0, 802.0, 203.0, 815.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [74.0, 735.0, 203.0, 814.0], "position": 7}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Percent of Streptococcus", "bbox": [96.0, 823.0, 204.0, 835.0]}, {"text": "pneumoniae infections in the U.S.", "bbox": [63.0, 836.0, 202.0, 848.0]}, {"text": "that were penicillin-resistant:", "bbox": [78.0, 850.0, 203.0, 861.0]}, {"text": "In 1987: 0.2", "bbox": [150.0, 863.0, 203.0, 875.0]}, {"text": "In 1994 : 6.6", "bbox": [149.0, 875.0, 204.0, 889.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [62.0, 822.0, 203.0, 888.0], "position": 8}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "SOURCES: Union of Concerned", "bbox": [82.0, 900.0, 204.0, 913.0]}, {"text": "Scientists, \"Hogging It: Estimates of", "bbox": [56.0, 912.0, 203.0, 924.0]}, {"text": "Antimicrobial Use in Livestock,", "bbox": [75.0, 922.0, 199.0, 933.0]}, {"text": "January 2001;

The following have been considered in recommending a compression-to-ventilation ratio of 30:2 for single rescuers:  • Evidence from manikin studies shows that lone rescuers cannot deliver the desired number of compressions per minute with the compression-to-ventilation ratio of 5:1 that was previously recommended (2000 and earlier删除6:<u>).</u>or the lone rescuer, manikin studies show that a ratio of 30:2 yields more chest compressions than a 15:2 ratio with no, or minimal, increase in rescuer fatigue. 64–68 • Volunteers recruited at an airport to perform single-rescuer layperson CPR on an adult manikin had less \"no flow time\"  (ie, arrest time without chest compressions, when no blood flow is generated) with 30:2 compared with a 15:2 ratio. 69 • An observational human study 70 comparing resuscitations by firefighters prior to and following the change from 15:2 to 30:2 compression-to-ventilation ratio reported more chest compressions per minute with a 30:2 ratio; ROSC was unchanged.  • Animal studies 71–73 show that coronary perfusion pressure, a major determinant of success in resuscitation, rapidly declines when chest compressions are interrupted; once compressions are resumed, several chest compressions are needed to restore coronary perfusion pressure. Thus, frequent interruptions of chest compressions prolong the duration of low coronary perfusion pressure and flow.\n\n【5】Manikin studies, 25,69 . 74 as well as in- and out-of-hospital adult human studies, 33,34,75 have documented long interruptions in chest compressions. Adult studies 76 - 78 have also demonstrated that these interruptions reduce the likelihood of ROSC.\n\n【6】## Activate Emergency Response System If There Are 2 Rescuers, One Should Start Cpr Immediately\n\n【7】and the other should activate the emergency response system (in most locales by phoning 911) and obtain an AED, if one is available. Most infants and children with cardiac arrest have an asphyxial rather than a VF arrest 3 . 9 . 12 ; therefore 2 minutes of CPR are recommended before the lone rescuer activates the emergency response system and gets an AED if one is nearby. The lone rescuer should then return to the victim as soon as possible and use the AED (if available) or resume CPR, starting with chest compressions. Continue with cycles of 30 compressions to 2 ventilations until emergency response rescuers arrive or the victim starts breathing spontaneously.\n\n【8】## Bls Sequence For Healthcare Providers And Others Trained In 2-Rescuer Cpr\n\n【9】For the most part the sequence of BLS for healthcare providers is similar to that for laypeople with some variation as indicated below (see Figure 3). Healthcare providers are more likely to work in teams and less likely to be lone rescuers. Activities described as a series of individual sequences are often performed simultaneously (eg, chest compressions and preparing for rescue breathing) so there is less significance regarding which is performed first.\n\n【10】It is reasonable for healthcare providers to tailor the sequence of rescue actions to the most likely cause of arrest.\n\n【11】For example, if the arrest is witnessed and sudden (eg, sudden collapse in an adolescent or a child identified at high risk for arrhythmia or during an athletic event), the healthcare provider may assume that the victim has suffered a sudden VF–cardiac arrest and as soon as the rescuer verifies that the child is unresponsive and not breathing (or only gasping) the rescuer should immediately phone the emergency response system, get the AED and then begin CPR and use the AED.\n\n【12】(Class IIa LOE C). 2 , 7 , 79\n\n【13】## Assess The Need For Cpr 删除5:<u>(Box 1)</u>\n\n【14】If the victim is unresponsive and is not breathing (or only gasping), send someone to activate the emergency response system.\n\n【15】## Pulse Check 删除5:<u>(Box 3)</u>\n\n【16】If the infant or child is unresponsive and not breathing (gasps do not count as breathing), healthcare providers may take up to 10 seconds to attempt to feel for a pulse (brachial in an infant and carotid or femoral in a child). If, within 10 seconds, you don't feel a pulse or are not sure if you feel a pulse, begin chest compressions (Class IIa, LOE C). It can be difficult to feel a pulse, especially in the heat of an emergency, and studies show that healthcare providers, 80 as well as lay rescuers, are unable to reliably detect a puls删除2:<u> 81–95</u>\n\n【17】## Inadequate Breathing With Pulse\n\n【18】If there is a palpable pulse ≥ 60 per minute but there is inadequate breathing, give rescue breaths at a rate of about 12 to 20 breaths per minute (1 breath every 3 to 5 seconds) until spontaneous breathing resumes 删除5:<u>(Box 3A)</u>. Reassess the pulse about every 2 minutes (Class IIa, LOE B) but spend no more than 10 seconds doing so.\n\n【19】## Bradycardia With Poor Perfusion If The Pulse Is < 60 Per Minute And There Are Signs Of Poor perfusion (ie, pallor, mottling, cyanosis) despite support of oxygenation and ventilation, begin chest compressions.\n\n【20】Because cardiac output in infancy and childhood largely depends on heart rate, profound bradycardia with poor perfusion is an indication for chest compressions because cardiac arrest is imminent and beginning CPR prior to full cardiac arrest results in improved surviva删除6:<u>l.</u>he absolute heart rate at which chest compressions should be initiated is unknown; the recommendation to provide chest compressions for a heart rate < 60 per minute with signs of", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "short a pause in chest compressions as possible after each set", "bbox": [60.0, 84.0, 377.0, 99.0]}, {"text": "of 30 compressions (Class IIa, LOE C).", "bbox": [60.0, 100.0, 271.0, 113.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [59.0, 83.0, 376.0, 112.0], "position": 3}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Coordinate Chest Compressions and Breathing", "bbox": [60.0, 136.0, 352.0, 151.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [59.0, 135.0, 351.0, 150.0], "position": 4}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "After giving 2 breaths, immediately give 30 compressions.", "bbox": [60.0, 153.0, 375.0, 167.0]}, {"text": "The lone rescuer should continue this cycle of 30 com-", "bbox": [60.0, 168.0, 375.0, 182.0]}, {"text": "pressions and 2 breaths for approximately 2 minutes (about", "bbox": [60.0, 184.0, 376.0, 197.0]}, {"text": "5 cycles) before leaving the victim to activate the emer-", "bbox": [60.0, 199.0, 375.0, 214.0]}, {"text": "gency response system and obtain an automated external", "bbox": [60.0, 215.0, 377.0, 228.0]}, {"text": "defibrillator (AED) if one is nearby.", "bbox": [60.0, 230.0, 261.0, 244.0]}, {"text": "The ideal compression-to-ventilation ratio in infants and", "bbox": [73.0, 246.0, 377.0, 260.0]}, {"text": "children is unknown.

An in-house CIA office called the In-Q-Tel Interface Center provides guidance on agency needs and candidate technologies. \"Without the interface center,\" Tucker notes, \"it's hard to imagine that we'd be able to know anything about [the CIA's] real needs unless we essentially turned ourselves into an element of the agency.\" To find new ideas and technologies that might be quickly developed and adapted for agency use, In-Q-Tel, with offices in the Washington, D.C., area and Silicon Valley, spends a lot of time doing \"terrain mapping\"— reviewing open-source information on the Internet or in trade literature. \"It's amazing what you can learn by just doing that,\" Tucker says. \"It's also amazing what you don't get.\" In-Q-Tel fills the gap by tracking less visible technologies, doing for the CIA what the agency can't do for itself. It monitors what it calls \"deal flow.\" \"There's an enormous undercurrent of companies that haven't disclosed themselves to the marketplace either to maintain their trade secrets or to maintain their competitive edge until they get bigger,\" Tucker explains. \"There are huge amounts of ingenuity out there in that section of the economy.\" For this reason, In-Q-Tel keeps close tabs on a network of other venture capitalists and investment bankers.\n\n【1】It supports an outreach program involving traditional investors as well as universities and commercial laboratories. When it comes across a technology that shows promise, it makes sure the company has solid credentials before agreeing to invest. Then, once it signs up a new company, it serves as a conduit between the agency and the technology developers, providing direction but, in many cases, shielding the agency's plans.\n\n【2】As a result, no one talks much about the applications themselves. Tucker says three In-Q-Tel projects have gone into the agency so far, meaning they have been implemented inside the wall of secrecy.\n\n【3】Projects in early stages of development are more aboveboard. A company called SafeWeb is adapting its product, PrivacyMatrix, a 128-bit Internet encryption system, for the agency's use. SafeWeb entered into a licensing and venture arrangement with In-Q-Tel last year. In exchange for financing, SafeWeb gives the CIA warrants that it can convert to equity later. In the meantime, In-Q-Tel will evaluate PrivacyMatrix, pro- vide the company with advice, and hope that the support will lead to a system that can benefit the CIA.\n\n【4】No one at SafeWeb has security clearance. In fact, says Stephen Hsu, the company's co-founder and chief executive, the CIA would prefer that SafeWeb know \"as little as possible\" about how it uses PrivacyMatrix. So far, Tucker says, this kind of arrangement has not caused a problem. Although In-Q-Tel has provided funds to major government contractors, including SAIC, officials have focused from the beginning on technologies and ideas promoted by smaller companies that, like SafeWeb, usually would not do business with a government entity such as the CIA .\n\n【5】Most small entrepreneurial companies, which are not part of the traditional government contractor base, don't want security clearance or the headaches associated with government accounting and acquisition regulations. With In-Q-Tel, they avoid the red tape that\n\n【6】## In-Q-Tel Helps Entrepreneurial Companies Avoid The Welter Of Red Tape They Would Confront As Government Contractors.\n\n【7】they would otherwise face if they dealt directly with the agency. \"We provide them an opportunity to come and play without having to be a government contractor,\" Tucker notes.\n\n【8】While Congress keeps its eye on In-Q-Tel, receiving periodic progress reports, the few critics of the company are outnumbered by the many supporters that have emerged. Other government agencies are paying close attention, and some frequently ask for information and advice. NASA , Tucker says, \"has been all over us,\" probing how a similar arrangement might work for the space agency. The army has gone further than that: in January the service asked its Science Board, a group of outside experts, to look into prospects for a venture-capital firm of its own.\n\n【9】In-Q-Tel isn't having any difficulty finding companies to work with either.

Two balloon-borne telescopes, Boomerang and Maxima, measured the microwave background with a resolution of better than one degree, revealing smallscale fluctuations. Unlike the larger-scale fluctuations made famous by the COBE satellite a decade ago—which are scale-invariant, occurring with the same relative strength no matter their size—the small ones seem to be strongest on certain scales known as peaks.\n\n【2】The size and strength of these peaks allow cosmologists to get at the geometry of space and the density of matter. The thinking is that as the universe grew, density fluctuations that started off as scale-invariant developed into synchronized oscillations on ever increasing scales. The microwave background reveals how far this process had gotten when the cosmos was 400,000 years old. After that time, the oscillations started to subside as gravity pulled matter into bodies such as galaxies.\n\n【3】Boomerang's and Maxima's results were a case of good news and bad news. The instruments saw the largest of the expected peaks, demonstrating that the universe is geometrically flat, but they failed to see a second peak. That suggested the universe had much more ordinary matter than the element abundances could countenance.\n\n【4】To universal relief, the discrepancy has now disappeared. This past April a third telescope—the ground-based Degree Angular Scale Interferometer (DASI), run by John E.\n\n【5】Carlstrom and his group at the University of Chicago—detected the second peak. Meanwhile the Boomerang team realized that it had overestimated the pointing accuracy of its instrument, which had the effect of smudging the fine details in the images. When the team undid this bias and incorporated new data, the second peak popped out. Maxima's results for the second peak haven't changed, but its error bars encompass the other experiments' values anyway.\n\n【6】Boomerang's revisions have left some cosmologists wondering what to believe, but observers respond that the agreement of independent techniques is grounds for confidence.\n\n【7】In any case, certainty should soon arrive on the wings of NASA's Microwave Anisotropy Probe and new ground-based instruments with still higher resolution.\n\n【8】Although some media accounts described the findings as \"confirmation\" of cosmic inflation and cold dark matter, that is not quite true. Geometric flatness and scale invariance were predicted long before inflation, based on very general principles. It is true that most alternatives to inflation are ruled out, having failed to foresee multiple peaks, but that is not the same as ruling inflation in. Similarly, it's hard to be sure that dark matter is real stuff rather than a theoretical artifact.\n\n【9】Direct evidence may not be far off, though. Already there are hints of a slight \"tilt\"—a deviation from exact scale invariance, as inflationary models predict—in the microwave background and, according to through a slice of space. Such maps are now extensive enough to correlate cosmic structures with the primordial fluctuations that seeded them.\n\n【10】Rupert A. C. Croft of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, in the distribution of intergalactic gas clouds. As for dark matter, Arthur Kosowsky of Rutgers University says the relative strength of the peaks is the do-or-die test. Cold dark matter contributes to gravity but not to pressure, thereby accentuating the odd-numbered peaks (which represent the gravity-dominated part of the primordial oscillation cycle) at the expense of the even-numbered ones (the pressure-dominated part). If you squint at the current data, you might say that the third peak is indeed bigger. Fortunately, with observational precision improving at its present rate  , squinting will soon be unnecessary.\n\n【11】Cosmic microwave background radiation Its spectrum indicates that hot plasma once filled the universe. Patchiness reveals that this primordial soup was slightly uneven.\n\n【12】Element abundances Historically the most precise of the pillars, it confirms that nuclear reactions took place in a hot, expanding universe.\n\n【13】Galaxy velocities The proportionality of distance and velocity shows that the cosmos is expanding. Slight deviations at large distances suggest that the expansion has accelerated. The most distant supernova ever seen, identified in April by the High-Z Supernova Search Team, strengthens the case.\n\n【14】Large-scale structure Studies of the arrangement and motion of galaxies and intergalactic clouds, such as the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey, have been erecting this new pillar. They typically look on scales of several hundred million lightyears and smaller, neatly dovetailing with the work on the microwave background, which probes nascent structures 100 million light-years across and larger.\n\n【15】Not only are both patterns broadly consistent, but traces of the microwave background fluctuations have appeared in the arrangement of galaxies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "dark matter. \"Previously, cosmology had", "bbox": [61.0, 55.0, 299.0, 70.0]}, {"text": "been independent strands of thought,\" says", "bbox": [61.0, 71.0, 300.0, 85.0]}, {"text": "cosmologist David Tytler of the University of", "bbox": [60.0, 86.0, 300.0, 101.0]}, {"text": "California at San Diego. \"It can now go on to", "bbox": [61.0, 103.0, 299.0, 118.0]}, {"text": "address the next level of detail.\"", "bbox": [61.0, 119.0, 233.0, 133.0]}, {"text": "Although the big bang theory has long", "bbox": [81.0, 135.0, 300.0, 149.0]}, {"text": "been supported by three observational pil-", "bbox": [61.0, 151.0, 298.0, 165.0]}, {"text": "lars—cosmic microwave background radia-", "bbox": [61.0, 167.0, 298.0, 181.0]}, {"text": "tion, abundance of light elements, and out-", "bbox": [61.0, 183.0, 297.0, 197.0]}, {"text": "ward velocity of distant galaxies—these pil-", "bbox": [61.0, 199.0, 298.0, 214.0]}, {"text": "lars uphold different aspects of the theory.", "bbox": [61.0, 215.0, 298.0, 229.0]}, {"text": "Only last year did observations of the first pil-", "bbox": [61.0, 231.0, 298.0, 245.0]}, {"text": "lar reach the precision needed to cross-check", "bbox": [61.0, 247.0, 299.0, 261.0]}, {"text": "the second one.

In reviewing the medical literature, members of the International First Aid Science Advisory Board once again found a paucity of evidence to guide first aid interventions. Very little research is being conducted in first aid, and many of the following recommendations are extrapolated from the experience of healthcare professionals. It is important to recognize the limitations of the evidence that supports many of these guidelines so that research can be undertaken and future guidelines can be based on a larger body of scientific evidence.\n\n【5】## Definition Of First Aid\n\n【6】We define first aid as the assessments and interventions that can be performed by a bystander (or by the victim) with minimal or no medical equipment. A first aid provider is defined as someone with formal training in first aid, emergency care, or medicine who provides first aid. First aid assessments and interventions should be medically sound and based on scientific evidence or, in the absence of such evidence, on expert consensus. Administration of first aid must not delay activation of the emergency medical services (EMS) system or other medical assistance when required. We strongly believe that education in first aid should be universal: everyone can learn first aid and everyone should.\n\n【7】The scope of first aid is not purely scientific; it is influenced by both training and regulatory issues. The definition of scope is therefore variable, and should be defined according to circumstances, need, and regulatory requirements.\n\n【8】## Calling For Help\n\n【9】A first aid provider must be able to recognize when help is needed and how to get it. First aid providers should learn how and when to access the EMS system, how to activate the on-site emergency response plan (ERP), and how to contact the Poison Control Center (see \"Poison Emergencies\" below).\n\n【10】## Positioning The Victim\n\n【11】As a general rule a victim should not be moved, especially if you suspect, from the victim's position or the nature of the injury, that the victim may have a spinal injury (see \"Spine Stabilization\" below). There are times, however, when the victim should be moved:  • If the area is unsafe for the rescuer or the victim, move the victim to a safe location if it is safe to do so.\n\n【12】• If the victim is face down and is unresponsive, turn the victim face up.  • If the victim has difficulty breathing because of copious secretions or vomiting, or if you are alone and have to leave an unresponsive victim to get help, place the victim in a modified High Arm IN Endangered Spine (HAINES) recovery position: 9.10 Extend one of the victim's arms above the head and roll the body to the side so the victim's head rests on the extended arm. Bend both legs to stabilize the victim (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【13】• If a victim shows evidence of shock, have the victim lie supine. If there is no evidence of trauma or injury, raise the feet about 6 to 12 inches (about 30° to 45°) (Class IIb, LOE C). Do not raise the feet if the movement or the position causes the victim any pain.\n\n【14】The evidence for a benefit to raising the feet is extrapolated from leg raising studies on volume expansion; there are no studies on the effect of leg raising as a first aid maneuver for shock. The results of the volume expansion studies are contradictory with some showing an increase in cardiac output, 11–13 while others show no change in cardiac output or mean arterial pressure 14 – 18 with leg raising.\n\n【15】## Oxygen\n\n【16】There is insufficient evidence to recommend routine use of supplementary oxygen by a first aid provider for victims complaining of chest discomfort 19 . 20 or shortness of breath 21 .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "International First Aid Science Advisory Board", "bbox": [104.0, 82.0, 334.0, 97.0]}, {"text": "Table.", "bbox": [61.0, 84.0, 93.0, 96.0]}, {"text": "Member Organizations", "bbox": [60.0, 98.0, 172.0, 111.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [59.0, 81.0, 333.0, 110.0], "position": 3}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "American Academy of Pediatrics", "bbox": [60.0, 120.0, 194.0, 134.0]}, {"text": "American Burn Association", "bbox": [60.0, 137.0, 172.0, 151.0]}, {"text": "American College of Emergency Physicians", "bbox": [60.0, 153.0, 237.0, 170.0]}, {"text": "American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine", "bbox": [60.0, 173.0, 317.0, 187.0]}, {"text": "American College of Surgeons", "bbox": [60.0, 189.0, 185.0, 203.0]}, {"text": "American Heart Association", "bbox": [60.0, 206.0, 174.0, 220.0]}, {"text": "American Pediatric Surgical Association", "bbox": [60.0, 224.0, 222.0, 238.0]}, {"text": "American Red Cross", "bbox": [60.0, 240.0, 146.0, 255.0]}, {"text": "American Red Cross Advisory Council on First Aid, Aquatics, Safety and", "bbox": [60.0, 258.0, 354.0, 273.0]}, {"text": "Preparedness (ACFASP)", "bbox": [60.0, 273.0, 157.0, 287.0]}, {"text": "American Safety & Health Institute (ASHI)", "bbox": [60.0, 289.0, 230.0, 303.0]}, {"text": "Austrian Red Cross", "bbox": [60.0, 306.0, 141.0, 320.0]}, {"text": "Canadian Red Cross", "bbox": [60.0, 324.0, 145.0, 338.0]}, {"text": "Divers Alert Network.", "bbox": [60.0, 341.0, 146.0, 354.0]}, {"text": "European Reference Center on First Aid Education", "bbox": [60.0, 358.0, 266.0, 372.0]}, {"text": "Egyptian Red Crescent", "bbox": [60.0, 376.0, 154.0, 390.0]}, {"text": "French Red Cross", "bbox": [59.0, 393.0, 136.0, 407.0]}, {"text": "Grenada Red Cross", "bbox": [60.0, 410.0, 141.0, 423.0]}, {"text": "Hong Kong Red Cross", "bbox": [60.0, 428.0, 152.0, 442.0]}, {"text": "Hungarian Red Cross", "bbox": [60.0, 445.0, 148.0, 458.0]}, {"text": "International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies", "bbox": [60.0, 462.0, 328.0, 475.0]}, {"text": "Medic First Aid International", "bbox": [60.0, 480.0, 177.0, 494.0]}, {"text": "National Association of EMS Educators", "bbox": [60.0, 497.0, 219.0, 510.0]}, {"text": "National Association of EMS Physicians", "bbox": [60.0, 514.0, 222.0, 528.0]}, {"text": "National Athletic Trainers' Association", "bbox": [60.0, 532.0, 217.0, 546.0]}, {"text": "National Safety Council", "bbox": [60.0, 549.0, 157.0, 562.0]}, {"text": "Norwegian Red Cross", "bbox": [60.0, 567.0, 150.0, 580.0]}, {"text": "Occupational Safety and Health Administration", "bbox": [60.0, 584.0, 250.0, 597.0]}, {"text": "Red Cross Society of China", "bbox": [60.0, 602.0, 174.0, 615.0]}, {"text": "Resuscitation Council of Asia", "bbox": [60.0, 618.0, 180.0, 632.0]}, {"text": "St. John Ambulance, UK", "bbox": [60.0, 636.0, 161.0, 649.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [58.0, 119.0, 353.0, 648.0], "position": 4}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Previous reports 5–8 have noted the paucity of scientific", "bbox": [72.0, 676.0, 375.0, 691.0]}, {"text": "evidence supporting many interventions in prehospital emer-", "bbox": [60.0, 693.0, 375.0, 708.0]}, {"text": "gency care.

Two-finger chest compression technique in infant (1 rescuer).\n\n【1】## Start Chest Compressions\n\n【2】During cardiac arrest, high-quality chest compressions generate blood flow to vital organs and increase the likelihood of ROSC. If the infant or child is unresponsive and not breathing, give 30 chest compressions.\n\n【3】The following are characteristics of high-quality CPR:  • Chest compressions of appropriate rate and depth. \"Push fast\": push at a rate of at least 100 compressions per minute. \"Push hard\": push with sufficient force to depress at least one third the anterior-posterior (AP) diameter of the chest or approximately 1 ½ inches (4 cm) in infants and 2 inches (5 cm) in children (Class I, LOE C). Inadequate compression depth is common 32 -34 even by health care providers.\n\n【4】• Allow complete chest recoil after each compression to  allow the heart to refill with blood.\n\n【5】• Minimize interruptions of chest compressions.\n\n【6】• Avoid excessive ventilation.\n\n【7】For best results, deliver chest compressions on a firm surface. 35 , 36\n\n【8】For an infant, lone rescuers (whether lay rescuers or healthcare providers) should compress the sternum with 2 fingers 删除5:<u>(Figure 2)</u> placed just below the intermammary line (Class IIb, LOE C删除6:<u>).</u>o not compress over the xiphoid or ribs. Rescuers should compress at least one third the depth of the chest, or about 4 cm (1.5 inches).\n\n【9】For a child, lay rescuers and healthcare providers should compress the lower half of the sternum at least one third of the AP dimension of the chest or approximately 5 cm (2 inches) with the heel of 1 or 2 hands. Do not press on the xiphoid or the ribs. There are no data to determine if the 1- or 2-hand method produces better compressions and better outcome (Class IIb, LOE C). In a child manikin study, higher chest compression pressures were obtained 42 with less rescuer fatigue 43 with the 2-hand technique. Because children and rescuers come in all sizes, rescuers may use either 1 or 2 hands to compress the child's chest. Whichever you use, make sure to achieve an adequate compression depth with complete release after each compression.\n\n【10】After each compression, allow the chest to recoil completely (Class IIb, LOE B) because complete chest re- expansion improves the flow of blood returning to the heart and thereby blood flow to the body during CP删除6:<u>R.</u>uring pediatric CPR incomplete chest wall recoil is common, particularly when rescuers become fa删除16:<u>¬ </u>tigue删除6:<u>d.</u>ncomplete recoil during CPR is associated with higher intrathoracic pressures and significantly decreased venous return, coronary perfusion, blood flow, and cerebral perfusio删除6:<u>n.</u>anikin studies suggest that techniques to lift the heel of the hand slightly, but completely, off the chest can improve chest recoil, but this technique has not been studied in human删除6:<u>s.</u>utomated CPR feedback devices hold promise as monitors of CPR quality parameters, including chest recoil, by providing real-time, corrective feedback to the rescuer. However, there is currently insufficient evidence for or against their use in infants and children.\n\n【11】Rescuer fatigue can lead to inadequate compression rate, depth, and recoi删除6:<u>l.</u>he quality of chest compressions may deteriorate within minutes even when the rescuer denies feeling fatigue删除6:<u>d.</u>escuers should therefore rotate the compressor role approximately every 2 minutes to prevent compressor fatigue and deterioration in quality and rate of chest compressions. Recent data suggest that when feedback devices are used and compressions are effective, some rescuers may be able to effectively continue past the 2-minute interva删除6:<u>l.</u>he switch should be accomplished as quickly as possible (ideally in less than 5 seconds) to minimize interruptions in chest compressions.\n\n【12】Resuscitation outcomes in infants and children are best if chest compressions are combined with ventilations (see below), but if a rescuer is not trained in providing ventilations, or is unable to do so, the lay rescuer should continue with chest compressions (\"Hands-Only\" or compression-only CPR) until help arrives.\n\n【13】## Open The Airway And Give Ventilations\n\n【14】For the lone rescuer a compression-to-ventilation ratio of 30:2 is recommended. After the initial set of 30 compressions, open the airway and give 2 breaths. In an unresponsive infant or child, the tongue may obstruct the airway and interfere with ventilation删除6:<u>s.</u>pen the airway using a head tilt–chin lift maneuver for both injured and noninjured victims (Class I, LOE B).\n\n【15】To give breaths to an infant, use a mouth-to-mouth-andnose technique; to give breaths to a child, use a mouth-tomouth techniqu删除6:<u>e.</u>ake sure the breaths are effective (ie, the chest rises).

If you use the mouth-to-nose technique, close the mouth. In either case make sure the chest rises when you give a breath.

Not only does it prevent facial drooping from occurring again, but it also helps facial muscles regain their strength.\n\n【3】After a thorough physical examination, a physical therapist identifies the weaknesses caused by this condition.\n\n【4】Physical therapy helps patients perform daily activities since it retrains muscles into working the way you want them to work. Physical therapy is intended to help people relearn their facial movements and is commonly referred to as initiation exercises.\n\n【5】Once patients have successfully overcome the challenging period of relearning, physical therapy is used to make muscles 'relearn' certain movements.

The alveolar-capillary membrane is destroyed in diseases such as emphysema, but is unaffected by well-controlled asthma.\n\n【1】Alveolus ( pl. alveoli ): An alveolus is a lung's air sac. Oxygen is exchanged for carbon dioxide in the lung alveoli.\n\n【2】A dense network of capillary vessels surrounds each alveolus. The close arrangement allows for very rapid exchange (or \"diffusion\") of oxygen from alveolus to capillary, and of carbon dioxide from capillary to alveolus.\n\n【3】A healthy adult human lung contains approximately 300 million alveoli.\n\n【4】The average diameter of a human alveolus is one quarter of a millimeter.\n\n【5】The total alveolar surface available for gas exchange in a healthy adult approximates 100 meters 2 , which is about the size of a tennis court.\n\n【6】Anaphylaxis: The most severe form of an allergic reaction or response. If untreated, anaphylaxis can be fatal.\n\n【7】The term \"anaphylactic shock\" is sometimes used to describe the most dramatic and serious form of anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis usually involves several organ systems, including the cardiovascular system, the skin, the respiratory system, and the gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms include a dangerous drop in blood pressure (hypotension), hives (urticaria) with itching and rash, respiratory distress and wheezing, throat tightness, nau- sea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.\n\n【8】Immediate emergency treatment is imperative. Persons at risk for the development of anaphylaxis, such as persons known to have had a prior significant allergic reaction to peanut or bee stings for example, should always have injectable epinephrine on hand.\n\n【9】If an anaphylactic reaction were to occur, prompt injection of epinephrine under the skin is literally life saving.\n\n【10】Antibody: A protein molecule pro- duced in blood or in tissues in direct response to a foreign substance or antigen. A specific antigen leads to the production of a corresponding specific antibody. The production of antibody can be beneficial or deleterious, depending on the circumstances.\n\n【11】Antibody made in response to an infectious agent, measles, for example, will protect against a second measles infection or a recurrence.\n\n【12】Antibody made in response to common environmental agents such as pollens, grasses, mold, and animal dander may lead to the development of allergy. Only susceptible persons (allergic or atopic individuals) will actually produce antibody against common allergens. The presence of antibody in response to a particular antigen is referred to as \"sensitization\" to that particular antigen. When such a person goes on to develop an allergy to that allergen, the antibody is usually of the IgE class.\n\n【13】Arterial: Related to one or more arteries.

When we compared the convicts' self-esteem with published norms for young adult men (mostly college students) from two dozen different studies, the prisoners were about in the middle. On narcissism, however, the violent prisoners had a higher mean score than any other published sample. It was the crucial trait that distinguished these prisoners from college students. If prison seeks to deflate young men's delusions that they are God's gift to the world, it fails.\n\n【1】## What About Deep Down?\n\n【2】A COMMON QUESTION in response to these findings is: \"Maybe violent people seem on the surface to have a high opinion of themselves, but isn't this just an act? Mightn't they really have low self-esteem on the inside, even if they won't admit it?\" This argument has a logical flaw, however. We know from ample research that people with overt low self-esteem are not aggressive. Why should low self-esteem cause aggression only when it is hidden and not when it is overt? The only difference between hidden and overt low self-esteem is the fact of its being hidden, and if that is the crucial difference, then the cause of violence is not the low self-esteem itself but the concealment of it. And what is concealing it is the veneer of egotism—which brings us back to the threatened egotism theory.\n\n【3】Various researchers have tried and failed to find any sign of a soft inner core among violent people. Martin Sanchez- Jankowski, who spent 10 years living with various gangs and wrote one of the most thorough studies of youth gang life, had this to say: \"There have been some studies of gangs that suggest that many gang members have tough exteriors but are insecure on the inside. This is a mistaken observation.\" Dan Olweus of the University of Bergen in Norway has devoted his career to studying childhood bullies, and he agrees: \"In contrast to a fairly common assumption among psychologists and psychiatrists, we have found no indicators that the aggressive bullies (boys) are anxious and insecure under a tough surface.\" The case should not be overstated. Psychology is not yet adept at measuring hidden aspects of personality, especially ones that a person may not be willing to admit even to himself or herself. But at present there is no empirical evidence or the-\n\n【4】## More To Explore\n\n【5】Relation of Threatened Egotism to Violence and Aggression: The Dark Side of High Self-Esteem. Roy F.

Narcissists are no more aggressive than anyone else, as long as no one insults or criticizes them. But when they receive an insult— which could be a seemingly minor remark or act that would not bother other people— the response tends to be much more aggressive than normal.\n\n【11】Thus, the formula of threatened egotism combines something about the person with something about the situation. Whatever the details of cause and effect, this appears to be the most accurate formula for predicting violence and aggression.\n\n【12】These patterns raise misgivings about how schools and other groups seek to boost self-esteem with feel-good exercises. A favorable opinion of self can put a person on a hair trigger, especially when this favorable opinion is unwarranted. In my view, there is nothing wrong with helping students and others to take pride in accomplishments and good deeds. But there is plenty of reason to worry about encouraging people to think highly of themselves when they haven't earned it. Praise should be tied to performance (including improvement) rather than dispensed freely as if everyone had a right to it simply for being oneself.\n\n【13】The person with low self-esteem emerges from our investigation as someone who is not prone to aggressive responses. Instead one should beware of people who regard themselves as superior to others, especially when those beliefs are inflated, weakly grounded in reality or heavily dependent on having others confirm them frequently. Conceited, self-important individuals turn nasty toward those who puncture their bubbles of self-love.\n\n【14】E", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "inals in prison and gave them the self-esteem and nar-", "bbox": [61.0, 86.0, 333.0, 101.0]}, {"text": "cissism questionnaires.

In dense molecular clouds, these dust cores are no larger than one tenthousandth of a millimeter.\n\n【3】Despite these painstaking observations, researchers still had no explanation for how the organic molecules could endure and react within the ice.

Blake also serves as chief of the Exobiology Branch at Ames. His other research interests include searching for signs of life in extraterrestrial rocks and designing spacecraft instruments that can analyze minerals on other planets. Jenniskens also led NASA's first astrobiology mission to explore how comet matter impacted Earth during the recent Leonid meteor showers.\n\n【7】ed high-magnification images and electron-diffraction patterns as the ice warmed or cooled.\n\n【8】When the temperature in our cryogenic microscope was low enough (below 30 kelvins) and when the water molecules were deposited slowly enough (fewer than 100 microns an hour), we created an amorphous solid very similar to the structures of interstellar ice that are interpreted from infrared spectra. Our experiments showed that this ice was in a special high-density form, known until then only from one unconfirmed x-ray-diffraction experiment conducted in 1976. We confirmed that water vapor deposited at about 14 degrees above absolute zero had a different amorphous structure than a similar deposit formed at a warmer temperature of 77 K. Indeed, we could follow the transition from the low-temperature form into the higher-temperature form as we gradually warmed the ice. We could best explain the diffraction patterns of the low-temperature form if we assumed that some water molecules were frozen inside the partially formed cages of neighboring molecules. This overpacking of oxygen atoms yields high-density amorphous ice, which at 1.1 grams per cubic centimeter is about 15 percent denser than ordinary ice.\n\n【9】We also confirmed the 1984 findings of H. G. Heide, then at the Fritz Haber Institute of the Max Planck Society in Berlin, who bombarded high-density amorphous ice with high-energy electrons. When he conducted this experiment at temperatures below 30 K, the ice restructured rapidly; in fact, it flowed. The discovery that amorphous ice is more like liquid water than it is like crystalline ice came as a huge surprise.\n\n【10】Most scientists had previously assumed that all forms of water ice, when cooled below a few tens of kelvins, would remain unchanged nearly indefinitely. Heide had found that, irrespective of its initial structure, the ice would transform into the high-density amorphous form once it was irradiated. Other researchers have since discovered that ultraviolet photons, which frequently irradiate cold molecular clouds, can also change the ice's structure in this manner.\n\n【11】Drawing on our experiments at Ames, we reasoned that this radiation converts most interstellar ice into the high-density amorphous form. We now understand that overpacked water molecules in this ice, and the defects that exist within the molecular stacking pattern, facilitate molecular mobility within the structure. As a result, it is within interstellar ice that the biologically important elements carbon, oxygen and nitrogen joined together for the first time to form organic compounds. Studies show that exposing high-density amorphous ice to energetic particles or photons breaks impurities such as carbon monoxide and ammonia into radicals that can migrate within the ice until they combine with other reactive species.\n\n【12】Once we had established a reasonable mechanism for the origin of organic compounds within interstellar ice, we wondered how such materials could have been preserved over the times and distances necessary to reach Earth. The best candidates for this duty are comets—relicts of the icy planetesimals that coalesced during the gravitational collapse of a cold Continued on page 50", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "LIQUID HELIUM escapes a specialized cryogenic electron", "bbox": [93.0, 408.0, 356.0, 422.0]}, {"text": "microscope as the authors, Peter Jenniskens ( left ) and David F.", "bbox": [94.0, 423.0, 387.0, 438.0]}, {"text": "Blake, prepare a sample of amorphous ice.", "bbox": [94.0, 440.0, 291.0, 453.0]}], "block_type": "Caption", "full_blocks": [92.0, 407.0, 386.0, 452.0], "position": 2}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "of dust and gas than visible light can—have enabled as-", "bbox": [94.0, 471.0, 407.0, 485.0]}, {"text": "tronomers to detect more than 100 different organic com-", "bbox": [94.0, 487.0, 408.0, 501.0]}, {"text": "pounds in cold molecular clouds.

This initial evaluation must be efficient because if the patient has STEMI, the goals of reperfusion are to administer fibrinolytics within 30 minutes of arrival (30-minute interval \"door-todrug\") or to provide PCI within 90 minutes of arrival (90-minute interval \"door-to-balloon\") (Class I, LOE A).\n\n【7】Potential delay during the in-hospital evaluation period may occur from door to data, from data (ECG) to decision, and from decision to drug (or PCI). These 4 major points of in-hospital therapy are commonly referred to as the \"4 D's.\" 109 All providers must focus on minimizing delays at each of these points.

ST-segment elevation or presumed new LBBB 删除5:<u>(Box 5)</u> is characterized by ST-segment elevation in 2 or more contiguous leads and is classified as ST-segment elevation MI ( STEMI ). Threshold values for ST-segment elevation consistent with STEMI are J-point elevation 0.2 mV (2 mm) in leads V2 and V3 and 0.1 mV (1 mm) in all other leads (men ≥ 40 years old); J-point elevation 0.25 mV (2.5 mm) in leads V2 and V3 and 0.1 mV\n\n【8】(1 mm) in all other leads (men <40 years old); J-point elevation 0.15 mV (1.5 mm) in leads V2 and V3 and 0.1 mV (1 mm) in all other leads (women). 113  2. Ischemic ST-segment depression > 0.5 mm (0.05 mV) or dynamic T-wave inversion with pain or discomfort 删除5:<u>(Box 9)</u> is classified as UA/NSTEMI. Nonpersistent or transient ST-segment elevation ≥ 0.5 mm for < 20 minutes is also included in this category. Threshold values for ST-segment depression consistent with ischemia are J-point depression 0.05 mV (-.5 mm) in leads V2 and V3 and -0.1 mV (-1 mm) in all other leads (men and women). 113  3. The nondiagnostic ECG with either normal or minimally abnormal (ie, nonspecific ST-segment or T-wave changes, Box 13). This ECG is nondiagnostic and inconclusive for ischemia, requiring further risk stratification. This classification includes patients with normal ECGs and those with ST-segment deviation of <0.5 mm (0.05 mV) or T-wave inversion of 删除0:<u>¶</u>0.2 mV.\n\n【9】This category of ECG is termed nondiagnostic .\n\n【10】The interpretation of the 12-lead ECG is a key step in this process, allowing not only for this classification but also the selection of the most appropriate diagnostic and management strategies. Not all providers are skilled in the interpretation of the ECG; as a consequence, the use of computer-aided ECG interpretation has been studied. While expert ECG intepretation is ideal, computer-aided ECG interpretation may have a role, particularly in assisting inexperienced clinicians in achieving a diagnosis (Class IIa, LOE B).\n\n【11】## Cardiac Biomarkers\n\n【12】Serial cardiac biomarkers are often obtained during evaluation of patients suspected of ACS.  Cardiac troponin is the preferred biomarker and is more sensitive than creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB). Cardiac troponins are useful in diagnosis, risk stratification, and determination of prognosis.\n\n【13】An elevated level of troponin correlates with an increased risk of death, and greater elevations predict greater risk of adverse outcom删除6:<u>e.</u>n the patients with STEMI reperfusion therapy should not be delayed pending results of biomarkers.

Other studies found no difference in neurologically intact surviva删除6:<u>l.</u> systematic review 378 . 379 and a recent evidence-based clinical policy review 380 concluded that, based on the available evidence, improvement in neurologically intact survival following treatment for carbon monoxide poisoning with hyperbaric oxygen is possible but unproven.\n\n【9】Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is associated with a low incidence of severe side effects. Because hyperbaric oxygen therapy appears to confer little risk, 380 the available data suggest that hyperbaric oxygen therapy may be helpful in treatment of acute carbon monoxide poisoning in patients with severe toxicity (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【10】Patients with carbon monoxide poisoning who develop a cardiac injury have an increased risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality for at least 7 years after the event, even if hyperbaric oxygen is administere删除6:<u>d.</u>lthough data about effective interventions in this population are lacking, it is reasonable to advise enhanced follow-up for these patients.\n\n【11】On the basis of this conflicting evidence, the routine transfer of patients to a hyperbaric treatment facility following resuscitation from severe cardiovascular toxicity should be carefully considered, weighing the risk of transport against the possible improvement in neurologically intact survival.\n\n【12】BLS and ACLS for the trauma patient are fundamentally the same as that for the patient with primary cardiac arrest, with focus on support of airway, breathing, and circulation. In addition, reversible causes of cardiac arrest need to considered. While CPR in the pulseless trauma patient has overall been considered futile, several reversible causes of cardiac arrest in the context of trauma are correctible and their prompt treatment could be life-saving. These include hypoxia, hypovolemia, diminished cardiac output secondary to pneumothorax or pericardial tamponade, and hypothermia.\n\n【13】When multisystem trauma is present or trauma involves the head and neck, the cervical spine must be stabilized. A jaw thrust should be used instead of a head tilt–chin lift to establish a patent airway. If breathing is inadequate and the patient's face is bloody, ventilation should be provided with a barrier device, a pocket mask, or a bag-mask device while maintaining cervical spine stabilization. Stop any visible hemorrhage using direct compression and appropriate dressings. If the patient is completely unresponsive despite rescue breathing, provide standard CPR and defibrillation as indicated.\n\n【14】Cyanide is a surprisingly common chemical. In addition to industrial sources, cyanide can be found in jewelry cleaners, electroplating solutions, and as a metabolic product of the putative antitumor drug amygdalin (laetrile). Cyanide is a major component of fire smoke, and cyanide poisoning must be considered in victims of smoke inhalation who have hypotension, central nervous system depression, metabolic acidosis, or soot in the nares or respiratory secretion删除6:<u>s.</u>yanide poisoning causes rapid cardiovascular collapse, which manifests as hypotension, lactic acidosis, central apnea, and seizures.\n\n【15】After initiation of BLS care, if bag-mask ventilation is inadequate, an advanced airway should be inserted while maintaining cervical spine stabilization.

Both methacholine challenge testing and cold-air exercise challenge are examples of bronchoprovocation tests.\n\n【1】Bronchoscopy: A procedure that allows a lung specialist to visually inspect the lungs' breathing passages (bronchi), and to obtain specimens or biopsies of any abnormalities. Bronchoscopy can also be used for therapeutic purposes, to remove mucus accumulation or inhaled foreign bodies, or to place stents in the airways in the case of abnormal narrowing.\n\n【2】Bronchus ( pl. bronchi ): A breathing passage or tube. The trachea splits at the level of the carina into the right and left mainstem bronchi. The right mainstem bronchus leads air to and from the entire right lung. The left mainstem bronchus leads air to and from the entire left lung. The mainstem bronchi further subdivide into bronchial tubes that lead to the subdivisions of each lung. Those bronchial tubes eventually branch out into smaller and narrower air passages called bronchioles before ending in alveoli.\n\n【3】Caffeine: A naturally occurring compound found in coffee and tea, and added to other beverages such as soda or \"energy\" drinks. It is also added some medications, such as those used for treatment of pain or headache. Caffeine has several effects in the body. It is a weak lung bronchodilator. It is a central nervous system stimulant, and increases mental alertness and wakefulness.\n\n【4】Caffeine acts as a mild kidney diuretic, leading to an increase in urine excretion.\n\n【5】Capillary: A capillary is a tiny, thinwalled blood vessel. The word is derived from capillus , the Latin word for hair. The lungs' capillaries play a crucial role in health as part of the alveolar-capillary membrane, absorbing O 2 into the body and getting rid of CO 2 .\n\n【6】Carbon dioxide: Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is an odorless, colorless gas produced as a waste by-product by the body's metabolism. Carbon dioxide is normally excreted by the lungs, and should not be confused with carbon monoxide (symbol: CO), which is a poisonous, odorless gas that, when inhaled, can lead to carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\n【7】Cardiac asthma: Refers to the symp- toms produced by dysfunction of the left ventricle, the heart's main pumping chamber in a condition known as CHF, or congestive heart failure.\n\n【8】The symptoms of \"cardiac asthma\" are reminiscent of those experienced by persons during an asthma exacerbation, but the symptoms are not due to asthma. In cardiac asthma, breathlessness, cough, and wheezing occur because of heart disease combined with a state of fluid retention, not because of a lung condition.

Kline [\"Whose Blood Is It, Anyway?\"] cites the odds that a newborn will need to use his or her own cord blood in the future as 1 in 200,000 and attributes this statistic to the National Institutes of Health. But the NIH provided the Cord Blood Registry with information estimating an individual's need for such a transplant to be 1 in 2,703. To our knowledge, the 1-in-200,000 figure has never been explained or published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\n【9】DAVID T. HARRIS Scientific Director, Cord Blood Registry\n\n【10】KLINE REPLIES: The 1-in-200,000 statistic came from an official at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. Although several other researchers have made such estimates, determining the likelihood that an individual would ever need his or her own cord blood is an experiment in progress. My article cited a 20- fold range in probability that a newborn would need a cord blood transplant. This underscores how much still remains to be understood about the uses of cord blood transplantation in the treatment of disease.\n\n【11】We still do not fully comprehend why the cancers of some people who receive transplants recur. Until we answer this question, we will not know which patients will benefit most from cord blood transplants. It would be a great help if blood banks made available data on the total number of cord blood units they collect and the number of units that are used for transplantation. Only in this way will we know the probability that a person who has stored his or her cord blood will actually find a use for it.\n\n【12】[Editors' note: The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute—part of the NIH—informed S CIENTIFIC A MERICAN that it has a policy of not responding to letters to the editor. ]\n\n【13】## Amino Acids\n\n【14】THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS I cannot let Robert M. Hazen [\"Life's Rocky Start\"] get away with pleading for pure chance as the reason why the amino acids in living organisms are predominantly \"left-handed.\" The left- and righthanded varieties of amino acids can be made in 50–50 quantities, as can mirrorimage crystal faces. So the fact that all natural substances are predominantly lefthanded must result not merely from chance. The other explanation is that somewhere in the mirror world of righthanded molecules, there is a combination that just does not work as well, and so natural selection ruled the right-handeds out.\n\n【15】PETER ROSE Knutsford, England\n\n【16】HAZEN REPLIES: I have two reasons for pleading pure chance. First, for every plausible mechanism that yields a significant excess of left over right, somewhere there exists the mirror mechanism. Second, even if the earth started with an excess of left- or right- handed molecules, amino acids gradually switch back and forth, yielding a 50–50 mix on a geologic timescale.\n\n【17】## Pride And Praise\n\n【18】Roy F. Baumeister's ingenious research [\"Violent Pride\"] demonstrates that narcissists are aggressive.

We produced maps showing the country divided into as few as four ecoregions and as many as 5,000. The maps with fewer ecoregions divided the country into recognizable zones—for example, the Rocky Mountain states and the desert Southwest. In contrast, the maps with thousands of ecoregions are far more complex than any previous classification of the country's environments. Because many plants and animals live in only one or two ecoregions, our maps may be useful to ecologists who study endangered species.\n\n【3】In our first maps the colors of the ecoregions were randomly assigned, but we later produced maps in which the colors of the ecoregions reflect the similarity of their respective environments. We statistically combined nine of the environmental variables into three composite characteristics, which we represented on the map with varying levels of red, green and blue. When the map is drawn this way, it shows gradations of color instead of sharp borders: the lush Southeast is mostly green, the cold Northeast is mainly blue, and the arid West is primarily red [删除9:<u>see illustration D on page 76]</u>.\n\n【4】## More To Explore\n\n【5】Cluster Computing: Linux Taken to the Extreme.

Using two projected climate scenarios developed by other research groups, we compared the current ecoregion map with the maps predicted for the year 2099. According to these projections, by the end of this century the environment in Pittsburgh will be more like that of present-day Atlanta, and conditions in Minneapolis will resemble those in present-day St. Louis.\n\n【11】## The Future Of Clusters\n\n【12】THE TRADITIONAL MEASURE OF SU- percomputer performance is benchmark speed: how fast the system runs a standard program. As scientists, however, we prefer to focus on how well the system can handle practical applications. To evaluate the Stone SouperComputer, we fed the same ecoregion mapping problem to ORNL's Intel Paragon supercomputer shortly before it was retired. At one time, this machine was the laboratory's fastest, with a peak performance of 150 gigaflops.\n\n【13】On a per-processor basis, the run time on the Paragon was essentially the same as that on the Stone SouperComputer. We have never officially clocked our cluster (we are loath to steal computing cycles from real work), but the system has a theoretical peak performance of about 1.2 gigaflops. Ingenuity in parallel algorithm design is more important than raw speed or capacity: in this young science, David and Goliath (or Beowulf and Grendel!) still compete on a level playing field.\n\n【14】The Beowulf trend has accelerated since we built the Stone SouperComputer.\n\n【15】New clusters with exotic names—Grendel, Naegling, Megalon, Brahma, Avalon, Medusa and theHive, to mention just a few—have steadily raised the performance curve by delivering higher speeds at lower costs. As of last November, 28 clusters of PCs, workstations or servers were on the list of the world's 500 fastest computers. The LosLobos cluster at the University of New Mexico has 512 Intel Pen- tium III processors and is the 80th-fastest system in the world, with a performance of 237 gigaflops. The Cplant cluster at Sandia National Laboratories has 580 Compaq Alpha processors and is ranked 84th. The National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy are planning to build even more advanced clusters that could operate in the teraflops range (one trillion floating-point operations per second), rivaling the speed of the fastest supercomputers on the planet.\n\n【16】Beowulf systems are also muscling their way into the corporate world. Major computer vendors are now selling clusters to businesses with large computational needs. IBM, for instance, is building a cluster of 1,250 servers for NuTec Sciences, a biotechnology firm that plans to use the system to identify disease-causing genes. An equally important trend is the development of networks of PCs that contribute their processing power to a collective task. An example is SETI@home, a project launched by researchers at the University of California at Berkeley who are analyzing deep-space radio signals for signs of intelligent life. SETI@home sends chunks of data over the Internet to more than three million PCs, which process the radio-signal data in their idle time. Some experts in the computer industry predict that researchers will eventually be able to tap into a \"computational grid\" that will work like a power grid: users will be able to obtain processing power just as easily as they now get electricity.\n\n【17】Above all, the Beowulf concept is an empowering force. It wrests high-level computing away from the privileged few and makes low-cost parallel-processing systems available to those with modest resources. Research groups, high schools, colleges or small businesses can build or buy their own Beowulf clusters, realizing the promise of a supercomputer in every basement.删除13:<u> Should you decide to join the parallel-processing proletariat, please contact us through our Web site (http:// extremelinux.esd.ornl.gov/) and tell us about your Beowulf-building experiences</u>.

Collins\n\n【8】arge quantum computers could in principle handle some of the toughest computing problems, such as factoring numbers to break encrypted messages—answering those questions in seconds instead of the centuries that today's computers would require. But quantum computers are extraordinarily difficult to build; they rely on exquisitely controlled interactions among fragile quantum states. Do they have to? Recently Ian A. Walmsley and his co-workers at the University of Rochester demonstrated that ordinary, classical light waves can perform as efficiently as one class of quantum computer.\n\n【9】The Rochester experiment searched a sorted 50-element database. An ordinary computer doing a binary search of such a database would need to query the database six times (enough to search 64 elements: 2 6 = 64). In 1997 Lov K. Grover of Bell Laboratories proved that a quantum computer only has to query once, no matter how large the database.\n\n【10】Walmsley's group used a light pulse in an interferometer, a device that gives light waves a choice of two paths to follow. Along one path, a diffraction grating splits the pulse apart into its broad range of frequencies, like white light through a prism. The 50 elements of the database correspond to 50 bands of that spectrum. The database itself is represented by an acousto-optic modulator through which the light passes. The modulator imprints a phase shift (that is, it moves the positions of the peaks and troughs of the light wave) on just one of the 50 bands. In essence, each band of the light \"looks at\" a different database entry (a different part of the modulator), and only one \"finds\" the target. When the pulse is recombined with light from the other arm of the in- terferometer, the phase-shifted band alone shines brightly into a spectrometer, which reads off the result. Only the wave nature of light, not its quantum features, is used.\n\n【11】The experiment is similar to established methods of optical signal processing that, for example, pass beams through holograms.\n\n【12】What's new is that it directly exemplifies a general result that Walmsley and his colleagues demonstrated theoretically late last year. \"For every machine that uses [only] quantum interference,\" Walmsley explains, \"there is an equivalent, equally efficient one that uses classical optical interference.\" Reading out a result on a quantum computer necessarily involves detection of particles, and the extra device components and computational steps for that process eliminate the quantum computer's advantage. According to Emanuel H. Knill of Los Alamos National Laboratory, that insight provides a new perspective \"on the relationship between computing with waves and quantum computing.\" The most powerful quantum algorithms, such as fast factoring, however, require an additional quantum feature: so-called entanglement of the states of many particles. Classical waves cannot emulate those algorithms efficiently, but light turns out to be well suited to such true quantum computation in another way. In theory, a full-power quantum computer can be built by sending individual photons through simple linear optical elements, such as beam splitters and phase shifters. Such an approach was proposed in 1997, but those early designs needed exponentially more optical elements as the number of qubits increased—utterly impractical for any but the smallest devices.\n\n【13】In January, Knill, his colleague Raymond Laflamme and Gerard J. Milburn of the University of Queensland in Australia exhibited a design whose circuit complexity would increase in linear proportion, not exponentially.\n\n【14】Unlike the Rochester experiment, this scheme relies on quantum effects of individual photons navigating paths through the device but avoids the need for nonlinear interactions between photons, something only readily achieved at very high intensities or with extraordinary equipment such as resonant cavities or light-slowing Bose-Einstein condensates.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "Three levels of computational ability", "bbox": [50.0, 285.0, 204.0, 298.0]}, {"text": "are, from weakest to strongest:", "bbox": [70.0, 297.0, 203.0, 311.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [49.0, 284.0, 203.0, 310.0], "position": 3}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "■ Classical, bit-based computing of", "bbox": [53.0, 325.0, 204.0, 337.0]}, {"text": "today's digital machines", "bbox": [98.0, 338.0, 204.0, 350.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [52.0, 324.0, 203.0, 349.0], "position": 4}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "■ Classical light-wave computing,", "bbox": [60.0, 365.0, 202.0, 377.0]}, {"text": "which uses limited aspects of", "bbox": [76.0, 379.0, 204.0, 390.0]}, {"text": "quantum computing—namely,", "bbox": [74.0, 393.0, 203.0, 405.0]}, {"text": "its wave nature", "bbox": [136.0, 405.0, 204.0, 417.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [59.0, 364.0, 203.0, 416.0], "position": 5}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "= Quantum computing, which", "bbox": [78.0, 432.0, 204.0, 444.0]}, {"text": "uses entanglement of", "bbox": [108.0, 445.0, 204.0, 457.0]}, {"text": "quantum states as well as their", "bbox": [70.0, 459.0, 204.0, 470.0]}, {"text": "wave nature to speed", "bbox": [111.0, 473.0, 204.0, 484.0]}, {"text": "processing exponentially for", "bbox": [81.0, 485.0, 204.0, 497.0]}, {"text": "certain problems", "bbox": [129.0, 499.0, 204.0, 510.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [69.0, 431.0, 203.0, 509.0], "position": 6}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "LIGHT WAVES AT WORK can search", "bbox": [49.0, 571.0, 204.0, 583.0]}, {"text": "a database as efficiently as a", "bbox": [74.0, 585.0, 204.0, 597.0]}, {"text": "quantum computer.", "bbox": [115.0, 599.0, 203.0, 611.0]}, {"text": "1 Diffraction grating spreads the", "bbox": [61.0, 611.0, 204.0, 626.0]}, {"text": "pulse into its component spectrum,", "bbox": [48.0, 625.0, 203.0, 638.0]}, {"text": "bands of which correspond to", "bbox": [77.0, 639.0, 204.0, 651.0]}, {"text": "the 50 database elements.", "bbox": [84.0, 651.0, 203.0, 663.0]}, {"text": "2 The modulator shifts the phase", "bbox": [59.0, 665.0, 204.0, 676.0]}, {"text": "of one band, that of the target", "bbox": [72.0, 678.0, 204.0, 691.0]}, {"text": "database element. 3 Ordinary wave", "bbox": [48.0, 693.0, 204.0, 704.0]}, {"text": "interference cancels the unshifted", "bbox": [50.0, 706.0, 204.0, 718.0]}, {"text": "bands. 4 Spectrometer reads off", "bbox": [61.0, 719.0, 204.0, 731.0]}, {"text": "the remaining light—the", "bbox": [95.0, 733.0, 203.0, 745.0]}, {"text": "target element.", "bbox": [133.0, 747.0, 203.0, 758.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [47.0, 570.0, 203.0, 757.0], "position": 7}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Computing with Light", "bbox": [253.0, 54.0, 664.0, 103.0]}], "block_type": "Title", "full_blocks": [252.0, 53.0, 663.0, 102.0], "position": 9}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "CLASSICAL WAVES FOR PSEUDO QUANTUM COMPUTING BY GRAHAM P.

Ozone treatment and disinfection of swimming pools has been commonly practiced in Europe for over 50 years, and is slowly being introduced and accepted in the United States. Swimming pools disinfected primarily with ozone have enhanced water clarity, along with greatly reduced chemical odors. The pool water is purer and far less irritating to skin, eyes, and lungs. If you live in an area with a choice of pools, you may want to research whether any of the pools are primarily disinfected with ozone. The first commercial indoor pool in of the state of New York to be primarily disinfected by ozone, for instance, is located in New York City, at the 92 ad Street YMHA in Manhattan.\n\n【4】To successfully incorporate exercise and sports in your asthma treatment, keep your asthma well controlled,", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "to participate in.

Asthma medicine, especially that administered in inhaled form, is not a contraindication to nursing your infant. Breast-feeding has many widely known advantages for both mother and child, and may even have beneficial effects in delaying or altogether avoiding the development of asthma in young children.

Breast-feeding also appears to delay the development of allergy in children. Studies indicate that breast-fed children known to be at increased risk for the development of allergy (because of a family history) develop allergies at an older age as compared to children with similar risk factors who are not exclusively breast-fed.

The use of clopidogrel in ACS patients with a high likelihood of needing CABG requires weighing the risk of bleeding if given against the potential for perioperative ACS events if withheld. The current ACC/AHA guidelines recommend withholding clopidogrel for 5 to 7 days in patients for whom CABG is anticipated.\n\n【14】In patients up to 75 years of age with STEMI managed by fibrinolysis, a consistent improvement in combined event rate (cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal infarction, and nonfatal stroke) and/or mortality, with a resultant small increase in major bleeding, is observed when clopidogrel, in a 300-mg loading dose, was administered in addition to aspirin and heparin (low-molecular-weight heparin [LMWH] or unfractionated heparin [UFH]), at the time of initial management (followed by a 75 mg daily dose for up to 8 days in hospital删除6:<u>).</u>n patients with STEMI managed with PPCI, there is a reduction in combined event rate (cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal infarction, and nonfatal stroke) and/or mortality with a resultant small increase in major bleeding\n\n【15】删除13:<u>删除12:<u>Downloaded from http://circ.ahajournals.org/ by guest on September 4, 2011</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "ered in consultation with the cardiologist if there is a", "bbox": [60.0, 84.0, 377.0, 99.0]}, {"text": "substantial delay to PCI.", "bbox": [60.0, 100.0, 196.0, 113.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [59.0, 83.0, 376.0, 112.0], "position": 3}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Complicated AMI", "bbox": [156.0, 128.0, 280.0, 146.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [155.0, 127.0, 279.0, 145.0], "position": 4}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Cardiogenic Shock, LV Failure, and Congestive", "bbox": [60.0, 149.0, 355.0, 166.0]}, {"text": "Heart Failure", "bbox": [60.0, 167.0, 146.0, 180.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [59.0, 148.0, 354.0, 179.0], "position": 5}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Infarction of ≥ 40% of the LV myocardium usually results in", "bbox": [60.0, 180.0, 377.0, 195.0]}, {"text": "cardiogenic shock and carries a high mortality rate.

Unwitting insects or the right wind might carry GM crop pollen to weedy plant relatives, fertilizing them. And if that happens, the newly endowed plants could break ecological rank, becoming \"superweeds\" that are unusually resistant to eradication by natural predators or pesticides. Scientists have stopped asking if such gene flow is possible. \"In many cases,\" says Cornell ecologist Allison Power, \"we know gene flow will occur. The question now is, What will the consequences be?\" So far no scientific studies have found evidence of GM crops causing superweeds, and a 10-year study reported in Nature in February found no weedlike behavior by GM potatoes, beets, corn or canola planted in England. But worrisome anecdotes have appeared. Canadian farmers, in particular, have described GM canola escaping from farm fields and invading wheat crops like a weed. This canola also resisted pesticide sprays.\n\n【3】Power's studies of gene flow from virus-resistant GM plants give further reason for precaution. For now, virus-resistant crops stake a small share of the GM landscape, but they are likely to become more prevalent, particularly in the developing world. Power investigates gene flow in cultivated grain crops— wheat, barley and oats—engineered to contain genes that make the plants resistant to the barley yellow dwarf virus (which damages some 100 grass species). These GM grain crops could be on the market within the next decade.\n\n【4】Power's work, carried out in the laboratory, indicates that wild oats—a weedy relative of cultivated oats—can \"catch\" the genes conferring resistance to barley yellow dwarf virus. If that happened in the field, she says, wild oats might run amok in the western U.S., outcompeting native grasses with kudzu-like intensity. Every GM crop, Power cautions, brings its own environmental personality and its own risks.\n\n【5】In the U.S., at least, landscape logistics make it rather unlikely that herbicide-tolerant or Bt crops will spread their biotech genes to weeds. That's because the GM crops sown in this country have no close relatives in the regions where they grow; most plants can pollinate others only if the recipients and the donors have certain features in common, such as the same chromosome number, life cycle or preferred habitat. A known exception to the \"no relatives\" rule in the U.S. is wild cotton growing in Hawaii and southern Florida, which, by virtue of its unusual similarity to GM cotton, can accept the GM pollen. To separate the wild and biotech plants from each other, the EPA has ordered companies not to sell GM cotton south of Florida's Interstate 60 or in Hawaii.\n\n【6】But it may prove harder to avoid creating superweeds outside North America, where weedy relatives of cultivated crops are common. Wild cotton, for instance, creeps past the Florida Keys, across the Gulf of Mexico and into Mexico. In South America, a weedy corn relative, teosinte, dresses the edges of domesticated cornfields.

Will Pregnancy Make My Asthma Worse? How Will Pregnancy Modify Or Affect My Asthma?\n\n【1】Pregnancy will not necessarily make your asthma worse or more symptomatic. Studies of asthma in pregnancy reveal that about one third of pregnant women with asthma will have no change in the degree of their asthma; one third will experience a lessening of their asthma symptoms and a decreased need for medication; and one third of will have worsening of the asthma in pregnancy. Approximately 1 of every 3 pregnant women with asthma will thus experience more asthma symptomatology and require an increase in asthma medication.\n\n【2】After the baby's delivery and the postpartum period, you can expect your asthma to gradually return to usual—whatever the usual was for you!\n\n【3】## 85. Do I Need To See My Asthma Specialist More Frequently Now That I’M Pregnant?\n\n【4】Yes, while you are pregnant, you should see your asthma specialist more frequently than before. In my practice, for example, I ask my pregnant patients with asthma to see me on a monthly basis, with about the same frequency that they visit the obstetrician. Some women may require more frequent appointments, and some less.\n\n【5】Now that you are pregnant, you and your asthma doctor have an \"extra\" to think about and to take into consideration.

One useful and handy formula for calculating an adult's ideal body weight requires knowledge of your height. Females are allowed 100 pounds for the first 5 feet of height, and 5 more pounds for each additional inch above 5 feet. A few additional pounds are added or subtracted for persons with large or small frames. So, a 5'3\" woman should ideally weigh about 115 pounds. The formula for men is similar: A man is allowed 106 pounds for \"the first\" 5 feet of height, and 6 additional pounds are added for every additional inch over 5 feet. A 6-foot tall man of average build would thus be expected to weigh 178 pounds. As for women, there is a correction for individuals with small and large frames.\n\n【3】Ideal body weight for children is best determined by computation of the body mass index (BMI). BMI is a measure that can also be used in adults. Assessment of BMI requires accurate measurement of height and weight, ideally in meters and kilograms. The BMI is the weight (in kilograms) divided by the square of the height (in meters). You will need to obtain a table of predicted BMI for any age to compare your child's BMI to the standard. A child with a BMI greater or equal to the 95th percentile for his or her age is considered obese. If you prefer not to do the math, there are several clever Web sites that ask you to enter data such as your weight, height, and age, and then calculate your ideal body weight and BMI for you.

Are Asthma Medications Harmful To The Unborn Child?\n\n【2】Many studies have been carried out all over the world to help doctors decide which asthma medicines are \"safest\" in pregnancy. The single biggest risk to an asthmatic woman's pregnancy is poor asthma control in the mother.\n\n【3】Uncontrolled asthma is very harmful to the developing baby and can result in devastating complications for both mother and child. Complications of poor asthma control include pregnancy-induced hypertension, pre-eclampsia and eclampsia in the mother, preterm labor and premature birth, intrauterine growth retardation, and low birth weight babies, along with increased perinatal morbidity and mortality. Inadequate control of the mother's asthma leads to a reduced oxygen supply to the developing baby (\"maternal hypoxia\"), as well as a decreased blood supply to the womb. All pulmonary specialists agree that they should treat their pregnant asthma patients with asthma medicines that are not only highly effective, but also as safe as possible for both mother and baby.\n\n【4】The FDA classifies all medicines approved since 1980 into one of five different categories. The FDA classification is based on studies of safety in pregnancy. The five categories are referred to as category A, B, C, D, and X (Table 33).

This appliance distalizes in a bodily manner because the distalization force is located near the center of resistance of the molars. (5,6,10,36,44)\n\n【23】This appliance is very similar to the Pendulum, but it has two advantages. First, the upper molars are distal删除16:<u>¬ </u>ized without the palatal movement that happens with the pendulum. Second, the Distal Jet can easily convert into a Nance button after the molar distalization has taken place. (5.6.44)\n\n【24】The Distal Jet is composed of:\n\n【25】A Nance button anchored to the premolars.\n\n【26】1.\n\n【27】2.\n\n【28】Two 0.036\" wires.\n\n【29】Two telescopic tubes imbedded in the acrylic of the 3.\n\n【30】Nance button.\n\n【31】Two NiTi open coils.\n\n【32】4.\n\n【33】Two stops or screws.\n\n【34】5.\n\n【35】The distalizing wires can be 0.036\" stainless steel wire; the distal part of the wire, bent as a bayonet, is going to be inserted in the palatine sheaths of both molars, and the mesial ends are inserted in the telescopic tubes that are imbedded in the acrylic of the Nance button. This is go删除16:<u>¬ </u>ing to work as a piston because the wire can slide freely in the telescopic tube. Over each tube a NiTi open coil and a screw are slipped on. The distalizing force is given by the total compression of the coil, which is accomplished by sliding the screw distally and adjusting it to its new position. The pair of telescopic tubes will be parallel to the occlusal plane and as close as possible to the center of resistance of the molar. (5.6.44)\n\n【36】The Nance button can be anchored on the first or second premolar. If the first premolars are used as anchorage, the second premolars will move with the molars during distalization, but the loss of anchorage and the overjet will increase. If we anchor the Nance button to the second premolars, we will have less anchorage loss, but the treatment time will increase because the canine and the premolars would have to be distalized in mass.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "5.", "bbox": [72.0, 87.0, 86.0, 102.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [71.0, 86.0, 85.0, 101.0], "position": 2}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "6.", "bbox": [72.0, 124.0, 85.0, 137.0]}, {"text": "7.", "bbox": [72.0, 139.0, 85.0, 155.0]}, {"text": "8.", "bbox": [72.0, 159.0, 86.0, 172.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [71.0, 123.0, 85.0, 171.0], "position": 3}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "It produces a pendular molar movement, so it is pos¬", "bbox": [98.0, 87.0, 384.0, 102.0]}, {"text": "sible that a posterior cross bite may develop.", "bbox": [98.0, 104.0, 344.0, 119.0]}, {"text": "The TMA wires can impinge in the palatine mucosa.", "bbox": [99.0, 121.0, 382.0, 137.0]}, {"text": "The occlusal rests can debond.", "bbox": [99.0, 139.0, 268.0, 155.0]}, {"text": "The anterior bite can open due to the fact that the", "bbox": [99.0, 157.0, 386.0, 171.0]}, {"text": "appliance distalizes molars rapidly.

This condition is sometimes referred to as 'Wind Attack' among the traditional Chinese.\n\n【2】Bell’s palsy according to Traditional Chinese medicine is said to develop due to exposure to wind that causes inflammation of the facial nerve. This results in qi or chi (vital energy) deficiency and the disruption of natural blood flow. Qi, also pronounced chi, is translated as life force or natural energy. Therefore, acupuncture sessions specifically target the effect of wind on the body and seek to improve blood circulation to the face and stimulate qi.\n\n【3】For successful recovery, traditional Chinese medicine practitioners recommend a combination of herbs to be used along with routine acupuncture. According to Chinese medicine experts, a weak and deficient immune system is also responsible for the development of Bell's palsy. They believe that if your body has a strong, healthy defense mechanism, your chances of being affected by Bell’s palsy are minimal. Therefore, certified acupuncturists also place a strong emphasis on maintaining a healthy lifestyle.\n\n【4】Your acupuncture session with a certified therapist might include numerous tips on staying stress-free and following a nutritious diet plan.

What Are The Characteristics Of “Fatal” Or “Near-Fatal” Asthma?\n\n【1】Fatal and near-fatal asthma have been the subject of much interest and study by physicians. By obtaining as much information as possible on persons who die or almost die of asthma, we can hopefully learn how to prevent similar deaths in the future.\n\n【2】The majority of persons with near-fatal or fatal asthma tend to underestimate the severity of their symptoms and present for care only after several days of clearly worsening symptoms. The symptoms are usually responses to triggers that can include a viral infection, intense exposure to allergens, noncompliance with prescribed asthma treatment, air pollution, changes in weather, or severe emotional stress. By waiting for a period of days before intervening to control the exacerbation, the opportunity for effective treatment is lost; in other words, it is too late by the time help is on the way. In most cases of fatal or near-fatal asthma, the actual disease can be controlled, but \"human patient factors\" adversely modify the outcome.\n\n【3】The more unusual scenario of very rapidly progressive asthma that exacerbates dramatically over the course of several hours occurs in the minority of patients with near-fatal or fatal asthma (Table 24). Some individuals have a particularly aggressive and severe type of asthma that, despite ideal and perfect compliance with medical treatment and recommendations, does lead to severe complications.

Two vocal cords allow for speech as inhaled air passes between them, and sets up vibrations within the larynx located in the mid-neck.\n\n【2】Leptin: Leptin is a human protein identified in 1994, and named after leptos the Greek word for \"thin.\" Leptin seems to play a role in the regulation of fat accumulation. In humans, increasing body fat appears to correlate with increased leptin levels.\n\n【3】Leukotriene:      Leukotrienes are inflammatory molecules. There are two families of leukotrienes. One in particular, called the cysteinyl-leukotriene, is important in asthma and allergy. Cysteinyl-leukotrienes are released in increased number during asthma exacerbations. Drugs, known as \"leukotriene modifiers,\" have been developed based on current knowledge of leukotrienes. The leukotriene modifiers include: (1) receptor antagonists or blockers, and (2) synthesis inhibitors. The first class blocks the effects of leukotrienes (blockers), while the second interferes with their formation (synthesis inhibitors).\n\n【4】Medicines in the first category are very safe and widely used in the maintenance treatment of allergic rhinitis and asthma.\n\n【5】the delivery of a precise and accurate dose of medicine to the lungs by inhalation. MDIs are reliable, portable, and very convenient. Many different types of respiratory medicines come in MDI form, including short-acting \"rescue\" bronchodilators, inhaled steroids, and antiinflammatory medicines, as well as inhaled anticholinergics. Medicines in MDI form are used in the treatment of asthma and COPD. The newer MDIs use a CFC-free propellant, usually HFA.\n\n【6】Methacholine challenge test: The methacholine challenge test is a type of bronchoprovocation test. It is a specialized PFT used in the evaluation of suspected asthma, when the diagnosis is otherwise uncertain.\n\n【7】Morbidity: A measure of illness in a given population. The yearly morbidity rate from a disease is defined as the proportion of people affected by that disease per year, per given unit of population.\n\n【8】Mortality: A measure of illness; the rate of death from a disease in a given community or population at a precise point in time. The yearly mortality rate from a disease is defined as the ratio of deaths due to that disease, to the total number of persons in that community or population.\n\n【9】Mucus: Mucus is a mixture composed of water, salt, and proteins produced by specialized cells in the nose  , sinuses, and lung passages.

Identification of an individual's asthma triggers and avoidance of exposure to the triggers are other ways to prevent an asthma exacerbation.\n\n【1】Prevention of the development asthma in a given individual is the subject of tremendous research. Patients, pulmonary specialists, allergists, and immunologists are all very interested in understanding the root causes of asthma. Right now, there is no known way to completely prevent the development of asthma. Because asthma tends to run in families, physicians often make suggestions to try and modify the emergence of allergies and/or asthma in a child thought to be at increased risk for the development of the disease.\n\n【2】Based on epidemiological studies, physicians may advise new parents with asthma to follow special guidelines in caring for their newborn. Many recommendations concern the baby's diet and environment.\n\n【3】For example, an exclusive diet of mother's milk for at least the first 6 months of life appears to delay, and possibly defer, the development of allergy and asthma.\n\n【4】Similarly, early introduction of solid food is frowned upon in an infant at increased risk for asthma. Certain highly allergenic foods should not be part of a toddler's diet. The foods responsible for most food allergy in children include cow's milk, eggs, nuts, and fish. More specifically, 90% of all allergic reactions to food are caused by eight foods: cow's milk, egg, peanut (which is a legume, not a true nut), tree nuts (such as walnuts, cashews, and hazelnuts), fish, shellfish, soy, and wheat.\n\n【5】In addition to dietary guidelines, physicians stress the", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "ερίειονοππος pue ‘səiνοοdT (ε1567", "bbox": [547.0, 64.0, 569.0, 284.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [546.0, 63.0, 568.0, 283.0], "position": 0}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "maintain normal lung function, and to prevent an exac-", "bbox": [70.0, 69.0, 425.0, 87.0]}, {"text": "erbation of asthma—what used to be called an asthma", "bbox": [69.0, 89.0, 428.0, 108.0]}, {"text": "\"attack\" (see Questions 12 and 14 for more on this sub-", "bbox": [69.0, 109.0, 425.0, 128.0]}, {"text": "ject).

(16)\n\n【17】Due to the hypodivergent growth, the incisors are com删除16:<u>¬ </u>pressed by the muscles of the lips and their hyper tonicity is going to provoke retroclination of the crowns of the incisors producing a deep bite. Of this functional influence and the consequential deviation of the dental eruptive pattern, the rest of the occlusal anomalies will develop, like retroclination, deep bite, mesialization of the buccal segments and overcrowding.\n\n【18】While the molars erupt, the anterior deep bite does not allow lateral movements of the mandible and the child becomes a vertical chewer. Aperture and closure move删除16:<u>¬ </u>ments that act like functional stimuli for the growth of the anterior maxillary alveolar apophysis are limited and inhibit mandible development. Anterior deep bites in the primary dentition are very frequent, but they are rarely treated. They can be associated with the presence of Class II malocclusions in development. The decisions of treat删除16:<u>¬ </u>ment are generally postponed until the mixed dentition.\n\n【19】The indications for such treatment in the primary denti删除16:<u>¬ </u>tion include: lower incisor impact on the palatal mucosa, excessive wear and headaches. (11,15,16)\n\n【20】Strong posterior mastication worsens the bite because it puts posterior teeth in infraclusion. Normally the inferior incisors present a marked retroclination due to blockage by the upper incisors and extrude until they touch the palatal mucosa. In occasions the overbite is so severe that the lower incisors are totally covered by the upper teeth.\n\n【21】This excessive overbite may produce trauma in the lower buccal mucosa and in the palatine mucosa of the upper maxilla. Deep bite is a typical clinical sign of Class II divi删除16:<u>¬ </u>sion 2 malocclusions. (11,15)\n\n【22】Acquired deep bite can be caused by the following factors:\n\n【23】1.\n\n【24】2.2.2.\n\n【25】The lateral posture of the tongue.\n\n【26】The premature loss of deciduous molars or permanent posterior molars.\n\n【27】3.  Wear of the occlusal surface or dental abrasion.\n\n【28】## Possible Treatment Options To Open Deep Bites\n\n【29】Deep bite can be localized in the dentoalveolar or skeletal zone, and treatment will always depend on the affected zone.\n\n【30】The correction of dentoalveolar deep bite can be obtained by intrusion of the anterior teeth, extrusion of posterior teeth, a combination of both, posterior teeth uprighting and increasing the inclination of the anterior teeth. (11.15.16)\n\n【31】Anterior teeth intrusion may be indicated in patients that show too much upper gum (gummy smile), or if they have too much dental mass in the four anterosuperior teeth, a great interlip gap or a steep mandibular plane.\n\n【32】Intrusive movements are very violent and may cause root resorption. But Gottlieb showed that using 15-20 g of force per incisor there is no measurable root shortening or visible apical resorption. (11.15)\n\n【33】Extrusion of the posterior teeth may be the treatment of choice in patients in which we want to increase inferior facial height, improve facial convexity or if we want to open the mandibular plane.

Adjuvant use of antihistamines (H1 and H2 antagonist), 86,87 inhaled β -adrenergic agents, 88 and IV corticosteroids89 has been successful in management of the patient with anaphylaxis and may be considered in cardiac arrest due to anaphylaxis (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【9】Extracorporeal Support of Circulation Cardiopulmonary bypass has been successful in isolated case reports of anaphylaxis followed by cardiac arres删除6:<u>t.</u>se of these advanced techniques may be considered in clinical situations where the required professional skills and equipment are immediately available (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【10】## Part 12.3: Cardiac Arrest Associated With Pregnancy\n\n【11】## Scope Of The Problem\n\n【12】The Confidential Enquiries into Maternal and Child Health (CEMACH) data set constitutes the largest population-based data set on this target populatio删除6:<u>n.</u>he overall maternal mortality rate was calculated at 13.95 deaths per 100 000 maternities.

The best hope of fetal survival is maternal survival. For the critically ill pregnant patient, rescuers must provide appropriate resuscitation based on consideration of the physiological changes caused by pregnancy.\n\n【13】## Key Interventions To Prevent Arrest\n\n【14】The following interventions are the standard of care for treating the critically ill pregnant patient (Class I, LOE C):  • Place the patient in the full left-lateral position to relieve possible compression of the inferior vena cava. Uterine obstruction of venous return can produce hypotension and may precipitate arrest in the critically ill patient. 95 , 96 • Give 100% oxygen.\n\n【15】• Establish intravenous (IV) access above the diaphragm.\n\n【16】• Assess for hypotension; maternal hypotension that warrants therapy has been defined as a systolic blood pressure < 100 mm Hg or < 80% of baselin删除6:<u>e.</u>aternal hypotension can result in reduced placental perfusio删除6:<u>n.</u>n the patient who is not in arrest, both crystalloid and colloid solutions have been shown to increase preload. 103 • Consider reversible causes of critical illness and treat conditions that may contribute to clinical deterioration as early as possible.\n\n【17】## Resuscitation Of The Pregnant Patient In Cardiac Arrest 删除5:<u>(Figure 1)</u>\n\n【18】There are no randomized controlled trials evaluating the effect of specialized obstetric resuscitation versus standard care in pregnant patients in cardiac arrest. There are reports in the literature of patients not in arrest that describe the science behind important physiological changes that occur in pregnancy that may influence treatment recommendations and guidelines for resuscitation from cardiac arrest in pregnancy.\n\n【19】## Bls Modifications\n\n【20】Patient Positioning Patient position has emerged as an important strategy to improve the quality of

Supplementary oxygen administration may be beneficial as part of first aid for divers with a decompression injury (Class IIb, LOE C 22 ).\n\n【1】## Medical Emergencies\n\n【2】## Breathing Difficulties\n\n【3】The incidence of acute asthma is increasing, especially in urban population删除6:<u>s.</u>any victims with asthma take a prescribed bronchodilator medication and can self-administer i删除6:<u>t.</u>irst aid providers are not expected to make a diagnosis of asthma, but they may assist the victim in using the victim's prescribed bronchodilator medication (Class IIa, LOE B) under the following conditions:  • The victim states that he or she is having an asthma attack or symptoms associated with a previously diagnosed breathing disorder, and the victim has the prescribed medications or inhaler in his or her possession.\n\n【4】• The victim identifies the medication and is unable to administer it without assistanc删除2:<u> 24</u>\n\n【5】First aid providers should become familiar with inhalers so that they can assist a victim with an acute asthma attack in using the inhaler.\n\n【6】## Anaphylaxis\n\n【7】Allergies are relatively common, but only a small proportion of people with allergies develop anaphylactic reactions. An anaphylactic reaction is a progressive series of signs and symptoms characterized by swelling, breathing difficulty, an itching rash, and eventually shock, which, if left untreated, may lead to death. Some of these signs and symptoms can also be present in other conditions, and first aid rescuers should not be expected to make a diagnosis of anaphylaxi删除6:<u>s.</u>lder patients who suffer from anaphylactic reactions know their signs and symptoms and many carry a lifesaving epinephrine auto-injector.

First aid providers should also know how to administer the auto-injector if the victim is unable to do so, provided that the medication has been prescribed by a physician and state law permits it (Class IIb, LOE B).\n\n【8】In retrospective studies 35 -37 18% to 35% of patients having signs of anaphylaxis required a second dose of epinephrine if symptoms persisted or progressed after the first dose. Because of the difficulty in making a diagnosis of anaphylaxis 27 – 30 , 38 , 39 and the potential harm from epinephrine if the diagnosis is incorrect, 40– 43 first aid providers are advised to seek medical assistance if symptoms persist, rather than routinely administering a second dose of epinephrine. In unusual circumstances, when advanced medical assistance is not available, a second dose of epinephrine may be given if symptoms of anaphylaxis persist (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【9】## Seizures\n\n【10】The general principles of first aid management of seizures are to\n\n【11】• Ensure an open airway.  . Prevent injury.\n\n【12】Do not restrain the victim during a seizure. Do not try to open the victim's mouth or try to place any object between the victim's teeth or in the mouth. Restraining the victim may cause musculoskeletal or soft-tissue injury. Placing an object in the victim's mouth may cause dental damage or aspiration (Class IIa, LOE C). It is not unusual for the victim to be unresponsive or confused for a short time after a seizure.\n\n【13】## Chest Discomfort\n\n【14】Because it is very difficult, even for the healthcare professional, to differentiate chest discomfort of cardiac origin from other chest discomfort, the first aid provider should assume that chest discomfort is cardiac until proven otherwise.\n\n【15】Cardiac chest discomfort is often described as \"crushing\" or \"pressing\" and is often accompanied by shortness of breath or perspiration. But cardiac chest discomfort may not have these classical characteristics, especially in women. Call EMS immediately for anyone with chest discomfort. Do not delay and do not try to transport the patient to a healthcare facility yourself.\n\n【16】While waiting for EMS to arrive, the first aid provider may encourage the victim to chew 1 adult (not enteric coated) or 2 low-dose \"baby\" aspirin if the patient has no allergy to aspirin or other contraindication to aspirin, such as evidence of a stroke or recent bleeding (Class IIa, LOE A删除2:<u> 44–46</u>\n\n【17】## Injury Emergencies\n\n【18】## Bleeding\n\n【19】Control of bleeding is a basic skill of first aid and one of the few actions with which a first aid provider can critically influence outcome.\n\n【20】## Direct Pressure\n\n【21】Bleeding is best controlled by applying pressure until bleeding stops 47 – 53 or EMS rescuers arrive (Class I, LOE A). The amount of pressure applied and the time the pressure is held are the most important factors affecting successful control of bleeding. The pressure must be firm, and it must be maintained for a long time. Methods of applying pressure include  • Manual pressure on gauze or other cloth placed over the bleeding source. If bleeding continues, do not remove the gauze; add more gauze on top and apply more pressure.\n\n【22】• If it is not possible to provide continuous manual pressure, wrap an elastic bandage firmly over gauze to hold it in place with pressure. 54 – 57", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "(Class IIb, LOE C).

Generally, the presence of a deep spee curve is derived from the extrusion of the anterior sector; this happens when the inferior incisors, during their eruptive phase, do not find their antagonist and erupt until they contact the palatine mucosa; for this reason, the anterosuperior sector elongates inducing a deep bite.\n\n【27】With the development of alloys, super elastic arches ap删除16:<u>¬ </u>peared in the form of a reverse curve or anti Spee curves (NiTi or TMA), round and rectangular (each one with advantages and disadvantages). In the sagittal sense, the reverse curve arches have three clearly defined zones:\n\n【28】1.\n\n【29】2.\n\n【30】3.\n\n【31】The anterior zone, that acts upon the incisor group.\n\n【32】The middle sector, upon the premolars.\n\n【33】The posterior sector, on the molars.\n\n【34】These super elastic arches generate various effects at the same time:\n\n【35】1.\n\n【36】2.\n\n【37】3.\n\n【38】Inclination (proclination) and intrusion of the ante删除16:<u>¬ </u>rior sector.\n\n【39】Extrusion of the lateral sectors.\n\n【40】Distal inclination of the molars. (6.14)\n\n【41】In order to correct a deep bite with anti Spee arches, Dr J.

Measurement of peak flow is an assessment of lung function, more precisely, of airflow through larger airways (discussed in Question 28).

Locals also covet the animal's medicinal properties. The besttasting, according to most, is the East Pacific green turtle ( Chelonia mydas ).\n\n【1】But the green, one of five marine turtles in Pacifi c Mexico, is theoretically off limits. Killing them has been strictly prohibited by the U.S. Endangered Species Act since 1978 and by Mexican law since 1990.\n\n【2】Not relying solely on the law, every year scientists, volunteers and even army units camp out along green turtle nesting beaches in southern Mexico to block poachers and predators from snatching the eggs needed to produce new generations of the animals. Even so, the number of mature females returning to the green's primary nesting beach has plummeted from 1,280 in 1990 to 145 in 2000. Why are the turtles missing?\n\n【3】Researchers have known for decades that people in fishing communities occasionally eat the green turtle, but new research has only now revealed that this tradition is colluding with egg poaching to bring about the animal's devastating decline. Scientists at the Autonomous University of Baja California estimate that poachers kill as many as 30,000 green turtles every year in Baja. The study indicates that most of the demand for the turtles comes from the government sector—politicians, teachers and the military—those with cash to pay for the delicacy and positions of power to escape legal repercussions.\n\n【4】For some experts, the recent findings call into question the decades-old assumption that protection of turtle eggs and hatchlings is the best way to assure the animals' survival. Clearly, they say, the adults need better defending as well.\n\n【5】Biologist Wallace J. Nichols, director of Wildcoast, a California-based conservation group, knows of poachers who have caught dozens of turtles and have been let go with a warning and confiscated catch. The last time a poacher went to jail was two years ago for only 12 days.\n\n【6】SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN\n\n【7】## 82", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "PUERTO SAN CARLOS, MEXICO –", "bbox": [45.0, 86.0, 253.0, 101.0]}, {"text": "Here along the Pacific coast of Mexico's", "bbox": [45.0, 103.0, 256.0, 117.0]}, {"text": "Baja California peninsula, a celebra-", "bbox": [45.0, 119.0, 255.0, 133.0]}, {"text": "tion—Easter, a birthday, the arrival of", "bbox": [44.0, 135.0, 256.0, 149.0]}, {"text": "important guests—calls for a meal of", "bbox": [45.0, 151.0, 256.0, 165.0]}, {"text": "caguama , or turtle.

Most importantly the presence of an advance directive, a living will, or a durable power of attorney for health care is closely associated with ensuring that personal preferences match the actual care received, as documented in a survey of surrogates for patients of at least 60 years of age who died between 2000 and 2006 and required surrogate decision making at some point in their car删除6:<u>e.</u> Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAR) order is given by a licensed physician or alternative authority as per local regulation, and it must be signed and dated to be vali删除6:<u>d.</u>n many settings, \"Allow Natural Death\" (AND) is becoming a preferred term to replace DNAR, to emphasize that the order is to allow natural consequences of a disease or injury, and to emphasize ongoing end-of-life car删除6:<u>e.</u>he DNAR order should explicitly describe the resuscitation interventions to be performed in the event of a life-threatening emergency. In most cases, a DNAR order is preceded by a documented discussion with the patient, family, or surrogate decision maker addressing the patient's wishes about resuscitation interventions. In addition, some jurisdictions may require confirmation by a witness or a second treating physician.\n\n【2】Surrogate Decision Makers In the event of incapacity, an adult may require a surrogate decision maker to make medical decisions. In the event that the individual has a durable power of attorney for health care, the person appointed by that document is authorized to make medical decisions within the scope of authority granted by the document. If the individual has a court-appointed guardian with authority to make healthcare decisions, the guardian becomes the authorized surrogate.\n\n【3】If there is no court-appointed or other authority, a close relative or friend can become a surrogate decision maker. Most jurisdictions have laws that designate the legally authorized surrogate decision maker for an incompetent patient who has not identified a decision maker through a durable power of attorney for health care. Surrogate decision makers should base their decisions on the individual's previously expressed preferences, if known; otherwise, surrogates should make decisions based on their understanding of what constitutes the best interests of the individual.\n\n【4】Pediatric Decision Making As a general rule, minors are considered incompetent to provide legally binding consent about their health care. Parents or guardians are generally empowered to make healthcare decisions on their behalf, and in most situations, parents are given wide latitude in terms of the decisions they make on behalf of their children. Parental authority is not absolute, however, and when a parent or guardian's decision appears to place the child at significant risk of serious harm as compared to other options, medical providers may seek to involve state agencies (eg, child protective services or a court determination) to allow treatment of the child over parental objection删除6:<u>s.</u> child should be involved in decision making at a level appropriate for the child's maturity. Children should be asked to consent to healthcare decisions when able within the legal definition of a consenting adult based on local policy and legislation. Children < 14 years of age (in Canada) and < 18 years of age (in the US) rarely possess the legal authority to consent to their health care except under specific legally defined situations (emancipated minors, mature minors, and for specific health conditions such as sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy-related care). In situations where an older child will not consent, the dissent should be carefully considered by the treating provider.\n\n【5】## Principle Of Futility\n\n【6】Patients or families may ask for care that is highly unlikely to improve health outcomes. Healthcare providers, however, are not obliged to provide such care when there is scientific and social consensus that the treatment is ineffective. If the purpose of a medical treatment cannot be achieved, the treatment can be considered futile.\n\n【7】An objective criterion for medical futility was defined in 1990 for interventions and drug therapy as imparting a < 1% chance of surviva删除6:<u>l.</u>lthough this criterion may be controversial, it remains a basis for current futility research. An obvious example of an inappropriate or futile intervention is providing CPR for a patient who has suffered irreversible death. Without objective signs of irreversible death (eg, decapitation, rigor mortis, or decomposition) and in the absence of known advance directives declining resuscitative attempts, full resuscitation should be offered.\n\n【8】Conditions such as irreversible brain damage or brain death cannot be reliably assessed or predicted at the time of cardiac arrest. Withholding resuscitation and the discontinuation of life-sustaining treatment during or after resuscitation are ethically equivalent. In situations where the prognosis is uncertain, a trial of treatment may be initiated while further information is gathered to help determine the likelihood of survival, the patient's preferences, and the expected clinical course (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【9】## Witholding And Withdrawing Cpr (Termination Of Resuscitative Efforts) Related To Out-Of Hospital Cardiac Arrest (Ohca) Criteria For Not Starting Cpr In All Ohca\n\n【10】Basic life support (BLS) training urges all potential rescuers to immediately begin CPR without seeking consent, because any delay in care dramatically decreases the chances of survival.\n\n【11】While the general rule is to provide emergency treatment to a victim of cardiac arrest, there are a few exceptions where withholding CPR might be appropriate, as follows:\n\n【12】• Situations where attempts to perform CPR would place the rescuer at risk of serious injury or mortal peril  • Obvious clinical signs of irreversible death (eg, rigor mortis, dependent lividity, decapitation, transection, or decomposition) • A valid, signed, and dated advance directive indicating that resuscitation is not desired, or a valid, signed, and dated DNAR order", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "living will affects the care received, and a durable power of", "bbox": [60.0, 85.0, 376.0, 99.0]}, {"text": "attorney accounts for unforeseen circumstances.

The name usually includes letters abbreviating the company's name (MSD for Merck, or GSK for Glaxo Smith Kline, for example), followed by a number.\n\n【1】After approval by the FDA, the ready-for-market medication is given both a generic and a trade name. Each generic and trade name must be unique and distinctive enough to avoid confusion with other products. In the U.S., the United States Adopted Names (USAN) Council assigns a drug its generic name. For example, the generic name for a widely prescribed, short-acting β 2 agent, inhaled, quick-relief medicine is albuterol sulfate.\n\n【2】A medicine's generic name is also its \"official name.\" The drug's manufacturer then selects the medicine's trade (or brand) name. The FDA must approve the trade name selected by the manufacturer.

HEPA filters are used in industrial settings, as well as in hospitals. In hospitals, HEPA filters are incorporated in the ventilation and exhaust systems of operating suites and \"isolation\" rooms, for example.\n\n【1】HEPA filters are occasionally recommended in the home in the setting of allergy. Some vacuum cleaners incorporate HEPA filtration, and roomsize fans are available that filter the room's air through the HEPA device.\n\n【2】Hormone: A chemical substance produced in the body by specialized endocrine glands. Once synthesized, hormones circulate in the bloodstream and regulate different body functions. Insulin is a hormone, for example. It is produced in the pancreas gland, and enters the blood circulation where it exerts profound effects on glucose (sugar) and carbohydrate metabolism.\n\n【3】Hydrofluroalkanes: Hydrofluroalkanes, abbreviated HFA, are medically inert substances that are used as propellants in metered dose inhalers, and meet CFC-free criteria.\n\n【4】Immunoglobulin E: IgE is a type of immunoglobulin that rises and is produced in increased quantity in the setting of atopy, allergic asthma, and in the setting of a typical allergic reaction.\n\n【5】Immunoglobulin: A protein produced by the body's immune system as part of an immune response to an antigen. Antigens can be infectious agents such as viruses, bacteria and parasites, or other proteins. When immunoglobulins are synthesized in response to an infection, they play a defensive and protective role. Immunoglobulins are sometimes called \"gamma globulins,\" an older terminology. Immunoglobulins are of five classes: IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM.\n\n【6】Immunotherapy: The technical term for allergy shots, used in the treatment of specific allergies that do not respond satisfactorily to allergen avoidance or medical treatment such as antihistamines.\n\n【7】Incidence: In medicine, refers to the number of new cases of a disease at any point in time. To say, for example, that the incidence of peanut allergy increased in a certain community in the year 2004, as compared to the prior year, you would need to count the number of new cases of peanut allergy in the community that were diagnosed in 2003, and compare that statistic to the number of new cases found in 2004.\n\n【8】Influenza: Refers interchangeably to the influenza virus and to the infectious illness caused by that virus.\n\n【9】Influenza begins abruptly and is characterized by high fever, chills, aches, and exhaustion. The illness is preventable via vaccination.\n\n【10】Inspiration: The action of taking a breath of air into your lungs. The respiratory cycle has two parts: inspiration and expiration.\n\n【11】Inspiratory: Breathing in.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "health.

Distance is measured or scaled as expected.\n\n【2】= Hyperbolic, which is disk-shaped and allows the map focus to be changed so that the chosen center is in sharp focus and the edges distorted, much like moving a magnifying glass over a piece of paper.\n\n【3】删除0:<u>■</u> Spherical, which wraps a flattened brain image around a sphere.\n\n【4】mensional curved surface can be flattened while preserving the angular information, thereby yielding a so-called conformal map.\n\n【5】To flatten the cortex, Hurdal takes anatomical information from a high-resolution, 3-D MRI scan and feeds it into her program. Within a few minutes, several algorithms convert the surface of the brain into a network of thousands or even millions of cortical points (the number depends on the size of the area to be flattened), each connected to into single flat maps (shown here in Euclidean and hyperbolic views) to reveal details that are normally hidden in the brain's folds.\n\n【6】its nearest neighbors by lines. The result is a triangulated mesh.\n\n【7】The key to flattening this landscape of convoluted triangles lies in a Greek theorem called circle packing. It says that three circles can always be drawn around the corners of a triangle so that each circle just touches the other two. Any two of these circles also belong to a neighboring triangle. Hence thousands of triangles in a flat plane can perfect- ly pack that plane with thousands of circles.\n\n【8】Applying the theorem to the brain may sound easy enough, but there is one problem, Hurdal notes: the triangles that represent the surface of a brain are not lying flat, so the touching circles will stick out. To fix this, the program employs a contemporary version of circle packing. It extends the theorem to three dimensions, moving all the cortical points until they settle down with the circles into a well-packed plane. Because the resulting maps are not perfect conformal maps, Hurdal calls them quasi-conformal. She has already flat-mapped the cerebellum and various bits of the cortex. To match precise regions with brain activity, researchers can take images from subsequent scans, flatten them and overlay them on the initial MRI.\n\n【9】Surgeons may eventually rely on the maps in brain surgery, particularly in epilepsy operations in which cutting out chunks of the cortex is necessary to help stop seizures.\n\n【10】Werner K. Doyle, a neurosurgeon who performs more than 200 such operations every year at New York University–Mount Sinai Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, says, \"Which parts are removed is often an educated guess.\" The most commonly used method to locate malfunctioning regions is electroencephalography (EEG). It requires placing several electrodes directly on the surface of the brain and waiting for a seizure. Unfortunately, EEG readings don't always mark the right spot, and so too much cortex or the wrong region is sometimes removed. Flat maps turn the 3-D brain into a 2-D image, which, Doyle says, \"will make it easier and safer for neurologists to navigate the mind.\" Ideally, no one will get lost, because directions aren't included.\n\n【11】Diane Martindale is a science writer based in New York City .\n\n【12】## The Peak Of Success\n\n【13】## The Big Bang Theory Clicks Together Better Than Ever   By George Musser\n\n【14】/ henever Scientific American runs an article on cosmology, we get letters complaining that cosmology isn't a science, just unconstrained speculation.

Whenever someone presses the KILL button on a cell, that cell shuts down, and its left and right neighbors become directly connected. The right neighbor recalculates its position and starts executing the deceased's program. Its tasks, in turn, are taken up by the next cell to the right, and so on, until a cell designated as a spare is pressed into service.\n\n【1】Writing programs for any parallel processor is tricky, but the MICTREE array requires an especially unconventional approach.\n\n【2】Instead of giving explicit instructions, the programmer must devise simple rules out of which the desired function will emerge. Being Swiss, Mange demonstrates by building a superreliable stopwatch.\n\n【3】Displaying minutes and seconds requires four cells in a row, one for each digit. The genome allows for two cell types: a counter from zero to nine and a counter from zero to five. An oscillator feeds one pulse per second into the rightmost cell. After 10 pulses, this cell cycles back to zero and sends a pulse to the cell on its left, and so on down the line. The watch takes up part of an array of 12 cells; when you kill one, the clock transplants itself one cell over and carries on. Obviously, though, there is a limit to its resilience: the whole thing will fail after, at most, eight kills.\n\n【4】The prototype MICTREE cells are hardwired, so their processing power cannot be tailored to a specific application. In a finished product, cells would instead be implemented on a fieldprogrammable gate array, a grid of electronic components that can be reconfigured on the fly [see \"Configurable Computing,\" by John Villasenor and William H. Mangione-Smith; S CIENTIFIC A MERICAN , June 1997]. Mange's team is now custom-designing a gate array, known as MUXTREE (multiplexer tree), that is optimized for artificial cells. In the biological metaphor, the components of this array are the \"molecules\" that constitute a cell. Each consists of a logic gate, a data bit and a string of configuration bits that determines the function of this gate.\n\n【5】Building a cell out of such molecules offers not only flexibility but also extra endurance. Each molecule contains two copies of the gate and three of the storage bit. If the two gates ever give different results, the molecule kills itself for the greater good of the cell. As a last gasp, the molecule sends its data bit (preserved by the triplicate storage) and configuration to its right neighbor, which does the same, and the process continues until the rightmost molecule transfers its data to a spare. This second level of fault tolerance prevents a single error from wiping out an entire cell.\n\n【6】A total of 2,000 molecules, divided into four 20-by-25 cells, make up the BioWall—the giant digital clock that Mange’s team has just put on display. Each molecule is enclosed in a small box and includes a KILL button and an LED display. Some molecules are configured to perform computations; others serve as pixels in the clock display. Making liberal use of the KILL buttons, I did my utmost to crash the system, something I’m usually quite good at. But the plucky clock just wouldn't submit. The clock display did start to look funny—numerals bent over as their pixels shifted to the right—but at least it was still legible, unlike most faulty electronic signs.\n\n【7】That said, the system did suffer from display glitches, which Mange attributed mainly to timing problems. Although the processing power is decentralized, the cells still rely on a central oscillator to coordinate their communications; sometimes they fall out of sync. Another Embryonics team, led by Andy Tyrrell of the University of York in England, has been studying making the cells asynchronous, like their biological counterparts. Cells would generate handshaking signals to orchestrate data transfers. The present system is also unable to catch certain types of error, including damaged configuration strings. Tyrrell's team has proposed adding watchdog molecules—an immune system—that would monitor the configurations (and one another) for defects.\n\n【8】Although these systems demand an awful lot of overhead, so do other fault-tolerance technologies. \"While Embryonics appears to be heavy on redundancy, it actually is not that bad when compared to other systems,\" Tyrrell argues. Moreover, MUXTREE should be easier to scale down to the nano level; the \"molecules\" are simple enough to really be molecules. Says Mange, “We are preparing for the situation where electronics will be at the same scale as biology.\" On a philosophical level, Embryonics comes very close to the dream of building a self-replicating machine. It may not be quite as dramatic as a robot that can go down to Radio Shack, pull parts off the racks, and take them home to resolder a connection or build a loving mate. But the effect is much the same. Letting machines determine their own destiny—whether reconfiguring themselves on a silicon chip or reprogramming themselves using a neural network or genetic algorithm—sounds scary, but perhaps we should be gratified that machines are becoming more like us: imperfect, fallible but stubbornly resourceful.\n\n【9】—George Musser, imperfect but resourceful staff editor and writer", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "ful though it may seem, this redundancy allows the array to ", "bbox": [63.0, 86.0, 351.0, 101.0]}, {"text": "withstand the loss of any cell.

Rescuers should avoid using the automatic mode of the oxygen-powered, flow-limited resuscitator during CPR because it may generate high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) that may impede venous return during chest compressions and compromise forward blood flow (Class III, LOE C 60 ).\n\n【2】## Devices To Support Circulation\n\n【3】Active Compression-Decompression CPR Active compression-decompression CPR (ACD-CPR) is performed with a device that includes a suction cup to actively lift the anterior chest during decompression. The application of external negative suction during the decompression phase of CPR creates negative intrathoracic pressure and thus potentially enhances venous return to the heart. When used, the device is positioned at midsternum on the chest.\n\n【4】Results from the use of ACD-CPR have been mixed. In several studies 61–66 ACD-CPR improved ROSC and shortterm survival compared with conventional CPR.  Of these studies, 3 showed improvement in neurologically intact surviva删除6:<u>l.</u>n contrast, 1 Cochrane meta-analysis of 10 studies involving both in-hospital arrest (826 patients) and out-of-hospital arrest (4162 patients) 67 and several other controlled trials 68–74 comparing ACD-CPR to conventional CPR showed no difference in ROSC or survival. The metaanalysis 67 did not find any increase in ACD-CPR–related complications.\n\n【5】There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the routine use of ACD-CPR. ACD-CPR may be considered for use when providers are adequately trained and monitored (Class IIb, LOE B).\n\n【6】## Phased Thoracic-Abdominal Compression- Decompression Cpr With A Handheld Device\n\n【7】Phased thoracic-abdominal compression-decompression CPR (PTACD-CPR) combines the concepts of IAC-CPR and ACD-CPR.  A handheld device alternates chest compression and abdominal decompression with chest decompression and abdominal compression. Evidence from 1 prospective randomized clinical study of adults in cardiac arrest 75 demonstrated no improvement in survival to hospital discharge with use of PTACD-CPR during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.\n\n【8】There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of PTACD-CPR for the treatment of cardiac arrest.\n\n【9】## Impedance Threshold Device\n\n【10】The impedance threshold device (ITD) is a pressure-sensitive valve that is attached to an endotracheal tube, supraglottic airway, or face mask. The ITD limits air entry into the lungs during the decompression phase of CPR, creating negative intrathoracic pressure and improving venous return to the heart and cardiac output during CPR. It does so without impeding positive pressure ventilation or passive exhalation.\n\n【11】Originally, the ITD was used with a cuffed endotracheal tube during bag-tube ventilation and ACD-CP删除6:<u>R.</u>he ITD and ACD-CPR devices are thought to act synergistically to enhance venous return. During ACD-CPR with or without the ITD, 1 randomized study 76 found no difference in survival, whereas another randomized study 79 found that the addition of an ITD improved short-term survival (24-hour survival and survival to ICU admission).\n\n【12】The ITD also has been used during conventional CPR with an endotracheal tube or with a face mask, if a tight seal is maintaine删除6:<u>d.</u>uring conventional CPR with and without the ITD, 1 randomized trial 80 reported no difference in overall survival; however, 1 prospective cohort study 82 reported improved survival to emergency department (ED) admission with the use of the ITD.  One meta-analysis of pooled data from both conventional CPR and ACD-CPR randomized trials83 demonstrated improved ROSC and short-term survival associated with the use of an ITD in the management of adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients but no significant improvement in either survival to hospital discharge or neurologically intact survival to discharge.\n\n【13】Three cohort studies with historic controls that implemented 2005 Guidelines plus ITD demonstrated improved survival to hospital discharge for out-of-hospital cardiac arres删除6:<u>t.</u>t was not possible to determine the relative contribution of the ITD to the improved outcome. The use of the ITD may be considered by trained personnel as a CPR adjunct in adult cardiac arrest (Class IIb, LOE B).\n\n【14】## Mechanical Piston Devices\n\n【15】A mechanical piston device consists of a compressed gasor electric-powered plunger mounted on a backboard; it is used to depress the sternum. Some incorporate a suction cup in the piston device while others do not. In 3 studies87–89 the use of a mechanical piston device for CPR improved end-tidal CO 2 and mean arterial pressure during adult cardiac arrest resuscitation. However, compared with manual CPR, no improvement in short- and long-term survival in adult patients was demonstrate删除6:<u>d.</u>nitiation and removal of the mechanical piston device were noted to increase interruptions in CP删除6:<u>R.</u>he Lund University Cardiac Arrest System (LUCAS) is a gas- (oxygen or air) or electric-powered piston device that produces a consistent chest compression rate and depth. It incorporates a suction cup attached to the sternum that returns the sternum to the starting position. There are no randomized control trials comparing the device with conventional CPR in human cardiac arrests.

It is reasonable for laypersons and healthcare providers to compress the adult chest at a rate of at least 100 compressions per minute (Class IIa, LOE B) with a compression depth of at least 2 inches/5 cm (Class IIa, LOE B). Rescuers should allow complete recoil of the chest after each compression, to allow the heart to fill completely before the next compression (Class IIa, LOE B).\n\n【1】Rescuers should attempt to minimize the frequency and duration of interruptions in compressions to maximize the number of compressions delivered per minute (Class IIa, LOE B). A compression-ventilation ratio of 30:2 is recommended (Class IIa, LOE B).\n\n【2】## Rescue Breaths\n\n【3】A change in the 2010 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC is to recommend the initiation of compressions before ventilations. While no published human or animal evidence demonstrates that starting CPR with 30 compressions rather than 2 ventilations leads to improved outcomes, it is clear that blood flow depends on chest compressions. Therefore, delays in, and interruptions of, chest compressions should be minimized throughout the entire resuscitation. Moreover, chest compressions can be started almost immediately, while positioning the head, achieving a seal for mouth-to-mouth rescue breathing, and getting a bag-mask apparatus for rescue breathing all take time. Beginning CPR with 30 compressions rather than 2 ventilations leads to a shorter delay to first compression (Class IIb, LOE C删除6:<u>).</u>nce chest compressions have been started, a trained rescuer should deliver rescue breaths by mouth-to-mouth or bag-mask to provide oxygenation and ventilation, as follows:  • Deliver each rescue breath over 1 second (Class IIa, LOE C).\n\n【4】• Give a sufficient tidal volume to produce visible chest rise (Class IIa, LOE C). 55 • Use a compression to ventilation ratio of 30 chest compressions to 2 ventilations.\n\n【5】## Early Defibrillation With An Aed\n\n【6】After activating the emergency response system the lone rescuer should next retrieve an AED (if nearby and easily accessible) and then return to the victim to attach and use the AED. The rescuer should then provide high-quality CPR.\n\n【7】When 2 or more rescuers are present, one rescuer should begin chest compressions while a second rescuer activates the emergency response system and gets the AED (or a manual defibrillator in most hospitals) (Class IIa, LOE C). The AED should be used as rapidly as possible and both rescuers should provide CPR with chest compressions and ventilations.\n\n【8】## Defibrillation Sequence\n\n【9】• Turn the AED on.  • Follow the AED prompts.\n\n【10】• Resume chest compressions immediately after the shock (minimize interruptions).\n\n【11】## Rescuer Specific Cpr Strategies: Putting It All Together\n\n【12】This section summarizes the sequence of CPR interventions that should be performed by 3 prototypical rescuers after they activate the emergency response system. The specific steps that rescuers should take (Hands-Only CPR, conventional CPR with rescue breathing, CPR and AED use) are determined by the rescuer's level of training.\n\n【13】## Untrained Lay Rescuer\n\n【14】If a bystander is not trained in CPR, then the bystander should provide Hands-Only (chest compression only) CPR, with an emphasis on \"push hard and fast,\" or follow the directions of the emergency medical dispatcher. The rescuer should continue Hands-Only CPR until an AED arrives and is ready for use or healthcare providers take over care of the victim (Class IIa, LOE B).\n\n【15】## Trained Lay Rescuer\n\n【16】All lay rescuers should, at a minimum, provide chest compressions for victims of cardiac arrest. In addition, if the trained lay rescuer is able to perform rescue breaths, he or she should add rescue breaths in a ratio of 30 compressions to 2 breaths. The rescuer should continue CPR until an AED arrives and is ready for use or EMS providers take over care of the victim (Class I, LOE B).\n\n【17】## Healthcare Provider\n\n【18】Optimally all healthcare providers should be trained in BLS.\n\n【19】In this trained population it is reasonable for both EMS and in-hospital professional rescuers to provide chest compressions and rescue breaths for cardiac arrest victims (Class IIa, LOE B). This should be performed in cycles of 30 compressions to 2 ventilations until an advanced airway is placed; then continuous chest compressions with ventilations at a rate of 1 breath every 6 to 8 seconds (8 to 10 ventilations per minute) should be performed. Care should be taken to minimize interruptions in chest compressions when placing, or ventilating with, an advanced airway. In addition, excessive ventilation should be avoided.\n\n【20】It is reasonable for healthcare providers to tailor the sequence of rescue actions to the most likely cause of arrest. For example, if a lone healthcare provider sees an adolescent suddenly collapse, the provider may assume that the victim has suffered a sudden cardiac arrest and call for help (phone 911 or the emergency response number), get an AED (if nearby), and return to the victim to attach and use the AED and then provide CPR. If a lone healthcare provider aids an adult drowning victim or a victim of foreign body airway obstruction who becomes unconscious, the healthcare provider may give about 5 cycles (approximately 2 minutes) of CPR before activating the emergency response system (Class IIa, LOE C).\n\n【21】## Adult Bls Skills\n\n【22】The sequence of BLS skills for the healthcare provider is depicted in the BLS Healthcare Provider Algorithm (see Figure 2).\n\n【23】## Recognition Of Arrest 删除5:<u>(Box 1)</u>\n\n【24】The necessary first step in the treatment of cardiac arrest is immediate recognition.

The definition states: \"Occupational asthma is a disease characterized by variable air flow limitation and/or airway hyperresponsiveness due to causes and conditions attributable to a particular occupational environment and not to stimuli encountered outside the workplace.\"\n\n【1】There are two general types of true occupational asthma (OA). Experts have classified the two types as \"asthma with latency\" and \"asthma without latency.\" The first type of OA is asthma that develops over time, caused by repeated inhalation of sensitizing work exposures to a specific substance, usually a large protein. Examples of sensitizing agents include formaldehyde, mineral dusts, animal proteins, flours, and grains. More that 250 different workplace substances have been reported to cause occupational asthma.\n\n【2】Many different manufacturing industries are involved, from baking, to veterinary work, to paint and circuit board production. Interestingly, not all workers in a certain industry and with clear-cut exposure actually go on to develop asthma. Studies suggest that atopy and cigarette smoking may predispose some persons to the development of occupational asthma. The second, more unusual type of OA involves the emergence of \"new\" asthma after a single, intense, and often dramatic exposure to potent respiratory irritants, such as bleach, chlorine gas, or strong acids, for example.\n\n【3】Chemical spills and workplace accidents are often implicated. The term \"RADS\" was coined by Dr. Stuart M. Brooks and his co-workers in 1985.

Yet we were also skeptical of studying self-esteem alone. The hypothesis of threatened egotism suggested that aggressive behavior would tend to occur among only a subset of people with high self-esteem. In the hope of identifying this subset, we tested for narcissism.\n\n【1】As defined by clinical psychologists, narcissism is a mental illness characterized by inflated or grandiose views of self, the quest for excessive admiration, an unreasonable or exaggerated sense of entitlement, a lack of empathy (that is, being unable to identify with the feelings of others), an exploitative attitude toward others, a proneness to envy or wish to be envied, frequent fantasies of greatness, and arrogance. The construct has been extended beyond the realm of mental illness by Robert Raskin of the Tulsa Institute of Behavioral Sciences in Oklahoma and several of his colleagues, who have constructed a scale for measuring narcissistic tendencies.\n\n【2】We included that measure alongside the self-esteem scales, because the two traits are not the same, although they are correlated. Individuals with high self-esteem need not be narcissistic. They can be good at things and recognize that fact without being conceited or regarding themselves as superior beings. The converse— high narcissism but low self-esteem—is quite rare, however.\n\n【3】The next problem was how to measure aggression in the laboratory. The procedure we favored involved having pairs of volunteers deliver blasts of loud noise to each other. The noise is unpleasant and people wish to avoid it, so it provides a good analogue to physical aggression. The famous social psychology experiments of the 1960s [see \"The Effects of Observing Violence,\" by Leonard Berkowitz; S cientific A merican , February 1964] used electric shock, but safety concerns have largely removed that as an option.\n\n【4】The noise was presented as part of a competition. Each par- other's work. Each participant then received his or her own essay back with the comments and ratings that the other person had (supposedly) given it.\n\n【5】In reality, the essays that people graded were fakes. We took the real essays aside and randomly marked them good or bad.\n\n【6】The good evaluation included very positive ratings on all counts and the handwritten comment, \"No suggestions, great essay!\" The bad evaluation contained low marks and the additional comment, \"This is one of the worst essays I have read!\" After handing back the essays and evaluations, we gave out instructions for the reaction-time test and the subjects began to compete. The measure of aggression was the level of noise with which they blasted each other.\n\n【7】The results supported the threatened-egotism theory rather than the low self-esteem theory. Aggression was highest among narcissists who had received the insulting criticism. Nonnarcissists (with either high or low self-esteem) were significantly less aggressive, as were narcissists who had been praised.\n\n【8】In a second study, we replicated these findings and added a new twist. Some participants were told that they would be playing the reaction-time game against a new person—someone different from the person who had praised or insulted them. We were curious about displaced aggression: Would people angered by their evaluation lash out at just anybody? As it happened, no. Narcissists blasted people who had insulted them but did not attack an innocent third party. This result agrees with a large body of evidence that violence against innocent bystanders is, despite conventional wisdom, quite rare.\n\n【9】A revealing incident illuminates the attitudes of the narcissists.\n\n【10】When a television news program did a feature on this experiment, we administered the test to several additional participants for the benefit of the cameras. One of them scored in the 98th percentile\n\n【11】## Narcissists Blasted People Who Had Insulted Them But Did Not\n\n【12】## Attack An Innocent Third Party.\n\n【13】ticipant vied with somebody else in a test of reaction time. Whoever responded more slowly received a blast of noise, with the volume and duration of the noise set by his or her opponent. This procedure differed from that of earlier studies, in which the subject played the role of a \"teacher\" who administered noise or shock to a \"learner\" whenever the learner made a mistake. Critics had suggested that such a method would yield ambiguous results, because a teacher might deliver strong shocks or loud noise out of a sincere belief that it was an effective way to teach.\n\n【14】## “One Of The Worst”\n\n【15】TO STUDY THE \"THREAT\" part of threatened egotism, we asked participants to write a brief essay expressing their opinion on abortion. We collected the essays and then (ostensibly) redistributed them, so the two contestants could evaluate each on narcissism and was quite aggressive during the study. Afterward he was shown the film and given the opportunity to refuse to let it be aired. He said to put it on—he thought he looked great.\n\n【16】Bushman then took him aside and explained that he might not want to be seen by a national audience as a highly aggressive narcissist. After all, the footage showed him using severe profanity when receiving his evaluation, then laughing while administering the highest permitted levels of aggression. The man shrugged this off with a smile and said he wanted to be on television. When Bushman proposed that the television station at least digitize his face to disguise his identity, the man responded with an incredulous no. In fact, he said, he wished the program could include his name and phone number.\n\n【17】Would our laboratory findings correspond to the outside world?

Conventional photolithography equipment projects ultraviolet light (usually at 248 or 193 nanometers) through a mask—a sheet of glass on which are traced a chip's circuit patterns. A series of lenses reduces the image to a quarter of its size. The image projected through the lenses is exposed in a chemical on the wafer. Another chemical treatment then etches away either the exposed or unexposed areas of the image, carving the circuit elements into the chip surface.\n\n【6】Things change at 13 nanometers, where extreme ultraviolet lithography earns its name. The mask and lenses, transparent at longer wavelengths, would absorb this radiation. So EUV uses mirrors for both the mask and the lenses. A laser trained on a jet of xenon gas creates a plasma that emits 13-nanometer radia- tion, which is focused onto a mask. The mask reflects the circuit pattern onto a series of curved mirrors that reduce the size of the image and focus it onto the wafer.\n\n【7】The 80 alternating layers of silicon and molybdenum that make up the mirrors and the mask have to be smoothed to single-atom tolerances. The entire circuitprinting process, moreover, has to be done in a vacuum because air itself absorbs radiation at this wavelength. And the mask will distort the image if it contains more than a handful of defects measuring even 50 nanometers, about 2,000 times narrower than the width of a human hair. The development team sometimes muses on ways to describe to the outside world the relative size of a 50- nanometer defect, comparing it to a search for a golf ball in a state the size of Maryland, a basketball in the state of Texas or a hair on a football field.\n\n【8】Physicists and engineers who designed and engineered nuclear weapons technology had to solve these challenges. Unlike AT&T, which conducted early development work on EUV at Bell Labs with about 30 employees, Intel has only five full-time employees at VNL's main facility at the Sandia laboratory in Livermore (although more than 10 others labor on developing proprietary mask designs and other EUV-related technology at several Intel facilities). \"They're using us as an advanced development and research lab,\" says Richard H. Stulen, the virtual laboratory's chief operating officer.\n\n【9】The company kept a close eye on how decisions were made at the labs. If alternative methods were proposed for making lenses, Intel would press the research team to pick one, instead of testing the merits of both. \"Nothing got spent that they didn't think would work,\" Freeman says. \"They didn't do it Bell Labs style.\" Intel also implemented the same detailed risk-management system that the compa- ny uses internally—essentially a rating system of things that could go wrong.\n\n【10】This flagged a list of about 200 problems, some of which the 150 national laboratories researchers who worked in the VNL might otherwise have downplayed.\n\n【11】At one meeting, the VNL staff mentioned that it would need to increase the power of the laser by a factor of 40, which raised a red flag for suppliers. \"The chip equipment manufacturers rated this at a much higher risk than we had,\" Stulen says.\n\n【12】VNL researchers identified what they called \"seven deadly showstoppers,\" but by late 1998, at another industry session, solutions to many of these problems— such as how to make supersmooth mirrors—had been found, propelling EUV into first place when it came time to vote.\n\n【13】\"The group went from having an attitude of 'Sure, sure, tell us you can do that' to placing us up front,\" Freeman says.\n\n【14】Intel has also brought a get-the-jobdone kind of urgency to laboratory employees unaccustomed to commercial deadlines.

The victim should be instructed to take a hot shower or immerse the affected part in hot water (temperature as hot as tolerated, or 45°C if there is the capability to regulate temperature), as soon as possible, for at least 20 minutes or for as long as pain persist删除6:<u>s.</u>f hot water is not available, dry hot packs or, as a second choice, dry cold packs may be helpful in decreasing pain but these are not as effective as hot water (Class IIb, LOE B 146 , 150 , 151 ). Topical application of aluminum sulfate or meat tenderizer, commercially available aerosol products, fresh water wash, and papain, an enzyme derived from papaya used as a local medicine, are even less effective in relieving pain (Class IIb, LOE B 147 . 152 ).\n\n【2】Pressure immobilization bandages are not recommended for the treatment of jellyfish stings because animal studies 153 . 154 show that pressure with an immobilization bandage causes further release of venom, even from already fired nematocysts (Class III, LOE C).\n\n【3】## Dental Injuries\n\n【4】Traumatic dental injuries are common. The first aid for an avulsed tooth is as follows:  • Clean bleeding wound(s) with saline solution or tap water.\n\n【5】• Stop bleeding by applying pressure with gauze or cotton.\n\n【6】• Handle the tooth by the crown, not the root (ie, do not handle the part that was beneath the gum).\n\n【7】• Place the tooth in milk, or clean water if milk is not available.  • Contact the patient's dentist or take the tooth and victim to an emergency care center as quickly as possible (Class IIa, LOE C删除2:<u> 155–158</u>\n\n【8】## Environmental Emergencies\n\n【9】## Cold Emergencies\n\n【10】## Hypothermia\n\n【11】Hypothermia is caused by exposure to cold. The urgency of treatment depends on the length of exposure and the victim's body temperature. Begin rewarming a victim of hypothermia immediately by moving the victim to a warm environment, removing wet clothing, and wrapping all exposed body surfaces with anything at hand, such as blankets, clothing, and newspapers. If the hypothermia victim is far from definitive health care, begin active rewarming (Class IIa, LOE B 159 . 160 ) although the effectiveness of active rewarming has not been evaluated. Active rewarming should not delay definitive care. Potential methods of active rewarming include placing the victim near a heat source and placing containers of warm, but not hot, water in contact with the skin.\n\n【12】## Frostbite\n\n【13】Frostbite usually affects an exposed part of the body such as the extremities and nose. In case of frostbite, remove wet clothing and dry and cover the victim to prevent hypothermia.\n\n【14】Transport the victim to an advanced medical facility as rapidly as possible. Do not try to rewarm the frostbite if there is any chance that it might refreeze161.162 or if you are close to a medical facility (Class III, LOE C).\n\n【15】Minor or superficial frostbite (frostnip) can be treated with simple, rapid rewarming using skin-to-skin contact such as a warm hand.\n\n【16】Severe or deep frostbite should be rewarmed within 24 hours of injury and this is best accomplished by immersing the frostbitten part in warm (37° to 40°C or approximately body temperature) water for 20 to 30 minutes (Class IIb, LOE C 161–170 ). Chemical warmers should not be placed directly on frostbitten tissue because they can reach temperatures that can cause burns (Class III, LOE C 171 ). Following rewarming, efforts should be made to protect frostbitten parts from refreezing and to quickly evacuate the patient for further care.\n\n【17】The effectiveness of ibuprofen or other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in frostbite has not been well established in human studies. 170 , 172 – 175\n\n【18】## Heat Emergencies\n\n【19】Heat-induced symptoms, often precipitated by vigorous exercise, may include heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke.\n\n【20】Heat cramps are painful involuntary muscle spasms that most often affect the calves, arms, abdominal muscles, and back. First aid includes rest, cooling off, and drinking an electrolyte-carbohydrate mixture, such as juice, milk, or a commercial electrolyte- carbohydrate drin删除6:<u>k.</u>tretching, icing, and massaging the painful muscles may be helpful.\n\n【21】Exercise should not be resumed until all symptoms have resolved.\n\n【22】Heat exhaustion is caused by a combination of exerciseinduced heat and fluid and electrolyte loss as sweat. Signs and symptoms may start suddenly and include: nausea, dizziness, muscle cramps, feeling faint, headache, fatigue, and heavy sweating. Heat exhaustion is a serious condition because it can rapidly advance to the next stage, heat stroke, which can be fatal. Heat exhaustion must be vigorously treated by having the victim lie down in a cool place, taking off as many clothes as possible, cooling the victim with a cool water spray, and encouraging the victim to drink cool fluids, preferably containing carbohydrates and electrolytes.\n\n【23】Heat stroke includes all the symptoms of heat exhaustion plus signs of central nervous system involvement, including dizziness, syncope, confusion, or seizures. The most important action by a first aid provider for a victim of heat stroke is to begin immediate cooling, preferably by immersing the victim up to the chin in cold wate删除6:<u>r.</u>t is also important to activate the EMS system.

Providers should rapidly identify patients with STEMI and quickly screen them for indications and contraindications to fibrinolytic therapy and PCI.  Patients who are ineligible for fibrinolytic therapy should be considered for transfer to a PCI facility regardless of delay.\n\n【5】Within a STEMI system of care, the first physician who encounters a patient with STEMI determines the need and strategy (fibrinolytic or PPCI) for reperfusion therapy (see Table 1). If the patient meets the criteria for fibrinolytic therapy, a door-to-needle time (initiation of fibrinolytic agent) < 30 minutes is recommended—the earlier the better (Class I, LOE A).

These patients usually have a partially or intermittently occluding thrombus. Both ACS syndromes may present with similar symptoms and ECG. Clinical features can correlate with the dynamic nature of clot formation and degradation (eg, waxing and waning clinical symptoms). The ECG will demonstrate a range of findings short of diagnostic ST-segment deviation; these ECG presentations include normal, minimal nonspecific ST-segment/T-wave changes, and significant ST-segment depression and T-wave inversions.\n\n【8】An elevated biomarker separates NSTEMI from UA and has incremental value in addition to the ECG.  Elevation of cardiac troponin indicates increased risk for major adverse cardiac events and benefit from an invasive strategy. Cardiac troponins indicate myocardial necrosis, although numerous conditions other than ACS may cause elevated biomarkers (eg, myocarditis, heart failure, and pulmonary embolism).\n\n【9】Management strategies for UA/NSTEMI include antiplatelet, antithrombin, and antianginal therapy and are based on risk stratification.

This nondiagnostic evaluation includes a normal or nondiagnostic 12-lead ECG and normal serum cardiac biomarker concentrations. The majority of these patients will not be experiencing an ACS, but many may have underlying CAD or other clinical features putting them at subsequent risk for major adverse cardiac events over the course of a few days to several months.\n\n【25】A major goal of the risk stratification process is to identify those patients who do not appear to have high-risk features on initial assessment but are found, through the course of the diagnostic process, to have ACS and clinically significant CAD. This strategy allows physicians to target patients who would benefit from guidelines-based ACS therapies while avoiding unnecessary procedural and pharmacological risks (eg, anticoagulation therapy and invasive cardiac catheterization) in patients with low risk for major adverse cardiac events.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "infarction can be made when clinical symptoms or new ECG", "bbox": [60.0, 84.0, 377.0, 99.0]}, {"text": "abnormalities are consistent with ischemia and one biomarker", "bbox": [60.0, 100.0, 376.0, 113.0]}, {"text": "is elevated above the 99 th percentile of the upper reference", "bbox": [60.0, 115.0, 375.0, 130.0]}, {"text": "limit (URL) using a test with optimal precision defined as a", "bbox": [60.0, 132.0, 377.0, 147.0]}, {"text": "CV ≤ 10%.", "bbox": [60.0, 148.0, 121.0, 162.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [59.0, 83.0, 376.0, 161.0], "position": 3}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "There is insufficient evidence to support the use of tropo-", "bbox": [73.0, 164.0, 375.0, 179.0]}, {"text": "nin point-of-care testing (POCT) either in or out of hospital.", "bbox": [60.0, 180.0, 375.0, 194.0]}, {"text": "There is also insufficient evidence to support the use of", "bbox": [60.0, 196.0, 376.0, 210.0]}, {"text": "myoglobin, β -natriuretic peptide (BNP), NT-proBNP,", "bbox": [60.0, 213.0, 375.0, 227.0]}, {"text": "D-dimer, C-reactive protein, ischemia-modified albumin", "bbox": [60.0, 229.0, 376.0, 242.0]}, {"text": "pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) or", "bbox": [60.0, 244.0, 375.0, 259.0]}, {"text": "interleukin-6 in isolation.", "bbox": [60.0, 261.0, 193.0, 274.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [59.0, 163.0, 375.0, 273.0], "position": 4}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "STEMI (Figure 1, Boxes 5 Through 8)", "bbox": [60.0, 290.0, 299.0, 305.0]}, {"text": "Patients with STEMI usually have complete occlusion of an", "bbox": [60.0, 307.0, 376.0, 321.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [59.0, 289.0, 375.0, 320.0], "position": 5}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "epicardial coronary artery.

Drowsiness Or Tiredness\n\n【1】This is a typical reaction after acupuncture and should not be a matter of great concern. Your body needs rest in order to boost its natural healing mechanism, so make sure you're getting enough sleep.\n\n【2】2. Feeling soreness and pain where needles are inserted in the skin\n\n【3】You may feel sore at specific points where the needles are inserted, but this pain normally dispels in less than 24 hours.\n\n【4】3. Bleeding or bruising\n\n【5】The majority of patients don't experience these symptoms. In some cases, bruising or bleeding might occur on the area being treated.\n\n【6】## 4. Fainting\n\n【7】For anxious patients or those afraid of needles, certain side effects such as fainting and vomiting can become a concern. It can be a physically intense process for faint-hearted patients, so make sure you consult your therapist for further advice.\n\n【8】## 5. Other Risks\n\n【9】Serious risks such as infections and tissue damage are particularly uncommon.

Like a connect-the-dots flip book, the story emerges from the links, which shift over time. If that is so, modelers could face a big problem: for most biochemical systems, scientists don't know what reacts with what, and when.\n\n【8】John R. Koza, a computer scientist at Stanford University, recently conducted an experiment that may help biologists connect their genetic dots. Koza is a pioneer in genetic programming, a technique for evolving software by instructing the computer to generate random programs, mutate them repeatedly and then screen them to identify the ones that perform the desired task best. Nicely closing a circle of metaphor, Koza used genetic programming to re-create a small but complicated part of the E-Cell model, itself built from software to mimic genes.\n\n【9】Koza rigged his system to evolve programs that piece together known enzymes into chemical machinery that can convert fatty acid and glycerol to diacylglycerol.\n\n【10】Each variant program was converted, for the sake of convenience, to an equivalent electrical circuit, whose behavior was cal- can handle larger problems, perhaps one day even deducing the convoluted paths by which cells turn food into energy, growth and waste—but only in cases where biochemists have measured how cells process chemicals over time. Such data are still scarce.\n\n【11】The observation that many biochemical problems most likely have an optimal answer is exploited by Palsson and his colleagues in the models they have built of E. coli , Hemophilus influenzae and Helicobacter pylori , the germ found in stomach ulcers. They comb the literature to reconstruct as much of the biochemical networks as they can. \"Then we subject them to constraints that they must abide,\" Palsson explains. Mass must be conserved, for example. Electrical charges must balance. Thermodynamics makes many reactions irreversible. \"We try to home in on the range of solutions that are physically possible.\" Markus W. Covert, a graduate student mune system. He figures the effort will take a decade to complete, at $10 million a year. \"But when we have these sorts of models,\" Gilman predicts, \"it will be the most incredible drug discovery engine there ever was. You could model disease in that cell and then see what drug manipulation could do. Ultimately—though maybe not in 10 years—I have no doubt that there will be quantitative models of cell function, organ function and eventually whole-animal function.\" \"I would approach such a goal with a fair amount of humility,\" Bailey cautions.\n\n【12】\"History teaches us that simulations can help explore particular questions, but there won't be any master model that answers all questions. Eventually the models will become as complicated as the cell itself and as difficult to understand.\" Unless, perhaps, the next Kepler happens to be a computer wizard.\n\n【13】M\n\n【14】W.

The adult sternum should be depressed at least 2 inches (5 cm) (Class IIa, LOE B 70 – 73 ), with chest compression and chest recoil/relaxation times approximately equal (Class IIb, LOE C 74 . 75 ). Allow the chest to completely recoil after each compression (Class IIa, LOE B 76 -80 ). In human studies of CPR in out-of-hospital 81 and in-hospital settings, 78–80 incomplete chest wall recoil was common, particularly when rescuers were fatigue删除6:<u>d.</u>ncomplete recoil during BLS CPR is associated with higher intrathoracic pressures and significantly decreased hemodynamics, including decreased coronary perfusion, cardiac index, myocardial blood flow, and cerebral perfusio删除6:<u>n.</u>mportantly, the incidence of incomplete chest wall recoil can be reduced during CPR by using electronic recording devices that provide real-time feedbac删除6:<u>k.</u>anikin studies suggest that lifting the heel of the hand slightly, but completely, off the chest can improve chest recoi删除6:<u>l.</u>he total number of chest compressions delivered to the victim is a function of the chest compression rate and the proportion of time that chest compressions are delivered without interruption. The compression rate refers to the speed of compressions, not the actual number of compressions delivered per minute. The actual number of chest compressions delivered per minute is determined by the rate of chest compressions and the number and duration of interruptions to open the airway, deliver rescue breaths, and allow AED analysi删除6:<u>s.</u>he number of chest compressions delivered per minute is an important determinant of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and neurologically intact surviva删除6:<u>l.</u>ne study of in-hospital cardiac arrest patients 85 showed that delivery of > 80 compressions/min was associated with ROSC. Extrapolation of data from an out-of-hospital observational study 6 showed improved survival to hospital discharge when at least 68 to 89 chest compressions per minute were delivered; the study also demonstrated that improved survival occurred with chest compression rates as high as 120/min. It is therefore reasonable for lay rescuers and healthcare providers to perform chest compressions for adults at a rate of at least 100 compressions per minute (Class IIa, LOE B).\n\n【2】The term \"duty cycle\" refers to the time spent compressing blood flow is determined partly by the duty cycle (reduced coronary perfusion is associated with a duty cycle of > 50%) and partly by how fully the chest is relaxed at the end of each compressio删除6:<u>n.</u>lthough duty cycles ranging between 20% and 50% can result in adequate coronary and cerebral perfusion,87–90 a duty cycle of 50% is recommended because it is easy to achieve with practice (Class IIb, LOE C 75 ).\n\n【3】In 2005 3 human observational studies 91 - 93 showed that interruptions of chest compressions were common, averaging 24% to 57% 85.91–93 of the total arrest time.\n\n【4】The preponderance of efficacy data 94 . 95 suggests that limiting the frequency and duration of interruptions in chest compressions may improve clinically meaningful outcomes in cardiac arrest patients. Data are now accumulating regarding the effectiveness of these interventions in \"the real world.\" 2.96 –102 Therefore, despite some data to the contrary, 103 it is reasonable for rescuers to minimize interruption of chest compressions for checking the pulse, analyzing rhythm, or performing other activities throughout the entire resuscitation, particularly in the period immediately before and after a shock is delivered (Class IIa, LOE B 94 -98 ).\n\n【5】Additional evidence of the importance of minimizing interruptions in chest compressions comes from nonrandomized studies suggesting that survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest may be improved by the initial EMS provider delivery of continuous chest compressions without initial assisted ventilations, 97.98 or by EMS providers using a higher compression-to-ventilation ratio (50:2删除6:<u>).</u>otably, in each of these studies, the airway was opened, oxygen insufflations were provided, and assisted ventilation was recommended at some point during the EMS resuscitation. Other EMS systems have noted significant improvement in survival from out-ofhospital arrest with use of compressions-plus-ventilations with emphases on improved quality of compressions and minimization of hands-off tim删除6:<u>e.</u>t this time there is insufficient evidence to support the removal of ventilations from CPR provided by EMS professionals.\n\n【6】Rescuer fatigue may lead to inadequate compression rates or dept删除6:<u>h.</u>ignificant fatigue and shallow compressions are common after 1 minute of CPR, although rescuers may not recognize that fatigue is present for ≥ 5 minute删除6:<u>s.</u>hen 2 or more rescuers are available it is reasonable to switch chest compressors approximately every 2 minutes (or after about 5 cycles of compressions and ventilations at a ratio of 30:2) to prevent decreases in the quality of compressions (Class IIa, LOE B). Consider switching compressors during any intervention associated with appropriate interruptions in chest compressions (eg, when an AED is delivering a shock).\n\n【7】Every effort should be made to accomplish this switch in < 5 seconds. If the 2 rescuers are positioned on either side of the patient, 1 rescuer will be ready and waiting to relieve the \"working compressor\" every 2 minutes.\n\n【8】Interruptions of chest compressions to palpate for a spontaneous pulse or to otherwise check for return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) can compromise vital organ perfusio删除6:<u>n.</u>ccordingly lay rescuers should not interrupt chest compressions to palpate pulses or check for ROSC (Class IIa, LOE C). In addition lay rescuers should continue the chest as a proportion of the time between the start of 1 cycle of compression and the start of the next.

Some merged into the supermassive hole at the center of our galaxy, and the rest may still be careening invisibly through interstellar space.\n\n【2】Once every 10 million years or so, one of these black holes enjoys a tasty platter of braised star. The plummeting morsels heat up and glow brightly, causing a spectacle that may be what x-ray satellites, such as the Chandra X-ray Observatory, have been seeing.\n\n【3】This scenario, recently outlined by Piero Madau of the University of California at Santa Cruz and Martin J.\n\n【4】Rees of the University of Cambridge, could be the key to understanding how galaxies took shape.  POSSIBLE MIDSIZE BLACK HOLE, 600 light-years from galaxy M82's center ( green cross ), got brighter over a three-month period. To its left are three splotches that got dimmer; they are thought to be smallish holes.\n\n【5】the supermassive black holes,\" says Martin J.\n\n【6】Ward of the University of Leicester in England.\n\n【7】In the mid-1980s orbiting observatories began noticing mysterious dots gleaming in x-rays. These dots were brighter than known stellar-mass holes and dimmer than active supermassive holes. Taken at face value, their luminosity implied a mass of 100 or so suns.\n\n【8】Any less and gravity would be unable to hold back the outward pressure of light; the objects, whatever they were, would blow themselves apart. Today astronomers know of more than 200 of these intermediate-luminosity x-ray objects (IXOs), according to Edward J. M.\n\n【9】Colbert of Johns Hopkins University. Half the spiral galaxies examined have at least one.\n\n【10】Last fall three groups—led by Richard E.\n\n【11】Griffiths of Carnegie Mellon University, by Philip Kaaret of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics and by Hironori Matsumoto of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology—announced Chandra observations of the brightest IXO, located in the galaxy M82. If anyone thought that higher resolution would make the problem go away, that the IXO would prove to be a tight clump of ordinary bodies, they were wrong. Although Chandra did make out a clump, at least one member of the clump still qualifies as an IXO. It is clearly offset from the center of the galaxy—ruling out a dormant supermassive hole (which would quickly sink to the middle)—and from radio and infrared sources, arguing against supernova debris (which would glow at multiple wavelengths).\n\n【12】Kaaret's team also thought it had found 10-minute flickering, which, by implying a size of less than 10 light-minutes, would have been proof of a mesohole. NASA called a triumphal press conference. Two weeks later the flickering proved to be an instrumental artifact.\n\n【13】NASA did not call a second press conference.\n\n【14】Other groups have taken x-ray spectra of various IXOs and caught them flip-flopping between two modes: bright and cool, dim and hot. Known holes do just that. Until recently, however, there was a problem with the hole hypothesis. A bigger hole has a wider maw, so the disk of material around it should stay farther away and hence be cooler. Yet IXOs are actually hotter than stellar-mass holes.\n\n【15】Ken-ya Watarai of the University of Kyoto in Japan and his colleagues have proposed a solution: material falls into the hole at such a high rate that the disk, in effect, pushes inward. A fluctuating rate neatly explains changes in the luminosity and temperature of three IXOs.\n\n【16】For theorists, intermediate masses are a nohole's-land. Dying stars might leave behind a hole of 15 solar-masses, tops; heavier stars don't necessarily make heavier holes, because they tend to shed weight during their flamboyant lives. On the other end, gas clouds in the early universe collapse to holes of a million solarmasses and up. Perhaps the midsize holes involve the merger of stars or stellar-mass holes in a star cluster, for which there is some evidence in M82. Or maybe they resulted from the collapse of the first generation of stars, which, having formed in simpler times, were a race of Titans. But none of these and other explanations is problem-free. \"I apologize for the confusion,\" says theorist Roeland van der Marel of the Space Telescope Science Institute.\n\n【17】\"This is not a field where a paradigm has formed.

Also refers to the process whereby the lungs exchange gases, more specifically, oxygen (O 2 ) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) at the level of the alveolus and the alveolar-capillary membrane.\n\n【2】Respiratory failure: A state or illness in which the lungs become incapable of respiration. They become unable to provide the body with needed oxygen  , and cannot rid the body of accumulated carbon dioxide and metabolic waste products. Respiratory failure can be acute, as after a car accident, for example, or chronic, as in the case of emphysema. Uncontrolled asthma can result in progressive respiratory failure, a true medical emergency. Left untreated, respiratory failure is fatal.\n\n【3】Rhinitis: Refers to an inflammation of the nasal lining. Symptoms include: an irritated, \"runny\" nose and itching.\n\n【4】Rhinitis can be due to different causes including allergy. Allergic rhinitis is seen in \"hay fever,\" pet allergies, and ragweed allergy, for example.\n\n【5】Rigid bronchoscopy: A type of bronchoscopy (see Bronchoscopy) performed with a specialized surgical instrument called a rigid bronchoscope. Rigid bronchoscopy requires general anesthesia and is indicated under different circumstances than flexible bronchoscopy.\n\n【6】Sinus: The sinuses are air-filled cavities within the human skull. Adults have several sinuses, named by location: the frontal, ethmoid, sphenoid, and maxillary sinuses. The sinuses continue to form after birth; consequently, the frontal and sphenoid sinuses are not well developed in children.\n\n【7】Sinusitis: An inflammation of the lining of sinuses, due most commonly to either infection (viral or bacterial sinusitis), or allergy (allergic sinusitis).\n\n【8】Spacer: The name for a device that facilitates the inhalation of medicine from a metered dose inhaler (MDI).\n\n【9】There are different brands and designs of spacers on the market. Spacers allow you to \"space\" the two required steps for correct MDI use over time.\n\n【10】Correct MDI technique requires simultaneously activating the MDI canister, releasing medicine, and inhaling as deeply as you can. Adding a spacer permits you to first activate the medicine, and then inhale deeply.\n\n【11】Spacer use makes it easier to use the MDI medicine, enhances medication delivery to the lungs, and reduces deposition of medicine on the voice box.\n\n【12】The last fact is important as deposition of inhaler medicine in the throat and on the vocal cords not only wastes medicine, but can also lead to throat irritation and hoarseness. Holding chambers are similar to spacer devices.\n\n【13】Some use the terms interchangeably.\n\n【14】Spirometry: Spirometry is one of the\n\n【15】PFTs, and is the most important PFT in the setting of asthma diagnosis and treatment. Spirometry measures the flow of air from the lungs as a person forcefully and fully exhales from a deep inspiration.

Crank the radio's handle, and it plays. Unlike earlier generations of human-powered electronics, which quit the instant you did, a new breed stores your muscle energy in springs, batteries and capacitors that provide lasting returns.\n\n【3】Freeplay Energy in London has sold more than 2.5 million hand-cranked radios and flashlights since 1995. In its original products, turning a crank wound a tight 33-foot steel ribbon, which slowly uncoiled. In its new line, the crank turns a mini transmission that drives an alternator to charge onboard batteries.\n\n【4】Thirty seconds of human effort will yield 40 minutes of play or eight minutes of light, and the products will be one fifth the size and weight, addressing a primary consumer complaint: human-powered electronics tend to be big and heavy.\n\n【5】People buy human-powered electronics, which typically cost $50 to $80, because they're tired of spending money on batteries or because they want surety during storms or just because the gizmos are cool. But a mass market won't open \"until prices drop to the $29 range,\" says Vaughan Wiles, Freeplay's marketing director. New deals may help. This fall, outdoor-gear giant Coleman will sell a Freeplay flashlight under its brand name, as well as the radio.\n\n【6】Freeplay also plans a hand-powered generator laden with electronics that can recharge certain popular cell phones. AladdinPower in Tampa markets a Stepcharger that works like a foot pump to recharge cellphone, laptop-computer and video-camera batteries.\n\n【7】Designing practical devices requires \"very small, very strong, very efficient components that can produce power when an elderly woman turns the crank and yet can handle a tough guy cranking the thing like crazy,\" says Freeplay technical director John Hutchinson. Minimizing mechanical wear is also paramount.\n\n【8】A number of start-up companies have jumped on the bandwagon, but some products simply don't work well. Ultimately, success depends on maximizing a user's reward. \"If someone is stranded at sea, he'll crank all day\" to keep his two-way radio working so he can be rescued, Hutchinson says. \"But for the average guy in his garage, 60 seconds of effort is all he's willing to give.\" -Mark Fischetti\n\n【9】TURNING THE CRANK on Freeplay's Bravo AM/FM radio spins gears in a tiny transmission that drives an alternator.\n\n【10】It sends current to a 3.6-volt nickel–metal hydride rechargeable battery. A 30-second wind of sufficient torque will provide 45 minutes of lowvolume play or 25 minutes of boom-box sound. Further cranking will extend RECHARGEABLE BATTERY play. An amorphous thin-film solar cell can provide added current for lazy listeners.\n\n【11】WINDER HANDLE\n\n【12】WEARING a Seiko Kinetic watch during daily activity provides enough motion to power its mechanism. When the watch is still, memory cells can keep time for four years.\n\n【13】USTRATIONS BY GEORGE RETSECK", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "WORKINGKNOV", "bbox": [44.0, 34.0, 490.0, 104.0]}], "block_type": "Title", "full_blocks": [43.0, 33.0, 489.0, 103.0], "position": 0}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "HUMAN-POWERED ELECTRONICS", "bbox": [45.0, 141.0, 242.0, 160.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [44.0, 140.0, 241.0, 159.0], "position": 1}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Crank It Up!", "bbox": [44.0, 188.0, 280.0, 248.0]}], "block_type": "Title", "full_blocks": [43.0, 187.0, 279.0, 247.0], "position": 2}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Just shake the flashlight , and it shines.

Patients with synkinesis cannot move and control the facial muscles correctly when they want to express themselves.\n\n【4】## Can You Predict Synkinesis?\n\n【5】Will you always feel some kind of tightening or pain in your facial muscles?\n\n【6】Well, synkinesis is somewhat predictable; however, the severity of the symptoms can differ greatly among patients.\n\n【7】Before we discuss the predictable pattern, let us first differentiate between true paralysis (weak muscles) and synkinesis. For this quick test, all you need to do is stand in front of a mirror. What do you see? If your facial tone is normal and you can observe noticeable movements, the abnormal movements are a result of facial synkinesis.\n\n【8】Most patients recovering from facial palsy and Bell's palsy experience eye closure, in particular, when they try to smile. Sometimes, the eyelids tend to twitch or close suddenly while the patient is trying to laugh.\n\n【9】Synkinesis also affects patients who have reacquired their facial tone. The patients are unable to pull the affected corner of the mouth upwards when they smile – people assume that their mouth is not moving due to muscle weakness, i.e. loss of muscle tone. The reason, on the other hand, is synkinesis or simultaneous movement, not facial paralysis.\n\n【10】The inability to move corners of the mouth is obvious because muscles that droop towards the corner of mouth, i.e. zygomaticus major and minor, work simultaneously with depressor anguli oris, platysma, and mentalis, i.e. muscles responsible to elevate the corner of your mouth.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "side.", "bbox": [93.0, 96.0, 133.0, 116.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [92.0, 95.0, 132.0, 115.0], "position": 0}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "This simply means that the facial muscles on the affected side have a higher", "bbox": [93.0, 131.0, 723.0, 151.0]}, {"text": "tone.

In normothermic patients without significant confounders (sedatives, hypotension, hypothermia, neuromuscular blockade, or hypoxemia), an EEG pattern showing generalized suppression to < 20 µ V , burst-suppression pattern associated with generalized epileptic activity, or diffuse periodic complexes on a flat background is associated with a poor outcome (FPR 3%, 95% CI 0.9% to 11%删除6:<u>).</u>ne week after the initial arrest event, specific EEG findings may be useful for predicting poor outcomes in comatose cardiac arrest survivors, 161,203,204,206,214–221 The prognostic accuracy of malignant EEG patterns appears to be less reliable in patients treated with hypothermia.

Biomarkers that are predictive of neurological outcome are typically released from dying neurons or glial cells in the brain (eg, neuron-specific enolase [NSE], S100B, GFAP, CK-BB) and can be measured in the blood or CSF. The primary advantage of biomarkers is that levels are unlikely to be confounded by sedation or neuromuscular blockade, which are commonly used in the first few days after cardiac arrest. However, for most biomarkers, only an association with outcome has been reported. When using a cutoff value that results in an FPR of 0% for predicting poor outcome, the 95% CI is unacceptably high due to the small number of patients studied.\n\n【15】The most promising and extensively studied biomarker is serum NSE, which has been reported to have a 0% FPR (95% CI 0% to 3%) for predicting poor outcome when measured between 24 and 72 hours after cardiac arres删除6:<u>t.</u>ther\n\n【16】删除13:<u>删除12:<u>Downloaded from http://circ.ahajournals.org/ by guest on September 4, 2011</u></u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "potentials (SSEPs) and select physical examination findings", "bbox": [60.0, 84.0, 377.0, 99.0]}, {"text": "at specific time points after ROSC in the absence of con-", "bbox": [60.0, 100.0, 375.0, 113.0]}, {"text": "founders (such as hypotension, seizures, sedatives, or neuro-", "bbox": [60.0, 115.0, 375.0, 130.0]}, {"text": "muscular blockers) are the most reliable early predictors of", "bbox": [60.0, 132.0, 377.0, 145.0]}, {"text": "poor outcome in patients not undergoing therapeutic hypo-", "bbox": [60.0, 147.0, 375.0, 160.0]}, {"text": "thermia.

It's caused tremendous confusion and frustration to already confused and frustrated dieters.\n\n【1】First, focusing primarily on any macronutrient (protein, carbs or fat) or macronutrient ratio should be secondary to energy balance. What makes you fat is eating too many calories.\n\n【2】Truth is, you can't blame all \"carbohydrates\" as a group for why we are getting fatter. What type of carbohydrates are we talking about? There are good carbs and bad carbs. The \"bad\" carbs are the refined ones; white flour and white sugar products like white bread, white pasta, sugar sweetened cereals, candy and soft drinks.\n\n【3】To avoid confusion, I would suggest never using the word \"carbohydrate\" without putting the adjective \"refined\" or \"natural\" in front of it.\n\n【4】Ironically, Dr. Atkins does make this distinction in his book, yet he still chose to recommend removal of almost ALL carbs during the induction and weight loss phases of his diet - even the good carbs that are proven healthy.  This creates rapid weight loss and the appearance of a hugely successful diet right from the first week.\n\n【5】Again, the real questions are: What kind of weight was lost and can you keep the weight off for good?\n\n【6】A healthy, maintainable fat burning diet should be centered on natural foods – and for most people, that includes natural carbs in moderation - not the total removal and demonizing of all carbohydrates.\n\n【7】## Lie #9: Ketosis Makes You Feel Better And Doesn’T Affect Your Performance\n\n【8】Your body is a remarkable machine that is fully capable of adapting to whatever fuel is provided in predominance. You can burn protein, fat, or carbs for energy.\n\n【9】However, carbohydrates are your body's preferred – and most efficient - fuel source for vigorous physical activity.\n\n【10】Many low carbers believe that fat is a more efficient energy source than carbohydrates, but this is not true. Fat is not a more efficient energy source, it is only a more concentrated energy source.\n\n【11】Since the fuel for muscular contraction is carbs (glycogen) a high fat, low carb diet is not the best approach to fat loss for athletes, bodybuilders or highly active individuals. These diets simply don't support high intensity training.\n\n【12】Very low carb diets might be appropriate for the sedentary, severely overweight, or those with orthopedic conditions that prevent any exercise.  It seems that ketogenic diets take off weight even with little or no exercise (although the weight won't be pure fat and you may not keep it off). Some Atkins dieters even report feeling more energetic after adapting to the low carbs and higher fat.  It's likely, however, that most of them were relatively inactive.

Even that is a triumph— for us and for Smolin. The subject of this book is so highly abstract, and so far removed from ordinary experience, that an illusion of understanding is perhaps the best we can hope for.\n\n【5】Only a few hundred people in the world may understand the intricacies of loop quantum gravity, Smolin's particular line of research, and I will confess that I am not one of them. Nevertheless, I am grateful that he has taken the time from his science to write this engaging popularization, for, as he rightly supposes, there are many of us who want to think we know what's going on. It would be hard to imagine a better guide to this difficult subject.\n\n【6】The first half of the 20th century saw the invention of two highly successful the- ories for describing the world: quantum mechanics and general relativity (gravity).\n\n【7】Each theory reigns supreme in its domain of application: quantum theory on the scale of elementary particles, relativity on the cosmic scale. Only occasionally, as in discussions of black holes, do the two theories rub against each other.\n\n【8】The rubbing can be abrasive. Quantum theory radicalizes our assumptions about the relationship between observer and observed but pretty much buys into Newton's ideas of space and time. General relativity changes our notions of space and time but accepts Newton's view of observer and observed. This situation is deemed unacceptable by most physicists, and the race is on to find a unifying theory of quantum gravity, sometimes called a Theory of Everything.\n\n【9】Smolin describes the three most promising approaches to such a theory, all of\n\n【10】QUANTUM UNIVERSE doing its foamy thing.

If we contemplate tooth extractions, it is indispensable to consider the amount of space that is going to be available, and the anchorage combinations that will be needed to limit dental displacement. In some cases, all the space obtained from the dental extractions will be used for the alignment of the remaining teeth, and in some other cases only part of that space will be required. (3)\n\n【3】When orthodontic treatment has been decided, we must take into consideration all the problems that can arise from biomechanics and must know the anchor value of each tooth (dental anchorage).\n\n【4】The complications in anchorage control can be easily managed, if we: Have a clear idea how the final occlusion will turn o out.\n\n【5】Be aware of the undesired movements that can ap删除16:<u>¬ </u>o pear between appointments and their immediate correction.  Be aware of the undesired movements that can ap删除16:<u>¬ </u>pear between appointments and their immediate correction.\n\n【6】Have knowledge of the biomechanical principles in o which orthodontic appliances function. (10.18.19.24)\n\n【7】## Types Of Anchorage\n\n【8】In this chapter we will study the different types of intraoral anchorage, which can be classified in diverse manners; however, a very simple and understandable classification will be presented. Intraoral anchorage can be divided in four big groups:\n\n【9】1:\n\n【10】192.\n\n【11】1.1.3.\n\n【12】4.\n\n【13】Minimal Anchorage.\n\n【14】Moderate Anchorage.\n\n【15】Maximum or Severe Anchorage.\n\n【16】Absolut Anchorage.\n\n【17】## Minimal Anchorage 1.\n\n【18】When we place this type of anchorage in molars, they migrate in a mesial direction up to 70% of the space, giving us 30% of anchorage; minimal anchorage is also helpful in anchoring the anterior segment. According to Nanda this type of anchorage is called C Anchorage or \"non-critical -anchorage\", where 75% of space closure is obtained by mesial displacement of posterior teeth. We elaborate this type of anchorage in the arch wire (stops, tip back, arch wire tie back, toe-in, toe-out, in-bend, out-bend) or with accessory elements (retro-ligature, intermaxillary elastics, lip bumper) or a combination of both. (19.24)\n\n【19】Types of Minimal Anchorage:\n\n【20】Stops.\n\n【21】1.\n\n【22】2.\n\n【23】3.\n\n【24】4.\n\n【25】5.\n\n【26】7.\n\n【27】## A)\n\n【28】6.\n\n【29】Tip back.\n\n【30】Arch wire tie back.\n\n【31】Toe-in, Toe-Out.\n\n【32】Retro-ligature.\n\n【33】Intermaxillary elastics.\n\n【34】Lip Bumper.\n\n【35】## Stops\n\n【36】This type of minimal anchorage is done in the arch wire, can be round (0.020\") or rectangular (0.017\"x 0.025\") stainless steel. The stops are made at the mesial portion of the molar tubes in a passive manner, this means that the arch wire must be inside all the slots. (22)\n\n【37】## Advantages\n\n【38】## 1.\n\n【39】2.\n\n【40】1.

One prospective, randomized controlled trial in an EMS system with short out-of-hospital transport intervals 67 showed no survival advantage for endotracheal intubation over bag-mask ventilation in children; providers in this study had limited training and experience in intubation.\n\n【3】The endotracheal tube keeps the airway patent, permits suctioning of airway secretions, enables delivery of a high concentration of oxygen, provides an altemative route for the administration of some drugs, facilitates delivery of a selected tidal volume, and, with use of a cuff, may protect the airway from aspiration.\n\n【4】Indications for emergency endotracheal intubation are (1) the inability of the provider to ventilate the unconscious patient adequately with a bag and mask and (2) the absence of airway protective reflexes (coma or cardiac arrest). The provider must have appropriate training and experience in endotracheal intubation.\n\n【5】During CPR providers should minimize the number and duration of interruptions in chest compressions, with a goal to limit interruptions to no more than 10 seconds. Interruptions for supraglottic airway placement should not be necessary at all, whereas interruptions for endotracheal intubation can be minimized if the intubating provider is prepared to begin the intubation attempt—ie, insert the laryngoscope blade with the tube ready at hand—as soon as the compressing provider pauses compressions. Compressions should be interrupted only for the time required by the intubating provider to visualize the vocal cords and insert the tube; this is ideally less than 10 seconds. The compressing provider should be prepared to resume chest compressions immediately after the tube is passed through the vocal cords. If the initial intubation attempt is unsuccessful, a second attempt may be reasonable, but early consideration should be given to using a supraglottic airway.\n\n【6】In retrospective studies, endotracheal intubation has been associated with a 6% to 25% incidence of unrecognized tube misplacement or displacemen删除6:<u>t.</u>his may reflect inadequate initial training or lack of experience on the part of the provider who performed intubation, or it may have resulted from displacement of a correctly positioned tube when the patient was moved. The risk of tube misplacement, displacement, or obstruction is high, 67.70 especially when the patient is move删除6:<u>d.</u>hus, even when the endotracheal tube is seen to pass through the vocal cords and tube position is verified by chest expansion and auscultation during positive-pressure ventilation, providers should obtain additional confirmation of placement using waveform capnography or an exhaled CO 2 or esophageal detector device (EDD删除6:<u>).</u>he provider should use both clinical assessment and confirmation devices to verify tube placement immediately after insertion and again when the patient is moved. However, no single confirmation technique is completely reliabl删除6:<u>e.</u>ontinuous waveform capnography is recommended in addition to clinical assessment as the most reliable method of confirming and monitoring correct placement of an endotracheal tube (Class I, LOE A).\n\n【7】If waveform capnography is not available, an EDD or nonwaveform exhaled CO 2 monitor in addition to clinical assessment is reasonable (Class IIa, LOE B). Techniques to confirm endotracheal tube placement are further discussed below.\n\n【8】Clinical Assessment to Confirm Tube Placement Providers should perform a thorough assessment of endotracheal tube position immediately after placement. This assessment should not require interruption of chest compressions.\n\n【9】Assessment by physical examination consists of visualizing chest expansion bilaterally and listening over the epigastrium (breath sounds should not be heard) and the lung fields bilaterally (breath sounds should be equal and adequate). A device should also be used to confirm correct placement in the trachea (see below). If there is doubt about correct tube placement, use the laryngoscope to visualize the tube passing through the vocal cords. If still in doubt, remove the tube and provide bag-mask ventilation until the tube can be replaced.\n\n【10】Use of Devices to Confirm Tube Placement Providers should always use both clinical assessment and devices to confirm endotracheal tube location immediately after placement and throughout the resuscitation. Two studies of patients in cardiac arrest 72 . 77 demonstrated 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity for waveform capnography in identifying correct endotracheal tube placement in victims of cardiac arrest. However, 3 studies demonstrated 64% sensitivity and 100% specificity when waveform capnography was first used for victims with prolonged resuscitation and transport time删除6:<u>s.</u>ll confirmation devices should be considered adjuncts to other confirmation techniques.\n\n【11】Exhaled CO 2 Detectors.  Detection of exhaled CO 2 is one of several independent methods of confirming endotracheal tube position. Studies of waveform capnography to verify endotracheal tube position in victims of cardiac arrest have shown 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity in identifying correct endotracheal tube placemen删除6:<u>t.</u>ontinuous waveform capnography is recommended in addition to clinical assessment as the most reliable method of confirming and monitoring correct placement of an endotracheal tube (Class I, LOE A).\n\n【12】Given the simplicity of colorimetric and nonwaveform exhaled CO 2 detectors, these methods can be used in addition to clinical assessment as the initial method for confirming correct tube placement in a patient in cardiac arrest when waveform capnography is not available (Class IIa, LOE B).\n\n【13】However, studies of colorimetric exhaled CO 2 detectors 89 – 94 and nonwaveform P ETCO 2 capnometers 77 , 90 , 95 indicate that the accuracy of these devices does not exceed that of auscultation and direct visualization for confirming the tracheal position of an endotracheal tube in victims of cardiac arrest.\n\n【14】When exhaled CO 2 is detected (positive reading for CO 2 ) in cardiac arrest, it is usually a reliable indicator of tube", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "EMS or healthcare system, and the patient's condition.", "bbox": [60.0, 84.0, 375.0, 99.0]}, {"text": "Frequent experience or frequent retraining is recommended", "bbox": [60.0, 100.0, 377.0, 113.0]}, {"text": "for providers who perform endotracheal intubation (Class I,", "bbox": [60.0, 115.0, 375.0, 129.0]}, {"text": "LOE B). 31. 66 EMS systems that perform prehospital intuba-", "bbox": [60.0, 129.0, 375.0, 146.0]}, {"text": "tion should provide a program of ongoing quality improve-", "bbox": [60.0, 147.0, 375.0, 160.0]}, {"text": "ment to minimize complications (Class IIa, LOE B).", "bbox": [60.0, 161.0, 336.0, 175.0]}, {"text": "No prospective randomized clinical trials have performed a", "bbox": [72.0, 177.0, 377.0, 190.0]}, {"text": "direct comparison of bag-mask ventilation versus endotra-", "bbox": [60.0, 193.0, 375.0, 207.0]}, {"text": "cheal intubation in adult victims of cardiac arrest.

When gestational age, birth weight, or congenital anomalies are associated with almost certain early death and when unacceptably high morbidity is likely among the rare survivors, resuscitation is not indicated.\n\n【9】Examples may include extreme prematurity (gestational age < 23 weeks or birth weight < 400 g), anencephaly, and some major chromosomal abnormalities such as trisomy 13 (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【10】In conditions associated with uncertain prognosis where survival is borderline, the morbidity rate is relatively high, and the anticipated burden to the child is high, parental desires concerning initiation of resuscitation should be supported (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【11】There should be a consistent and coordinated approach from the obstetric and neonatal teams in applying these guidelines and in communicating with the parents in developing an agreedupon management plan when possible.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "Figure 2.

These targets may be achieved by initiating resuscitation with air or a blended oxygen and titrating the oxygen concentration to achieve an Spo 2 in the target range as described above using pulse oximetry (Class IIb, LOE C). If blended oxygen is not available, resuscitation should be initiated with air (Class IIb, LOE B). If the baby is bradycardic (HR < 60 per minute) after 90 seconds of resuscitation with a lower concentration of oxygen, oxygen concentration should be increased to 100% until recovery of a normal heart rate (Class IIb, LOE B).\n\n【13】Many experts recommend administration of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to infants who are breathing spontaneously, but with difficulty, following birth, although its use has been studied only in infants born preterm. A multicenter randomized clinical trial of newborns at 25 to 28 weeks gestation with signs of respiratory distress showed no significant difference in the outcomes of death or oxygen requirement at 36 weeks postmenstrual age between infants started on CPAP versus those intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation in the delivery room.

He clicks, and suddenly a constellation of tiny pink dots appears like a pox on the countryside.

U.S.\n\n【3】forces dropped more than two million tons of bombs on the Ho Chi Minh Trail, the North Vietnamese supply route that snaked through the jungles of eastern Laos.\n\n【4】\"The patterns show very clearly the targeting was on flat land and lines of communication,\" says Sheinkman, an maimed more than 10,000 people. In addition to their effect on public health, unexploded bombs greatly hamper the small and fragile Lao economy, especially by impeding agricultural development.\n\n【5】After the war ended in 1975, bomb disposal groups tried to clear swaths of land with marginal success. But it wasn't until the mid-1990s that a more sophisticated, countrywide program called UXO Lao (the national office of which is in Vientiane) was launched by the Lao government with the support of international aid agencies. Finding and disposing of unexploded ordnance, or UXO, is the slow and exacting work of the program's 628 bomb technicians and 23 foreign advisers.\n\n【6】For the past two years, Sheinkman, employed first by a government contractor called Management Support Technology and now by Federal Resource Corporation, both based in Fairfax, Va., has as- records. He and his colleagues at Bolling Air Force Base's History Support Office planned to write a history of air combat operations during the Vietnam War. He was browsing the office library and found an index of U.S. bombing records. \"It had pages and pages of databases from the Vietnam War era,\" Stanley marvels. \"I thought, 'This is just incredible.' \" The index, from a Rand Corporation study published in 1976, inspired Stanley to seek the actual magnetic tapes embedded with streams of arcane numerical codes used by the U.S. military during the war. Stanley realized that those tapes—if they still existed—should denote bomb and aircraft types, target coordinates and other information about U.S. bombing missions in Southeast Asia. Military analysts knew nothing of the antiquated records.\n\n【7】Stanley next checked closer to home, at the National Archives, in Maryland.\n\n【8】## Bomb Specialists And Manufacturers Estimate That Up To 30 Percent Of Bombs Dropped By The U.S. On The Ho Chi Minh Trail In Eastern Laos Failed To Explode.\n\n【9】American geographer working on the extensive effort to locate and neutralize the unexploded ordnance. \"The downside for the people of Laos some 30 years later is that flat land is at a premium.\" Land mines, perhaps more familiar as a threat, represent a mere 4 percent of the unexploded bombs in Laos. U.S.-made aerial bombs account for the majority of ordnance lurking in topsoil and bamboo thickets, although artillery shells, antitank rockets, hand grenades and other types of ordnance from China, France, Russia and elsewhere emerge regularly from hiding.\n\n【10】The human cost of these unexploded bombs is considerable: they have killed or\n\n【11】THE AUTHOR\n\n【12】DANIEL LOVERING is a Bangkok-based correspondent for the French news service Agence France-Presse.

His work is an outgrowth of U.S. funding that began three years ago, when the U.S. Department of Defense's Humanitarian Demining Office began assisting UXO Lao with training and equipment. In late 1998 Sheinkman and his Lao advisees began charting old bombing runs that may have left unexploded ordnance in their wake.\n\n【14】## Bomb Sniffing\n\n【15】THE DIGITAL MAPS splashed across Sheinkman's office incorporate bombing data that had to be painstakingly culled from electronic records kept by the U.S.\n\n【16】military during the war.

Bag-mask ventilation requires training and periodic retraining in the following skills: selecting the correct mask size, opening the airway, making a tight seal between the mask and face, delivering effective ventilation, and assessing the effectiveness of that ventilation.\n\n【5】Use a self-inflating bag with a volume of at least 450 to 500 mL 123 for infants and young children, as smaller bags may not deliver an effective tidal volume or the longer inspiratory times required by full-term neonates and infant删除6:<u>s.</u>n older children or adolescents, an adult self-inflating bag (1000 mL) may be needed to reliably achieve chest rise.\n\n【6】A self-inflating bag delivers only room air unless supplementary oxygen is attached, but even with an oxygen inflow of 10 L/min, the concentration of delivered oxygen varies from 30% to 80% and is affected by the tidal volume and peak inspiratory flow rat删除6:<u>e.</u>o deliver a high oxygen concentration (60% to 95%), attach an oxygen reservoir to the self-inflating bag. Maintain an oxygen flow of 10 to 15 L/min into a reservoir attached to a pediatric bag125 and a flow of at least 15 L/min into an adult bag.\n\n【7】Effective bag-mask ventilation requires a tight seal between the mask and the victim's face. Open the airway by lifting the jaw toward the mask making a tight seal and squeeze the bag until the chest rises (see Figure 5). Because effective bag-mask ventilation requires complex steps, bagmask ventilation is not recommended for a lone rescuer during CPR. During CPR the lone rescuer should use mouth- to-barrier device techniques for ventilation. Bag-mask ventilation can be provided effectively during 2-person CPR.\n\n【8】Precautions Healthcare providers often deliver excessive ventilation during CPR, 34 , 126 , 127 particularly when an advanced airway is in place. Excessive ventilation is harmful because it  • Increases intrathoracic pressure and impedes venous return and therefore decreases cardiac output, cerebral blood flow, and coronary perfusion. 127 • Causes air trapping and barotrauma in patients with smallairway obstruction.\n\n【9】• Increases the risk of regurgitation and aspiration in patients without an advanced airway.\n\n【10】Avoid excessive ventilation (Class III, LOE C); use only the force and tidal volume necessary to just make the chest rise. Give each breath slowly, over approximately 1 second, and watch for chest rise. If the chest does not rise, reopen the airway, verify that there is a tight seal between the mask and the face (or between the bag and the advanced airway), and reattempt ventilation.\n\n【11】Because effective bag-mask ventilation requires complex steps, bag-mask ventilation is not recommended for ventilation by a lone rescuer during CPR.\n\n【12】Patients with airway obstruction or poor lung compliance may require high inspiratory pressures to be properly ventilated (sufficient to produce chest rise). A pressurerelief valve may prevent the delivery of a sufficient tidal volume in these patient删除6:<u>s.</u>ake sure that the bag-mask device allows you to bypass the pressure-relief valve and use high pressures, if necessary, to achieve visible chest expansio删除2:<u> 128</u>\n\n【13】## Two-Person Bag-Mask Ventilation\n\n【14】If skilled rescuers are available, a 2-person technique may provide more effective bag-mask-ventilation than a singleperson techniqu删除6:<u>e.</u> 2-person technique may be required to provide effective bag-mask ventilation when there is significant airway obstruction, poor lung compliance, 128 or difficulty in creating a tight seal between the mask and the face. One rescuer uses both hands to open the airway and maintain a tight mask-to-face seal while the other compresses the ventilation bag. Both rescuers should observe the chest to ensure chest rise. Because the 2-person technique may be more effective, be careful to avoid delivering too high a tidal volume that may contribute to excessive ventilation.\n\n【15】## Gastric Inflation And Cricoid Pressure\n\n【16】Gastric inflation may interfere with effective ventilation 130 and cause regurgitation. To minimize gastric inflation  • Avoid creation of excessive peak inspiratory pressures by delivering each breath over approximately 1 second. 131 • Cricoid pressure may be considered, but only in an unresponsive victim if there is an additional healthcare provide删除6:<u>r.</u>void excessive cricoid pressure so as not to obstruct the trache删除2:<u> 135</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "Figure 5.

Similarly, the lower eyelid may sag. This exposes your eye to the environment making it more susceptible to damage, discomfort and visual impairment. The main aim of eye surgery is to reduce discomfort. The surgery is also very effective in preserving vision.\n\n【1】As with any surgical procedure, there are certain risks associated with eye surgery. Remember, there are various other treatments, surgeries and therapies that are helpful for people suffering from Bell's palsy. You can discuss possible options with your doctor before making a final decision.\n\n【2】I've come across many people who live a very happy life even though they decided against having any surgical corrections. It really depends on what makes you happy as a person. If you can live with the fact that you have a droopy eye, then more power to you. However, if you don't want to deal with a droopy eye for life, you may choose to go under the knife.\n\n【3】## Upper Eyelid Surgery\n\n【4】This surgery helps the upper lid cover more of the cornea and patients can close over 75% of their eye. Usually, it involves the surgical implantation of gold eyelid weights. The weights help the eyelid close with the help of gravity.\n\n【5】Gold eyelid weights can be implanted in an outpatient procedure. You can go back home the very same day. Once gold weights are attached to the eyelid, you can close the eyelid immediately. Minor bruising and swelling of the area is quite common, but it goes away in a few weeks.\n\n【6】There can be a slight bump on the eyelid where the weights are implanted. A qualified surgeon may place the gold implants in a place where they remain hidden. The reason gold weights are used is that the metal does not irritate a patient's skin. Gold weights are also safe to be used during an MRI.\n\n【7】The risk of upper eyelid surgery is that it can be difficult to control the position of the upper lid. If the eyelid still remains high, a repeat surgery may be required. Sometimes the weight may be too heavy, which will be seen as a bulky mass through the upper eyelid. The use of heavy weights can also blur your vision.\n\n【8】##", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "During Bell's palsy, the eyebrow may droop, and the upper eyelid may not close", "bbox": [93.0, 96.0, 723.0, 116.0]}, {"text": "completely.

Since the revolution is just beginning, we can only speculate. A large part of the improvement in the performance of the device is due to the development of a new design called the 'junction transistor.' The early units consisted of a germanium crystal touched by two closely spaced fine wires—'cat's whiskers.' In the junction transistor this point-contact arrangement has been replaced by a large-area contact. It therefore operates more efficiently and consumes far less power. —Louis N. Ridenour.\"\n\n【5】THE EYE AND THE BRAIN—\"Adelbert Ames, Jr., of the Institute for Associated Research in Hanover, N.H., has designed some new ways of studying visual perception. His theory suggests that the world each of us knows is a world created in large measure from our experience in dealing with the environment. In our illustration [ right ], figures are distorted when they are placed in a specially constructed room.

The answer seems to be yes. At a distance of 360 million light-years, the limit of the 200-inch's penetration so far, the nebulae apparently are receding from the earth with a velocity of 38,000 miles per second, at the rate predicted by the expanding-universe theory.\"\n\n【7】## August 1901\n\n【8】RADIATION BURNS—\"Henri Becquerel has confirmed, by an unpleasant experience, the fact, first noted by Walkoff and Giesel, that the rays of radium have an energetic action on the skin.

By the time the physician is ready to deliver the baby, standard ACLS should be underway and immediately reversible causes of cardiac arrest should be ruled out. When the gravid uterus is large enough to cause maternal hemodynamic changes due to aortocaval compression, emergency cesarean section should be considered, regardless of fetal viability.\n\n【2】## What Defines A Gravid Uterus With The Potential To Cause Aortocaval Compression?\n\n【3】A study found that maternal aortocaval compression can occur for singleton pregnancies at ≥ 20 weeks of gestational ag删除6:<u>e.</u>owever, the exact gestational age at which aortocaval compression occurs is not consistent, especially with multiplegestation pregnancies or intrauterine growth retardation, and gestational age and number of fetuses may not always be known in the emergency situation. Fundal height is often used to estimate gestational age. In a singleton gestation, by 20 weeks fundal height is approximately at the level of the umbilicus 157 ; however the fundus may reach the umbilicus between 15 and 19 weeks of gestatio删除6:<u>n.</u>undal height may also be skewed by other factors such as abdominal distention 157 and increased body mass index; therefore fundal height may be a poor predictor of gestational age.\n\n【4】One review of emergency cesarean sections in maternal cardiac arrest before the third trimester concluded that if the fundus extends above the level of the umbilicus, aortocaval compression can occur, and emergency cesarean section should be performed regardless of gestational ag删除6:<u>e.</u>wo cases of maternal cardiac arrest in early pregnancy of 13 to 15 weeks were reported in which the mother was resuscitated without an emergency cesarean section being performed and the pregnancy continued to successful delivery of a live infant at ter删除6:<u>m.</u>ot every pregnant woman in cardiac arrest is a candidate for an emergency cesarean section; the decision depends on whether or not the gravid uterus is thought to interfere with maternal hemodynamics.\n\n【5】## Why Perform An Emergency Cesarean Section In Cardiac Arrest?\n\n【6】Several case reports of emergency cesarean section in maternal cardiac arrest indicate a return of spontaneous circulation or improvement in maternal hemodynamic status only after the uterus has been emptie删除6:<u>d.</u>n a case series of 38 cases of perimortem cesarean section, 12 of 20 women for whom maternal outcome was recorded had return of spontaneous circulation immediately after delivery.

Emergency cesarean section may be considered at 4 minutes after onset of maternal cardiac arrest if there is no return of spontaneous circulation (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【12】## Institutional Preparation For Maternal Cardiac Arrest\n\n【13】Experts and organizations have emphasized the importance of preparatio删除6:<u>n.</u>roviders at medical centers must review whether performance of an emergency hysterotomy is feasible, and if so, they must identify the best means of accomplishing this procedure rapidly.

Instead videotape recorders captured events in the dome for later processing.\n\n【1】Ruzena Bajcsy, head of the GRASP (General Robotics, Automation, Sensing and Perception) Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania, was intrigued by the idea of real-time seas of cameras.\n\n【2】删除8:<u>Starting in 1994, she worked with colleagues at Chapel Hill and Carnegie Mellon on small-scale \"puddles\" of two or three cameras to gather real-world data for virtual-reality applications.</u>\n\n【3】Bajcsy and her colleague Kostas Daniilidis took on the assignment of creating the first real-time sea of cameras—one that was, moreover, scalable and modular so that it could be adapted to a variety of rooms and uses. They worked closely with the Chapel Hill team, which was responsible for taking the \"animated sculpture\" data and using computer graphics techniques to turn it into a realistic scene for each user.\n\n【4】But a sea of cameras in itself isn't a complete solution. Suppose a sea of cameras is looking at a clean white wall. Because there are no surface features, the cameras have no information with which to build a sculptural model. A person can look at a white wall without being confused. Humans don't worry that a wall might actually be a passage to an infinitely deep white chasm, because we don't rely on geometric cues alone— we also have a model of a room in our minds that can rein in errant mental interpretations. Unfortunately, to today's digital cameras, a person's forehead or T-shirt can present the same challenge as a white wall, and today's software isn't smart enough to undo the confusion that results.\n\n【5】Researchers at Chapel Hill came up with a novel method that has shown promise for overcoming this obstacle, called \"imperceptible structured light,\" or ISL. Conventional lightbulbs flicker 50 or 60 times a second, fast enough for the flickering to be generally invisible to the human eye. Similarly, ISL appears to the human eye as a continuous source of white light, like an ordinary lightbulb, but in fact it is filled with quickly changing patterns visible only to specialized, care- fully synchronized cameras. These patterns fill in voids such as white walls with imposed features that allow a sea of cameras to complete the measurements.\n\n【6】## The Eureka Moment\n\n【7】删除8:<u>we were able to demonstrate tele-immersion for the first time on May 9, 2000, virtually bringing together three locations. About a dozen dignitaries were physically at the telecubicle in Chapel Hill. There we and they took turns sitting down in the simulated office of tomorrow. As fascinating as the three years of research leading up to this demonstration had been for me, the delight of experiencing tele-immersion was unanticipated and incomparable. Seen through a pair of polarizing glasses, two walls of the cubicle dissolved into windows, revealing other offices with other people who were looking back at me. (The glasses helped to direct a slightly different view of the scenes to each eye, creating the stereo vision effect.) Through one wall I greeted Amela Sadagic, a researcher at my lab in Armonk, N.Y. Through the other wall was Jane Mulligan, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania.</u>\n\n【8】Unlike the cartoonish virtual worlds I had worked with for many years, the remote people and places I was seeing were clearly derived from reality. They were not perfect by any means. There was \"noise\" in the system that looked something like confetti being dropped in the other people's cubicles. The frame rate was low (2 to 3 fps), there was as much as one second of delay, and only one side of the conversation had access to a tele-immersive display.\n\n【9】Nevertheless, here was a virtual world that was not a simplistic artistic representation of the real world but rather an authentic measurement-based rendition of it.\n\n【10】In a later demo (in October 2000) most of the confetti was\n\n【11】COMPARISON OF TWO VIEWS of a person taken by the tele-immersion cameras yields this image. The colors represent the first rough calculation of the depth of the person's features.\n\n【12】gone and the overall quality and speed of the system had increased, but the most important improvement came from researchers at Brown University led by Andries van Dam. They arrived in a tele-immersive session bearing virtual objects not derived from the physical scene. I sat across the table from Robert C. Zeleznik of Brown, who was physically at my lab in Armonk. He presented a simulated miniature office interior (about two feet wide) resting on the desk between us, and we used simulated laser pointers and other devices to modify walls and furniture in it collaboratively while we talked. This was a remarkable blending of the experience of using simulations associated with virtual reality and simply being with another person.\n\n【13】## When Can I Use It?\n\n【14】BEYOND THE SCENE-CAPTURE system, the principal components of a tele-immersion setup are the computers, the network services, and the display and interaction devices. Each of these components has been advanced in the cause of teleimmersion and must advance further.\n\n【15】Tele-immersion is a voracious consumer of computer resources.

Intermittent or continuous sedation and/or analgesia can be used to achieve specific goals. Patients with post– cardiac arrest cognitive dysfunction may display agitation or frank delirium with purposeless movement and are at risk of self-injury. Opioids, anxiolytics, and sedative-hypnotic agents can be used in various combinations to improve patient-ventilator interaction and blunt the stress-related surge of endogenous catecholamines. Other agents with sedative and antipsychotic-tranquilizer properties, such as α 2 -adrenergic agonists,¹ 26 and butyrophenones¹ 27 are also used based on individual clinical circumstances.\n\n【3】If patient agitation is life-threatening, neuromuscular blocking agents can be used for short intervals with adequate sedation. Caution should be used in patients at high risk of seizures unless continuous electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring is available. In general sedative agents should be administered cautiously with daily interruptions and titrated to the desired effect. A number of sedation scales 128 – 133 and motor activity scales 134 were developed to titrate these pharmacological interventions to a clinical goal.\n\n【4】Shorter-acting medications that can be used as a single bolus or continuous infusion are usually preferred. There is little evidence to guide sedation/analgesia therapy immediately after ROSC. One observational study 135 found an association between use of sedation and development of pneumonia in intubated patients during the first 48 hours of therapy. However, the study was not designed to investigate sedation as a risk factor for either pneumonia or death in patients with cardiac arrest.\n\n【5】Although minimizing sedation allows a better clinical estimate of neurological status, sedation, analgesia, and occasionally neuromuscular relaxation are routinely used to facilitate induced hypothermia and to control shivering. The duration of neuromuscular blocker use should be minimized and the depth of neuromuscular blockade should be monitored with a nerve twitch stimulator.\n\n【6】It is reasonable to consider the titrated use of sedation and analgesia in critically ill patients who require mechanical ventilation or shivering suppression during induced hypothermia after cardiac arrest (Class IIb, LOE C). Duration of neuromuscular blocking agents should be kept to a minimum or avoided altogether.\n\n【7】## Cardiovascular System\n\n【8】ACS is a common cause of cardiac arres删除6:<u>t.</u>he clinician should evaluate the patient's 12-lead ECG and cardiac markers after ROSC. A 12-lead ECG should be obtained as soon as possible after ROSC to determine whether acute ST elevation is present (Class I, LOE B).\n\n【9】Because it is impossible to determine the final neurological status of comatose patients in the first hours after ROSC, aggressive treatment of ST-elevation myocardial infarction\n\n【10】(STEMI) should begin as in non–cardiac arrest patients, regardless of coma or induced hypothermia. Because of the high incidence of acute coronary ischemia, consideration of emergent coronary angiography may be reasonable even in the absence of STEM删除6:<u>I.</u>otably, PCI, alone or as part of a bundle of care, is associated with improved myocardial function 14 and neurological outcome删除6:<u>s.</u>herapeutic hypothermia can be safely combined with primary PCI after cardiac arrest caused by AM删除6:<u>I.</u>ther details of ACS treatment are discussed in Part 10.\n\n【11】Patients with cardiac arrest may receive antiarrhythmic drugs such as lidocaine or amiodarone during initial resuscitation. There is no evidence to support or refute continued or prophylactic administration of these medication删除2:<u> 7.148–152</u>\n\n【12】## Vasoactive Drugs For Use In Post–Cardiac Arrest Patients\n\n【13】## Vasopressors\n\n【14】Vasoactive drugs may be administered after ROSC to support cardiac output, especially blood flow to the heart and brain.\n\n【15】Drugs may be selected to improve heart rate (chronotropic effects), myocardial contractility (inotropic effects), or arterial pressure (vasoconstrictive effects), or to reduce afterload (vasodilator effects). Unfortunately many adrenergic drugs are not selective and may increase or decrease heart rate and afterload, increase cardiac arrhythmias, and increase myocardial ischemia by creating a mismatch between myocardial oxygen demand and delivery. Myocardial ischemia, in turn, may further decrease heart function. Some agents may also have metabolic effects that increase blood glucose, lactate, and metabolic rate. There is a paucity of data about which vasoactive drug to select first, although providers should become familiar with the differing adverse effects associated with these drugs, which might make a particular agent more or less appropriate for a specific patien删除6:<u>t.</u>pecific drug infusion rates cannot be recommended because of variations in pharmacokinetics (relation between drug dose and concentration) and pharmacodynamics (relation between drug concentration and effect) in critically ill patients, 154 , 155 so commonly used initial dose ranges are listed in Table 2. Vasoactive drugs must be titrated at the bedside to secure the intended effect while limiting side effects. Providers must also be aware of the concentrations delivered and compatibilities with previously and concurrently administered drugs.\n\n【16】In general, adrenergic drugs should not be mixed with sodium bicarbonate or other alkaline solutions in the IV line because there is evidence that adrenergic agents are inactivated in alkaline solution删除6:<u>s.</u>orepinephrine (levarterenol) and other catecholamines that activate α -adrenergic receptors may produce tissue necrosis if extravasation occurs.\n\n【17】Therefore, administration through a central line is preferred whenever possible.

Amiodarone, however, has been shown to increase short-term survival to hospital admission when compared with placebo or lidocaine.\n\n【10】Two observational studies 290 . 291 showed that IV magnesium sulfate can facilitate termination of torsades de pointes (irregular/polymorphic VT associated with prolonged QT interval). Magnesium sulfate is not likely to be effective in terminating irregular/polymorphic VT in patients with a normal QT interva删除2:<u> 291</u>\n\n【11】IV amiodarone affects sodium, potassium, and calcium channels and has α - and β -adrenergic blocking properties. It can be considered for treatment of VF or pulseless VT unresponsive to shock delivery, CPR, and a vasopressor. In blinded randomized controlled clinical trials in adults with refractory VF/pulseless VT in the out-of-hospital setting, 134 , 136 paramedic administration of amiodarone (300 mg 134 or 5 mg/kg 136 ) improved hospital admission rates when compared with administration of placebo 134 or 1.5 mg/kg of lidocain删除6:<u>e.</u>dditional studies 283–287 documented consistent improvement in termination of arrhythmias when amiodarone was given to humans or animals with VF or hemodynamically unstable VT. A higher incidence of bradycardia and hypotension was reported for amiodarone in one out-of-hospital stud删除6:<u>y.</u> canine study 288 noted that administration of a vasoconstrictor before amiodarone prevented hypotension. The adverse hemodynamic effects of the IV formulation of amiodarone are attributed to vasoactive solvents (polysorbate 80 and benzyl alcohol). When administered in the absence of these solvents, an analysis of the combined data of 4 prospective clinical trials of patients with VT (some hemodynamically unstable) showed that amiodarone produced no more hypotension than lidocain删除6:<u>e.</u> formulation of IV amiodarone without these vasoactive solvents was approved for use in the United States.\n\n【12】Amiodarone may be considered for VF or pulseless VT unresponsive to CPR, defibrillation, and a vasopressor therapy (Class IIb, LOE B). An initial dose of 300 mg IV/IO can be followed by 1 dose of 150 mg IV/IO. Although anecdotally administered IO without known adverse effects, there is limited experience with amiodarone given by this route.\n\n【13】A number of doses of magnesium sulfate have been used clinically, and an optimal dosing regimen has not been established. When VF/pulseless VT cardiac arrest is associated with torsades de pointes, providers may administer an IV/IO bolus of magnesium sulfate at a dose of 1 to 2 g diluted in 10 mL D 5 W (Class IIb, LOE C). See Part 8.3: \"Management of Symptomatic Bradycardia and Tachycardia\" for additional information about management of torsades de pointes not associated with cardiac arrest.\n\n【14】Three RCTs 292–294 did not identify a significant benefit from use of magnesium compared with placebo among patients with VF arrest in the prehospital, intensive care unit, and emergency department setting, respectively. Thus, routine administration of magnesium sulfate in cardiac arrest is not recommended (Class III, LOE A) unless torsades de pointes is present.\n\n【15】Atropine sulfate reverses cholinergic-mediated decreases in heart rate and atrioventricular nodal conduction. No prospective controlled clinical trials have examined the use of atropine in asystole or bradycardic PEA cardiac arrest.\n\n【16】Lower-level clinical studies provide conflicting evidence of the benefit of routine use of atropine in cardiac arres删除6:<u>t.</u>here is no evidence that atropine has detrimental effects during bradycardic or asystolic cardiac arrest. Available evidence suggests that routine use of atropine during PEA or asystole is unlikely to have a therapeutic benefit (Class IIb, LOE B). For this reason atropine has been removed from the cardiac arrest algorithm.\n\n【17】A retrospective review 289 demonstrated an association between improved hospital admission rates and use of lidocaine (compared with standard treatment) in patients with out-of-hospital VF cardiac arrest. But there is inadequate evidence to recommend the use of lidocaine in patients who have refractory VT/VF, defined as VT/VF not terminated by defibrillation or that continues to recur after defibrillation during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest or inhospital cardiac arrest.\n\n【18】Lidocaine is an alternative antiarrhythmic of long-standing and widespread familiarity with fewer immediate side effects\n\n【19】Tissue acidosis and resulting acidemia during cardiac arrest and resuscitation are dynamic processes resulting from no blood flow during arrest and low blood flow during CPR.\n\n【20】These processes are affected by the duration of cardiac arrest, level of blood flow, and arterial oxygen content during CPR.\n\n【21】Restoration of oxygen content with appropriate ventilation with oxygen, support of some tissue perfusion and some cardiac output with high-quality chest compressions, then rapid ROSC are the mainstays of restoring acid-base balance during cardiac arrest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "Antiarrhythmics", "bbox": [60.0, 171.0, 165.0, 186.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [59.0, 170.0, 164.0, 185.0], "position": 3}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Magnesium Sulfate", "bbox": [404.0, 204.0, 511.0, 218.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [403.0, 203.0, 510.0, 217.0], "position": 4}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Amiodarone", "bbox": [60.0, 287.0, 129.0, 301.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [59.0, 286.0, 128.0, 300.0], "position": 5}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Interventions Not Recommended for Routine Use", "bbox": [404.0, 575.0, 710.0, 589.0]}, {"text": "During Cardiac Arrest", "bbox": [404.0, 591.0, 547.0, 605.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [403.0, 573.0, 709.0, 604.0], "position": 6}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Atropine", "bbox": [404.0, 612.0, 453.0, 625.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [403.0, 611.0, 452.0, 624.0], "position": 7}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Lidocaine", "bbox": [60.0, 803.0, 116.0, 816.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [59.0, 802.0, 115.0, 815.0], "position": 8}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Sodium Bicarbonate", "bbox": [404.0, 823.0, 516.0, 836.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [403.0, 822.0, 515.0, 834.0], "position": 9}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "than may be encountered with other antiarrhythmics.

Nadkarni; Mary Fran Hazinski the unanticipated event in the out-of-hospital setting to anticipated arrests in the intensive care unit. Outcome from cardiac arrest is a function of many factors including the willingness of bystanders to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), the ability of rescuers to integrate knowledge and psychomotor skills, the quality of performance delivered by individual rescuers and teams, and the efficiency and effectiveness of post–cardiac arrest care.\n\n【2】The Chain of Survival is a metaphor used to organize and describe the integrated set of time-sensitive, coordinated actions necessary to maximize survival from cardiac arrest.\n\n【3】The use of evidence-based education and implementation strategies can optimize the links of that chain.\n\n【4】Strengthening the Chain of Survival in the prehospital setting requires focus on prevention and immediate recognition of cardiac arrest, increasing the likelihood of high-quality bystander CPR and early defibrillation, and improving regional systems of care. In the hospital setting, organized efforts targeting early identification and prevention of deterioration in patients at risk can decrease the incidence of cardiac arrest. The challenge for resuscitation programs is twofold: to ensure that providers acquire and maintain the necessary knowledge, skills, and team behavior to maximize resuscitation outcome; and to assist response systems in developing, implementing, and sustaining an evidence-based Chain of Survival.\n\n【5】Maximizing survival from cardiac arrest requires improvement in resuscitation education and the implementation of systems that support the delivery of high-quality resuscitation and postarrest care, including mechanisms to systematically evaluate resuscitation performance. Well-designed resuscitation education can encourage the delivery of high-quality CPR. In addition continuous quality improvement processes should close the feedback loop and narrow the gap between ideal and actual performance. Community- and hospitalbased resuscitation programs should systematically monitor cardiac arrests, the level of resuscitation care provided, and outcomes. The cycle of measurement, benchmarking, feed- back, and change provides fundamental information necessary to optimize resuscitation care and maximize survival.\n\n【6】This chapter reviews key educational issues that affect the quality of resuscitation performance and describes major implementation and team-related issues shown to improve outcomes. The information is organized into four major categories: willingness to perform CPR, educational design, improving resuscitation quality, and issues related to implementation and outcomes.\n\n【7】While important concepts identified in the 2010 International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) and American Heart Association (AHA) evidence evaluation process are applied below, 1.2 this document does not include all education, implementation, and team-related topics contained within the 2010 International Consensus on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiac Care Science With Treatment Recommendation删除2:<u> 1.2</u>\n\n【8】## Willingness To Perform\n\n【9】Without immediate initiation of CPR, most victims of cardiac arrest will die.

Under these circumstances, reconnection takes place along a wide equatorial belt, opening up nearly the entire outer boundary of the magnetosphere to the solar wind. For other orientations of the IMF, reconnection still happens, but it may be more localized in the higher latitudes, where the released energy mainly flows around the magnetosphere rather than into it.\n\n【2】The transfer of magnetic energy from the solar wind radi- cally alters the shape of the magnetosphere. When reconnection is initiated on the dayside magnetopause, the interconnected IMF and geomagnetic field lines are swept back by the solar wind over the earth's poles, pouring energy into the northern and southern lobes of the long magnetotail on the nightside.\n\n【3】As the lobes swell with the added magnetic energy, the plasma sheet that lies between them begins to thin. The process continues until the field lines of the northern and southern lobes, which have opposite directions, are pressed together and themselves reconnect.\n\n【4】This second reconnection releases the solar wind's magnet- ic field, enabling it to continue its flow through the solar system. At the same time, it allows the earth's magnetic field lines, which have been stretched tailward during the loading of the lobes, to snap back into their normal configuration. The abrupt movement of the field lines heats and accelerates the ions and electrons in the plasma sheet, injecting them into the inner part of the magnetosphere. Some of these particles, traveling along geomagnetic field lines, dive into the upper atmosphere above the earth's poles, stimulating auroral emissions at x-ray, ultraviolet, visible and radio wavelengths as they collide with oxygen atoms and nitrogen molecules. The entire sequence of events— from dayside reconnection to nightside reconnection to auroras—is known as a magnetospheric substorm.\n\n【5】In addition to transferring magnetic energy to the tail lobes, dayside reconnection also intensifies the electric field across the magnetotail. The stronger field, in turn, increases the flow of ions and electrons from the plasma sheet to the inner magnetosphere.\n\n【6】This flow feeds into the earth's ring current, which is carried by charged particles circling the planet above its equator at altitudes between 6,400 and 38,000 kilometers. During longer periods of dayside reconnection— which occur when the IMF's orientation remains consistently southward— the sustained enhancement\n\n【7】JAMES L.

He is a Fellow of the American Geophysical Union and current chairman of the Committee on Solar and Space Physics of the National Research Council.\n\n【9】of the earthward plasma flow greatly increases the number and energies of the charged particles in the ring current. An extended period of southward IMF can also lead to a rapid succession of substorms, each of which injects more particles toward the earth. The resulting growth in strength of the ring current is the classic hallmark of a full-fledged geomagnetic storm.\n\n【10】## Here Comes The Sun The Orientation Of The Imf Turns Southward Quite Fre-\n\n【11】quently, so magnetospheric substorms are fairly common: on average, they happen a few times every day and last for one to three hours. But major geomagnetic storms such as the Bastille Day event are much rarer. Although they can occur anytime during the 11-year solar cycle, they are most frequent in the solar maximum period.\n\n【12】Until the early 1990s, it was widely believed that solar flares triggered geomagnetic storms. Space and solar physicists, however, had been assembling evidence that pointed strongly to another culprit, and in 1993 John T. Gosling of Los Alamos National Laboratory wove the various threads of evidence together in an article in the Journal of Geophysical Research that challenged the \"solar flare myth.\" Gosling set forth a compelling argument for the central role of coronal mass ejections in setting off large geomagnetic storms. Scientists still do not know what causes these violent eruptions in the sun's corona, but the phenomenon most likely involves a reconfiguration of the magnetic field lines there. CMEs are often, but not always, associated with solar flares.\n\n【13】Not all CMEs cause geomagnetic storms. Most of the eruptions are not directed at the earth, and of those that are, only about one in six is \"geoeffective\"—strong enough to trigger a storm. The primary factor is the CME's speed relative to that of the solar wind. Only fast CMEs are geoeffective. Why?\n\n【14】When fast CMEs plow through the slower solar wind, they produce interplanetary shock waves, which are responsible for the high-energy particle showers and the severe deformations of the earth's magnetic field. Even more important, a fast-moving CME compresses the solar wind ahead of it, thereby increasing the strength of the magnetic field in the compressed region and in the front part of the CME itself. Moreover, this draping of the field around the CME tends to tilt the IMF more along the north-south direction, which causes a stronger reconnection when the IMF encounters the earth's magnetic field.\n\n【15】A weaker kind of geomagnetic storm occurs during the declining phase of the solar cycle and near the solar minimum period. These disturbances, which tend to recur in phase with the sun's 27-day rotational period, are set off by the interaction between fast solar winds emanating from holes in the corona and slower winds arising from the sun's equatorial streamer belt.\n\n【16】Although CMEs are not the primary cause of recurrent storms, they may contribute to their intensity.\n\n【17】With the launch of IMAGE last year, researchers finally had the means to obtain global views of the minute-by-minute progress of a large geomagnetic storm.

One study in children suggests that CPR with rescue breathing is preferable to chest compressions alone when the arrest is of noncardiac etiolog删除6:<u>y.</u>t is recommended that a 3:1 compression to ventilation ratio be used for neonatal resuscitation where compromise of ventilation is nearly always the primary cause, but rescuers should consider using higher ratios (eg, 15:2) if the arrest is believed to be of cardiac origin (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【2】Respirations, heart rate, and oxygenation should be reassessed periodically, and coordinated chest compressions and ventilations should continue until the spontaneous heart rate is ≥ 60 per minute (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【3】However, frequent interruptions of compressions should be avoided, as they will compromise artificial maintenance of systemic perfusion and maintenance of coronary blood flow (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【4】## Medications\n\n【5】Drugs are rarely indicated in resuscitation of the newly born infant. Bradycardia in the newborn infant is usually the result of inadequate lung inflation or profound hypoxemia, and establishing adequate ventilation is the most important step toward correcting it. However, if the heart rate remains < 60 per minute despite adequate ventilation (usually with endotracheal intubation) with 100% oxygen and chest compressions, administration of epinephrine or volume expansion, or both, may be indicated. Rarely, buffers, a narcotic antagonist, or vasopressors may be useful after resuscitation, but these are not recommended in the delivery room.\n\n【6】## Rate And Dose Of Epinephrine Administration\n\n【7】Epinephrine is recommended to be administered intravenously (Class IIb, LOE C). Past guidelines recommended that initial doses of epinephrine be given through an endotracheal tube because the dose can be administered more quickly than when an intravenous route must be established. However, animal studies that showed a positive effect of endotracheal epinephrine used considerably higher doses than are currently recommended, 83 . 84 and the one animal study that used currently recommended doses via endotracheal tube showed no effec删除6:<u>t.</u>iven the lack of supportive data for endotracheal epinephrine, the IV route should be used as soon as venous access is established (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【8】The recommended IV dose is 0.01 to 0.03 mg/kg per dose. Higher IV doses are not recommended because animal 86,87 and pediatric 88,89 studies show exaggerated hypertension, decreased myocardial function, and worse neurological function after administration of IV doses in the range of 0.1 mg/kg. If the endotracheal route is used, doses of 0.01 or 0.03 mg/kg will likely be ineffective.\n\n【9】Therefore, IV administration of 0.01 to 0.03 mg/kg per dose is the preferred route. While access is being obtained, administration of a higher dose (0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg) through the endotracheal tube may be considered, but the safety and efficacy of this practice have not been evaluated (Class IIb, LOE C). The concentration of epinephrine for either route should be 1:10,000 (0.1 mg/mL).\n\n【10】## Volume Expansion\n\n【11】Volume expansion should be considered when blood loss is known or suspected (pale skin, poor perfusion, weak pulse) and the baby's heart rate has not responded adequately to other resuscitative measures (Class IIb, LOE C删除6:<u>).</u>n isotonic crystalloid solution or blood is recommended for volume expansion in the delivery room (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【12】The recommended dose is 10 mL/kg, which may need to be repeated. When resuscitating premature infants, care should be taken to avoid giving volume expanders rapidly, because rapid infusions of large volumes have been associated with intraventricular hemorrhage (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【13】## Postresuscitation Care\n\n【14】Babies who require resuscitation are at risk for deterioration after their vital signs have returned to normal. Once adequate ventilation and circulation have been established, the infant should be maintained in, or transferred to an environment where close monitoring and anticipatory care can be provided.\n\n【15】## Naloxone\n\n【16】Administration of naloxone is not recommended as part of initial resuscitative efforts in the delivery room for newborns with respiratory depression. Heart rate and oxygenation should be restored by supporting ventilation.\n\n【17】## Glucose\n\n【18】Newborns with lower blood glucose levels are at increased risk for brain injury and adverse outcomes after a hypoxicischemic insult, although no specific glucose level associated with worse outcome has been identifie删除6:<u>d.</u>ncreased glucose levels after hypoxia or ischemia were not associated with adverse effects in a recent pediatric series93 or in animal studies, 94 and they may be protectiv删除6:<u>e.</u>owever, there are no randomized controlled trials that examine this question.

After cutting the cord and checking the afterbirth for gaps and tears that might indicate that a piece still remains inside the mother's uterus—where it could cause a potentially fatal infection—the doctor usually tosses it into a stainless-steel bucket with the rest of the medical waste bound for incineration.\n\n【3】But more and more physicians and parents are realizing the value of what they used to regard as merely birth's byproduct. Since 1988 hundreds of lives have been saved by the three ounces of blood contained in a typical placenta and umbilical cord. That blood is now known to be a rich source of so-called hematopoietic stem cells, the precursors of everything in the blood from infection-fighting white blood cells to the red blood cells that carry oxygen to the platelets that facilitate blood clotting after an injury.\n\n【4】The stem cells from a single placenta are sufficient to rebuild the blood and immune system of a child with leukemia, whose own white blood cells are abnormally dividing and must be killed by chemotherapy. In the past, physicians had to seek a living donor to provide such children with transplants of bone marrow, which also contains stem cells that produce blood and immune cells. Unfortu- nately, many people have died during the long search for a donor with a matching tissue type or from complications if the donated marrow did not match well. Cord blood, which can be stored, is more likely to provide a suitable match and less likely to cause complications, because its stem cells are immunologically different from and more tolerant than those in adult bone marrow.\n\n【5】The benefits of umbilical cord blood transplantation have been demonstrated most conclusively in leukemia, but the process has other uses. The stem cells in cord blood can help to restore normal red blood cells in people with sickle cell anemia and to reconstitute the immune system of infants born with severe combined immunodeficiency. Cord blood can also be used to treat fatal inherited enzyme deficiencies, such as Hurler's syndrome, which results in progressive neurological degeneration and death. In such cases, the stem cells in cord blood can give rise not only to normal red and white blood cells but also to supporting cells in the brain called microglia that can provide the crucial missing enzyme there.\n\n【6】Recognizing the apparent advantages of umbilical cord blood transplantation, a number of medical centers have established banks so that a mother can donate her baby's cord blood for use by a stranger in need. The New York Blood Center's Placental Blood Program, pioneered by Pablo Rubinstein, now has 13,000 banked donations and is the nation's largest pub- lic cord blood bank. The University of California at Los Angeles and Duke University also have umbilical cord blood storage programs, which are federally funded.\n\n【7】But like many new scientific discoveries, umbilical cord blood transplantation brings with it a set of ethical questions [ see box on next page ]. Who owns umbilical cord blood: both parents, the mother or the infant? What happens if a mother donates her baby's cord blood to a bank but the child later develops leukemia and needs it? The ethical questions are compounded by the advent of for-profit companies that collect and preserve a newborn's cord blood for possible use by the family later. Is it right for such companies to aggressively market their services—which can cost $1,500 for collection and $95 per year for storage— when the chance a child will ever need his or her cord blood ranges from 1 in 10,000 (according to the New York Blood Center) to 1 in 200,000 (according to the National Institutes of Health)?\n\n【8】## Founts Of Stem Cells\n\n【9】the first hint that umbilical cord blood could be clinically useful came in 1972, when Norman Ende of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey and his brother, Milton, a physician in Petersburg, Va., reported giving a 16-year-old leukemia patient an infusion of cord blood.

Caution is advised when considering limiting care or withdrawing life-sustaining therapy. Characteristics or test results that are predictive of poor outcome in post–cardiac arrest patients not treated with therapeutic hypothermia may not be as predictive of poor outcome after administration of therapeutic hypothermia.\n\n【2】Because of the growing need for transplant tissue and organs, all provider teams who treat postarrest patients should also plan and implement a system of tissue and organ donation that is timely, effective, and supportive of family members for the subset of patients in whom brain death is confirmed or for organ donation after cardiac arrest.\n\n【3】Resuscitation research is challenging. It must be scientifically rigorous while confronting ethical, regulatory, and public relations concerns that arise from the need to conduct such research with exception to informed consent. Regulatory requirements, community notification, and consultation requirements often impose expensive and time-consuming demands that may not only delay important research but also render it cost-prohibitive, with little significant evidence that these measures effectively address the concerns about research. 106 – 109\n\n【4】## Basic Life Support\n\n【5】BLS is the foundation for saving lives following cardiac arrest. Fundamental aspects of adult BLS include immediate recognition of sudden cardiac arrest and activation of the emergency response system, early performance of highquality CPR , and rapid defibrillation when appropriate. The 2010 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC contain several important changes but also have areas of continued emphasis based on evidence presented in prior years.\n\n【6】## Key Changes In The 2010 Aha Guidelines For Cpr And Ecc\n\n【7】• The BLS algorithm has been simplified, and \"Look, Listen and Feel\" has been removed from the algorithm. Performance of these steps is inconsistent and time consuming. For this reason the 2010 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC stress immediate activation of the emergency response system and starting chest compressions for any unresponsive adult victim with no breathing or no normal breathing (ie, only gasps).\n\n【8】• Encourage Hands-Only (compression only) CPR for the untrained lay rescuer. Hands-Only CPR is easier to perform by those with no training and can be more readily guided by dispatchers over the telephone.\n\n【9】Initiate chest compressions before giving rescue breaths (C- A-B rather than A-B-C ). Chest compressions can be started immediately, whereas positioning the head, attaining a seal for mouth-to-mouth rescue breathing, or obtaining or assembling a bag-mask device for rescue breathing all take time. Beginning CPR with 30 compressions rather than 2 ventilations leads to a shorter delay to first compression.\n\n【10】• There is an increased focus on methods to ensure that high-quality CPR is performed. Adequate chest compressions require that compressions be provided at the appropriate depth and rate, allowing complete recoil of the chest after each compression and an emphasis on minimizing any pauses in compressions and avoiding excessive ventilation.\n\n【11】Training should focus on ensuring that chest compressions are performed correctly. The recommended depth of compression for adult victims has increased from a depth of 1½ to 2 inches to a depth of at least 2 inches.\n\n【12】• Many tasks performed by healthcare providers during resuscitation attempts, such as chest compressions, airway management, rescue breathing, rhythm detection, shock delivery, and drug administration (if appropriate), can be performed concurrently by an integrated team of highly trained rescuers in appropriate settings. Some resuscitations start with a lone rescuer who calls for help, resulting in the arrival of additional team members. Healthcare provider training should focus on building the team as each member arrives or quickly delegating roles if multiple rescuers are present. As additional personnel arrive, responsibilities for tasks that would ordinarily be performed sequentially by fewer rescuers may now be delegated to a team of providers who should perform them simultaneously.\n\n【13】## Key Points Of Continued Emphasis For The 2010 Aha Guidelines For Cpr And Ecc\n\n【14】• Early recognition of sudden cardiac arrest in adults is based on assessing responsiveness and the absence of normal breathing. Victims of cardiac arrest may initially have gasping respirations or even appear to be having a seizure.\n\n【15】These atypical presentations may confuse a rescuer, causing a delay in calling for help or beginning CPR. Training should focus on alerting potential rescuers to the unusual presentations of sudden cardiac arrest.\n\n【16】Minimize interruptions in effective chest compressions until ROSC or termination of resuscitative efforts. Any unnecessary interruptions in chest compressions (including longer than necessary pauses for rescue breathing) decreases CPR effectiveness.\n\n【17】Minimize the importance of pulse checks by healthcare providers. Detection of a pulse can be difficult, and even highly trained healthcare providers often incorrectly assess the presence or absence of a pulse when blood pressure is abnormally low or absent.

Nail biting (onychophagia).\n\n【2】The incidence of nail biting is exceptionally high. Both sexes are equally affected but females worry more due to the esthetic problem so they seek help much more than males. Surveys show that close to 45% of children during puberty, around 25% of university students and more or less 10% of adults older than 35 years of age bite their nails compulsively. Generally the patients bite all their nails.\n\n【3】This habit does not cause occlusal problems because it only exerts pressure through the longitudinal axis of the tooth. But some authors believe that onychophagia interferes with the normal development of the face and can bring as a consequence, depending mainly on the frequency, intensity and of the predominance of the vertical growth component face, whose result in conjunc删除16:<u>¬ </u>tion with atypical deglutition is the triggering factor of anterior open bite.删除4:<u>  Fig. 23. Onychophagia is generally reflected i n all the nails of the hand.</u>\n\n【4】## Etiology\n\n【5】Some think that the etiology of this habit is the conse删除16:<u>¬ </u>quence of a behavior that was not conveniently finished at the appropriate time when the patient was 2 or 3 years old, when the child was sucking a finger or a thumb. It is also affirmed that at the moment in which the deglutition pattern changes, when the fist teeth appear, the impulse to bite is installed. In this period a more solid diet is required to compensate this impulse. One way to exercise mastica删除16:<u>¬ </u>tion is to offer the infant a steak so the infant can hold it and begin to bite and suck, even before the complete eruption of all the deciduous teeth. If this impulse is not satisfied, the child will seek things to chew, mainly the nails, so the onychophagia habit is installed.

The development of inhaled corticosteroid medicines in MDI and DPI forms has revolutionized the treatment of asthma and transformed the lives of countless asthmatics for the better. Steroids come in forms other than pills and inhalers. An allergic child with eczema may be treated with a steroid cream, for example. Similarly, ophthalmologists may prescribe steroid eye drops for specific conditions.

Anabolic steroids have been abused by some weight builders and athletes to help them \"bulk up\" and build muscle mass. Corticosteroids are completely different medicines from anabolic steroids and are used extensively in allergy and asthma management. Another reason you might think of steroids as dangerous is because they have to be taken exactly as directed. If your doctor instructs you to take tapering or decreasing doses daily, for example, then you should follow the physician's directions to the letter. There are at least two important reasons for you not to stop taking the pill form of corticosteroids abruptly. The first reason is that if prescribed for asthma treatment, there is a good chance that the asthma will flare anew if the steroid dosage is decreased all at once. The second reason applies in the scenario of an individual who requires steroids on a more long-term basis. Our bodies all produce a form of steroids that is required for health.

Through the regular use of meditation, it is within your grasp to create a sense of inner peace and have a clear mind.\n\n【2】## What Is Meditation?\n\n【3】A Good Way To Grasp the real essence of true meditation is to consider a lake. Think about how you can clearly see the bottom of the lake when the surface is still. However, when there are a lot of waves, you are unable to see much below the surface at all. This is the perfect analogy for the mind: when your mind is still, you are better able to experience inner calm.\n\n【4】## Where & When To Meditate\n\n【5】You are free to meditate wherever you are comfortable, but there are some considerations to bear in mind. If you choose to meditate indoors, pick a room that is warm, clutter-free, and away from distracting noises. If you go outside, find somewhere with as little activity as possible but where you are safe and able to relax fully. Meditation can be practiced at any time of day or night, but it is easier to train your mind if you are able to set a regular time slot.  MEDITATING TOGETHER You do not have to meditate alone.

Therefore, more women with congenital heart disease are surviving to have children, which translates into higher risk for a cardiac event during pregnancy.

After a pregnant woman receives an electric shock, the range of clinical presentations varies from the mother feeling only a strange sensation with no fetal effects to fetal death either immediately or a few days after the shock. Risk factors for adverse fetal outcomes include the magnitude of current and duration of contact. The greatest predictor of risk for adverse fetal outcome is if the current travels through the uterus, because amniotic fluid most likely transmits current in a manner similar to that transmitted via other body fluids, which could increase the risk of fetal death or burns.\n\n【11】Although there is a small risk of inducing fetal arrhythmias, cardioversion and defibrillation on the external chest are considered safe at all stages of pregnanc删除6:<u>y.</u>ome experts have raised concern that electric arcing may occur if fetal monitors are attached during defibrillation of a pregnant woman, but there is no evidence to support this.\n\n【12】Overall it is reasonable to assume that if the shock is delivered to the mother's thorax, there is very low to no risk of electric arcing to fetal monitors. If internal or external fetal monitors are attached during cardiac arrest in a pregnant woman, it is reasonable to remove them (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【13】Patients with magnesium toxicity present with cardiac effects ranging from ECG interval changes (prolonged PR, QRS and QT intervals) at magnesium levels of 2.5–5 mmol/L to AV nodal conduction block, bradycardia, hypotension and cardiac arrest at levels of 6–10 mmol/L. Neurological effects ranging from loss of tendon reflexes, sedation, severe muscular weakness, and respiratory depression are seen at levels of 4–5 mmol/L. Other signs of magnesium toxicity include gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea and vomiting), skin changes (flushing), and electrolyte/ fluid abnormalities (hypophosphatemia, hyperosmolar dehydration). Patients with renal failure and metabolic derangements can develop toxicity after relatively lower magnesium doses.\n\n【14】Iatrogenic overdose is possible in the pregnant woman who receives magnesium sulfate, particularly if the woman becomes oliguric.
