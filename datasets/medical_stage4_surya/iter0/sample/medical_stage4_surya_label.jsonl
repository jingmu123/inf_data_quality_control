This form of steel remains stainless, or does not rust, because of the interaction between its alloying elements and the environment.\n\n【7】Stainless steel contains iron, chromium, manganese, silicon, carbon and, in many cases, significant amounts of nickel and molybdenum. These elements react with oxygen from water and air to produce a very thin, stable film that consists of such corrosion products as metal oxides and hydroxides.\n\n【8】Chromium plays a dominant role in reacting with oxygen to form this film. In fact, all stainless steels by definition contain at least 10 percent chromium.\n\n【9】This stable film prevents additional corrosion by acting as a barrier that limits the access of oxygen and water to the underlying metal surface. Because the film forms so readily and tightly, even just a few atomic layers of the material reduce the rate of corrosion to very low levels. The film is much thinner than the wavelength of visible light, and so it is difficult to see without the aid of modern instruments. Thus, although the steel is in fact corroded at the atomic level, it appears stainless to the unaided eye. Common inexpensive steel, in contrast, reacts with oxygen from water to form a relatively unstable iron oxide/hydroxide film that continues to grow with time and exposure to water and air. As such, this film, otherwise known as rust, achieves sufficient thickness to be easily observable soon after exposure to water and air.\n\n【10】In summary, because it is sufficiently reactive to protect itself from further attack by forming a passive corrosion product layer, stainless steel does not rust.

PPCI also appears applicable in the setting of NSTEMI subjects in whom emergent revascularization may result in hemodynamic and electric stability. PPCI after ROSC in subjects with arrest of presumed ischemic cardiac etiology may be reasonable, even in the absence of a clearly defined STEMI (Class IIb, LOE B).\n\n【1】There is concern that the poor prognosis for out-of-hospital\n\n【2】 cardiac arrest will prove detrimental to the public perception and reputation of interventional programs dedicated to treating patients following ROSC because of poorer outcome that could adversely affect mortality data for PCI programs. As a result, the AHA policy statement strongly supports a mechanism to report PCI outcomes for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest separate from PCI outcomes following STEMI, as this will remove potential barriers for interventional cardiologists to actively participate in the care of this population. 216 In contrast to PCI, randomized control trials of acute reperfusion therapy using fibrinolytic agents have been performed in subjects with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest without a favorable outcome. 218,219 A 12-lead ECG should be performed as soon as possible after ROSC. Clinical findings of coma in patients prior to PCI are commonly present in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and should not be a contraindication to consider immediate angiography and PCI. It is reasonable to include cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography in standardized post–cardiac arrest protocols as part of an overall strategy to improve neurologically intact survival in this patient group (Class IIa, LOE B) and appropriate treatment of ACS or STEMI, including PCI or fibrinolysis, should be initiated regardless of coma (Class I, LOE B). Angiography and/or PCI need not preclude or delay other therapeutic strategies including therapeutic hypothermia (Class IIa, LOE B).\n\n【3】Cardiac angiography and PCI, when used as part of a\n\n【4】 standardized advanced post–cardiac arrest protocol, may result in improved survival to hospital discharge. 220 Acute coronary artery occlusion is frequent in survivors of out-ofhospital cardiac arrest. PCI is feasible following ROSC, and almost 50% of cardiac arrest survivors have an acute thrombotic occlusion, or culprit lesion, that is amenable to reperfusion. 217,221–235 In addition, successful PCI can result in\n\n【5】 improved cardiac ejection fraction and survival. 217 Cardiac catheterization alone (without PCI) has been associated with improved neurologically intact survival. 235 Although coronary artery occlusion after cardiac arrest is associated with ST elevation or LBBB, specific ECG findings may also be conspicuously absent. 217,235 Outcomes after angiography and PCI vary considerably depending on patient subsets. Survival in post–cardiac arrest patients with STEMI is as high as 70% to almost 100% with shorter durations of witnessed arrest due to VF. 221,223 A significant number of eventual survivors may initially be comatose before PCI. 221 A 12-lead ECG should be performed as soon as possible after ROSC (Class I, LOE A). Appropriate treatment of ACS or STEMI, including PCI or fibrinolysis, should be initiated regardless of coma (Class I, LOE B). Coma and the use of induced hypothermia are not contraindications or reasons to delay PCI or fibrinolysis.\n\n【6】## Pci Versus Fibrinolytic Therapy\n\n【7】\n For patients admitted to hospitals with PCI facilities, PPCI confers clinical benefit as compared to fibrinolysis (both in terms of death and reinfarction or stroke) for the majority of patients. 189.236 There is scant evidence for incremental benefit of PCI over fibrinolysis for specific subgroups such as post-CABG patients 235 or patients with renal failure. 238 PCI is the preferred reperfusion strategy in the STEMI patient who can arrive in the catheterization laboratory with ballon inflation within 90 minutes of initial hospital arrival. As a system goal, PCI should ideally be performed within 90 minutes of first medical contact. PCI should be performed by an experienced provider (an individual who performs > 75 PCI procedures per year) in a high-volume center (a laboratory that performs more than 200 PCI procedures per year, of which at least 36 are PCI for STEMI). High-risk STEMI patients, \"late presenters\" (ie, > 3 hours since the onset of STEMI symptoms), and individuals with contraindication to fibrinolysis are all candidates for PCI as well. And, of course, if the diagnosis of STEMI is in doubt, regardless of the reason, initial coronary angiography followed by PCI is the most appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic strategy.\n\n【8】Although PCI may offer an improved outcome over fibrinolysis, catheter-based techniques must be applied early without prolonged delay. If applied without delay by experienced providers, PCI provides improved outcome in the STEMI patient. As noted in the DANAMI-2 study, 239 PCI initiated within 3 hours of initial hospital arrival was superior to fibrinolysis. For patients admitted in hospital without PCI capabilities, there may be some benefit associated with transferring patients for PPCI versus on-site fibrinolytics in terms of reinfarction, stroke and a trend to a lower mortality in the PPCI group. 214.240 For patients with cardiogenic shock, early revascularization was associated with improved survival at six months, especially in patients younger than 75 years-of-age. 241 Transfer for PCI instead of more immediate fibrinolysis has shown the combined rate of death, nonfatal MI, and stroke to be reduced by 42% if the mean transfer to PCI time could be less than 80 to 122 minutes.\n\n【9】 Downloaded from http://circ.ahajournals.org/ by guest on September 4, 2011", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "PCI Following ROSC After Cardiac Arrest", "bbox": [60.0, 84.0, 293.0, 99.0]}, {"text": "Each year in the United States, 236 000 to 325 000 patients", "bbox": [60.0, 100.0, 376.0, 112.0]}, {"text": "experience out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, and the prognosis is", "bbox": [60.0, 114.0, 376.0, 127.0]}, {"text": "generally grim with a median survival to discharge rate of", "bbox": [60.0, 129.0, 376.0, 144.0]}, {"text": "only 8.4%. 215 Large variations in outcome have been ob-", "bbox": [60.0, 145.0, 375.0, 160.0]}, {"text": "served across EMS systems, and this has resulted in a call for", "bbox": [60.0, 160.0, 376.0, 174.0]}, {"text": "regionalization of care with a goal to optimize the utilization", "bbox": [60.0, 176.0, 376.0, 190.0]}, {"text": "of proven beneficial therapies and interventions. 216 Despite", "bbox": [60.0, 191.0, 376.0, 205.0]}, {"text": "the lack of data from RCTs in this situation, the performance", "bbox": [60.0, 207.0, 376.0, 220.0]}, {"text": "of PCI has been associated with favorable outcomes in this", "bbox": [60.0, 222.0, 376.0, 235.0]}, {"text": "setting and is supported by the observation that following", "bbox": [60.0, 237.0, 376.0, 252.0]}, {"text": "early angiography, half of the studied population is noted to", "bbox": [60.0, 253.0, 376.0, 267.0]}, {"text": "have an acute coronary occlusion. 217 The data are strongest", "bbox": [60.0, 267.0, 377.0, 282.0]}, {"text": "for patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to VF in", "bbox": [60.0, 283.0, 377.0, 298.0]}, {"text": "the setting of STEMI (or new or presumably new LBBB), and", "bbox": [60.0, 300.0, 376.0, 313.0]}, {"text": "emergent angiography with prompt recanalization of the", "bbox": [60.0, 314.0, 376.0, 329.0]}, {"text": "infarct-related artery is recommended (Class I, LOE B).

The surfaces of these layers frequently carry an electric charge, which might be able to attract organic molecules and hold them in place. Experiments later confirmed these speculations. In the late 1970s an Israeli research group demonstrated that amino acids can concentrate on clay surfaces and then link up into short chains that resemble biological proteins. These chemical reactions occurred when the investigators evaporated a water-based solution containing amino acids from a vessel containing clays—a situation not unlike the evaporation of a shallow pond or tidal pool with a muddy bottom.\n\n【1】More recently, separate research teams led by James P. Ferris of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and by Gustaf Arrhenius of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography demonstrated that clays and other layered minerals can attract and assemble a variety of organic molecules. In a tour de force series of experiments during the past decade, the team at Rensselaer found that clays can act as scaffolds for the building blocks of RNA, the molecule in living organisms that translates genetic instructions into proteins.\n\n【2】Once organic molecules had attached\n\n【3】 cules that would become biologically important. Recent experiments show, once again, that minerals may have played a central role in this task.\n\n【4】## Preferential Treatment\n\n【5】\n perhaps the most mysterious episode of selection left all living organisms with a strange predominance of one type of amino acid. Like many organic molecules, amino acids come in two forms.\n\n【6】Each version comprises the same types of atoms, but the two molecules are constructed as mirror images of each other.\n\n【7】The phenomenon is called chirality, but for simplicity's sake scientists refer to the two versions as \"left-handed\" (or \"L\") and \"right-handed\" (or \"D\"). Organic synthesis experiments like Miller's invariably produce 50–50 mixtures of L and D molecules, but the excess of lefthanded amino acids in living organisms is nearly 100 percent.\n\n【8】Researchers have proposed a dozen theories—from the mundane to the exotic—to account for this bizarre occurrence. Some astrophysicists have argued that the earth might have formed with an excess of L amino acids—a consequence of processes that took place in the cloud of dust and gas that became the solar system. The main problem with this theory\n\n【9】 feature of the physical environment selected one version over the other. To me, the most obvious candidates for this specialized physical environment are crystal faces whose surface structures are mirror images of each other [ see box on page 80 ]. Last spring I narrowed in on calcite, the common mineral that forms limestone and marble, in part because it often displays magnificent pairs of mirror-image faces. The chemical structure of calcite in many mollusk shells bonds strongly to amino acids. Knowing this, I began to suspect that calcite surfaces may feature chemical bonding sites that are ideally suited to only one type of amino acid or the other. With the help of my Carnegie colleague Timothy Filley (now at Purdue University) and Glenn Goodfriend of George Washington University, I ran more than 100 tests of this hypothesis.\n\n【10】Our experiments were simple in concept, although they required meticulous clean-room procedures to avoid contamination by the amino acids that exist everywhere in the environment. We immersed a well-formed, fist-size crystal of calcite into a 50–50 solution of aspartic acid, a common amino acid. After 24 hours we removed the crystal from this solution, washed it in water and carefully collected all the molecules that had ad-\n Crystal faces of certain minerals could have ACTIVELY SELECTED and concentrated molecules that were destined to become biologically important.\n\n【11】 themselves to a mineral scaffold, various types of complex molecules could have been forged.

HAZEN has explored the behavior of minerals under high pressure at the Carnegie Institution of Washington's Geophysical Laboratory since 1976. In the past five years he has designed many of his mineral experiments to mimic the high-pressure environments of deepsea hydrothermal vents. Rocks and minerals first piqued Hazen's curiosity as a child growing up in northern New Jersey, a region known for its unusual ore deposits. After receiving a doctorate in earth sciences at Harvard University in 1975 and spending a year at the University of Cambridge, he joined the staff at Carnegie. In 1990 Hazen took on a second position, as professor of earth science at George Mason University. He is also a part-time professional trumpeter and the author of numerous articles and books on science, education, history and music.\n\n【17】 hered to specific crystal faces. In one experiment after another we observed that calcite's \"left-handed\" faces selected L- amino acids, and vice versa, with excesses approaching 40 percent in some cases.\n\n【18】Curiously, calcite faces with finely terraced surfaces displayed the greatest selectivity. This outcome led us to speculate that these terraced edges might force the L and D amino acids to line up in neat rows on their respective faces.

The dedicated rescuer who provides manual abdominal compressions will compress the abdomen midway between the xiphoid and the umbilicus during the relaxation phase of chest compression. Hand position, depth, rhythm, and rate of abdominal compressions are similar to those for chest compressions and the force required is similar to that used to palpate the abdominal aorta.\n\n【7】In most reports, an endotracheal tube is placed before or shortly after initiation of IAC-CPR. IAC-CPR increases diastolic aortic pressure and venous return, resulting in improved coronary perfusion pressure and blood flow to other vital organs.\n\n【8】In 2 randomized in-hospital trials, IAC-CPR performed by trained rescuers improved short-term survival 17 and survival to hospital discharge 18 compared with conventional CPR for adult cardiac arrest. The data from these studies were combined in 2 positive meta-analyses. 19 . 20 However, 1 randomized controlled trial of adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest 21 did not show any survival advantage to IAC-CPR. Although there were no complications reported in adults,19 1 pediatric case report 22 documented traumatic pancreatitis following IAC-CPR.\n\n【9】IAC-CPR may be considered during in-hospital resuscita-\n\n【10】 When the patient cannot be placed in the supine position, it may be reasonable for rescuers to provide CPR with the patient in the prone position, particularly in hospitalized patients with an advanced airway in place (Class IIb, LOE C).34–37\n\n【11】 This section is new to the 2010 Guidelines and is based on the conclusions reached by the 2010 ILCOR evidence evaluation process. 38\n\n【12】 A precordial thump has been reported to convert ventricular tachyarrhythmias in 1 study with concurrent controls, 39 single-patient case reports, and small case series. 40–44 However, 2 larger case series found that the precordial thump was ineffective in 79 (98.8%) of 80 cases 45 and in 153 (98.7%) of 155 cases of malignant ventricular arrhythmias. 46 Case reports and case series 47 -49 have documented complications associated with precordial thump including sternal fracture, osteomyelitis, stroke, and triggering of malignant arrhythmias in adults and children.\n\n【13】The precordial thump should not be used for unwitnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (Class III, LOE C). The precordial thump may be considered for patients with witnessed, monitored, unstable ventricular tachycardia including pulseless VT if a defibrillator is not immediately ready for use (Class IIb, LOE C), but it should not delay CPR and shock delivery. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of the precordial thump for witnessed onset of asystole.\n\n【14】 tion when sufficient personnel trained in its use are available (Class IIb, LOE B). There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of IAC-CPR in the out-of-hospital setting or in children.\n\n【15】 Percussion (eg, fist) pacing refers to the use of regular, rhythmic and forceful percussion of the chest with the rescuer's fist in an attempt to pace the myocardium. There is little evidence supporting fist or percussion pacing in cardiac arrest based on 6 single-patient case reports 50 -55 and a moderate-sized case series. 56 There is insufficient evidence to recommend percussion pacing during typical attempted resuscitation from cardiac arrest.\n\n【16】## Cpr Devices\n\n【17】\n## Devices To Assist Ventilation\n\n【18】\n## Automatic And Mechanical Transport Ventilators\n\n【19】\n \"Cough\" CPR describes the use of forceful voluntary coughs every 1 to 3 seconds in conscious patients shortly after the onset of a witnessed nonperfusing cardiac rhythm in a controlled environment such as the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Coughing episodically increases the intrathoracic pressure and can generate systemic blood pressures higher than those usually generated by conventional chest compressions, 23.24 allowing patients to maintain consciousness 23–26 for a brief arrhythmic interval (up to 92 seconds documented in humans). 25 \"Cough\" CPR has been reported exclusively in awake,\n\n【20】 monitored patients (predominantly in the cardiac catheterization laboratory) when arrhythmic cardiac arrest can be anticipated, the patient remains conscious and can be instructed before and coached during the event, and cardiac activity can be promptly restored. 23–33 However, not all victims are able to produce hemodynamically effective coughs. 27 \"Cough\" CPR is not useful for unresponsive victims and should not be taught to lay rescuers. \"Cough\" CPR may be considered in settings such as the cardiac catheterization laboratory for conscious, supine, and monitored patients if the patient can be instructed and coached to cough forcefully every 1 to 3 seconds during the initial seconds of an arrhythmic cardiac arrest. It should not delay definitive treatment (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【21】 Automatic Transport Ventilators There are very few studies evaluating the use of automatic transport ventilators (ATVs) during attempted resuscitation in patients with endotracheal intubation. During prolonged resuscitation efforts, the use of an ATV (pneumatically powered and time- or pressure-cycled) may provide ventilation and oxygenation similar to that possible with the use of a manual resuscitation bag, while allowing the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) team to perform other tasks (Class IIb, LOE C 57 .58 ). Disadvantages of ATVs include the need for an oxygen source and a power source. Thus, providers should always have a bag-mask device available for manual backup.\n\n【22】 Downloaded from http://circ.ahajournals.org/ by guest on September 4, 2011", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "Prone CPR", "bbox": [404.0, 84.0, 477.0, 99.0]}], "type": "Section-header", "position": 3}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Interposed Abdominal Compression-CPR", "bbox": [60.0, 84.0, 316.0, 99.0]}], "type": "Section-header", "position": 4}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Precordial Thump", "bbox": [404.0, 195.0, 520.0, 210.0]}], "type": "Section-header", "position": 5}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Percussion Pacing", "bbox": [404.0, 568.0, 518.0, 583.0]}], "type": "Section-header", "position": 6}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "\"Cough\" CPR", "bbox": [60.0, 593.0, 150.0, 608.0]}], "type": "Section-header", "position": 7}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "The interposed abdominal compression (IAC)-CPR is a", "bbox": [60.0, 100.0, 377.0, 113.0]}, {"text": "3-rescuer technique (an abdominal compressor plus the chest", "bbox": [60.0, 115.0, 377.0, 128.0]}, {"text": "compressor and the rescuer providing ventilations) that in-", "bbox": [60.0, 130.0, 375.0, 144.0]}, {"text": "cludes conventional chest compressions combined with alter-", "bbox": [60.0, 146.0, 375.0, 159.0]}, {"text": "nating abdominal compressions.

Instead, the compressing rescuer gives continuous chest compressions at a rate of at least 100 per minute without pause for ventilation. The rescuer delivering ventilation provides about 1 breath every 6 to 8 seconds (8 to 10 breaths per minute). Two or more rescuers should rotate the compressor role approximately every 2 minutes to prevent compressor fatigue and deterioration in quality and rate of chest compressions.\n\n【5】If defibrillation successfully restores an organized rhythm (or there is other evidence of ROSC, such as an abrupt rise.\n\n【6】in P ETCO 2 or visible pulsations on an arterial waveform), check the child's pulse to determine if a perfusing rhythm is present.

Regardless of the cause, treat torsades de pointes with a rapid (over several minutes) IV infusion of magnesium sulfate (25 to 50 mg/kg; maximum single dose 2 g).\n\n【12】## Bradycardia\n\n【13】\n Box numbers in the text below refer to the corresponding boxes in the PALS Bradycardia Algorithm (see Figure 2).\n\n【14】This algorithm applies to the care of the infant or child with bradycardia and cardiorespiratory compromise, but a palpable pulse.

Therefore, more women with congenital heart disease are surviving to have children, which translates into higher risk for a cardiac event during pregnancy. In fact, illnesses related to congenital heart disease and pulmonary hypertension are the third most common cause of maternal cardiac deaths. 92\n\n【12】 Defibrillation should be performed at the recommended ACLS defibrillation doses (Class I, LOE C). 122 Although there are no studies documenting matemal or fetal complications with defibrillation, there are case reports 123 – 130 and case series 131 – 133 that describe potential harm to the fetus when an accidental electric shock (lightning, electric circuit) is delivered directly to the mother. After a pregnant woman receives an electric shock, the range of clinical presentations varies from the mother feeling only a strange sensation with no fetal effects to fetal death either immediately or a few days after the shock. Risk factors for adverse fetal outcomes include the magnitude of current and duration of contact. The greatest predictor of risk for adverse fetal outcome is if the current travels through the uterus, because amniotic fluid most likely transmits current in a manner similar to that transmitted via other body fluids, which could increase the risk of fetal death or burns.\n\n【13】Although there is a small risk of inducing fetal arrhythmias, cardioversion and defibrillation on the external chest are considered safe at all stages of pregnancy. 134 – 136 Some experts have raised concern that electric arcing may occur if fetal monitors are attached during defibrillation of a pregnant woman, but there is no evidence to support this.\n\n【14】Overall it is reasonable to assume that if the shock is delivered to the mother's thorax, there is very low to no risk of electric arcing to fetal monitors. If internal or external fetal monitors are attached during cardiac arrest in a pregnant woman, it is reasonable to remove them (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【15】 Patients with magnesium toxicity present with cardiac effects ranging from ECG interval changes (prolonged PR, QRS and QT intervals) at magnesium levels of 2.5–5 mmol/L to AV nodal conduction block, bradycardia, hypotension and cardiac arrest at levels of 6–10 mmol/L. Neurological effects ranging from loss of tendon reflexes, sedation, severe muscular weakness, and respiratory depression are seen at levels of 4–5 mmol/L. Other signs of magnesium toxicity include gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea and vomiting), skin changes (flushing), and electrolyte/ fluid abnormalities (hypophosphatemia, hyperosmolar dehydration). Patients with renal failure and metabolic derangements can develop toxicity after relatively lower magnesium doses.\n\n【16】Iatrogenic overdose is possible in the pregnant woman who receives magnesium sulfate, particularly if the woman becomes oliguric. Empirical calcium administration may be lifesaving in these cases. 141–143\n\n【17】 Preeclampsia/eclampsia develops after the 20th week of gestation and can produce severe hypertension and ultimately diffuse organ-system failure. If untreated, maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality may result.\n\n【18】 nonpregnant women can occur during pregnancy. Providers should be familiar with pregnancy-specific diseases and procedural complications and during resuscitation attempts should try to identify common and reversible causes of cardiac arrest in pregnancy. 92\n\n【19】 Successful use of fibrinolytics in pregnant women has been reported for massive, life-threatening PE 144 –146 and ischemic stroke. 147 Pregnant women in cardiac arrest with suspected PE should be treated in accordance with the ACLS guidelines (see Part 12.5: \"Cardiac Arrest Associated With Pulmonary Embolism\").\n\n【20】 Cardiac disease is the primary cause of maternal mortality, according to the 2003 to 2005 Confidential Enquiries into Maternal and Child Health report.92 For example, the number of deaths from cardiac disease was 2.27 per 100,000 pregnancies, whereas the number of deaths from thrombosis and thromboembolism was 1.94 per 100,000 pregnancies. 92 The number of cardiac deaths during pregnancy has increased steadily since 1991. The most common causes of maternal death from cardiac disease are myocardial infarction, followed by aortic dissection. 92 A study completed in California also found that the incidence of myocardial infarction in pregnancy increased throughout the 1990s. 137 In addition, a nationwide review of myocardial infarction in pregnancy in the United States found that the risk of myocardial infarction in pregnancy is 3 to 4 times that of nonpregnant women of reproductive age. 138 Women are deferring pregnancy to older ages, increasing the chance that they will have atherosclerotic heart disease. Because\n\n【21】 Clinicians have reported successful use of cardiopulmonary bypass for pregnant women with a life-threatening amniotic fluid embolism during labor and delivery. 148 The use of perimortem cesarean section has resulted in maternal and neonatal survival. 149\n\n【22】 Anesthesia-related maternal morbidity and mortality continue to be a major concern, which has led to development of specialized obstetric anesthesia techniques. 118 Cardiac arrest may result from spinal shock as a result of regional anesthesia. Induction of general anesthesia may lead to loss of airway control or pulmonary aspiration, and emergence from anesthesia can be associated with hypoventilation or airway obstruction, leading to cardiac arrest. 150–155\n\n【23】 Downloaded from http://circ.ahajournals.org/ by guest on September 4, 2011", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "Defibrillation", "bbox": [60.0, 155.0, 135.0, 169.0]}], "type": "Section-header", "position": 3}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Magnesium Sulfate Toxicity", "bbox": [404.0, 280.0, 557.0, 294.0]}], "type": "Section-header", "position": 4}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Preeclampsia/Eclampsia", "bbox": [404.0, 552.0, 536.0, 566.0]}], "type": "Section-header", "position": 5}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Treatment of Reversible Causes", "bbox": [60.0, 600.0, 258.0, 614.0]}, {"text": "The same reversible causes of cardiac arrest that occur in", "bbox": [60.0, 615.0, 377.0, 629.0]}], "type": "Section-header", "position": 6}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Life-Threatening Pulmonary Embolism (PE)", "bbox": [404.0, 636.0, 646.0, 650.0]}], "type": "Section-header", "position": 7}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Cardiac Disease", "bbox": [60.0, 717.0, 149.0, 730.0]}], "type": "Section-header", "position": 8}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Amniotic Fluid Embolism", "bbox": [404.0, 754.0, 545.0, 768.0]}], "type": "Section-header", "position": 9}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Anesthetic Complications", "bbox": [404.0, 855.0, 542.0, 869.0]}], "type": "Section-header", "position": 10}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "medications or doses should be altered during management of", "bbox": [60.0, 84.0, 376.0, 99.0]}, {"text": "cardiac arrest in pregnancy; therefore, current recommended", "bbox": [60.0, 100.0, 377.0, 113.0]}, {"text": "drug dosages for use in resuscitation of adults should also be", "bbox": [60.0, 115.0, 376.0, 129.0]}, {"text": "used in resuscitation of the pregnant patient.", "bbox": [60.0, 131.0, 282.0, 145.0]}], "type": "Text", "position": 11}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "fibrinolytics are relatively contraindicated in pregnancy, PCI is", "bbox": [403.0, 84.0, 720.0, 99.0]}, {"text": "the reperfusion strategy of choice for ST-elevation myocardial", "bbox": [403.0, 100.0, 720.0, 113.0]}, {"text": "infarction.", "bbox": [403.0, 115.0, 458.0, 129.0]}, {"text": "The number of babies born with congenital heart disease who", "bbox": [417.0, 131.0, 721.0, 145.0]}, {"text": "now survive to adulthood has increased exponentially over the", "bbox": [404.0, 147.0, 720.0, 160.0]}, {"text": "last 3 decades. 139,140 It is estimated that 85% of neonates born", "bbox": [404.0, 161.0, 721.0, 178.0]}, {"text": "with congenital heart disease will survive to adulthood.

Collins\n\n【8】\n arge quantum computers could in principle handle some of the toughest computing problems, such as factoring numbers to break encrypted messages—answering those questions in seconds instead of the centuries that today's computers would require. But quantum computers are extraordinarily difficult to build; they rely on exquisitely controlled interactions among fragile quantum states. Do they have to? Recently Ian A. Walmsley and his co-workers at the University of Rochester demonstrated that ordinary, classical light waves can perform as efficiently as one class of quantum computer.\n\n【9】The Rochester experiment searched a sorted 50-element database. An ordinary computer doing a binary search of such a database would need to query the database six times (enough to search 64 elements: 2 6 = 64). In 1997 Lov K. Grover of Bell Laboratories proved that a quantum computer only has to query once, no matter how large the database.\n\n【10】Walmsley's group used a light pulse in an interferometer, a device that gives light waves a choice of two paths to follow. Along one path, a diffraction grating splits the pulse apart into its broad range of frequencies, like white light through a prism. The 50 elements of the database correspond to 50 bands of that spectrum. The database itself is represented by an acousto-optic modulator through which the light passes. The modulator imprints a phase shift (that is, it moves the positions of the peaks and troughs of the light wave) on just one of the 50 bands. In essence, each band of the light \"looks at\" a different database entry (a different part of the modulator), and only one \"finds\" the target. When the pulse is recombined with light from the other arm of the in-\n\n【11】 terferometer, the phase-shifted band alone shines brightly into a spectrometer, which reads off the result. Only the wave nature of light, not its quantum features, is used.\n\n【12】The experiment is similar to established methods of optical signal processing that, for example, pass beams through holograms.\n\n【13】What's new is that it directly exemplifies a general result that Walmsley and his colleagues demonstrated theoretically late last year. \"For every machine that uses [only] quantum interference,\" Walmsley explains, \"there is an equivalent, equally efficient one that uses classical optical interference.\" Reading out a result on a quantum computer necessarily involves detection of particles, and the extra device components and computational steps for that process eliminate the quantum computer's advantage. According to Emanuel H. Knill of Los Alamos National Laboratory, that insight provides a new perspective \"on the relationship between computing with waves and quantum computing.\" The most powerful quantum algorithms, such as fast factoring, however, require an additional quantum feature: so-called entanglement of the states of many particles. Classical waves cannot emulate those algorithms efficiently, but light turns out to be well suited to such true quantum computation in another way. In theory, a full-power quantum computer can be built by sending individual photons through simple linear optical elements, such as beam splitters and phase shifters. Such an approach was proposed in 1997, but those early designs needed exponentially more optical elements as the number of qubits increased—utterly impractical for any but the smallest devices.\n\n【14】In January, Knill, his colleague Raymond Laflamme and Gerard J. Milburn of the University of Queensland in Australia exhibited a design whose circuit complexity would increase in linear proportion, not exponentially.\n\n【15】Unlike the Rochester experiment, this scheme relies on quantum effects of individual photons navigating paths through the device but avoids the need for nonlinear interactions between photons, something only readily achieved at very high intensities or with extraordinary equipment such as resonant cavities or light-slowing Bose-Einstein condensates.\n\n【16】 EORGE RETSE\n SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "Three levels of computational ability", "bbox": [50.0, 285.0, 204.0, 298.0]}, {"text": "are, from weakest to strongest:", "bbox": [70.0, 297.0, 203.0, 311.0]}], "type": "Text", "position": 3}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "■ Classical, bit-based computing of", "bbox": [53.0, 325.0, 204.0, 337.0]}, {"text": "today's digital machines", "bbox": [98.0, 338.0, 204.0, 350.0]}], "type": "Text", "position": 4}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "■ Classical light-wave computing,", "bbox": [60.0, 365.0, 202.0, 377.0]}, {"text": "which uses limited aspects of", "bbox": [76.0, 379.0, 204.0, 390.0]}, {"text": "quantum computing—namely,", "bbox": [74.0, 393.0, 203.0, 405.0]}, {"text": "its wave nature", "bbox": [136.0, 405.0, 204.0, 417.0]}], "type": "Text", "position": 5}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "= Quantum computing, which", "bbox": [78.0, 432.0, 204.0, 444.0]}, {"text": "uses entanglement of", "bbox": [108.0, 445.0, 204.0, 457.0]}, {"text": "quantum states as well as their", "bbox": [70.0, 459.0, 204.0, 470.0]}, {"text": "wave nature to speed", "bbox": [111.0, 473.0, 204.0, 484.0]}, {"text": "processing exponentially for", "bbox": [81.0, 485.0, 204.0, 497.0]}, {"text": "certain problems", "bbox": [129.0, 499.0, 204.0, 510.0]}], "type": "Text", "position": 6}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "LIGHT WAVES AT WORK can search", "bbox": [49.0, 571.0, 204.0, 583.0]}, {"text": "a database as efficiently as a", "bbox": [74.0, 585.0, 204.0, 597.0]}, {"text": "quantum computer.", "bbox": [115.0, 599.0, 203.0, 611.0]}, {"text": "1 Diffraction grating spreads the", "bbox": [61.0, 611.0, 204.0, 626.0]}, {"text": "pulse into its component spectrum,", "bbox": [48.0, 625.0, 203.0, 638.0]}, {"text": "bands of which correspond to", "bbox": [77.0, 639.0, 204.0, 651.0]}, {"text": "the 50 database elements.", "bbox": [84.0, 651.0, 203.0, 663.0]}, {"text": "2 The modulator shifts the phase", "bbox": [59.0, 665.0, 204.0, 676.0]}, {"text": "of one band, that of the target", "bbox": [72.0, 678.0, 204.0, 691.0]}, {"text": "database element. 3 Ordinary wave", "bbox": [48.0, 693.0, 204.0, 704.0]}, {"text": "interference cancels the unshifted", "bbox": [50.0, 706.0, 204.0, 718.0]}, {"text": "bands. 4 Spectrometer reads off", "bbox": [61.0, 719.0, 204.0, 731.0]}, {"text": "the remaining light—the", "bbox": [95.0, 733.0, 203.0, 745.0]}, {"text": "target element.", "bbox": [133.0, 747.0, 203.0, 758.0]}], "type": "Text", "position": 7}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Computing with Light", "bbox": [253.0, 54.0, 664.0, 103.0]}], "type": "Title", "position": 9}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "CLASSICAL WAVES FOR PSEUDO QUANTUM COMPUTING BY GRAHAM P.

What Is “Cough-Variant Asthma”?\n\n【3】\n Cough-variant asthma is a type of asthma with cough as the principal, and sometimes only, symptom. A person with cough-variant asthma experiences dry, generally nonproductive cough without wheezing or breathlessness (Table 15). The cough can be considered as a \"wheeze equivalent.\" It may be provoked by triggers such as cold air or viral upper respiratory tract infections. Like \"typical\" asthma, there may be a significant nocturnal component. Cough-variant asthma has been described in all age groups, from toddlers to\n\n【4】## Table 15 Cough-Variant Asthma\n\n【5】\n Important points about cough-variant asthma include: • Cough-variant asthma is a subclass, or variant of asthma.\n • Although individuals with asthma can experience cough as one symptom along with wheezing and breathlessness, individuals with the cough-variant form have only cough as a symptom, usually without wheezing or breathlessness.\n • The chest x-ray is normal.\n • Pulmonary function tests are normal.\n • Methacholine challenge testing is abnormal, or \"positive.\"\n • Corticosteroids, either inhaled or in pill form, are effective treatments and should be part of the treatment regimen.\n\n【6】• The response to oral corticosteroids can be dramatic, with marked improvement in as little as 24 hours.\n A person with dry cough for three weeks or more should be evalu- .\n\n【7】ated for possible cough-variant asthma, especially if the chest x-ray and pulmonary function tests are normal.\n • Other causes of chronic dry cough of three weeks duration or more with normal chest x-ray and spirometry include: (1) gastroesophageal reflux (GERD), (2) post-nasal drip or discharge, and (3) post-viral cough following a viral respiratory illness.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "sm101 tusneV bus notreatificeed) : emilisy", "bbox": [548.0, 42.0, 569.0, 308.0]}], "type": "Text", "position": 0}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "goal will be to prescribe the smallest oral corticosteroid", "bbox": [70.0, 70.0, 427.0, 87.0]}, {"text": "dose necessary for adequate control.

In this whimsical example, the male \nuser has chosen to appear in more formal clothing than he is wearing in reality. Software to achieve this transformation does not yet exist, but early examples of related visual filtering have already appeared\n\n【4】 Current prototypes use two overlapping projections of polarized images and require users to wear polarized glasses so that each image is seen by only one eye. This technique will be replaced in the future by \"autostereoscopic\" displays that channel images to each eye differentially without the need\n\n【5】 . . . TO THE RECEIVER Specific renderings of remote people and places are synthesized from the model as it is received to match the points of view of each eye of a user.  The whole process repeats many times a second to keep up with the user's head motion.\n\n【6】 All the depth maps 1 are combined into a single viewpointindependent sculptural model of the scene at a given moment. The process of combining the depth maps provides opportunities for removing spurious points and noise.\n\n【7】 An array of cameras views people and their surroundings from . . different angles.

This torque is placed to separate the apexes from the lingual cortical and to situate them in trabecular bone in order to ac¬ complish the intrusion movement. The arch loses its intrusion capacity because of the contact of the apexes with the lingual cortical and only a buccal movement will occur, so this arch will not serve its purpose. This radicle-buccal torque activation is essential for the intrusion movement.

These values respond to the application of 100 g of force for every cm 2 of root surface consider¬ ing that the surface that opposes the dental intrusion movement is the transversal surface of the root of the incisors (please refer to Space Closure in Orthodontics, chapter 3).

The adult sternum should be depressed at least 2 inches (5 cm) (Class IIa, LOE B 70 – 73 ), with chest compression and chest recoil/relaxation times approximately equal (Class IIb, LOE C 74 . 75 ). Allow the chest to completely recoil after each compression (Class IIa, LOE B 76 -80 ). In human studies of CPR in out-of-hospital 81 and in-hospital settings, 78–80 incomplete chest wall recoil was common, particularly when rescuers were fatigued. 78,81 Incomplete recoil during BLS CPR is associated with higher intrathoracic pressures and significantly decreased hemodynamics, including decreased coronary perfusion, cardiac index, myocardial blood flow, and cerebral perfusion. 76,82 Importantly, the incidence of incomplete chest wall recoil can be reduced during CPR by using electronic recording devices that provide real-time feedback. 80 Manikin studies suggest that lifting the heel of the hand slightly, but completely, off the chest can improve chest recoil. 77 , 81 The total number of chest compressions delivered to the victim is a function of the chest compression rate and the proportion of time that chest compressions are delivered without interruption. The compression rate refers to the speed of compressions, not the actual number of compressions delivered per minute. The actual number of chest compressions delivered per minute is determined by the rate of chest compressions and the number and duration of interruptions to open the airway, deliver rescue breaths, and allow AED analysis. 83.84 The number of chest compressions delivered per minute is an important determinant of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and neurologically intact survival. 6,85 One study of in-hospital cardiac arrest patients 85 showed that delivery of > 80 compressions/min was associated with ROSC. Extrapolation of data from an out-of-hospital observational study 6 showed improved survival to hospital discharge when at least 68 to 89 chest compressions per minute were delivered; the study also demonstrated that improved survival occurred with chest compression rates as high as 120/min. It is therefore reasonable for lay rescuers and healthcare providers to perform chest compressions for adults at a rate of at least 100 compressions per minute (Class IIa, LOE B).\n\n【2】The term \"duty cycle\" refers to the time spent compressing\n\n【3】 blood flow is determined partly by the duty cycle (reduced coronary perfusion is associated with a duty cycle of > 50%) and partly by how fully the chest is relaxed at the end of each compression. 86 Although duty cycles ranging between 20% and 50% can result in adequate coronary and cerebral perfusion,87–90 a duty cycle of 50% is recommended because it is easy to achieve with practice (Class IIb, LOE C 75 ).\n\n【4】In 2005 3 human observational studies 91 - 93 showed that interruptions of chest compressions were common, averaging 24% to 57% 85.91–93 of the total arrest time.\n\n【5】The preponderance of efficacy data 94 . 95 suggests that limiting the frequency and duration of interruptions in chest compressions may improve clinically meaningful outcomes in cardiac arrest patients. Data are now accumulating regarding the effectiveness of these interventions in \"the real world.\" 2.96 –102 Therefore, despite some data to the contrary, 103 it is reasonable for rescuers to minimize interruption of chest compressions for checking the pulse, analyzing rhythm, or performing other activities throughout the entire resuscitation, particularly in the period immediately before and after a shock is delivered (Class IIa, LOE B 94 -98 ).\n\n【6】Additional evidence of the importance of minimizing interruptions in chest compressions comes from nonrandomized studies suggesting that survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest may be improved by the initial EMS provider delivery of continuous chest compressions without initial assisted ventilations, 97.98 or by EMS providers using a higher compression-to-ventilation ratio (50:2). 96 Notably, in each of these studies, the airway was opened, oxygen insufflations were provided, and assisted ventilation was recommended at some point during the EMS resuscitation. Other EMS systems have noted significant improvement in survival from out-ofhospital arrest with use of compressions-plus-ventilations with emphases on improved quality of compressions and minimization of hands-off time. 2.99 At this time there is insufficient evidence to support the removal of ventilations from CPR provided by EMS professionals.\n\n【7】Rescuer fatigue may lead to inadequate compression rates or depth. 104–106 Significant fatigue and shallow compressions are common after 1 minute of CPR, although rescuers may not recognize that fatigue is present for ≥ 5 minutes. 105 When 2 or more rescuers are available it is reasonable to switch chest compressors approximately every 2 minutes (or after about 5 cycles of compressions and ventilations at a ratio of 30:2) to prevent decreases in the quality of compressions (Class IIa, LOE B). Consider switching compressors during any intervention associated with appropriate interruptions in chest compressions (eg, when an AED is delivering a shock).\n\n【8】Every effort should be made to accomplish this switch in < 5 seconds. If the 2 rescuers are positioned on either side of the patient, 1 rescuer will be ready and waiting to relieve the \"working compressor\" every 2 minutes.\n\n【9】Interruptions of chest compressions to palpate for a spontaneous pulse or to otherwise check for return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) can compromise vital organ perfusion. 2,94–99 Accordingly lay rescuers should not interrupt chest compressions to palpate pulses or check for ROSC (Class IIa, LOE C). In addition lay rescuers should continue\n\n【10】 the chest as a proportion of the time between the start of 1 cycle of compression and the start of the next.

Thomas E. Brown, manager of archival services at the Electronic and Special Media Records Services Division of the National Archives, says some Vietnam air combat databases were never transferred to the National Archives from the Department of Defense. \"I am certain that some databases related to air missions were destroyed,\" Brown adds. Although the National Archives had informal policies aimed at preserving electronic records as early as 1968, they were not officially enforced until years later.\n\n【1】Despite these setbacks, Stanley did find two useful tape databases at the National Archives that had been listed in the Rand index: the Combat Activities File had details about missions flown in Southeast Asia from October 1965 through December 1970, and the Southeast Asia Data-\n\n【2】 base documented missions flown between January 1970 and August 1975. These intact databases were created on IBM System 360 and System 370 mainframe computers using software called the National Military Command System Information Processing System 360 Formatted File System, or NIPS. Developed for the government by IBM in the 1960s, NIPS did what database software does: it created, structured, maintained and revised data files.\n\n【3】But the details of missions over Laos—on average, a planeload of bombs every eight minutes for nine years—were coded to save space because of the limited storage capacity of mainframes at the time. \"What you have is nested data,\" Brown explains.\n\n【4】\"You would have a fixed field with information about sorties and additional fields identifying each leg of the mission.\" Further hindering Stanley's attempt to understand the databases was the scant documentation of changes in database codes. \"Sometimes codes were reused and the data processors just assigned new val-\n\n【5】 ues to the codes,\" Brown says. \"These changes were not always incorporated into the systems manuals, and early versions of the manuals were not always saved.\" In the Southeast Asia Database, for example, the National Archives has a manual dated 1975, but it is uncertain whether the information applies to earlier years. So simple coded data included nested information, and the codes themselves may have variable meanings.\n\n【6】In 1994 Stanley landed a $10,000 grant from the Department of Defense to complete a feasibility study of the data, still unaware that it would eventually help UXO Lao save lives. He enlisted the aid of Management Support Technology, the government contractor that eventually employed Sheinkman in Laos, to decipher the databases. The contractor then sought the help of a former IBM programmer who worked on the original database.

Finally, the routine use of cricoid pressure during airway management of patients in cardiac arrest is no longer recommended.\n\n【3】There are several important changes in the 2010 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC regarding management of symptomatic arrhythmias. On the basis of new evidence of safety and potential efficacy, adenosine can now be considered for the diagnosis and treatment of stable undifferentiated wide-complex tachycardia when the rhythm is regular and the QRS waveform is monomorphic. For symptomatic or unstable bradycardia, intravenous (IV) infusion of chronotropic agents is now recommended as an equally effective alternative to external pacing when atropine is ineffective.\n\n【4】For 2010 a new circular AHA ACLS Cardiac Arrest Algorithm has been introduced as an alternative to the traditional box-and-line format. Both algorithms represent restructured and simplified formats that focus on interventions that have the greatest impact on outcome. To that end, emphasis has been placed on delivery of high-quality CPR with minimal interruptions and defibrillation of VF/pulseless VT.  Vascular access, drug delivery, and advanced airway placement, while still recommended, should not cause significant interruptions in chest compression or delay shocks. In addition, atropine is no longer recommended for routine use in the management of pulseless electrical activity (PEA)/asystole.\n\n【5】Real-time monitoring and optimization of CPR quality using either mechanical parameters (eg, monitoring of chest compression rate and depth, adequacy of chest wall relaxation, length and duration of pauses in compression and number and depth of ventilations delivered) or, when feasible, physiologic parameters (partial pressure of end-tidal CO 2 [ P ETCO 2 ], arterial pressure during the relaxation phase of chest compressions, or central venous oxygen saturation [Scv0,]) are encouraged. When quantitative waveform capnography is used for adults, guidelines now include recommendations for monitoring CPR quality and detecting ROSC based on P ETCO 2 values.\n\n【6】Finally the 2010 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC continue to recognize that ACLS does not end when a patient achieves ROSC. Guidelines for post–cardiac arrest management have been significantly expanded (see Part 9) and now include a new Early Post–Cardiac Arrest Treatment Algorithm.\n\n【7】## Post–Cardiac Arrest Care\n\n【8】\n The 2010 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC recognize the increased importance of systematic care and advancements in the multispecialty management of patients following ROSC and admission to the hospital that can affect neurologically intact survival. Part 9: \"Post–Cardiac Arrest Care\" recognizes the importance of bundled goal-oriented management and\n\n【9】 interventions to achieve optimal outcome in victims of cardiac arrest who are admitted to a hospital following ROSC.  We recommend that a comprehensive, structured, integrated, multidisciplinary system of care should be implemented in a consistent manner for the treatment of post– cardiac arrest patients.\n\n【10】Initial and later key objectives of post–cardiac arrest care include\n • Optimizing cardiopulmonary function and vital organ perfusion after ROSC • Transportation to an appropriate hospital or critical-care unit with a comprehensive post–cardiac arrest treatment system of care • Identification and intervention for acute coronary syndromes (ACS) • Temperature control to optimize neurologic recovery • Anticipation, treatment, and prevention of multiple organ dysfunction\n\n【11】 The primary goal of a bundled treatment strategy for the patient after cardiac arrest includes a consistently applied comprehensive therapeutic plan delivered in a multidisciplinary environment leading to the return of normal or near-normal functional status. Patients with suspected ACS should be triaged to a facility with reperfusion capabilities and a multidisciplinary team prepared to monitor patients for multi-organ dysfunction and initiate appropriate post–cardiac arrest therapy, including hypothermia. Prognostic assessment in the setting of hypothermia is changing, and experts qualified in neurologic assessment in this patient population and integration of prognostic tools are essential for patients, caregivers, and families and are reviewed in detail in Part 9.\n\n【12】As a guide to therapy, a new algorithm and a table of integrated goal therapy care were developed.\n\n【13】## Stabilization Of The Patient With Acs\n\n【14】\n The 2010 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC recommendations for the evaluation and management of ACS have been updated to define the scope of training for healthcare providers who treat patients with suspected or definite ACS within the first hours after onset of symptoms. Within this context several important strategies and components of care are defined and emphasized by these guidelines and include systems of care for patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), prehospital 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), triage to hospitals capable of performing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and comprehensive care for patients following cardiac arrest with confirmed STEMI or suspected ACS.\n\n【15】A well-organized approach to STEMI care requires inte-\n\n【16】 gration of community, EMS, physician, and hospital resources in a bundled STEMI system of care. An important and key component of STEMI systems of care is the performance of prehospital 12-lead ECGs with transmission or interpretation by EMS providers and advance notification of the receiving facility. Use of prehospital 12-lead ECGs has been recommended by the AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC since 2000 and has been documented to reduce time to\n\n【17】 Downloaded from http://circ.ahajournals.org/ by guest on September 4, 2011", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "essential bridge between BLS and long-term survival with good", "bbox": [60.0, 84.0, 376.0, 99.0]}, {"text": "neurologic function.", "bbox": [60.0, 100.0, 161.0, 113.0]}, {"text": "In terms of airway management the 2010 AHA Guidelines", "bbox": [73.0, 114.0, 376.0, 129.0]}, {"text": "for CPR and ECC have a major new Class I recommendation", "bbox": [60.0, 131.0, 376.0, 145.0]}, {"text": "for adults: use of quantitative waveform capnography for", "bbox": [60.0, 147.0, 376.0, 160.0]}, {"text": "confirmation and monitoring of endotracheal tube placement.", "bbox": [60.0, 162.0, 375.0, 175.0]}, {"text": "In addition, the use of supraglottic advanced airways contin-", "bbox": [60.0, 177.0, 375.0, 191.0]}, {"text": "ues to be supported as an alternative to endotracheal intuba-", "bbox": [60.0, 193.0, 375.0, 207.0]}, {"text": "tion for airway management during CPR.

Even that is a triumph— for us and for Smolin. The subject of this book is so highly abstract, and so far removed from ordinary experience, that an illusion of understanding is perhaps the best we can hope for.\n\n【6】Only a few hundred people in the world may understand the intricacies of loop quantum gravity, Smolin's particular line of research, and I will confess that I am not one of them. Nevertheless, I am grateful that he has taken the time from his science to write this engaging popularization, for, as he rightly supposes, there are many of us who want to think we know what's going on. It would be hard to imagine a better guide to this difficult subject.\n\n【7】The first half of the 20th century saw the invention of two highly successful the-\n\n【8】 ories for describing the world: quantum mechanics and general relativity (gravity).\n\n【9】Each theory reigns supreme in its domain of application: quantum theory on the scale of elementary particles, relativity on the cosmic scale. Only occasionally, as in discussions of black holes, do the two theories rub against each other.\n\n【10】The rubbing can be abrasive. Quantum theory radicalizes our assumptions about the relationship between observer and observed but pretty much buys into Newton's ideas of space and time. General relativity changes our notions of space and time but accepts Newton's view of observer and observed. This situation is deemed unacceptable by most physicists, and the race is on to find a unifying theory of quantum gravity, sometimes called a Theory of Everything.\n\n【11】Smolin describes the three most promising approaches to such a theory, all of\n\n【12】 PHILLIPS (above\n\n【13】 QUANTUM UNIVERSE doing its foamy thing.

Meditation helps calm the overactive mind, thereby reenergizing you, increasing your stamina, and improving your powers of concentration. Through the regular use of meditation, it is within your grasp to create a sense of inner peace and have a clear mind.\n\n【3】## What Is Meditation?\n\n【4】A Good Way To Grasp\n\n【5】\n the real essence of true meditation is to consider a lake. Think about how you can clearly see the bottom of the lake when the surface is still. However, when there are a lot of waves, you are unable to see much below the surface at all. This is the perfect analogy for the mind: when your mind is still, you are better able to experience inner calm.\n\n【6】## Where & When To Meditate\n\n【7】\n You are free to meditate wherever you are comfortable, but there are some considerations to bear in mind. If you choose to meditate indoors, pick a room that is warm, clutter-free, and away from distracting noises. If you go outside, find somewhere with as little activity as possible but where you are safe and able to relax fully. Meditation can be practiced at any time of day or night, but it is easier to train your mind if you are able to set a regular time slot.\n MEDITATING TOGETHER You do not have to meditate alone.

Similarly, the lower eyelid may sag. This exposes your eye to the environment making it more susceptible to damage, discomfort and visual impairment. The main aim of eye surgery is to reduce discomfort. The surgery is also very effective in preserving vision.\n\n【1】 As with any surgical procedure, there are certain risks associated with eye surgery. Remember, there are various other treatments, surgeries and therapies that are helpful for people suffering from Bell's palsy. You can discuss possible options with your doctor before making a final decision.\n\n【2】 I've come across many people who live a very happy life even though they decided against having any surgical corrections. It really depends on what makes you happy as a person. If you can live with the fact that you have a droopy eye, then more power to you. However, if you don't want to deal with a droopy eye for life, you may choose to go under the knife.\n\n【3】## Upper Eyelid Surgery\n\n【4】\n This surgery helps the upper lid cover more of the cornea and patients can close over 75% of their eye. Usually, it involves the surgical implantation of gold eyelid weights. The weights help the eyelid close with the help of gravity.\n\n【5】 Gold eyelid weights can be implanted in an outpatient procedure. You can go back home the very same day. Once gold weights are attached to the eyelid, you can close the eyelid immediately. Minor bruising and swelling of the area is quite common, but it goes away in a few weeks.\n\n【6】 There can be a slight bump on the eyelid where the weights are implanted. A qualified surgeon may place the gold implants in a place where they remain hidden. The reason gold weights are used is that the metal does not irritate a patient's skin. Gold weights are also safe to be used during an MRI.\n\n【7】 The risk of upper eyelid surgery is that it can be difficult to control the position of the upper lid. If the eyelid still remains high, a repeat surgery may be required. Sometimes the weight may be too heavy, which will be seen as a bulky mass through the upper eyelid. The use of heavy weights can also blur your vision.\n\n【8】## Lower Eyelid Surgery\n\n【9】\n Surgical correction of the lower eyelid is done to reduce watering and allow the", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "During Bell's palsy, the eyebrow may droop, and the upper eyelid may not close", "bbox": [93.0, 96.0, 723.0, 116.0]}, {"text": "completely.

Once the earth formed 4.5 billion years ago, asteroid impacts periodically shattered and sterilized the planet's surface for another half a billion years. And yet, within a few hundred million years of that hellish age, microscopic life appeared in abundance. Sometime in the interim, the first living entity must have been crafted from air, water and rock.\n\n【3】Of those three raw materials, the atmosphere and oceans\n\n【4】 have long enjoyed the starring roles in origins-of-life scenarios. But rocks, and the minerals of which they are made, have been called on only as bit players or simply as props.\n\n【5】Scientists are now realizing that such limited casting is a mistake. Indeed, a recent flurry of fascinating experiments is revealing that minerals play a crucial part in the basic chemical reactions from which life must have arisen.\n\n【6】The first act of life's origin story must have introduced collections of carbon-based molecules that could make copies of themselves. Achieving even this nascent step in evolution entailed a sequence of chemical transformations, each of which added a level of structure and complexity to a group of organic molecules. The most abundant carbon-based compounds available on the ancient earth were gases with only one atom of carbon per molecule, namely, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and methane. But the essential building blocks of living organisms—energy-rich sugars, membrane-forming lipids and complex amino acids—may include more than a dozen carbon atoms per molecule. Many of these molecules, in turn, must bond together to form chainlike polymers and other molecular arrays in order to accomplish life's chemical tasks. Linking small molecules into these complex, extended structures must have been\n\n【7】 especially difficult in the harsh conditions of the early earth, where intense ultraviolet radiation tended to break down clusters of molecules as quickly as they could form.\n\n【8】Carbon-based molecules needed protection and assistance to enact this drama. It turns out that minerals could have served at least five significant functions, from passive props to active players, in life-inducing chemical reactions.\n\n【9】Tiny compartments in mineral structures can shelter simple molecules, while mineral surfaces can provide the scaffolding on which those molecules assemble and grow. Beyond these sheltering and supportive functions, crystal faces of certain minerals can actively select particular molecules resembling those that were destined to become biologically important. The metallic ions in other minerals can jumpstart meaningful reactions like those that must have converted simple molecules into self-replicating entities. Most surprising, perhaps, are the recent indications that elements of dissolved minerals can be incorporated into biological molecules. In other words, minerals may not have merely helped biological molecules come together, they might have become part of life itself.\n\n【10】## Protection From The Elements\n\n【11】\n FOR THE BETTER PART of a century, following the 1859 publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species, a parade of scientists speculated on life's chemical origins.\n\n【12】Some even had the foresight to mention rocks and minerals in their inventive scenarios. But experimental evidence only sporadically buttressed these speculations.\n\n【13】One of the most famous experiments took place at the University of Chicago in 1953. That year chemist Harold C.\n\n【14】Urey's precocious graduate student Stanley L.

It is reasonable for laypersons and healthcare providers to compress the adult chest at a rate of at least 100 compressions per minute (Class IIa, LOE B) with a compression depth of at least 2 inches/5 cm (Class IIa, LOE B). Rescuers should allow complete recoil of the chest after each compression, to allow the heart to fill completely before the next compression (Class IIa, LOE B).\n\n【1】Rescuers should attempt to minimize the frequency and duration of interruptions in compressions to maximize the number of compressions delivered per minute (Class IIa, LOE B). A compression-ventilation ratio of 30:2 is recommended (Class IIa, LOE B).\n\n【2】## Rescue Breaths\n\n【3】\n A change in the 2010 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC is to recommend the initiation of compressions before ventilations. While no published human or animal evidence demonstrates that starting CPR with 30 compressions rather than 2 ventilations leads to improved outcomes, it is clear that blood flow depends on chest compressions. Therefore, delays in, and interruptions of, chest compressions should be minimized throughout the entire resuscitation. Moreover, chest compressions can be started almost immediately, while positioning the head, achieving a seal for mouth-to-mouth rescue breathing, and getting a bag-mask apparatus for rescue breathing all take time. Beginning CPR with 30 compressions rather than 2 ventilations leads to a shorter delay to first compression (Class IIb, LOE C). 52–54 Once chest compressions have been started, a trained\n\n【4】 rescuer should deliver rescue breaths by mouth-to-mouth or bag-mask to provide oxygenation and ventilation, as follows:\n • Deliver each rescue breath over 1 second (Class IIa, LOE C).\n\n【5】• Give a sufficient tidal volume to produce visible chest rise (Class IIa, LOE C). 55 • Use a compression to ventilation ratio of 30 chest compressions to 2 ventilations.\n\n【6】## Early Defibrillation With An Aed\n\n【7】\n After activating the emergency response system the lone rescuer should next retrieve an AED (if nearby and easily accessible) and then return to the victim to attach and use the AED. The rescuer should then provide high-quality CPR.\n\n【8】When 2 or more rescuers are present, one rescuer should begin chest compressions while a second rescuer activates the emergency response system and gets the AED (or a manual defibrillator in most hospitals) (Class IIa, LOE C). The AED should be used as rapidly as possible and both rescuers should provide CPR with chest compressions and ventilations.\n\n【9】## Defibrillation Sequence\n\n【10】\n • Turn the AED on.\n • Follow the AED prompts.\n\n【11】• Resume chest compressions immediately after the shock (minimize interruptions).\n\n【12】## Rescuer Specific Cpr Strategies: Putting It All Together\n\n【13】\n This section summarizes the sequence of CPR interventions that should be performed by 3 prototypical rescuers after they activate the emergency response system. The specific steps that rescuers should take (Hands-Only CPR, conventional CPR with rescue breathing, CPR and AED use) are determined by the rescuer's level of training.\n\n【14】## Untrained Lay Rescuer\n\n【15】\n If a bystander is not trained in CPR, then the bystander should provide Hands-Only (chest compression only) CPR, with an emphasis on \"push hard and fast,\" or follow the directions of the emergency medical dispatcher. The rescuer should continue Hands-Only CPR until an AED arrives and is ready for use or healthcare providers take over care of the victim (Class IIa, LOE B).\n\n【16】## Trained Lay Rescuer\n\n【17】\n All lay rescuers should, at a minimum, provide chest compressions for victims of cardiac arrest. In addition, if the trained lay rescuer is able to perform rescue breaths, he or she should add rescue breaths in a ratio of 30 compressions to 2 breaths. The rescuer should continue CPR until an AED arrives and is ready for use or EMS providers take over care of the victim (Class I, LOE B).\n\n【18】## Healthcare Provider\n\n【19】\n Optimally all healthcare providers should be trained in BLS.\n\n【20】In this trained population it is reasonable for both EMS and in-hospital professional rescuers to provide chest compressions and rescue breaths for cardiac arrest victims (Class IIa, LOE B). This should be performed in cycles of 30 compressions to 2 ventilations until an advanced airway is placed; then continuous chest compressions with ventilations at a rate of 1 breath every 6 to 8 seconds (8 to 10 ventilations per minute) should be performed. Care should be taken to minimize interruptions in chest compressions when placing, or ventilating with, an advanced airway. In addition, excessive ventilation should be avoided.\n\n【21】It is reasonable for healthcare providers to tailor the sequence of rescue actions to the most likely cause of arrest. For example, if a lone healthcare provider sees an adolescent suddenly collapse, the provider may assume that the victim has suffered a sudden cardiac arrest and call for help (phone 911 or the emergency response number), get an AED (if nearby), and return to the victim to attach and use the AED and then provide CPR. If a lone healthcare provider aids an adult drowning victim or a victim of foreign body airway obstruction who becomes unconscious, the healthcare provider may give about 5 cycles (approximately 2 minutes) of CPR before activating the emergency response system (Class IIa, LOE C).\n\n【22】## Adult Bls Skills\n\n【23】\n The sequence of BLS skills for the healthcare provider is depicted in the BLS Healthcare Provider Algorithm (see Figure 2).\n\n【24】## Recognition Of Arrest (Box 1)\n\n【25】\n The necessary first step in the treatment of cardiac arrest is immediate recognition. Bystanders may witness the sudden\n\n【26】 Downloaded from http://circ.ahajournals.org/ by guest on September 4, 2011", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "cardiac arrest should receive chest compressions (Class I,", "bbox": [71.0, 84.0, 376.0, 99.0]}, {"text": "LOE B). 47–51", "bbox": [71.0, 100.0, 142.0, 113.0]}], "type": "Text", "position": 3}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "• To provide effective chest compressions, push hard and", "bbox": [60.0, 116.0, 377.0, 131.0]}, {"text": "push fast.

{"seq_id": "9fa7d24b-0cad-4794-b325-ef35e3afe249", "title": null, "text": "【0】页码:259\n\n【1】## Simultaneous Actions\n\n【2】\n BLS (whether for a child or adult) is presented as a series of sequential events with the assumption that there is only one responder, but PALS usually takes place in an environment where many rescuers are rapidly mobilized and actions are performed simultaneously. The challenge is to organize the rescuers into an efficient team. Important considerations for the greatest chance of a successful resuscitation from cardiac arrest include the following:\n • Chest compressions should be immediately started by one rescuer, while a second rescuer prepares to start ventilations with a bag and mask. Ventilation is extremely important in pediatrics because of the large percentage of\n\n【3】 asphyxial arrests in which best results are obtained by a combination of chest compressions and ventilations. 8 Unfortunately ventilations are sometimes delayed because equipment (bag, mask, oxygen, airway) must be mobilized.\n\n【4】Chest compressions require only the hands of a willing\n rescuer. Therefore, start CPR with chest compressions immediately, while a second rescuer prepares to provide ventilations (Class I, LOE C).\n\n【5】• The effectiveness of PALS is dependent on high-quality CPR, which requires an adequate compression rate (at least 100 compressions/min), an adequate compression depth (at least one third of the AP diameter of the chest or approximately 1 ½ inches [4 cm] in infants and approximately 2 inches [5 cm] in children), allowing complete recoil of the chest after each compression, minimizing interruptions in compressions, and avoiding excessive ventilation. Reasons for not performing high-quality CPR include rescuer inat-\n\n【6】 tention to detail, rescuer fatigue, and long or frequent interruptions to secure the airway, check the heart rhythm, and move the patient. 22 Optimal chest compressions are best delivered with the victim on a firm surface. 23.24 • While one rescuer performs chest compressions and another performs ventilations, other rescuers should obtain a monitor/defibrillator, establish vascular access, and calculate and prepare the anticipated medications.\n\n【7】## Monitored Patients\n\n【8】\n Many in-hospital patients, especially if they are in an ICU, are monitored and some have an advanced airway and are receiving mechanical ventilation. If the patient has an indwelling arterial catheter, use the waveform as feedback to evaluate hand position and chest compression depth. A minor adjustment of hand position or depth of compression can significantly improve the amplitude of the arterial waveform, reflecting better chest compression-induced stroke volume.\n\n【9】The arterial waveform may also be useful in identification of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). If the patient's end-tidal CO 2 (P ETCO 2 ) is being monitored, it can be used to evaluate the quality of chest compressions; it can also provide an indication of ROSC (see below).\n\n【10】## Respiratory Failure\n\n【11】\n Respiratory failure is characterized by inadequate ventilation, insufficient oxygenation, or both. Anticipate respiratory failure if any of the following signs is present:\n • An increased respiratory rate, particularly with signs of distress (eg, increased respiratory effort including nasal flaring, retractions, seesaw breathing, or grunting) • An inadequate respiratory rate, effort, or chest excursion (eg, diminished breath sounds or gasping), especially if mental status is depressed • Cyanosis with abnormal breathing despite supplementary oxygen\n\n【12】## Shock\n\n【13】\n Shock results from inadequate blood flow and oxygen delivery to meet tissue metabolic demands. The most common type of shock in children is hypovolemic, including shock due to hemorrhage. Distributive, cardiogenic, and obstructive shock occur less frequently. Shock progresses over a continuum of severity, from a compensated to a decompensated state. Compensatory mechanisms include tachycardia and increased systemic vascular resistance (vasoconstriction) in an effort to maintain cardiac output and perfusion pressure respectively. Decompensation occurs when compensatory mechanisms fail and results in hypotensive shock.\n\n【14】Typical signs of compensated shock include\n • Tachycardia\n • Cool and pale distal extremities • Prolonged (> 2 seconds) capillary refill (despite warm ambient temperature) • Weak peripheral pulses compared with central pulses • Normal systolic blood pressure\n\n【15】 As compensatory mechanisms fail, signs of inadequate end-organ perfusion develop. In addition to the above, these signs include\n\n【16】 • Depressed mental status\n • Decreased urine output • Metabolic acidosis\n • Tachypnea\n • Weak central pulses • Deterioration in color (eg, mottling, see below)\n\n【17】 Decompensated shock is characterized by signs and symptoms consistent with inadequate delivery of oxygen to tissues (pallor, peripheral cyanosis, tachypnea, mottling of the skin, decreased urine output, metabolic acidosis, depressed mental status), weak or absent peripheral pulses, weak central pulses, and hypotension.\n\n【18】Learn to integrate the signs of shock because no single sign confirms the diagnosis. For example:\n • Capillary refill time alone is not a good indicator of circulatory volume, but a capillary refill time > 2 seconds is a useful indicator of moderate dehydration when combined with decreased urine output, absent tears, dry mucous membranes, and a generally ill appearance. Capillary refill time is influenced by ambient temperature, 25 site, and age and its interpretation can be influenced by lighting. 26 • Tachycardia is a common sign of shock, but it can also\n\n【19】 result from other causes, such as pain, anxiety, and fever.\n\n【20】 Downloaded from http://circ.ahajournals.org/ by guest on September 4, 2011", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "Simultaneous Actions", "bbox": [60.0, 84.0, 194.0, 99.0]}], "type": "Section-header", "position": 3}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "BLS (whether for a child or adult) is presented as a series of", "bbox": [60.0, 100.0, 376.0, 113.0]}, {"text": "sequential events with the assumption that there is only one", "bbox": [60.0, 115.0, 376.0, 129.0]}, {"text": "responder, but PALS usually takes place in an environment", "bbox": [60.0, 132.0, 376.0, 145.0]}, {"text": "where many rescuers are rapidly mobilized and actions are", "bbox": [60.0, 147.0, 376.0, 161.0]}, {"text": "performed simultaneously.

The drug is typically given only once because of its prolonged onset of action, but some studies have shown that repeat doses of 250 mcg or 500 mcg every 20 minutes may be beneficial. 17 A recent meta-analysis indicated a reduced number of hospital admissions associated with treatment with ipratropium bromide, particularly in patients with severe exacerbations. 18\n\n【11】 Oxygen Oxygen should be provided to all patients with severe asthma, even those with normal oxygenation. As noted above, successful treatment with β 2 -agonists may cause an initial decrease in oxygen saturation because the resultant bronchodilation can initially increase the ventilation-perfusion mismatch.\n\n【12】 When combined with nebulized β -adrenergic agents and corticosteroids, IV magnesium sulfate can moderately improve pulmonary function in patients with asthma. 19 Magnesium causes relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle independent of serum magnesium level, with only minor side effects (flushing, lightheadedness). A Cochrane meta-analysis of 7 studies concluded that IV magnesium sulfate improves pulmonary function and reduces hospital admissions, particularly for patients with the most severe exacerbations of asthma. 20 The use of nebulized magnesium sulfate as an adjunct to nebulized β -adrenergic agents has been reported in a small case series to improve FEV1 and Spo 2 , 21 although a prior meta-analysis demonstrated only a trend toward improved pulmonary function with nebulized magnesium. 22 For those with severe refractory asthma, providers may consider IV magnesium at the standard adult dose of 2 g administered over 20 minutes.\n\n【13】 Short-acting β -agonists provide rapid, dose-dependent bronchodilation with minimal side effects. Because the dose delivered depends on the patient's lung volume and inspiratory flow rate, the same dose can be used in most patients regardless of age or size. Studies have shown no difference in the effects of continuous versus intermittent administration of nebulized albuterol 8.9 ; however, continuous administration was more effective in a subset of patients with severe exacerbations of asthma. 8 A Cochrane meta-analysis showed no overall difference between the effects of albuterol delivered by metered-dose inhaler spacer or nebulizer. 10 If prior use of a metered-dose inhaler has not been effective, use of a nebulizer is reasonable.\n\n【14】Although albuterol is sometimes administered intravenously (IV) in severe asthma, a systematic review of 15 clinical trials found that IV β 2 -agonists, administered by either bolus or infusion, did not lead to significant improvements in any clinical outcome measure. 9 Levalbuterol is the R-isomer of albuterol. Comparisons with\n\n【15】 Epinephrine and terbutaline are adrenergic agents that can be given subcutaneously to patients with acute severe asthma. The dose of subcutaneous epinephrine (concentration 1:1000) is 0.01 mg/kg, divided into 3 doses of approximately 0.3 mg administered at 20-minute intervals. Although the nonselective adrenergic properties of epinephrine may cause an increase in heart rate, myocardial irritability, and increased oxygen demand, its use is well-tolerated, even in patients > 35 years of age. 23 Terbutaline is given in a subcutaneous dose of 0.25 mg, which can be repeated every 20 minutes for 3 doses. There is no evidence that subcutaneous epinephrine or terbutaline has advantages over inhaled β 2 -agonists. Epinephrine has been administered IV (initiated at 0.25 mcg/min to 1 mcg/min continuous infusion) in severe asthma; however, 1 retrospective investigation indicated a 4% incidence of serious side effects. There is no evidence of improved outcomes with IV epinephrine compared with selective inhaled β 2 -agonists. 24\n\n【16】 albuterol have produced mixed results, with some studies showing a slightly improved bronchodilator effect in the treatment of acute asthma in the ED. 11 There is no evidence that levalbuterol should be favored over albuterol.\n\n【17】One of the most common adjuncts used with β -agonist treatment, particularly in the first hours of treatment, include anticholinergic agents (see \"Adjunctive Therapies\" below for more detail). When combined with short-acting β -agonists, anticholinergic agents such as ipratropium can produce a clinically modest improvement in lung function compared with short-acting β -agonists alone. 12,13\n\n【18】 Systemic corticosteroids are the only treatment for the inflammatory component of asthma proven to be effective for acute asthma exacerbations. Because the antiinflammatory effects after administration may not be apparent for 6 to 12 hours, corticosteroids should be administered early. The early use of systemic steroids hastens the resolution of airflow obstruction and may reduce admission to the hospital. 14 Although there may be no difference in clinical effects between oral and IV formulations of corticosteroids, 15. 16 the IV route is preferable in patients with severe asthma. In adults a typical initial dose of methylprednisolone is 125 mg (dose range: 40 mg to 250 mg); a typical dose of dexamethasone is 10 mg.\n\n【19】 Ketamine is a parenteral, dissociative anesthetic with bronchodilatory properties that also can stimulate copious bronchial secretions.

{"seq_id": "9a23af8d-e6df-41b8-b451-015d66512bdb", "title": null, "text": "【0】页码:11\n dark matter. \"Previously, cosmology had been independent strands of thought,\" says cosmologist David Tytler of the University of California at San Diego. \"It can now go on to address the next level of detail.\" Although the big bang theory has long been supported by three observational pillars—cosmic microwave background radiation, abundance of light elements, and outward velocity of distant galaxies—these pillars uphold different aspects of the theory.\n\n【1】Only last year did observations of the first pillar reach the precision needed to cross-check the second one. Two balloon-borne telescopes, Boomerang and Maxima, measured the microwave background with a resolution of better than one degree, revealing smallscale fluctuations. Unlike the larger-scale fluctuations made famous by the COBE satellite a decade ago—which are scale-invariant, occurring with the same relative strength no matter their size—the small ones seem to be strongest on certain scales known as peaks.\n\n【2】The size and strength of these peaks allow cosmologists to get at the geometry of space and the density of matter. The thinking is that as the universe grew, density fluctuations that started off as scale-invariant developed into synchronized oscillations on ever increasing scales. The microwave background reveals how far this process had gotten when the cosmos was 400,000 years old. After that time, the oscillations started to subside as gravity pulled matter into bodies such as galaxies.\n\n【3】Boomerang's and Maxima's results were a case of good news and bad news. The instruments saw the largest of the expected peaks, demonstrating that the universe is geometrically flat, but they failed to see a second peak. That suggested the universe had much more ordinary matter than the element abundances could countenance.\n\n【4】To universal relief, the discrepancy has now disappeared. This past April a third telescope—the ground-based Degree Angular Scale Interferometer (DASI), run by John E.\n\n【5】Carlstrom and his group at the University of Chicago—detected the second peak. Meanwhile the Boomerang team realized that it had overestimated the pointing accuracy of its instrument, which had the effect of smudging the fine details in the images. When the team undid this bias and incorporated new data, the second peak popped out. Maxima's results for the second peak haven't changed, but its error bars encompass the other experiments' values anyway.\n\n【6】 GALAXY REDSHIFT SURVEY AND THE ANGLO-AUSTRALIAN OBSERVATORY\n\n【7】 Boomerang's revisions have left some cosmologists wondering what to believe, but observers respond that the agreement of independent techniques is grounds for confidence.\n\n【8】In any case, certainty should soon arrive on the wings of NASA's Microwave Anisotropy Probe and new ground-based instruments with still higher resolution.\n\n【9】Although some media accounts described the findings as \"confirmation\" of cosmic inflation and cold dark matter, that is not quite true. Geometric flatness and scale invariance were predicted long before inflation, based on very general principles. It is true that most alternatives to inflation are ruled out, having failed to foresee multiple peaks, but that is not the same as ruling inflation in. Similarly, it's hard to be sure that dark matter is real stuff rather than a theoretical artifact.\n\n【10】Direct evidence may not be far off, though. Already there are hints of a slight \"tilt\"—a deviation from exact scale invariance, as inflationary models predict—in the microwave background and, according to\n\n【11】 through a slice of space. Such maps are now extensive enough to correlate cosmic structures with the primordial fluctuations that seeded them.\n\n【12】 Rupert A. C. Croft of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, in the distribution of intergalactic gas clouds. As for dark matter, Arthur Kosowsky of Rutgers University says the relative strength of the peaks is the do-or-die test. Cold dark matter contributes to gravity but not to pressure, thereby accentuating the odd-numbered peaks (which represent the gravity-dominated part of the primordial oscillation cycle) at the expense of the even-numbered ones (the pressure-dominated part). If you squint at the current data, you might say that the third peak is indeed bigger. Fortunately, with observational precision improving at its present rate  , squinting will soon be unnecessary.\n\n【13】 Cosmic microwave background radiation Its spectrum indicates that hot plasma once filled the universe. Patchiness reveals that this primordial soup was slightly uneven.\n\n【14】 Element abundances Historically the most precise of the pillars, it confirms that nuclear reactions took place in a hot, expanding universe.\n\n【15】 Galaxy velocities The proportionality of distance and velocity shows that the cosmos is expanding.

The leader of a resuscitation attempt may need to adapt application of these recommendations to unique circumstances.\n\n【2】## New Developments In Resuscitation Science Since 2005\n\n【3】\n A universal compression-ventilation ratio of 30:2 performed by lone rescuers for victims of all ages was one of the most controversial topics discussed during the 2005 International Consensus Conference, and it was a major change in the 2005 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC. 11 In 2005 rates of survival to hospital discharge from witnessed out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation (VF) were low, averaging £6% worldwide with little improvement in the years immediately preceding the 2005 conference. 5 Two studies published just before the 2005 International Consensus Conference documented poor quality of CPR performed in both out-of-hospital and in-hospital resuscitations. 12,13 The changes in the compression-ventilation ratio and in the defibrillation sequence (from 3 stacked shocks to 1 shock followed by immediate CPR) were recommended to minimize interruptions in chest compressions. 11 – 13 There have been many developments in resuscitation science since 2005, and these are highlighted below.\n\n【4】## Emergency Medical Services Systems And Cpr Quality\n\n【5】\n Emergency medical services (EMS) systems and healthcare providers should identify and strengthen \"weak links\" in the Chain of Survival. There is evidence of considerable regional variation in the reported incidence and outcome from cardiac arrest within the United States. 5.14 This evidence supports the importance of accurately identifying each instance of treated cardiac arrest and measuring outcomes and suggests additional opportunities for improving survival rates in many communities.\n\n【6】Recent studies have demonstrated improved outcome from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, particularly from shockable rhythms, and have reaffirmed the importance of a stronger emphasis on compressions of adequate rate and depth, allowing complete chest recoil after each compression, minimizing interruptions in compressions and avoiding excessive ventilation. 15– 22 Implementation of new resuscitation guidelines has been shown to improve outcomes. 18,20–22 A means of expediting guidelines implementation (a process that may take from 18 months to 4 years 23 – 26 ) is needed. Impediments to implementation include delays in instruction (eg, time needed to produce new training materials and update instructors and providers), technology upgrades (eg, reprogramming AEDs), and decision making (eg, coordination with allied agencies\n\n【7】 and government regulators, medical direction, and participation in research).\n\n【8】## Documenting The Effects Of Cpr Performance By Lay Rescuers\n\n【9】\n During the past 5 years there has been an effort to simplify CPR recommendations and emphasize the fundamental importance of high-quality CPR.  Large observational studies from investigators in member countries of the Resuscitation Council of Asia (the newest member of ILCOR) 27 , 28 – 30 and other studies 31 , 32 have provided important information about the positive impact of bystander CPR on survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.\n\n【10】For most adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, bystander CPR with chest compression only (Hands-Only CPR) appears to achieve outcomes similar to those of conventional CPR (compressions with rescue breathing). 28 – 32 However, for children, conventional CPR is superior. 27\n\n【11】## Cpr Quality\n\n【12】\n Minimizing the interval between stopping chest compressions and delivering a shock (ie, minimizing the preshock pause) improves the chances of shock success 33 . 34 and patient survival. 33–35 Data downloaded from CPR-sensing and feedbackenabled defibrillators provide valuable information to resuscitation teams, which can improve CPR quality. 36 These data are driving major changes in the training of in-hospital resuscitation teams and out-of-hospital healthcare providers.\n\n【13】## In-Hospital Cpr Registries\n\n【14】\n The National Registry of CardioPulmonary Resuscitation (NRCPR) 37 and other large databases are providing new information about the epidemiology and outcomes of in-hospital resuscitation in adults and children. 8,38–44 Although observational in nature, registries provide valuable descriptive information to better characterize cardiac arrest and resuscitation outcomes as well as identify areas for further research.\n\n【15】## Deemphasis On Devices And Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support Drugs During Cardiac Arrest\n\n【16】\n At the time of the 2010 International Consensus Conference there were still insufficient data to demonstrate that any drugs or mechanical CPR devices improve long-term outcome after cardiac arrest. 45 Clearly further studies, adequately powered to detect clinically important outcome differences with these interventions, are needed.\n\n【17】## Importance Of Post–Cardiac Arrest Care\n\n【18】\n Organized post–cardiac arrest care with an emphasis on multidisciplinary programs that focus on optimizing hemodynamic, neurologic, and metabolic function (including therapeutic hypothermia) may improve survival to hospital discharge among victims who achieve ROSC following cardiac arrest either in- or out-of-hospital. 46–48 Although it is not yet possible to determine the individual effect of many of these therapies, when bundled as an integrated system of care, their deployment may well improve outcomes.\n\n【19】Therapeutic hypothermia is one intervention that has been shown to improve outcome for comatose adult victims of\n\n【20】 Downloaded from http://circ.ahajournals.org/ by guest on September 4, 2011", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "ous disclosure and management of potential conflicts of interest,", "bbox": [60.0, 84.0, 375.0, 99.0]}, {"text": "which are detailed in Part 2: \"Evidence Evaluation and Man-", "bbox": [60.0, 100.0, 375.0, 113.0]}, {"text": "agement of Potential and Perceived Conflicts of Interest.\"", "bbox": [60.0, 115.0, 347.0, 130.0]}, {"text": "The recommendations in the 2010 Guidelines confirm the", "bbox": [73.0, 132.0, 376.0, 145.0]}, {"text": "safety and effectiveness of many approaches, acknowledge", "bbox": [60.0, 147.0, 376.0, 161.0]}, {"text": "ineffectiveness of others, and introduce new treatments based", "bbox": [60.0, 163.0, 376.0, 176.0]}, {"text": "on intensive evidence evaluation and consensus of experts.", "bbox": [60.0, 178.0, 375.0, 193.0]}, {"text": "These new recommendations do not imply that care using", "bbox": [60.0, 194.0, 375.0, 207.0]}, {"text": "past guidelines is either unsafe or ineffective.

Moreover, in recent months two major semiconductor equipment manufacturers—ASML and Applied Materials—dropped plans to develop electron projection lithography, which uses parallel beams of electrons to print circuit patterns, another contender for the nextgeneration lithography that had been under development for years inside AT&T Bell Laboratories.\n\n【2】Despite its role as lead sponsor for EUV, Intel cannot claim credit for inventing it. In the late 1980s AT&T Bell Laboratories (now part of Lucent Technologies) and NTT Communications published separate papers on soft x-ray projection lithography. Two national laboratories—Sandia and Lawrence Livermore—expanded on this work using technologies from the Strategic Defense Initiative. Sandia fashioned an early lithography prototype using radiation from a laser-generated plasma, which had been involved before in testing the response of different materials to the high-energy pulses that satellites might sustain in scenarios postulated by \"Star Wars\" planners.\n\n【3】It has been understood for decades that the billion-dollar expense and overwhelming difficulties of producing chips with nanoscale circuitry would require that chipmakers such as IBM, Intel or (at one time) AT&T fund the early research of their equipment manufacturers. Bell Labs, which oversaw parallel efforts in five separate lithography technologies during the early 1990s, was enticed by the idea of short-wavelength radiation that did not require a synchrotron, the giant x-ray generators found in high-energy physics laboratories. The technical difficulties that beset x-ray lithography at the time led the Bell Labs researchers to change the name from soft x-rays to extreme ultraviolet lithography. Intel had\n\n【4】 joined AT&T and others in a cooperative research program with the national laboratories. But the actual day-to-day research was concentrated at Lawrence Livermore, Sandia and Bell Laboratories.\n\n【5】When Congress eliminated the program in 1996, pegging it as a form of corporate welfare, AT&T decided to get out. Intel then stepped in to salvage and carry on the work. \"Intel came to the realization [that] if they didn't put money into a couple of key technologies that would come into play in the 2000s, they were going to be in big trouble,\" says Richard R. Freeman, a professor of applied science at the University of Califor-\n\n【6】 nia at Davis, who headed lithography development at AT&T Bell Labs and later the EUV program at the national laboratories during the mid-1990s.\n\n【7】On paper, EUV was attractive. With a wavelength of 13 nanometers—almost one twentieth the wavelength being readied for use in commercial chipmaking five years ago—EUV could be extended until the physical challenges of making atomicscale chips rendered existing semiconductor technologies unworkable. And the technology used a machine tool that bears some resemblance to those deployed in existing fabrication facilities. Insiders at Intel were suspicious, though. \"People start-\n\n【8】## Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography\n\n【9】\n LUSTRATION BY SAMUEL VELAS", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "ography program, championed by IBM", "bbox": [45.0, 135.0, 261.0, 149.0]}, {"text": "for decades, that used x-ray radiation.", "bbox": [45.0, 151.0, 261.0, 164.0]}, {"text": "The program consumed hundreds of mil-", "bbox": [45.0, 166.0, 260.0, 181.0]}, {"text": "lions of dollars in expenditures by both", "bbox": [44.0, 183.0, 261.0, 197.0]}, {"text": "IBM and the Defense Advanced Research", "bbox": [45.0, 199.0, 261.0, 213.0]}, {"text": "Projects Agency—and some industry ob-", "bbox": [45.0, 215.0, 260.0, 229.0]}, {"text": "servers estimate that the sum exceeded $1", "bbox": [44.0, 231.0, 260.0, 245.0]}, {"text": "billion.

The process could have applications ranging from extremely precise measurements of properties of atoms to quantum computing.\n\n【1】Lene V. Hau's group at the Rowland Institute for Science in Cambridge, Mass., and at Harvard University carries out these tricks in a tiny cloud of sodium atoms chilled to less than a microkelvin above absolute zero. The other group, led by Ronald L.\n\n【2】Walsworth and Mikhail D. Lukin of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, also in Cambridge, achieves much the same results in a four-centimeter-long cell of rubidium vapor almost as hot as boiling water. Both use the same two-step process to freeze the light.\n\n【3】First a laser sends a carefully tuned pulse of light into the gas.\n\n【4】Usually the gas would be as opaque as a brick wall to this \"signal\" light and would completely absorb it. In these slow-light experiments, however, a second \"control\" laser beam is irradiating the gas, making it transparent to the signal pulse. This effect, called electromagnetically induced transparency, was pioneered in the early 1990s by Stephen E.\n\n【5】Harris of Stanford University and others. The control light interacts with the atoms and by a process of quantum interference eliminates their ability to absorb photons of the signal pulse. The changes to the gas's optical properties also greatly slow down the speed of the signal pulse. Such slow light was demonstrated a couple of years ago by Hau and Harris and their colleagues.\n\n【6】Traveling through the gas in unison with the slow pulse is a pattern in the alignment of the atoms' tiny magnetic fields, which exactly mimics the form of the light pulse. The combination of atomic polarizations and light is called a polariton. Stopping this polariton—the second step of the process—is achieved by turning off the control beam while the polariton is still traversing the gas. As the control beam's intensity ebbs, the remaining signal light is absorbed, and the increasingly atomic polariton slows even more. At zero intensity, the last glimmer of the light vanishes into the atoms, and the polariton comes to a dead stop.\n\n【7】 All the properties of the light pulse remain encoded in this motionless entity. The experimenters demonstrated this by waiting for a while—only a fraction of a second but aeons on the timescale of the original light pulse— and then turning the control beam back on again. The polariton is converted back into a pulse that now crawls onward to the far end of the gas and then speeds away through the air.\n\n【8】Of course, the storage and regeneration of the light is not perfect; the longer the pause,\n\n【9】 ( orange ), is compressed and slowed in the artificially transparent\n\n【10】 atomic gas ( blue ). The pulse can be frozen in place as a magnetic\n\n【11】 pattern in the atoms and then regenerated.\n\n【12】 the more degraded the output pulse becomes.\n\n【13】The atoms that carry the polarizations are not, after all, frozen in place. Diffusion and collisions steadily disperse and destroy the polariton—more rapidly in the hot gas.\n\n【14】The process achieves a key function needed for large-scale quantum-information processing, as would occur in quantum computers: reliable interconversion of fast-moving quantum states (light pulses) and robust stationary ones (polaritons). Quantum-computing expert David P. DiVincenzo of IBM cautions, however, that other aspects of the slow-light system are not so well suited for quantum computation. \"It doesn't produce a straight shot to a quantum computer,\" he says. Nevertheless, he calls it \"beautiful research\" that is \"a very positive step forward in the manipulation of quantum systems.\"\n\n【15】 A 10-microsecond pulse of light is three kilometers long in air but is crammed into 0.3 millimeter inside the cold gas used in the experiment.\n\n【16】 The light pulse can be regenerated in compressed or stretched form—or in multiple copies—by varying how the \"read-out\" laser beam is applied.\n\n【17】 The cold gas experiment stores and revives entire pulses; the hot gas stores only parts of pulses.\n\n【18】 Longer storage times are achieved in the cold gas. Slightly coldergas—a Bose-Einstein condensate — should preserve pulses for even longer times.\n\n【19】 AGES BY LENEV.

Of the more than 250 employees surveyed about symptoms associated with carpal tunnel, such as tingling and numbness, only 10.5 percent met official clinical criteria for the syndrome, and nerve conduction tests confirmed the condition in only 3.5 percent. These numbers are consistent with previous data for the general population. The study, which appeared in the June 12 Neurology , suggests that symptoms assumed to indicate carpal tunnel syndrome may have numerous other explanations, such as pinched neck nerves.\n\n【11】-Steve Mirsky\n\n【12】## Hematology\n\n【13】\n## Sticky Situation\n\n【14】\n The great hope for curing sickle-cell disease—affecting one in about 650 African-Americans— remains gene therapy: it would correct the single mutation responsible for the misshapen red blood cells that adhere to blood vessels and impede proper blood flow. But research from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has revealed another important aspect of the disease—a protein largely responsible for the cellular stickiness. The protein, called thrombospondin, binds to red blood cells and provokes them into releasing molecules that increase the cells' tendency to stick to blood vessel walls. The revelation, which appeared in the June 15 Journal of Clinical Investigation , brings up the possibility of treating sickle-cell disease by interfering with thrombospondin and its effects.\n\n【15】—Steve Mirsky\n\n【16】## Health\n\n【17】\n## Fat Kills\n\n【18】\n Combating obesity in childhood could prevent up to four million cancer cases a year worldwide, said researchers at the 11th European Congress on Obesity, held in Vienna in May.\n\n【19】About 30 to 40 percent of all cancer cases stem from excessive weight. Obesity, which\n VARIETY may be the spice of life, but it's also fattening.\n\n【20】 can also cause heart disease and diabetes, leads to 300,000 deaths annually in the U.S., second only to the 400,000 who die from tobacco use. It also accounts for 5.5 to 7 percent of U.S. health care costs, more than double that of other developed countries, such as Australia (2 percent), France (2 percent) and Canada (2.4 percent). One cause is the variety of foods available, which keeps the taste buds from getting tired of the same food and makes overeating more likely. In reviewing 39 dietary studies, scientists from the University of Buffalo found that people offered different choices in multicourse meals ate 44 percent more than those who ate the same food for each course. The review appears in the May Psychological Bulletin.\n\n【21】—Philip Yam\n\n【22】 INNIS GALANTE Stone (top); LAWRENCE MANNING Corbis (bottom); ILLUSTRATION BY MATT COLLINS", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "YOUR TAXES AT WORK", "bbox": [34.0, 233.0, 204.0, 268.0]}], "type": "Section-header", "position": 1}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "In terms of science spending,", "bbox": [79.0, 277.0, 204.0, 288.0]}, {"text": "President George W.

Like a connect-the-dots flip book, the story emerges from the links, which shift over time. If that is so, modelers could face a big problem: for most biochemical systems, scientists don't know what reacts with what, and when.\n\n【10】John R. Koza, a computer scientist at Stanford University, recently conducted an experiment that may help biologists connect their genetic dots. Koza is a pioneer in genetic programming, a technique for evolving software by instructing the computer to generate random programs, mutate them repeatedly and then screen them to identify the ones that perform the desired task best. Nicely closing a circle of metaphor, Koza used genetic programming to re-create a small but complicated part of the E-Cell model, itself built from software to mimic genes.\n\n【11】Koza rigged his system to evolve programs that piece together known enzymes into chemical machinery that can convert fatty acid and glycerol to diacylglycerol.\n\n【12】Each variant program was converted, for the sake of convenience, to an equivalent electrical circuit, whose behavior was cal-\n\n【13】 can handle larger problems, perhaps one day even deducing the convoluted paths by which cells turn food into energy, growth and waste—but only in cases where biochemists have measured how cells process chemicals over time. Such data are still scarce.\n\n【14】The observation that many biochemical problems most likely have an optimal answer is exploited by Palsson and his colleagues in the models they have built of E. coli , Hemophilus influenzae and Helicobacter pylori , the germ found in stomach ulcers. They comb the literature to reconstruct as much of the biochemical networks as they can. \"Then we subject them to constraints that they must abide,\" Palsson explains. Mass must be conserved, for example. Electrical charges must balance. Thermodynamics makes many reactions irreversible. \"We try to home in on the range of solutions that are physically possible.\" Markus W. Covert, a graduate student\n\n【15】 mune system. He figures the effort will take a decade to complete, at $10 million a year. \"But when we have these sorts of models,\" Gilman predicts, \"it will be the most incredible drug discovery engine there ever was. You could model disease in that cell and then see what drug manipulation could do. Ultimately—though maybe not in 10 years—I have no doubt that there will be quantitative models of cell function, organ function and eventually whole-animal function.\" \"I would approach such a goal with a fair amount of humility,\" Bailey cautions.\n\n【16】\"History teaches us that simulations can help explore particular questions, but there won't be any master model that answers all questions. Eventually the models will become as complicated as the cell itself and as difficult to understand.\" Unless, perhaps, the next Kepler happens to be a computer wizard.\n\n【17】M\n\n【18】 W.

Although the precise number of trained volunteers needed to optimize the chance that a specific victim will receive CPR is not known, it is reasonable to assume that maximizing the number of people trained in a community and providing instructions and encouragement at the time an event occurs will improve the odds that a bystander will engage in resuscitation efforts.\n\n【12】 reduce willingness to undertake basic life support training or to perform CPR. However infection resulting from CPR performance is extremely rare and limited to a few case reports. 34–44 Educating the public about the low risks to the rescuer and victim may increase willingness to perform CPR.\n\n【13】Some rescuers, including healthcare providers, may be more likely to initiate CPR if they have access to barrier devices. Despite the low risk of infections, it is reasonable to teach rescuers about the use of barrier devices emphasizing that CPR should not be delayed for their use (Class IIa, LOE C).\n\n【14】Rescuers who are not willing to perform mouth-to-mouth ventilations may be willing to perform Hands-Only (chest compression-only) CPR 5.9.10.13.19.21.45–47 CPR training programs should teach compression-only CPR as an alternative to conventional CPR for rescuers when they are unwilling or unable to provide conventional CPR (Class I, LOE B).\n\n【15】 Evidence-based guidelines for instruction, as well as the development of cost-effective courses, are required to improve training of providers and ultimately improve resuscitation performance and patient outcomes.\n\n【16】 Victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who are gasping have a higher survival rate compared to victims who are not gasping. 48 Gasping is commonly misinterpreted as a sign of life that may prevent rescuers from initiating resuscitation.\n\n【17】Potential rescuers can be taught to recognize gasping and initiate CPR. 49 Rescuers should be taught to initiate CPR if the adult victim is unresponsive and is not breathing or not breathing normally (eg, only gasping) (Class I, LOE B).\n\n【18】Dispatcher telephone instructions and support has been shown to increase willingness to perform CPR. 16,50,51 In order to increase bystander willingness to perform CPR, dispatchers should provide telephone CPR instructions to callers reporting an adult who is unresponsive and not breathing or not breathing normally (ie, only gasping) (Class I, LOE B).\n\n【19】 The appropriate application of learning theories combined with research into program effectiveness has resulted in substantial changes to the AHA Emergency Cardiovascular Care (ECC) courses over the past quarter century. Since the development of the first ECC Guidelines in 1966, 81 the AHA has established itself as a leader in resuscitation science.\n\n【20】However, the AHA's involvement in resuscitation education and training programs predates the development of formal ECC guidelines. In 1973, the AHA first endorsed training of the lay public in CPR. 82 Subsequently, Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) was introduced in 1974,83.84 followed by Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) in 1988.85 In 2004 the AHA established the ECC Education Subcommittee with members including experts in curriculum and instructional design. Over time, the Education Subcommittee endorsed several educational principles as core concepts (see Table 1). Consistent with established methodologies for program evaluation,86 the effectiveness of resuscitation courses should be evaluated (Class I, LOE C). Although participant satisfaction is important, program evaluation should extend beyond this end point and assess learners' acquisition and retention of knowledge and skills. Evidence that learners integrate what they learn into actual practice and\n\n【21】 Correct performance of chest compressions is physically demanding. 52– 54 In the few reports of injuries to CPR providers, most of the injuries are musculoskeletal in nature. 55 – 59 Case reports have described occasional complaints of shortness of breath 60– 62 ; other isolated events 63. 64 ; hand puncture

As a result, many of the historical accounts of cannibalism have come to be viewed skeptically. In 1937 anthropologist Ashley Montagu stated that cannibalism was \"pure traveler's myth.\" In 1979 anthropologist William Arens\n\n【6】 of the State University of New York at Stony Brook extended this argument by reviewing the ethnographic record of cannibalism in his book The Man-Eating Myth . Arens concluded that accounts of cannibalism among people from the Aztec to the Maori to the Zulu were either false or inadequately documented.\n\n【7】His skeptical assertion has subsequently been seriously questioned, yet he nonetheless succeeded in identifying a significant gulf between these stories and evidence of cannibalism: \"Anthropology has not maintained the usual standards of documentation and intellectual rigor expected when other topics are being considered.\n\n【8】Instead, it has chosen uncritically to lend its support to the collective representations and thinly disguised prejudices of western culture about others.\" The anthropologists whom Arens and Montagu were criticizing had not limited themselves to commenting solely on contemporary peoples. Some had projected their prejudices even more deeply— into the archaeological record. Interpretations of cannibalism inevitably followed many discoveries of prehistoric remains.\n\n【9】Archaeological findings in Europe and elsewhere led to rampant speculation about cannibalism. And by 1871 American author Mark Twain had weighed in on the subject in an essay later published in Life as I Find It: \"Here is a pile of bones of primeval man and beast all mixed together, with no more damning evidence that the man ate the bears than that the bears ate the man—yet paleontology holds a coroner's inquest in the fifth geologic period on an 'unpleasantness' which transpired in the quaternary, and calmly lays it on the MAN , and then adds to it what purports to be evidence of CANNI- BALISM. I ask the candid reader, Does not this look like taking advantage of a gentleman who has been dead two million years. . . . . \"\n\n【10】 In the century after Twain's remarks, archaeologists and physical anthropologists described the hominids Australopithecus africanus, Homo erectus and H.\n\n【11】neanderthalensis as cannibalistic. According to some views, human prehistory from about three million years ago until very recently was rife with cannibalism.\n\n【12】In the early 1980s, however, an important critical assessment of these conclusions appeared. Archaeologist Lewis Binford's book Bones: Ancient Men and Modern Myths argued that claims for early hominid cannibalism were unsound.\n\n【13】He built on the work of other prehistorians concerned with the composition, context and modifications of Paleolithic bone assemblages. Binford emphasized the need to draw accurate inferences about past behaviors by grounding knowledge of the past on experiment and observation in the present. His influential work coupled skepticism with a plea for methodological rigor in studies of prehistoric cannibalism.\n\n【14】## Higher Standards Of Evidence\n\n【15】\n it would be helpful if we could turn to modern-day cannibals with our questions, but such opportunities have largely disappeared. So today's study of this intriguing behavior must be accomplished through a historical science. Archaeology has therefore become the primary means of investigating the existence and extent of human cannibalism.\n\n【16】One of the challenges facing archaeologists, however, is the amazing variety of ways in which people dispose of their dead. Bodies may be buried, burned, placed on scaffolding, set adrift, put in tree trunks or fed to scavengers. Bones may be disinterred, washed, painted, buried in bundles or scattered on stones.\n\n【17】In parts of Tibet, future archaeologists will have difficulty recognizing any mortuary practice at all. There most corpses are dismembered and fed to vultures and other carnivores. The bones are then collected, ground into powder, mixed with barley and flour and again fed to vultures. Given the various fates of bones and bodies, distinguishing cannibalism from other mortuary practices can be quite tricky.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "CRUSHING", "bbox": [22.0, 737.0, 97.0, 755.0]}], "type": "Section-header", "position": 1}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Many different types of damage can be", "bbox": [22.0, 760.0, 210.0, 775.0]}, {"text": "seen on  bones left by human cannibals.", "bbox": [22.0, 773.0, 215.0, 792.0]}, {"text": "When this damage is identical to that", "bbox": [22.0, 791.0, 203.0, 806.0]}, {"text": "seen on animal bones at the same sites,", "bbox": [22.0, 808.0, 217.0, 821.0]}, {"text": "archaeologists infer that the human", "bbox": [22.0, 823.0, 199.0, 838.0]}, {"text": "remains were processed in the same", "bbox": [22.0, 840.0, 201.0, 853.0]}, {"text": "manner and for the same reason: for", "bbox": [22.0, 855.0, 198.0, 869.0]}, {"text": "consumption.

I never received the recommended treatment in foster care. Additionally, being bullied at school took a toll on my social life. It was a frightening time for me because I felt like an outcast with only a few friends.

I too felt the same way at a young age, but things are different now. The love and support of my parents helped me overcome hurdles and lead a good life. Today, facial paralysis does not stop me from being 'myself.'\n\n【3】## Who Can Be Affected?\n\n【4】\n Bell's palsy is listed as a rare medical occurrence that only occurs in 1 in 5,000 people every year. It can strike anyone; either men or women aged between 15 and 45 years are more commonly affected.\n\n【5】 In the past, Bell's palsy was simply thought to be a case of unusual appearance.\n\n【6】Since viral infections may cause the condition, it is more likely to affect individuals with a compromised immune system.\n\n【7】 Bell's palsy sadly is also rated as the most common cause of one-sided facial muscle weakness in children. However, the majority of sufferers are adults.\n\n【8】 The severity of symptoms or recovery rate doesn't seem to vary a great deal across both genders. Neither does race nor ethnicity make a difference as far as being at risk is concerned. So the good news is that regardless of where your ancestors are from, you are not specifically more at risk to get Bell's palsy.\n\n【9】However, the flip side is that since the disease has no bounds, anyone can be affected by it.\n\n【10】## Are You At Risk?\n\n【11】\n About 40,000 people are affected with the disorder in the United States annually.\n\n【12】While Bell's palsy can happen at almost any age, studies have identified groups that are at higher risk for developing the condition.\n\n【13】 1.

{"seq_id": "ef4543d1-c85e-4035-8583-fe0d1b2bc36a", "title": null, "text": "【0】页码:251\n American College of Emergency Physicians 162 is available online (www.aap.org/advocacy/EIFTemp09.pdf).\n\n【1】## Advanced Directives\n\n【2】\n If a decision to limit or withhold resuscitative efforts is made, the physician must write an order clearly detailing the limits of any attempted resuscitation. A separate order must be written for the out-of-hospital setting. Regulations regarding out-of-hospital DNAR or AND directives vary from state to state.\n\n【3】When a child with a chronic or potentially lifethreatening condition is discharged from the hospital, parents, school nurses, and home healthcare providers should be informed about the reason for hospitalization, a summary of the hospital course, and how to recognize signs of deterioration. They should receive specific instructions about CPR and whom to contact. 161\n\n【4】## Ventilation With A Tracheostomy Or Stoma\n\n【5】\n Everyone involved with the care of a child with a tracheostomy (parents, school nurses, and home healthcare providers) should know how to assess patency of the airway, clear the airway, change the tracheostomy tube, and perform CPR using the artificial airway.\n\n【6】Use the tracheostomy tube for ventilation and verify adequacy of airway and ventilation by watching for chest expansion. If the tracheostomy tube does not allow effective ventilation even after suctioning, replace it. If you are still unable to achieve chest rise, remove the tracheostomy tube and attempt alternative ventilation methods, such as mouth-to-stoma ventilation or bag-mask ventilation through the nose and mouth (while you or someone else occludes the tracheal stoma).\n\n【7】## Trauma\n\n【8】\n The principles of BLS resuscitation for the injured child are the same as those for the ill child, but some aspects require emphasis.\n\n【9】The following are important aspects of resuscitation of pediatric victims of trauma:\n • Anticipate airway obstruction by dental fragments, blood, or other debris. Use a suction device if necessary.\n\n【10】• Stop all external bleeding with direct pressure.\n\n【11】• When the mechanism of injury is compatible with spinal injury, minimize motion of the cervical spine and movement of the head and neck.\n\n【12】• Professional rescuers should open and maintain the airway with a jaw thrust and try not to tilt the head. If a jaw thrust\n\n【13】 does not open the airway, use a head tilt–chin lift, because a patent airway is necessary. If there are 2 rescuers, 1 can manually restrict cervical spine motion while the other rescuer opens the airway.\n\n【14】To limit spine motion, secure at least the thighs, pelvis, and shoulders to the immobilization board. Because of the disproportionately large size of the head in infants and young children, optimal positioning may require recessing the occiput 163 or elevating the torso to avoid undesirable backboard-induced cervical flexion. 163,164 • If possible, transport children with potential for serious trauma to a trauma center with pediatric expertise.\n\n【15】## Drowning\n\n【16】\n Outcome after drowning is determined by the duration of submersion, the water temperature, and how promptly and effectively CPR is provided. 1,16,165 Neurologically intact survival has been reported after prolonged submersion in icy waters. 166 . 167 Start resuscitation by safely removing the victim from the water as rapidly as possible. If you have special training, start rescue breathing while the victim is still in the water168 if doing so will not delay removing the victim from the water. Do not attempt chest compressions in the water.\n\n【17】After removing the victim from the water start CPR if\n\n【18】 the victim is unresponsive and is not breathing. If you are alone, continue with 5 cycles (about 2 minutes) of compressions and ventilations before activating the emergency response system and getting an AED.

These include monitoring the time required for recognition and activation of the emergency response system, the quality of CPR delivered at the scene of cardiac arrest, other process-ofcare measures (eg, initial rhythm, bystander CPR, and response intervals), and patient outcome up to hospital discharge (see Part 4: \"Overview of CPR\").

Instead videotape recorders captured events in the dome for later processing.\n\n【1】Ruzena Bajcsy, head of the GRASP (General Robotics, Automation, Sensing and Perception) Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania, was intrigued by the idea of real-time seas of cameras.\n\n【2】Starting in 1994, she worked with colleagues at Chapel Hill and Carnegie Mellon on small-scale \"puddles\" of two or three cameras to gather real-world data for virtual-reality applications.\n\n【3】Bajcsy and her colleague Kostas Daniilidis took on the assignment of creating the first real-time sea of cameras—one that was, moreover, scalable and modular so that it could be adapted to a variety of rooms and uses. They worked closely with the Chapel Hill team, which was responsible for taking the \"animated sculpture\" data and using computer graphics techniques to turn it into a realistic scene for each user.\n\n【4】But a sea of cameras in itself isn't a complete solution. Suppose a sea of cameras is looking at a clean white wall. Because there are no surface features, the cameras have no information with which to build a sculptural model. A person can look at a white wall without being confused. Humans don't worry that a wall might actually be a passage to an infinitely deep white chasm, because we don't rely on geometric cues alone— we also have a model of a room in our minds that can rein in errant mental interpretations. Unfortunately, to today's digital cameras, a person's forehead or T-shirt can present the same challenge as a white wall, and today's software isn't smart enough to undo the confusion that results.\n\n【5】Researchers at Chapel Hill came up with a novel method that has shown promise for overcoming this obstacle, called \"imperceptible structured light,\" or ISL. Conventional lightbulbs flicker 50 or 60 times a second, fast enough for the flickering to be generally invisible to the human eye. Similarly, ISL appears to the human eye as a continuous source of white light, like an ordinary lightbulb, but in fact it is filled with quickly changing patterns visible only to specialized, care-\n\n【6】 fully synchronized cameras. These patterns fill in voids such as white walls with imposed features that allow a sea of cameras to complete the measurements.\n\n【7】## The Eureka Moment\n\n【8】\n we were able to demonstrate tele-immersion for the first time on May 9, 2000, virtually bringing together three locations. About a dozen dignitaries were physically at the telecubicle in Chapel Hill. There we and they took turns sitting down in the simulated office of tomorrow. As fascinating as the three years of research leading up to this demonstration had been for me, the delight of experiencing tele-immersion was unanticipated and incomparable. Seen through a pair of polarizing glasses, two walls of the cubicle dissolved into windows, revealing other offices with other people who were looking back at me. (The glasses helped to direct a slightly different view of the scenes to each eye, creating the stereo vision effect.) Through one wall I greeted Amela Sadagic, a researcher at my lab in Armonk, N.Y. Through the other wall was Jane Mulligan, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n【9】Unlike the cartoonish virtual worlds I had worked with for many years, the remote people and places I was seeing were clearly derived from reality. They were not perfect by any means. There was \"noise\" in the system that looked something like confetti being dropped in the other people's cubicles. The frame rate was low (2 to 3 fps), there was as much as one second of delay, and only one side of the conversation had access to a tele-immersive display.\n\n【10】Nevertheless, here was a virtual world that was not a simplistic artistic representation of the real world but rather an authentic measurement-based rendition of it.\n\n【11】In a later demo (in October 2000) most of the confetti was\n\n【12】 COMPARISON OF TWO VIEWS of a person taken by the tele-immersion cameras yields this image. The colors represent the first rough calculation of the depth of the person's features.\n\n【13】 gone and the overall quality and speed of the system had increased, but the most important improvement came from researchers at Brown University led by Andries van Dam. They arrived in a tele-immersive session bearing virtual objects not derived from the physical scene. I sat across the table from Robert C. Zeleznik of Brown, who was physically at my lab in Armonk. He presented a simulated miniature office interior (about two feet wide) resting on the desk between us, and we used simulated laser pointers and other devices to modify walls and furniture in it collaboratively while we talked. This was a remarkable blending of the experience of using simulations associated with virtual reality and simply being with another person.\n\n【14】## When Can I Use It?\n\n【15】\n BEYOND THE SCENE-CAPTURE system, the principal components of a tele-immersion setup are the computers, the network services, and the display and interaction devices. Each of these components has been advanced in the cause of teleimmersion and must advance further.\n\n【16】Tele-immersion is a voracious consumer of computer resources. We've chosen to work with \"commodity\" computer components (those that are also used in common home and office products) wherever\n SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN\n\n【17】 COURTESY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "was not a real-time device, it could not be", "bbox": [63.0, 86.0, 280.0, 101.0]}, {"text": "used for tele-immersion.

In 1960 Kouwenhoven, Knickerbocker, and Jude documented 14 patients who survived cardiac arrest with the application of closed chest cardiac massage. 1 That same year, at the meeting of the Maryland Medical Society in Ocean City, MD, the combination of chest compressions and rescue breathing was introduced. 2 Two years later, in 1962, direct-current, monophasic waveform defibrillation was described. 3 In 1966 the American Heart Association (AHA) developed the first cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) guidelines, which have been followed by periodic updates. 4 During the past 50 years the fundamentals of early recognition and activation, early CPR, early defibrillation, and early access to emergency medical care have saved hundreds of thousands of lives around the world. These lives demonstrate the importance of resuscitation research and clinical translation and are cause to celebrate this 50 th anniversary of CPR.\n\n【3】Challenges remain if we are to fulfill the potential offered by the pioneer resuscitation scientists. We know that there is a striking disparity in survival outcomes from cardiac arrest across systems of care, with some systems reporting 5-fold higher survival rates than others. 5–9 Although technology, such as that incorporated in automated external defibrillators (AEDs), has contributed to increased survival from cardiac arrest, no initial intervention can be delivered to the victim of cardiac arrest unless bystanders are ready, willing, and able to act. Moreover, to be successful, the actions of bystanders and other care providers must occur within a system that coordinates and integrates each facet of care into a comprehensive whole, focusing on survival to discharge from the hospital.\n\n【4】 This executive summary highlights the major changes and most provocative recommendations in the 2010 AHA Guidelines for CPR and Emergency Cardiovascular Care (ECC).\n\n【5】The scientists and healthcare providers participating in a comprehensive evidence evaluation process analyzed the sequence and priorities of the steps of CPR in light of current scientific advances to identify factors with the greatest potential impact on survival. On the basis of the strength of the available evidence, they developed recommendations to support the interventions that showed the most promise.\n\n【6】There was unanimous support for continued emphasis on high-quality CPR, with compressions of adequate rate and depth, allowing complete chest recoil, minimizing interruptions in chest compressions and avoiding excessive ventilation. High-quality CPR is the cornerstone of a system of care that can optimize outcomes beyond return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Return to a prior quality of life and functional state of health is the ultimate goal of a resuscitation system of care.\n\n【7】The 2010 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC are based on the most current and comprehensive review of resuscitation literature ever published, the 2010 ILCOR International Consensus on CPR and ECC Science With Treatment Recommendations . 10 The 2010 evidence evaluation process included 356 resuscitation experts from 29 countries who reviewed, analyzed, evaluated, debated, and discussed research and hypotheses through in-person meetings, teleconferences, and online sessions (\"webinars\") during the 36-month period before the 2010 Consensus Conference. The experts produced 411 scientific evidence reviews on 277 topics in resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care. The process included structured evidence evaluation, analysis, and cataloging of the literature.

Teichgraeber VICE PRESIDENT AND MANAGING DIRECTOR, INTERNATIONAL: Charles McCullagh VICE PRESIDENT: Frances Newburg\n\n【5】 \"JARON LANIER'S DESCRIPTION of the seven-camera teleimmersion project in 'Virtually There' [April] should have mentioned, for historical context, the traditional two-camera system that has a 20-millisecond latency: the system whose two cameras are called eyes and that uses a computer called a brain on which runs the ever popular Mind OS software that portrays external reality as a near-real-time, three-dimensional, internal representation viewed by … the mysterious viewer called consciousness.\" Okay, Robert Burruss of Chevy Chase, Md., consider it mentioned.\n\n【6】For discussions of other topics from the April issue, please direct your OS below.\n\n【7】## Cord Blood: Stat\n\n【8】\n Ronald M. Kline [\"Whose Blood Is It, Anyway?\"] cites the odds that a newborn will need to use his or her own cord blood in the future as 1 in 200,000 and attributes this statistic to the National Institutes of Health. But the NIH provided the Cord Blood Registry with information estimating an individual's need for such a transplant to be 1 in 2,703. To our knowledge, the 1-in-200,000 figure has never been explained or published in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\n【9】DAVID T. HARRIS Scientific Director, Cord Blood Registry\n\n【10】 KLINE REPLIES: The 1-in-200,000 statistic came from an official at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. Although several other researchers have made such estimates, determining the likelihood that an individual would ever need his or her own cord blood is an experiment in progress. My article cited a 20- fold range in probability that a newborn would need a cord blood transplant. This underscores how much still remains to be understood about the uses of cord blood transplantation in the treatment of disease.\n\n【11】We still do not fully comprehend why the cancers of some people who receive transplants recur. Until we answer this question, we will not know which patients will benefit most from cord blood transplants. It would be a great help if blood banks made available data on the total number of cord blood units they collect and the number of units that are used for transplantation. Only in this way will we know the probability that a person who has stored his or her cord blood will actually find a use for it.\n\n【12】 [Editors' note: The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute—part of the NIH—informed S CIENTIFIC A MERICAN that it has a policy of not responding to letters to the editor. ]\n\n【13】## Amino Acids\n\n【14】\n THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS I cannot let Robert M. Hazen [\"Life's Rocky Start\"] get away with pleading for pure chance as the reason why the amino acids in living organisms are predominantly \"left-handed.\" The left- and righthanded varieties of amino acids can be made in 50–50 quantities, as can mirrorimage crystal faces. So the fact that all natural substances are predominantly lefthanded must result not merely from chance. The other explanation is that somewhere in the mirror world of righthanded molecules, there is a combination that just does not work as well, and so natural selection ruled the right-handeds out.\n\n【15】PETER ROSE Knutsford, England\n\n【16】 HAZEN REPLIES: I have two reasons for pleading pure chance. First, for every plausible mechanism that yields a significant excess of left over right, somewhere there exists the mirror mechanism.

This maxillary traction is possible because the craniofacial complex is very malleable and\n\n【18】 we can obtain significant changes in the three planes of space. The maxillae bone responds to orthopedic and functional stimulus because it is of intramembranous ossification origin. Therefore, the object of the treatment is to stimulate the growth of this bone. (13,19,35)\n\n【19】 Potpeschnigg (1875) was the first to develop the idea of maxillary traction; later Delaire at the end of the 60's renewed the interest of the use of the face mask for maxil¬ lary protraction, which was created to correct the poste¬ rior rotation of the maxilla and its development deficiency for the treatment of cleft lip and palate patients, Petit at the end of the 70's proposed the use of this appliance for patients with skeletal Class III patients that needed maxillary protraction. Petit modified the basic concept of Delaire, changing the anatomy of the face mask, he also increased the magnitude of the generated force exerted by the appliance and also reduced treatment time. 9.19)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "Fig. 57.

Feeling incapable to express amusement without being stared at by others affects their confidence.\n\n【3】They feel uncomfortable meeting new people. They tend to remain socially distant because they believe they will be unable to interact with people normally.\n\n【4】## 2.  Feeling Of Being Alone\n\n【5】\n Bell’s palsy is a rare illness. It affects 1 in 5,000 people each year. As a teenager with Bell's palsy, they feel they are different from everyone else.

They feel that even their friends and family do not realize what they are going through.\n\n【6】## 3.

A teenager who has suddenly developed Bell’s palsy might have a sense of grief take over. They feel that they could have looked so attractive if this condition had not developed.\n\n【10】 Furthermore, since 'selfies' and photographs have become such an integral part in a teenager's life, those affected with Bell's palsy feel uncomfortable when being included in pictures.

Morrison, Chair; Gerald Kierzek; Douglas S. Diekema; Michael R. Sayre; Scott M. Silvers; Ahamed H. Idris; Mary E. Mancini\n\n【2】 ' he goals of resuscitation are to preserve life, restore health, 1 relieve suffering, limit disability, and respect the individual's decisions, rights, and privacy. Decisions about cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) efforts are often made in seconds by rescuers who may not know the victim of cardiac arrest or whether an advance directive exists. As a result, administration of CPR may be contrary to the individual's desires or best interests. 1–3 However, practice is evolving as more emergency physicians reportedly honor legal advance directives in decisions about resuscitation. 4–7 This section provides guidelines for healthcare providers who are faced with the difficult decision to provide or withhold emergency cardiovascular care.\n\n【3】## Ethical Principles\n\n【4】\n Healthcare professionals should consider ethical, legal, and cultural factors 8.9 when caring for those in need of CPR.\n\n【5】Although healthcare providers must play a role in resuscitation decision making, they should be guided by science, the individual patient or surrogate preferences, local policy, and legal requirements.\n\n【6】## Principle Of Respect For Autonomy10\n\n【7】\n The principle of respect for autonomy is an important social value in medical ethics and law. The principle is based on society's respect for a competent individual's ability to make decisions about his or her own healthcare. Adults are presumed to have decision-making capability unless they are incapacitated or declared incompetent by a court of law. Truly informed decisions require that individuals receive and understand accurate information about their condition and prognosis, as well as the nature, risks, benefits, and alternatives of any proposed interventions. The individual must deliberate and choose among alternatives by linking the decision to his or her framework of values. Truly informed decisions require a strong healthcare provider–patient relationship/communication and a 3-step process: (1) the patient receives and understands accurate information about his or her condition, prognosis, the nature of any proposed interventions, alternatives, and risks and benefits; (2) the patient is asked to paraphrase the information to give the provider the opportunity to assess his or her understanding and\n\n【8】 to correct any misimpressions; and (3) the patient deliberates and chooses among alternatives and justifies his or her decision. 11 When decision-making capacity is temporarily impaired by factors such as active illness, treatment of these conditions may restore capacity. When the individual's preferences are unknown or uncertain, emergency conditions should be treated until further information is available.\n\n【9】Advance Directives, Living Wills, and Patient Self-Determination A recent study documented that more than a quarter of elderly patients require surrogate decision making at the end of life.\n\n【10】Advance directives, living wills, and executing a durable power of attorney for health care ensure that when the patient is unable to make decisions, the preferences that the individual established in advance can guide care. These decisions are associated with less aggressive medical care near death, earlier hospice referrals for palliation, better quality of life, and caregiver's bereavement adjustment. 12 A healthcare advance directive is a legal binding document\n\n【11】 that in the United States (US) is based on the Patient Self- Determination Act of 1990. 13 It communicates the thoughts, wishes, or preferences for healthcare decisions that might need to be made during periods of incapacity. The Patient Self- Determination Act mandated that healthcare institutions should facilitate the completion of advance directives if patients desire them. 13 Advance directives can be verbal or written and may be based on conversations, written directives, living wills, or durable power of attorney for health care. The legal validity of various forms of advance directives varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Courts consider written advance directives to be more trustworthy than recollections of conversations.\n\n【12】A living will may be referred to as a \"medical directive\" or \"declaration\" or \"directive to physicians,\" and it provides written direction to healthcare providers about the care that the individual approves should he or she become terminally ill and be unable to make decisions. A living will constitutes evidence of the individual's wishes, and in most areas it can be legally enforced.\n\n【13】A durable power of attorney for health care is a legal document that appoints an authorized person to make healthcare decisions (not limited to end-of-life decisions).

The primary goal of initial treatment is early reperfusion therapy through administration of fibrinolytics (pharmacological reperfusion) or PPCI (mechanical reperfusion). Providers should rapidly identify patients with STEMI and quickly screen them for indications and contraindications to fibrinolytic therapy and PCI.  Patients who are ineligible for fibrinolytic therapy should be considered for transfer to a PCI facility regardless of delay.\n\n【5】Within a STEMI system of care, the first physician who encounters a patient with STEMI determines the need and strategy (fibrinolytic or PPCI) for reperfusion therapy (see Table 1). If the patient meets the criteria for fibrinolytic therapy, a door-to-needle time (initiation of fibrinolytic agent) < 30 minutes is recommended—the earlier the better (Class I, LOE A). Routine consultation with a cardiologist or another physician is not recommended except in equivocal or uncertain cases. 89,121 Consultation delays therapy and is associated with increased hospital mortality rates (Class III, LOE B).\n\n【6】## Ua And Nstemi (Figure 1, Boxes 9 Through 12) Unstable Angina (Ua) And Nstemi Are Difficult To Distin-\n\n【7】\n guish initially.

Clinical features can correlate with the dynamic nature of clot formation and degradation (eg, waxing and waning clinical symptoms).

This nondiagnostic evaluation includes a normal or nondiagnostic 12-lead ECG and normal serum cardiac biomarker concentrations. The majority of these patients will not be experiencing an ACS, but many may have underlying CAD or other clinical features putting them at subsequent risk for major adverse cardiac events over the course of a few days to several months.\n\n【30】A major goal of the risk stratification process is to identify\n\n【31】 those patients who do not appear to have high-risk features on initial assessment but are found, through the course of the diagnostic process, to have ACS and clinically significant CAD. This strategy allows physicians to target patients who would benefit from guidelines-based ACS therapies while avoiding unnecessary procedural and pharmacological risks (eg, anticoagulation therapy and invasive cardiac catheterization) in patients with low risk for major adverse cardiac events.\n\n【32】 Downloaded from http://circ.ahajournals.org/ by guest on September 4, 2011", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "infarction can be made when clinical symptoms or new ECG", "bbox": [60.0, 84.0, 377.0, 99.0]}, {"text": "abnormalities are consistent with ischemia and one biomarker", "bbox": [60.0, 100.0, 376.0, 113.0]}, {"text": "is elevated above the 99 th percentile of the upper reference", "bbox": [60.0, 115.0, 375.0, 130.0]}, {"text": "limit (URL) using a test with optimal precision defined as a", "bbox": [60.0, 132.0, 377.0, 147.0]}, {"text": "CV ≤ 10%.", "bbox": [60.0, 148.0, 121.0, 162.0]}], "type": "Text", "position": 3}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "There is insufficient evidence to support the use of tropo-", "bbox": [73.0, 164.0, 375.0, 179.0]}, {"text": "nin point-of-care testing (POCT) either in or out of hospital.", "bbox": [60.0, 180.0, 375.0, 194.0]}, {"text": "There is also insufficient evidence to support the use of", "bbox": [60.0, 196.0, 376.0, 210.0]}, {"text": "myoglobin, β -natriuretic peptide (BNP), NT-proBNP,", "bbox": [60.0, 213.0, 375.0, 227.0]}, {"text": "D-dimer, C-reactive protein, ischemia-modified albumin", "bbox": [60.0, 229.0, 376.0, 242.0]}, {"text": "pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) or", "bbox": [60.0, 244.0, 375.0, 259.0]}, {"text": "interleukin-6 in isolation.", "bbox": [60.0, 261.0, 193.0, 274.0]}], "type": "Text", "position": 4}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "STEMI (Figure 1, Boxes 5 Through 8)", "bbox": [60.0, 290.0, 299.0, 305.0]}, {"text": "Patients with STEMI usually have complete occlusion of an", "bbox": [60.0, 307.0, 376.0, 321.0]}], "type": "Section-header", "position": 5}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "epicardial coronary artery.

(16)\n\n【5】 The definition of deep bite, according to Graber, refers to a state of increased vertical overbite in which the dimension between the incisal margins of the upper and lower teeth is excessive. This dental projection is denominated overbite and the norm is 2 mm. Chaconas considers it in percentages and mentions that a normal overbite exists when close to 20% of the buccal surface of the lower inci¬ sors is covered by the upper incisors. (11.15)\n\n【6】 Deep bite predisposes the patient to periodontal disease due to the overcharge of occlusal forces, excessive ten¬ sion, trauma, functional problems (limitation in lateral movements) and bruxism. Due to the excessive depth of the bite, functional problems that affect the temporal, masseter and lateral pterigoyd muscles occur, and by consequence, the condyle goes backwards and upwards in the articular fossa (vertical growth) due to the lingual eruption of the central incisors, which forces the man¬ dible and the condyles to go backwards far away from central relation. Therefore these patients are susceptible to TMJ pathology. (11,15,16)\n\n【7】 Facial characteristics of deep bite patients may be the following:\n\n【8】 1.1.\n\n【9】 2.\n\n【10】 3.\n\n【11】 4.\n\n【12】 5.\n\n【13】 6.\n\n【14】 7.\n\n【15】 Brachicephalic face.\n\n【16】Skeletal Class II tendency, Concave profile.\n\n【17】Short vertical dimension and lower third of the face.\n\n【18】Diminished occlusal plane.\n\n【19】Hypodivergent growth tendency.\n\n【20】Mandible retrognatia.

The anterior facial height is reduced; especially the lower third of the face, meanwhile the posterior facial height is excessive. (16) When the an¬ terior facial height is lesser than the posterior facial height the maxillary bases converge and the result is a deep bite of skeletal origin. The alterations of the transversal width can also cause a skeletal deep bite because we can have a wide maxilla and a nar¬ row mandible.

Will Asthma Lead To Loss Of Oxygen?\n\n【2】\n Well-controlled, stable, treated asthma does not affect the body's oxygen levels. If lung function is normal¬ ized, gas exchange also continues normally. For example, an asthmatic experiencing chest tightness or wheezing that responds to two puffs of a rescue inhaler every few days is not in any danger from low blood oxygen levels.\n\n【3】 Asthma in its more extreme forms can lead to reduced oxygen levels. Both severe exacerbations of asthma, as well as life-threatening asthma, have the potential to significantly interfere with the lungs' ability to extract oxygen from the air. In particular, when bronchospasm, swelling, and mucus accumulation narrow the bronchial passages, oxygen levels may dip. The emergency treatment of an asthma exacerbation that brings a patient to the emergency room, for example, always begins with supplemental oxygen, given by either an oxygen mask or nasal prongs. In an asthmatic emergency, it is always better to err on the side of safety and automatically prescribe supplemental oxygen, rather than risk reduced oxygen.\n\n【4】## 46. What Is An Asthma Specialist?\n\n【5】\n An asthma specialist is a physician who has a special interest in treating patients with asthma, and who has completed post-doctoral training either in adult or pediatric lung diseases (pulmonary medicine), or in allergy and immunology.

(5) The transpalatine arch is made with 0.036\" stainless steel wire and consists of a palatal arch, with a central omega, that is connected to the bands of both upper first molars. A very common situation that we can encounter during the occlusal analysis of a patient is to find molars that are in a buccal position or in a cross bite, which in oc¬ casions is product of a dentoalveolar compensation caused by a transversal narrowing of the maxilla, pronouncing even more the Wilson curve. The course of action in these cases is to flatten this curve; this can be done applying torque on the solder point of the bands with the transpalatal arch to correct, the buccal position of the tooth or the cross bite, depending on the position of the tooth. (19)\n\n【39】 On the other hand, these arches can be activated to establish and maintain the width of the arches, prevent molar rotations, correct mesiodistal asymmetries, correct asymmetric and symmetric cross bites and to correct third order axial inclinations.

The book has a stock of more than 1,000 clinical photographs in which we explain \"different methods to do the same thing\" meaning that we point out many ways to close, open or uncross a bite. We include different molar distalizers, how to provide anchorage or how to close spaces; in this manner, multiple treatment options are shown for an identical problem, orthodontic or orthopedic in nature.\n\n【1】 Our book consists of ten chapters, which we will describe briefly:\n\n【2】 Chapter 1. Action and reaction. In an informative and straightforward approach we:\n\n【3】 Describe how and why teeth move orthodontically, and the effects at bone and dental levels.\n\n【4】The three laws of Newton and their clinical application during orthodontic treatment.\n\n【5】A simple and easy description on how to understand the physics laws that we utilize in an orthodontic treatment. The use of forces, resultant forces, coplanar forces, center of resistance, center of rotation, moment, types of dental movements and their physiology, dental equilibrium and first, second and third order bends are clearly explained.\n\n【6】 Chapter 2. Anchorage. In this chapter we examine the different types of anchorage utilized during orthodontic treatment, such as when to use minimal, moderate, maximum or absolute anchorage, their advantages, disadvantages and recommendations for each one.\n\n【7】 Chapter 3. Space closure in orthodontics. We present a whole array of different modalities for dental space closure, from the classical elastic chain to the use of coils, wire bends and retroligatures. We also describe the forces produced by each of these additions, in the case they can be used, the advantages, disadvantages and recommendations of each one.\n\n【8】 Chapter 4. Deep bite. Description of the different types of deep bites and their etiology, and the possible treatment plans for correction. We mention here why and how to use a bite plane, the use of bite ramps, bypass, why should braces be bonded near the incisal edge to help correct this problem, when to use an intrusion bend or a Tip back, how to use and how can reverse curves help us to correct a deep bite, the use of in-block intrusion arch wires like the intrusion arch of Dr. Oscar Quiroz, the utility arch wire, the CIA and intrusive arches with loops. All these additions have advantages, disadvantages and recommendations, which are clearly explained.\n\n【9】 Chapter 5. Open bite. This is one of the most difficult types of malocclusions to treat because it has a high relapse rate. As in the deep bite chapter, we describe the different causes and the different types of open bite, and their possible treatments. We discuss how we use in block extrusion bends or in an individual manner, the benefits of palatal plates and the advantages of using reverse curves on the maxilla and a curve on the mandible in order to close an anterior open bite; why brace bonding near the gingival margin helps us, cases in which we can use an individual or In block By-pass, the use of an inverted\n\n【10】 .\n\n【11】 .\n\n【12】 .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "' he book 1,001 Tips For Orthodontics and its Secrets has been written in a simple and", "bbox": [238.0, 250.0, 721.0, 267.0]}, {"text": "didactic way for easy reading and understanding, ideal for the dental student, orth-", "bbox": [259.0, 266.0, 721.0, 282.0]}, {"text": "odontic resident or specialist.

There are various surgical options for the management of Bell's palsy. These include treatments for restoring the smile and facial balance, corrective surgeries such as face lifts, brow lifts and other muscle relaxing procedures.\n\n【3】 These treatments are known to enhance the appearance of the face, but do not necessarily improve muscle function. It should be kept in mind that these procedures may not completely restore natural facial expressions or natural movement. But they can improve the patient's quality of life since the condition isn't as apparent.\n\n【4】 Corrective surgery truly helps patients regain their confidence. Nevertheless, there are many people who have developed Bell's palsy and continue to live contentedly without any surgery. You also have to keep in mind that there are always risks associated with surgery. Let's take a look at some of these risks.\n\n【5】## Oculoplastic Surgery\n\n【6】\n The foremost aim of this treatment is to enhance eye comfort and protect vision.\n\n【7】Due to Bell's palsy, patients may experience eyelid retraction that can cause droopy eyebrows. This condition can be very painful as well. Oculoplastic surgery not only enhances the appearance of the eyes but is helpful in addressing problems such as watering of the eyes and incomplete eyelid closure.\n\n【8】 This surgery involves a wide range of surgical procedures that involve the eyelids, orbit, face, and tear ducts. Therefore, this is the ideal type of surgery that people with Bell's palsy choose to undergo.\n\n【9】## Eyelid Surgery\n\n【10】\n Most people with Bell's palsy have difficulty closing their eyelid. As previously discussed, this puts the eye at immense danger of infection or injury. Some patients may observe the improvement of eyelid function without any treatment.\n\n【11】But those who experience lasting effects of Bell's palsy should not lose hope.\n\n【12】Eyelid surgery helps these patients pull through the problem and protect their eye.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "Chapter Seven: Correction with Surgery", "bbox": [171.0, 121.0, 643.0, 146.0]}], "type": "Section-header", "position": 0}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Damage to the facial nerve affects how your face looks and also causes facial", "bbox": [93.0, 169.0, 722.0, 189.0]}, {"text": "expressions (smiling, frowning, etc.) to become asymmetrical.

Be sure you avoid people who are suffering from chickenpox and measles.\n\n【1】 6. You might be instructed to follow a diet rich in potassium and calcium while taking Prednisone. Your doctor may also ask you to reduce your salt intake. If needed, you might be asked to take a calcium or potassium supplement along with Prednisone.\n\n【2】## Antiviral Drugs\n\n【3】\n As viral infections have a role in the etiology of Bell's palsy, antiviral drugs are also used to treat the condition. Although antiviral drugs, if taken alone, have no impact on recovery, they are used in combination with Prednisolone for greater effectiveness.\n\n【4】 Acyclovir (Zovirax) and valacyclovir (Valtrex) are sometimes used to treat Bell's palsy. They are known to prevent the development of infection if a virus is identified to have caused the inflammation of the facial nerve. It is worth mentioning that this treatment is offered only if the condition is severe.\n\n【5】## Treatment With Botulinum Toxin\n\n【6】\n There are a number of neurotransmitters (special chemical substances) inside your body that control the transmission of electrical signals. Acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter responsible for transmitting electrical messages that help facial muscles contract.\n\n【7】 Facial paralysis caused by Bell’s palsy is sudden; however, you never know how long these effects may last. Botulinum toxin or simply Botox injections help paralyzed muscles relax and restore facial symmetry. Botulinum toxin is a protein produced by bacterium Clostridium botulinum and this toxin blocks the release of acetylcholine.\n\n【8】 Your doctor will inject the toxin into affected muscles on the paralyzed side, causing them to relax as I mentioned earlier in the treatment of synkinesis section. The result is a more symmetrical face. A very fine needle is used during the procedure; therefore, you will experience very little pain.\n\n【9】 Sometimes, Botox injections are also used on the normal side of the face to restore symmetry.

On the side where distention of the periodontal ligament fibers is occurring, undifferentiated mesenchyma cells transform into osteoblasts and fibro¬ blasts, which are responsible of forming bone tissue and collagen fibers respectively. When blood flow is limited, teeth do not move or they move slowly. Intense forces may limit the physiologic response and can affect the rate of dental movement. (12)\n\n【3】 Dental movement begins two days after the force is applied.\n\n【4】This movement stimulates osteoclasts and osteoblasts to begin the bone remodeling process with apposition on the periodontal fiber tension side and resorption on the compressed periodontal ligament side. Slowly the alveolus dislocates in the direction of the applied force, with orth¬ odontic movement as a consequence.

In his study he proposed that 200 g/cm 2 of exposed root surface to movement was the optimal pressure to apply In order to obtain an efficient dental movement.

The buccolingual size of the root surface is evaluated if the tooth is going to be moved in a transverse direction. When intrusion or extrusion of teeth is planned, the cross section of the root surface is evaluated. ( 12 )\n\n【8】 According to Ricketts, the optimal force for dental movement is 100 g/cm 2 of root surface exposed to movement (please refer to Space Closure chapter. Table of Ricketts).

This can be classified according to the location of the center of resistance:\n\n【22】 Uncontrolled inclination: This type of incli¬ a.\n\n【23】nation happens when the center of rotation is between the center of resistance and the apex of the tooth. This movement can be obtained by any orthodontist, but is usually not wanted.\n\n【24】This uncontrolled inclination happens when we have a round arch wire in the slot of the brace and force is applied to the tooth.

Shasha\n\n【2】\n Predicting the future accurately is most useful in betting games—the stock market comes to mind. Unfortunately, perfect oracles are hard to come by (the stock market comes to mind, again). This puzzle considers how to take advantage of the flaky oracles one is likely to find.\n\n【3】You have $100 to start with and 10 bets to make. Each bet turns on the result of a coin flip. The oracle will tell you which way the coin will fall but may lie on just one occasion and may do so after seeing your bet for that flip. You can find a counterparty who will give you even odds on any bet you make, so placing an x -dollar bet means he will return 2 x dollars to you if the oracle tells the truth about that flip and will pocket your bet if the oracle lies. How do you end up with the greatest possible final amount, no matter when the oracle chooses to lie?\n\n【4】Here is a second problem: suppose you have to decide the amount of all your bets in advance without knowing when the oracle will lie. What should your bets be in that case, and what final amount can you be sure to get no matter when (and if) the oracle chooses to lie?\n\n【5】Just one more thing: you lose everything if you plan to make a bet on a particular move but end up having too little money at that time.\n\n【6】Warm-up for the first problem: Suppose there are three flips and at most one lie. You have $100. How much should you bet the first time? Given the outcome, how much should you bet the second and third times? The figure shows some good alternatives.\n\n【7】E\n\n【8】 Answer to Last Month's Puzzle For a circle with a radius of 10 centimeters or more, any pattern of red and blue must satisfy the 10-centimeter bicoloration condition. Here's the proof: Consider two points in the circle—R (which is red) and B (which is blue)—that are between 10 and 20 centimeters apart (for the proof that two such points must exist, see the Puzzling Adventures page at www.sciam.com). Draw circles with a radius of 10 centimeters around each point. These circles must intersect at one or two points, and at least one of these points must lie within the original circle. Label this point Q.\n\n【9】If Q is red, then the line segment B-Q is 10 centimeters long and bicolored. If Q is blue, then the segment R-Q is 10 centimeters long and bicolored.\n\n【10】Either way the pattern satisfies the 10-centimeter rule.\n\n【11】 Web Solution For a peek at the answer to this month's problem, visit www.sciam.com", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "UZZLINGADVENTURE", "bbox": [72.0, 51.0, 451.0, 96.0]}], "type": "Title", "position": 0}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "The Delphi Flip by dennis e. shasha", "bbox": [45.0, 216.0, 489.0, 268.0]}], "type": "Section-header", "position": 1}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Predicting the future accurately is most", "bbox": [47.0, 279.0, 261.0, 293.0]}, {"text": "useful in betting games—the stock mar-", "bbox": [47.0, 295.0, 260.0, 308.0]}, {"text": "ket comes to mind.

Graft-versus-host disease can manifest itself as a blistering and ulcerating skin rash, liver damage that progresses to liver failure or severe gastrointestinal bleeding; it can quickly lead to death.\n\n【6】To minimize such serious complications in people who cannot obtain a bone marrow transplant from a well-matched sibling, in 1987 a coalition of national blood bank organizations persuaded the U.S. federal government to establish the National Marrow Donor Program to find the best matches for patients among a pool of registered potential bone marrow donors. The program—together with other, similar, international registries— lists 6.5 million names. But because there is only a 1 in 400 chance that an individual will be a match for someone who is not a relative, those in need typically have just a 60 percent chance of finding a potentially lifesaving donor. The odds are even worse for patients who are members of a minority group, because matches are more likely to occur between people of the same race and the registries do not have enough minority volunteers.\n\n【7】Even those who do find a suitable donor from one of the registries still face an alarming 80 percent risk of moderate to severe (grade II to IV) graft-versus-host disease.

Following the overview of bradyarrhythmias and summary of the initial evaluation and treatment of bradycardia, drugs used in the treatment of bradycardia are presented. See the Bradycardia Algorithm, Figure 3. Box numbers in the text refer to the numbered boxes in the algorithm.\n\n【13】 Evaluation Bradycardia is defined as a heart rate of < 60 beats per minute. However, when bradycardia is the cause of symptoms, the rate is generally < 50 beats per minute, which is the\n\n【14】 working definition of bradycardia used here (Figure 3, Box 1). A slow heart rate may be physiologically normal for some patients, whereas a heart rate of > 50 beats per minute may be inadequate for others. The Bradycardia Algorithm focuses on management of clinically significant bradycardia (ie, bradycardia that is inappropriate for the clinical condition).\n\n【15】Because hypoxemia is a common cause of bradycardia, initial evaluation of any patient with bradycardia should focus on signs of increased work of breathing (tachypnea, intercostal retractions, suprasternal retractions, paradoxical abdominal breathing) and oxyhemoglobin saturation as determined by pulse oximetry (Figure 3, Box 2 ).

What's scary about it is the fact that this loss of facial muscle control (facial paralysis) occurs rapidly - it can even happen overnight!\n\n【1】 Sadly, medical research cannot predict the degree or extent of facial paralysis or muscle weakness. Quite often, only the lower half of the face is affected. At times, Bell's palsy can affect the whole side of the face or even worse, both sides of the face can become paralyzed. Bell's palsy on both sides of the face, however, is extremely rare. Now moving forward, let's see what the muscles in our face can do.\n\n【2】## The Muscles Used For Facial Expressions\n\n【3】\n You will be surprised with the long list of functions your facial muscles perform.\n\n【4】The 7th cranial nerve is responsible for controlling the following muscles and their corresponding functions.\n\n【5】 1. Occipitofrontalis muscle – raising the eyebrows\n\n【6】 2. Zygomaticus – raises the corners of the mouth during 'open mouth' smiling.

The following have been considered in recommending a compression-to-ventilation ratio of 30:2 for single rescuers:\n • Evidence from manikin studies shows that lone rescuers cannot deliver the desired number of compressions per minute with the compression-to-ventilation ratio of 5:1 that was previously recommended (2000 and earlier). 60–63 For\n\n【5】 the lone rescuer, manikin studies show that a ratio of 30:2 yields more chest compressions than a 15:2 ratio with no, or minimal, increase in rescuer fatigue. 64–68 • Volunteers recruited at an airport to perform single-rescuer layperson CPR on an adult manikin had less \"no flow time\"\n (ie, arrest time without chest compressions, when no blood flow is generated) with 30:2 compared with a 15:2 ratio. 69 • An observational human study 70 comparing resuscitations by firefighters prior to and following the change from 15:2 to 30:2 compression-to-ventilation ratio reported more chest compressions per minute with a 30:2 ratio; ROSC was unchanged.\n • Animal studies 71–73 show that coronary perfusion pressure, a major determinant of success in resuscitation, rapidly declines when chest compressions are interrupted; once\n\n【6】 compressions are resumed, several chest compressions are needed to restore coronary perfusion pressure. Thus, frequent interruptions of chest compressions prolong the duration of low coronary perfusion pressure and flow.\n\n【7】Manikin studies, 25,69 . 74 as well as in- and out-of-hospital adult human studies, 33,34,75 have documented long interruptions in chest compressions. Adult studies 76 - 78 have also demonstrated that these interruptions reduce the likelihood of ROSC.\n\n【8】## Activate Emergency Response System If There Are 2 Rescuers, One Should Start Cpr Immediately\n\n【9】\n and the other should activate the emergency response system (in most locales by phoning 911) and obtain an AED, if one is available. Most infants and children with cardiac arrest have an asphyxial rather than a VF arrest 3 . 9 . 12 ; therefore 2 minutes of CPR are recommended before the lone rescuer activates the emergency response system and gets an AED if one is nearby. The lone rescuer should then return to the victim as soon as possible and use the AED (if available) or resume CPR, starting with chest compressions. Continue with cycles of 30 compressions to 2 ventilations until emergency response rescuers arrive or the victim starts breathing spontaneously.\n\n【10】## Bls Sequence For Healthcare Providers And Others Trained In 2-Rescuer Cpr\n\n【11】\n For the most part the sequence of BLS for healthcare providers is similar to that for laypeople with some variation as indicated below (see Figure 3). Healthcare providers are more likely to work in teams and less likely to be lone rescuers. Activities described as a series of individual sequences are often performed simultaneously (eg, chest compressions and preparing for rescue breathing) so there is less significance regarding which is performed first.\n\n【12】It is reasonable for healthcare providers to tailor the sequence of rescue actions to the most likely cause of arrest.\n\n【13】For example, if the arrest is witnessed and sudden (eg, sudden collapse in an adolescent or a child identified at high risk for arrhythmia or during an athletic event), the healthcare provider may assume that the victim has suffered a sudden VF–cardiac arrest and as soon as the rescuer verifies that the child is unresponsive and not breathing (or only gasping) the rescuer should immediately phone the emergency response system, get the AED and then begin CPR and use the AED.\n\n【14】(Class IIa LOE C). 2 , 7 , 79\n\n【15】## Assess The Need For Cpr (Box 1)\n\n【16】\n If the victim is unresponsive and is not breathing (or only gasping), send someone to activate the emergency response system.\n\n【17】## Pulse Check (Box 3)\n\n【18】\n If the infant or child is unresponsive and not breathing (gasps do not count as breathing), healthcare providers may take up to 10 seconds to attempt to feel for a pulse (brachial in an infant and carotid or femoral in a child). If, within 10 seconds, you don't feel a pulse or are not sure if you feel a pulse, begin chest compressions (Class IIa, LOE C). It can be difficult to feel a pulse, especially in the heat of an emergency, and studies show that healthcare providers, 80 as well as lay rescuers, are unable to reliably detect a pulse. 81–95\n\n【19】## Inadequate Breathing With Pulse\n\n【20】\n If there is a palpable pulse ≥ 60 per minute but there is inadequate breathing, give rescue breaths at a rate of about 12 to 20 breaths per minute (1 breath every 3 to 5 seconds) until spontaneous breathing resumes (Box 3A). Reassess the pulse about every 2 minutes (Class IIa, LOE B) but spend no more than 10 seconds doing so.\n\n【21】## Bradycardia With Poor Perfusion If The Pulse Is < 60 Per Minute And There Are Signs Of Poor\n\n【22】\n perfusion (ie, pallor, mottling, cyanosis) despite support of oxygenation and ventilation, begin chest compressions.\n\n【23】Because cardiac output in infancy and childhood largely depends on heart rate, profound bradycardia with poor perfusion is an indication for chest compressions because cardiac arrest is imminent and beginning CPR prior to full cardiac arrest results in improved survival. 96 The absolute heart rate at which chest compressions should be initiated is unknown; the recommendation to provide chest compressions for a heart rate < 60 per minute with signs of\n\n【24】 Downloaded from http://circ.ahajournals.org/ by guest on September 4, 2011", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "short a pause in chest compressions as possible after each set", "bbox": [60.0, 84.0, 377.0, 99.0]}, {"text": "of 30 compressions (Class IIa, LOE C).", "bbox": [60.0, 100.0, 271.0, 113.0]}], "type": "Text", "position": 3}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Coordinate Chest Compressions and Breathing", "bbox": [60.0, 136.0, 352.0, 151.0]}], "type": "Section-header", "position": 4}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "After giving 2 breaths, immediately give 30 compressions.", "bbox": [60.0, 153.0, 375.0, 167.0]}, {"text": "The lone rescuer should continue this cycle of 30 com-", "bbox": [60.0, 168.0, 375.0, 182.0]}, {"text": "pressions and 2 breaths for approximately 2 minutes (about", "bbox": [60.0, 184.0, 376.0, 197.0]}, {"text": "5 cycles) before leaving the victim to activate the emer-", "bbox": [60.0, 199.0, 375.0, 214.0]}, {"text": "gency response system and obtain an automated external", "bbox": [60.0, 215.0, 377.0, 228.0]}, {"text": "defibrillator (AED) if one is nearby.", "bbox": [60.0, 230.0, 261.0, 244.0]}, {"text": "The ideal compression-to-ventilation ratio in infants and", "bbox": [73.0, 246.0, 377.0, 260.0]}, {"text": "children is unknown.

How Do Human Lungs Work?\n\n【2】\n The lungs are part of the respiratory system (Figure 1).\n\n【3】A good way to understand the workings of the lungs is to first get an overview of their structure, or anatomy (Figure 1A). The human respiratory system begins at the nose and includes the nasal passages, which allow air to pass by the back of the throat and to enter the windpipe, or trachea. The trachea sits below the voice box (larynx), and can be felt in the front of your neck as it descends behind the breastbone (sternum) into the upper chest. The trachea divides into two branches: the right mainstem bronchus and the left mainstem bronchus. The right mainstem bronchus leads air to and from the right lung, and the left mainstem bronchus leads air to and from the left lung.\n\n【4】 The area where the trachea divides into the right and left mainstem bronchi is called the carina. After the split, the right and left mainstem bronchi leading to each lung subdivide further into smaller and smaller tube-like passages, via the branching tracheo-bronchial tree. As the bronchi continue to subdivide into successively narrower and narrower bronchi, they ultimately end in the tiniest subdivision, the bronchiole. Each bronchiole leads to the lung air sacs, the alveoli.\n\n【5】 The alveoli are specialized lung structures. They allow for fresh, oxygen-rich (O2) inhaled air to enter the body, and for oxygen-poor, carbon dioxide-rich (CO 2 ) air to exit (Figure 1B). Oxygen is required for life; oxygen deprivation is rapidly fatal. As oxygen is provided to the body's organs via the lungs, \"used\" air—comprised mostly of carbon dioxide (CO 2 )—is excreted by exhalation. Carbon dioxide is produced by the body's metabolism and is considered a \"waste product.\"", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "6.

A shortacting inhaled β 2 agonist is the recommended \"quick-relief\" agent.\n\n【11】 .\n\n【12】 Daily medication is required. In most cases, inhaled anti-inflamma-\n tory medication is preferred. Pills such as leukotriene modifiers or sustained-release theophylline tablets can be alternatives.\n\n【13】 Anyone with mild persistent asthma can experience exacerbations of their asthma. The exacerbations may be mild, moderate, or even severe, and they may affect activity.

Given this challenge, recognition of arrest and prompt action by the rescuer continue to be priorities for the 2010 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC . This chapter provides an overview of cardiac arrest epidemiology, the principles behind each link in the Chain of Survival, an overview of the core components of CPR (see Table 1), and the approaches of the 2010 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC to improving the quality of CPR.  The goal of this chapter is to integrate resuscitation science with real-world practice in order to improve the outcomes of CPR.\n\n【3】## Epidemiology\n\n【4】\n Despite important advances in prevention, cardiac arrest remains a substantial public health problem and a leading cause of death in many parts of the world. 2 Cardiac arrest occurs both in and out of the hospital. In the US and Canada, approximately 350 000 people/year (approximately half of them in-hospital) suffer a cardiac arrest and receive attempted resuscitation. 3–7 This estimate does not include the substantial number of victims who suffer an arrest without attempted resuscitation. While attempted resuscitation is not always appropriate, there are many lives and life-years lost because appropriate resuscitation is not attempted.\n\n【5】The estimated incidence of EMS-treated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the US and Canada is about 50 to 55/100 000 persons/year and approximately 25% of these present with pulseless ventricular arrhythmias. 3 . 8 The estimated incidence of in-hospital cardiac arrest is 3 to 6/1000 admissions 4–6 and similarly, approximately 25% of these present with pulseless ventricular arrhythmias. 7 Cardiac arrest victims who present with ventricular fibrillation (VF) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT) have a substantially better outcome com-\n\n【6】 pared with those who present with asystole or pulseless electric activity. 1 . 7 . 9 The vast majority of cardiac arrest victims are adults, but thousands of infants and children suffer either an in-hospital or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest each year in the US and Canada. 7,10\n\n【7】 Cardiac arrest continues to be an all-too-common cause of premature death, and small incremental improvements in survival can translate into thousands of lives saved every year.\n\n【8】## Key Principles In Resuscitation: Strengthening The Links In The Chain Of Survival\n\n【9】\n Successful resuscitation following cardiac arrest requires an integrated set of coordinated actions represented by the links in the Chain of Survival (see Figure 1).\n\n【10】The links include the following:\n\n【11】 • Immediate recognition of cardiac arrest and activation of the emergency response system • Early CPR with an emphasis on chest compressions • Rapid defibrillation\n\n【12】## • Effective Advanced Life Support • Integrated Post–Cardiac Arrest Care\n\n【13】\n Emergency systems that can effectively implement these links can achieve witnessed VF cardiac arrest survival of almost 50%. 11 -14 In most emergency systems, however, survival is lower, indicating that there is an opportunity for improvement by carefully examining the links and strengthening those that are weak. 3 The individual links are interdependent, and the success of each link is dependent on the effectiveness of those that precede it.\n\n【14】Rescuers have a wide variety of training, experience, and skills. The cardiac arrest victim's status and response to CPR maneuvers, as well as the settings in which the arrests occur, can also be heterogeneous. The challenge is how to encourage early, effective CPR for as many victims as possible, taking\n The American Heart Association requests that this document be cited as follows: Travers AH, Rea TD, Bobrow BJ, Edelson DP, Berg RA, Sayre MR, Berg MD, Chameides L, O'Connor RE, Swor RA.

Trade policy, infrastructure and land reform are much more important, yet they are barely mentioned.\n\n【1】Genetic engineering has a place and should not be taken off the table, but I don't believe it is a panacea for world hunger.\n\n【2】Treating it as if it is distorts this important debate. It is also amazing to me how quickly some have dismissed the virtues of traditional breeding— the technology that,  after all, made us into an agricultural powerhouse.\n\n【3】## Can We Turn To Another Potential Benefit That People Claim For Gm Foods: Agriculture That Is More Environmentally Friendly?\n\n【4】\n Let's ask a question: What is a green agriculture? Is it one that doesn't depend on pesticides? I think it's a lot more than that, actually. But if we just consider avoiding pesticide use, we now have some data on the impacts of engineered crops. Surveys of American farmers by the Department of Agriculture show that the use of Bt [pest-resistant] corn aimed at the corn borer, for example, hasn't done much to reduce the application of pesticides to corn, because the vast majority of corn acreage isn't treated with pesticide to control that pest.\n\n【5】The introduction of Bt cotton, however, has resulted in a measurable drop in pesticide use. That's good for the environment and good for the farmers who cut their input costs. But this benefit will last only as long as the Bt trait keeps working.\n\n【6】I think most scientists expect that the way Bt crops are being deployed will lead—sooner rather than later—to the evolution of resistance in the target pests, which means that the Bt cotton won't work anymore. We are likely to run through Bt cotton just like we ran through all the pesticides before it. So it isn't a durable path to a greener agriculture.\n\n【7】And there are environmental risks out there. Most scientists agree now that gene flow will occur—genes will go from engineered crops to nearby relatives. That means pollen will carry novel genes from the agricultural settings into neighbors' fields or into the wild. Gene flow from herbicide-resistant GM crops into the wild is already leading to the creation of herbicideresistant weeds in Canada.\n\n【8】## What About The Health Risks Of Gm Foods? Do You See Any Looming Problems?\n\n【9】\n I know of no reason to say the foods currently on the market are not safe to consume. But I don't have as much confidence as I should in that statement. There was a letter published in the journal Science last June from someone who had searched the literature for peer-reviewed studies comparing GM food to non-GM food. The researcher found something like five studies. That's not enough of a basis on which to claim, from a scientific standpoint, that we know enough to assure ourselves that these foods are going to be safe.\n\n【10】With the little we know about the food safety issue, I would say the biggest concern is allergenicity. Introducing new tox-\n\n【11】 ins into food is also a risk. Of course, breeders are going to try to avoid doing that, but plants have lots of toxins in them; as scientists manipulate systems that they don't completely understand, one of the unexpected effects could be turning on genes for toxins. There are rules that govern how genes come together and come apart in traditional breeding. We're not obeying those rules.\n\n【12】## So You Don'T See Genetic Engineering Of Crops To Be An Extension Of Traditional Breeding?\n\n【13】\n No, not at all. You just can't get an elephant to mate with a corn plant. Scientists are making combinations of genes that are not found in nature.\n\n【14】From a scientific standpoint, there is no dispute that this is fundamentally different from what has been done before. And that it is unnatural. Now, because it's new and unnatural doesn't necessarily mean that it will prove to be more risky. But it is certainly a big enough break with what we have done before to demand an extra measure of caution.\n\n【15】And caution is particularly appropriate where the technology involves our food supply. Lots and lots of people— virtually the whole population—could be exposed to genetically engineered foods, and yet we have only a handful of studies in the peer-reviewed literature addressing their safety. The question is, do we assume the technology is safe based on an argument that it's just a minor extension of traditional breeding, or do we prove it? The scientist in me wants to prove it's safe. Why rest on assumptions when you can go into the lab?\n\n【16】## Science Can Never Prove That Any Technology Is 100 Percent Safe. Will You Ever Be Satisfied That We'Ve Tested Gm Foods Enough? And How Much Risk Is Acceptable?\n\n【17】\n Sure, I could be satisfied that GM foods have been adequately tested. But it's premature to address that question now. Nobody is saying, \"Look, we've got this large body of peer-reviewed experimental data comparing GM with non-GM foods on a number of criteria that demonstrate the food is safe.\" When we have generated such a body of evidence, then there will be an issue of whether what we have is enough. And eventually, if things go well, we'll get to a point where we say, we've been cautious, but now we're going to move ahead—we need to fish or cut bait. But we're nowhere near that point now.\n\n【18】Obviously, we take risks all the time. But why are we taking these risks? If we didn't have an abundant food supply, if we didn't have something like 300,000 food products on our shelves already, then we would have an argument for taking this society-wide risk. But we've got plenty of food. In fact, we've got too much. And although we have many problems associated with our food system, they are not going to be solved by biotechnology.\n\n【19】 Sasha Nemecek , a former editor at Scientific American, is a science writer based in New York City.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "technology, including genetic engineering, would be some¬", "bbox": [61.0, 86.0, 391.0, 102.0]}, {"text": "where on the list, but it would not be at the top.

Daniel Mange, however, likes it when visitors walk up to one of his inventions and press the button marked KILL. The lights on the panel go out; a small box full of circuitry is toast. Early in May his team unveiled its latest contraption at a science festival here—a wall-size digital clock whose components you can zap at will—and told the public: Give it your best shot. See if you can crash the system.\n\n【3】The goal of Mange and his team is to instill electronic circuits with the ability to take a lickin’ and keep on tickin’—just like living things. Flesh-and-blood creatures might not be so good at calculating π to the millionth digit, but they can get through the day without someone pressing Ctrl-Alt-Del. Combining the precision of digital hardware with the resilience of biological wetware is a leading challenge for modern electronics.\n\n【4】Electronics engineers have been working on fault-tolerant circuits ever since there were electronics engineers [see \"Redundancy in Computers,\" by William H. Pierce; S CIENTIFIC American, February 1964]. Computer modems would still be dribbling data at 1200 baud if it weren’t for error detection and correction. In many applications, simple quality-control checks, such as extra data bits, suffice. More complex systems provide entire backup computers. The space shuttle, for example, has five processors. Four of them perform the same calculations; the fifth checks whether they agree and pulls the plug on any dissenter.\n\n【5】 The problem with these systems, though, is that they rely on centralized control. What if that control unit goes bad?\n\n【6】Nature has solved that problem through radical decentralization. Cells in the body are all basically identical; each takes on a specialized task, performs it autonomously and, in the event of infection or failure, commits hara-kiri so that its tasks can be taken up by new cells. These are the attributes that Mange, a professor at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology here, and others have sought since 1993 to emulate in circuitry, as part of the \"Embryonics\" (embryonic electronics) project.\n\n【7】One of their earlier inventions, the MICTREE (microinstruction tree) artificial cell, consisted of a simple processor and four bits of data storage. The cell is contained in a plastic box roughly the size of a pack of Post-its. Electrical contacts run along the sides so that cells can be snapped together like Legos. As in cellular automata, the models used to study the theory of self-replication, the MICTREE cells are connected only to their immediate neighbors. The communication burden on each cell is thus independent of the total number of cells. The system, in other words, is easily scalable— unlike many parallel-computing architectures.\n\n【8】Cells follow the instructions in their “genome,” a program written in a subset of the Pascal computer language. Like their biological antecedents, the cells all contain the exact same genome and execute part of it based on their position within the array, which each cell calculates relative to its neighbors.

This is because the necessary forces for the correction of an anterior cross bite of skeletal origin must be greater than the ones that can be produced by a forward arch.\n\n【3】 The forward arch is made by doing two small stops at the entrance of the molar tubes and leaving 2 mm or 3 mm of separation between the arch wire and the slot of the ante¬ rior braces. This arch wire is not only going to produce an anterior proclination for the correction of the cross bite, but will also provoke a mild molar distalization.\n Fig. 75.

As with past guidelines, 15 the process of evidence evaluation for the 2010 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC was comprehensive, systematic, and transparent. The 2010 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC rest on a foundation of previous guidelines, but they are supported by new evidence whenever possible.\n\n【6】The following sections provide an overview of the first three links in the Chain of Survival: immediate recognition of\n\n【7】 an arrest and activation of the emergency response system, early CPR, and rapid defibrillation. The information is provided in a manner that recognizes the real-world heterogeneity of the rescuer, victim, and resources.\n\n【8】## Conceptual Framework For Cpr: Interaction Of Rescuer(S) And Victim\n\n【9】\n CPR traditionally has integrated chest compressions and rescue breathing with the goal of optimizing circulation and oxygenation. Rescuer and victim characteristics may influence the optimal application of the components of CPR.\n\n【10】 Rescuer Everyone can be a lifesaving rescuer for a cardiac arrest victim. CPR skills and their application depend on the rescuer's training, experience, and confidence.\n\n【11】Chest compressions are the foundation of CPR (see Figure 2). All rescuers, regardless of training, should provide chest compressions to all cardiac arrest victims .\n\n【12】Because of their importance, chest compressions should be the initial CPR action for all victims regardless of age.\n\n【13】Rescuers who are able should add ventilations to chest compressions. Highly trained rescuers working together should coordinate their care and perform chest compressions as well as ventilations in a team-based approach.\n\n【14】 Victim Most cardiac arrests in adults are sudden, resulting from a primary cardiac cause; circulation produced by chest compressions is therefore paramount. 16 In contrast, cardiac arrest in children is most often asphyxial, which requires both ventilations and chest compressions for optimal results. 17 Thus rescue breathing may be more important for children than for adults in cardiac arrest. 17\n\n【15】## Early Action: Integrating The Critical Components Of Cpr The Universal Adult Basic Life Support (Bls) Algorithm\n\n【16】\n is a conceptual framework for all levels of rescuers in all settings. It emphasizes the key components that any rescuer can and should perform (see Figure 3).\n\n【17】When encountering a victim of sudden adult cardiac arrest, the lone rescuer must first recognize that the victim has experienced a cardiac arrest, based on unresponsiveness and lack of normal breathing. After recognition, the rescuer should immediately activate the emergency response system, get an AED/defibrillator, if available, and start CPR with chest compressions. If an AED is not close by, the rescuer should proceed directly to CPR. If other rescuers are present, the first rescuer should direct them to activate the emergency response system and get\n\n【18】 Figure 1. Chain of Survival.

Both theories have their merits, but neither one satisfactorily explains why asthma does not affect males and females equally. A third, more contempo¬ rary approach, with intriguing supportive data in laboratory animals, attempts to sort out the influence of chromosomal changes and hormonal factors that might confer predispositions to both asthma and overweight status. In 1994, a protein molecule called leptin was identified in humans. Leptin is primarily produced by fatty tissues. Leptin and a second protein called ghrelin are both suspected of playing important roles in the regulation of food intake, energy balance, and ultimately of weight. Of interest to lung researchers, lung and airway cells have receptors for leptin on their surfaces, and leptin furthermore stimulates the proliferation of the lung and airway cells, acting as a kind of stimulatory lung growth factor.

Whenever someone presses the KILL button on a cell, that cell shuts down, and its left and right neighbors become directly connected. The right neighbor recalculates its position and starts executing the deceased's program. Its tasks, in turn, are taken up by the next cell to the right, and so on, until a cell designated as a spare is pressed into service.\n\n【1】Writing programs for any parallel processor is tricky, but the MICTREE array requires an especially unconventional approach.\n\n【2】Instead of giving explicit instructions, the programmer must devise simple rules out of which the desired function will emerge. Being Swiss, Mange demonstrates by building a superreliable stopwatch.\n\n【3】Displaying minutes and seconds requires four cells in a row, one for each digit. The genome allows for two cell types: a counter from zero to nine and a counter from zero to five. An oscillator feeds one pulse per second into the rightmost cell. After 10 pulses, this cell cycles back to zero and sends a pulse to the cell on its left, and so on down the line. The watch takes up part of an array of 12 cells; when you kill one, the clock transplants itself one cell over and carries on. Obviously, though, there is a limit to its resilience: the whole thing will fail after, at most, eight kills.\n\n【4】The prototype MICTREE cells are hardwired, so their processing power cannot be tailored to a specific application. In a finished product, cells would instead be implemented on a fieldprogrammable gate array, a grid of electronic components that can be reconfigured on the fly [see \"Configurable Computing,\" by John Villasenor and William H. Mangione-Smith; S CIENTIFIC A MERICAN , June 1997]. Mange's team is now custom-designing a gate array,\n\n【5】 known as MUXTREE (multiplexer tree), that is optimized for artificial cells. In the biological metaphor, the components of this array are the \"molecules\" that constitute a cell. Each consists of a logic gate, a data bit and a string of configuration bits that determines the function of this gate.\n\n【6】Building a cell out of such molecules offers not only flexibility but also extra endurance. Each molecule contains two copies of the gate and three of the storage bit. If the two gates ever give different results, the molecule kills itself for the greater good of the cell. As a last gasp, the molecule sends its data bit (preserved by the triplicate storage) and configuration to its right neighbor, which does the same, and the process continues until the rightmost molecule transfers its data to a spare. This second level of fault tolerance prevents a single error from wiping out an entire cell.\n\n【7】A total of 2,000 molecules, divided into four 20-by-25 cells, make up the BioWall—the giant digital clock that Mange’s team has just put on display. Each molecule is enclosed in a small box and includes a KILL button and an LED display. Some molecules are configured to perform computations; others serve as pixels in the clock display. Making liberal use of the KILL buttons, I did my utmost to crash the system, something I’m usually quite good at. But the plucky clock just wouldn't submit. The clock display did start to look funny—numerals bent over as their pixels shifted to the right—but at least it was still legible, unlike most faulty electronic signs.\n\n【8】That said, the system did suffer from display glitches, which Mange attributed mainly to timing problems. Although the processing power is decentralized, the cells still rely on a central oscillator to coordinate their communications; sometimes they fall out of sync. Another Embryonics team, led by Andy Tyrrell of the University of York in England, has been studying making the cells asynchronous, like their biological counterparts. Cells would generate handshaking signals to orchestrate data transfers. The present system is also unable to catch certain types of error, including damaged configuration strings. Tyrrell's team has proposed adding watchdog molecules—an immune system—that would monitor the configurations (and one another) for defects.\n\n【9】Although these systems demand an awful lot of overhead, so do other fault-tolerance technologies. \"While Embryonics appears to be heavy on redundancy, it actually is not that bad when compared to other systems,\" Tyrrell argues. Moreover, MUXTREE should be easier to scale down to the nano level; the \"molecules\" are simple enough to really be molecules. Says Mange, “We are preparing for the situation where electronics will be at the same scale as biology.\" On a philosophical level, Embryonics comes very close to the dream of building a self-replicating machine. It may not be quite as dramatic as a robot that can go down to Radio Shack, pull parts off the racks, and take them home to resolder a connection or build a loving mate. But the effect is much the same. Letting machines determine their own destiny—whether reconfiguring themselves on a silicon chip or reprogramming themselves using a neural network or genetic algorithm—sounds scary, but perhaps we should be gratified that machines are becoming more like us: imperfect, fallible but stubbornly resourceful.\n\n【10】—George Musser, imperfect but resourceful staff editor and writer", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "ful though it may seem, this redundancy allows the array to ", "bbox": [63.0, 86.0, 351.0, 101.0]}, {"text": "withstand the loss of any cell.

Neuroprotective agents with anticonvulsant properties such as thiopental 196 and single-dose diazepam or magnesium or both198 given after ROSC have not improved neurological outcome in survivors. No studies have addressed whether anticonvulsant therapy improves outcome after cardiac arrest, and several studies demonstrated that post– cardiac arrest seizures were refractory to traditional anticonvulsant agents. 199–201 The same anticonvulsant regimens for the treatment of seizures used for status epilepticus caused by other etiologies may be considered after cardiac arrest. (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【9】 Corticosteroids have an essential role in the physiological response to severe stress, including maintenance of vascular tone and capillary permeability. In the post–cardiac arrest phase, several authors report a relative adrenal insufficiency compared with the metabolic demands of the body. 188,189 Relative adrenal insufficiency in the post–cardiac arrest phase was associated with higher rates of mortality. 188–190 At present there are no human randomized trials investigating corticosteroid use after ROSC. One investigation combined steroid therapy with use of vasopressin, which made interpretation of results specific to steroids impossible. 191 The post–cardiac arrest syndrome has similarities to septic shock, but the efficacy of corticosteroids remains controversial in patients with sepsis as well. 68 , 192 – 194 Whether the provision of corticosteroids in the post–cardiac arrest phase improves outcome remains unknown and the value of the routine use of corticosteroids for patients with ROSC following cardiac arrest is uncertain.\n\n【10】 The molecular events that cause neurodegeneration after cardiac arrest occur over hours to days after ROSC. This time course suggests a potentially broad therapeutic window for neuroprotective drug therapy. However, the number of clinical trials performed to date is limited and has failed to demonstrate improved neurological outcome with potential neuroprotective drugs given after cardiac arrest.\n\n【11】Few neuroprotective drugs have been tested in clinical trials, and only one published randomized trial 202 was performed in which a neuroprotective drug was combined with therapeutic hypothermia. No neuroprotection benefit was observed when patients (without hypothermia) were treated with thiopental, glucocorticoids, nimodipine, lidoflazine, diazepam, and magnesium sulfate. One trial using coenzyme Q10 in patients receiving hypothermia failed to show improved survival with good neurological outcome. 202 The routine use of coenzyme Q10 in patients treated with hypothermia is uncertain (Class IIb, LOE B).\n\n【12】 Hemofiltration has been proposed as a method to modify the humoral response to the ischemic-reperfusion injury that occurs after cardiac arrest. In a single randomized controlled trial there was no difference in 6-month survival among the groups. 195 Future investigations are required to determine whether hemofiltration will improve outcome in post–cardiac arrest patients.\n\n【13】 Brain injury is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in post–cardiac arrest patients. Brain injury is the cause of death in 68% of patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and in 23% after in-hospital cardiac arrest. 13 The pathophysiology of post– cardiac arrest brain injury involves a complex cascade of molecular events that are triggered by ischemia and reperfusion and then executed over hours to days after ROSC. Events and conditions in the post–cardiac arrest period have the potential to exacerbate or attenuate these injury pathways and impact ultimate outcomes. Clinical manifestations of post–cardiac arrest brain injury include coma, seizures, myoclonus, various degrees of neurocognitive dysfunction (ranging from memory deficits to persistent vegetative state), and brain death. 3\n\n【14】 The goal of post–cardiac arrest management is to return patients to their prearrest functional level. However, many patients will die, remain permanently unresponsive, or remain permanently unable to perform independent activities. Early prognostication of neurological outcome is an essential component of post– cardiac arrest care. Most importantly, when decisions to limit or withdraw life-sustaining care are being considered, tools used to prognosticate poor outcome must be accurate and reliable with a false-positive rate (FPR) approaching 0%.\n\n【15】Poor outcome is defined as death, persistent unresponsiveness, or the inability to undertake independent activities after 6 months. 203 No prearrest or intra-arrest parameters (including arrest duration, bystander CPR, or presenting rhythm) alone or in combination accurately predict outcome in individual patients who achieve ROSC.\n\n【16】A thorough neurological evaluation is needed to obtain accurate prognostic findings. No postarrest physical examination finding or diagnostic study has as yet predicted poor outcome of comatose cardiac arrest survivors during the first 24 hours after ROSC. After 24 hours somatosensory evoked\n\n【17】 Whether there is any disease-specific management of seizures after cardiac arrest remains unknown and the true incidence of post–cardiac arrest electrographic seizures may be higher as the clinical diagnosis of seizures may not be readily apparent. It is accepted in other settings that prolonged, untreated seizures are detrimental to the brain, and seizures are common after ROSC, occurring in 5% to 20% of comatose cardiac arrest survivors with or without therapeutic hypothermia. 11,196,197\n\n【18】 Downloaded from http://circ.ahajournals.org/ by guest on September 4, 2011", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "Steroids", "bbox": [60.0, 160.0, 113.0, 174.0]}], "type": "Section-header", "position": 3}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Neuroprotective Drugs", "bbox": [404.0, 345.0, 547.0, 359.0]}], "type": "Section-header", "position": 4}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Hemofiltration", "bbox": [60.0, 468.0, 154.0, 482.0]}], "type": "Section-header", "position": 5}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Central Nervous System", "bbox": [135.0, 606.0, 301.0, 622.0]}], "type": "Section-header", "position": 6}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Prognostication of Neurological Outcome in", "bbox": [414.0, 652.0, 712.0, 667.0]}, {"text": "Comatose Cardiac Arrest Survivors", "bbox": [440.0, 669.0, 685.0, 683.0]}], "type": "Section-header", "position": 7}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Seizure Management", "bbox": [60.0, 838.0, 191.0, 851.0]}], "type": "Section-header", "position": 8}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "to control glucose concentration within a lower range (80 to", "bbox": [60.0, 84.0, 376.0, 99.0]}, {"text": "110 mg/dL [4.4 to 6.1 mmol/L]) should not be implemented", "bbox": [60.0, 100.0, 377.0, 113.0]}, {"text": "after cardiac arrest due to the increased risk of hypoglycemia", "bbox": [60.0, 115.0, 376.0, 129.0]}, {"text": "(Class III, LOE B).", "bbox": [60.0, 131.0, 164.0, 145.0]}], "type": "Text", "position": 9}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "An EEG for the diagnosis of seizure should be performed", "bbox": [417.0, 84.0, 721.0, 99.0]}, {"text": "with prompt interpretation as soon as possible and should be", "bbox": [404.0, 100.0, 720.0, 113.0]}, {"text": "monitored frequently or continuously in comatose patients", "bbox": [403.0, 115.0, 720.0, 129.0]}, {"text": "after ROSC (Class I , LOE C).

Nothing ever works for me, at least not on the first try. So I wasn't too surprised when I had difficulty connecting the modem to my laptop. This computer (which actually belongs to Scientific American , not me) is a Macintosh PowerBook G3—not a state-of-the-art machine, perhaps, but not an antique either. The problem was that the laptop's operating system was OS 8-point-something, whereas the Ricochet modem requires OS 9.0 (and to get optimal performance with Windows machines, you'll need Windows 98, version 2, or better).\n\n【2】I had to ask Vincent Salzillo, our magazine's invaluable Macintosh expert, to upgrade the operating system.\n\n【3】But my troubles were only beginning.\n\n【4】The Ricochet modem can connect to laptops through either a serial port (the traditional interface for an external modem) or a Universal Serial Bus (a newer, faster type of interface). My PowerBook had only a serial port, and the serial cable included with the Ricochet modem didn't fit it. Although the technical support people at Wireless WebConnect! assured me that I could find an adapter at a computer store, I had no luck at the first few places I tried. I finally jury-rigged a connection using two different cables and an adapter between them. Turning on the modem, I muttered under my breath, \"If this works, I am Houdini.\" It didn't work, of course. But after a few more calls to the technical support folks (I needed a newer version of the installation software), the modem beeped to life, and my Internet Explorer home page appeared on the laptop's screen. I felt a surge of elation: I was wireless!\n\n【5】My first impulse was to check the modem's speed, so I went to the Microsoft Network's Bandwidth Speed Test (msn.\n\n【6】zdnet.com/partners/msn/bandwidth/speed test500.htm), which measures the transmission rate of an Internet connection by\n\n【7】 downloading a whopping data file to your computer. My elation ebbed somewhat when the result came in: 74 kbps, or less than 60 percent of the promised speed. When I tested the modem again an hour later, the data rate had risen to 98\n\n【8】 kbps, but when I checked a third time the rate had fallen to 43 kbps.\n\n【9】I suspected that my Rube Goldberg– style cable hookup might be slowing the flow.

Administration of high-dose insulin in patients with shock refractory to other measures may be considered (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【1】Although the ideal human dose has not been determined, a commonly used protocol calls for IV administration of 1 U/kg regular insulin as a bolus, accompanied by 0.5 g/kg dextrose, followed by continuous infusions of 0.5 to 1 U/kg per hour of insulin and 0.5 g/kg per hour of dextrose. 269 The insulin infusion is titrated as needed to achieve adequate hemodynamic response, whereas the dextrose infusion is titrated to maintain serum glucose concentrations of 100 to 250 mg/dL (5.5 to 14 mmol/L).\n\n【2】Very frequent serum glucose monitoring (up to every 15 minutes) may be needed during the initial phase of dextrose titration. Sustained infusions of concentrated dextrose solutions (> 10%) require central venous access. Insulin causes potassium to shift into the cells. Moderate hypokalemia is common during high-dose insulin-euglycemia therapy, and animals treated with aggressive potassium repletion developed asystole. 266 To avoid overly aggressive potassium repletion, 1 human protocol targets potassium levels of 2.5 to 2.8 mEq/L. 269\n\n【3】## Calcium\n\n【4】\n One human case report 270 and a large-animal study 271 suggest that calcium may be helpful in β -blocker overdose. Administration of calcium in patients with shock refractory to other measures may be considered (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【5】One approach is to administer 0.3 mEq/kg of calcium (0.6 mL/kg of 10% calcium gluconate solution or 0.2 mL/kg of 10% calcium chloride solution) IV over 5 to 10 minutes, followed by an infusion of 0.3 mEq/kg per hour. 269 The infusion rate is titrated to adequate hemodynamic response.\n\n【6】Serum ionized calcium levels should be monitored, and severe hypercalcemia (ionized calcium levels greater than twice the upper limits of normal) should be avoided. Sustained infusions of IV calcium require central venous access.\n\n【7】## Other Therapies\n\n【8】\n Case reports have suggested that in patients who remain critically hypotensive despite maximal vasopressor therapy, specific interventions using intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation, ventricular assist devices, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or other extra corporeal life support (ECLS) devices may be lifesaving. 272 -274 While evidence remains weak, at least two human case reports indicate a possible benefit from lipid emulsion infusion for overdose by β -blockers. 275,276 Animal studies are mixed. 277–280 Because this area of therapy is rapidly evolving, 281– 283 prompt consultation with a medical toxicologist or other specialists with up-to-date knowledge is recommended when managing treatment-refractory hypotension from β -blocker overdosage.\n\n【9】## Calcium Channel Blockers\n\n【10】\n There are no data to support the use of specific antidotes in the setting of cardiac arrest due to calcium channel blocker overdose. Resuscitation from cardiac arrest should follow standard BLS and ACLS algorithms.\n\n【11】Calcium channel blocker overdose also may cause lifethreatening hypotension and bradycardia that are refractory to\n\n【12】 standard agents. Treatment with high-dose insulin has been described in a number of clinical case reports 284 – 295 and animal studies. 296–299 High-dose insulin, in the doses listed in the β -blocker section above, may be effective for restoring hemodynamic stability and improving survival in the setting of severe cardiovascular toxicity associated with toxicity from a calcium channel blocker overdose (Class IIb, LOE B).\n\n【13】Limited evidence supports the use of calcium in the treatment of hemodynamically unstable calcium channel overdose refractory other blocker to treatments. 285,286,289,290,292–294,297,300–303 Administration of calcium in patients with shock refractory to other measures may be considered (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【14】There is insufficient and conflicting evidence to recommend the use of glucagon 289,290,294,296,297,300,303–306 in the treatment of hemodynamically unstable calcium channel blocker overdose.\n\n【15】## Digoxin And Related Cardiac Glycosides\n\n【16】\n Digoxin poisoning can cause severe bradycardia and lifethreatening arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and high degrees of AV nodal blockade. Other plant- and animal-derived cardiac glycosides may produce similar effects, including those found in oleander, lily-of-the-valley, toad skin, and some herbal medications.\n\n【17】There are no data to support the use of specific antidotes in the setting of cardiac arrest due to digoxin overdose. Resuscitation from cardiac arrest should follow standard BLS and ACLS algorithms, with specific antidotes used in the postcardiac arrest phase if severe cardiotoxicity is encountered.\n\n【18】Antidigoxin Fab antibodies should be administered to patients with severe life-threatening cardiac glycoside toxicity (Class I, LOE B). 307–316 One vial of antidigoxin Fab is standardized to neutralize 0.5 mg of digoxin. Although the ideal dose is unknown, a reasonable strategy is as follows:\n\n【19】 • If the ingested dose of digoxin is known, administer 2 vials of Fab for every milligram of digoxin ingested.\n\n【20】In cases of chronic digoxin toxicity or when the ingested dose is not known, calculate the number of vials to administer by using the following formula: serum digoxin concentration (ng/mL) × weight (kg)/100.\n\n【21】• In critical cases in which therapy is required before a serum digoxin level can be obtained or in cases of life-threatening toxicity due to cardiac glycosides, administer empirically 10 to 20 vials.\n\n【22】 Hyperkalemia is a marker of severity in acute cardiac glycoside poisoning and is associated with poor prognosis. 317 Antidigoxin Fab may be administered empirically to patients with acute poisoning from digoxin or related cardiac glycosides whose serum potassium level exceeds 5.0 mEq/L. 318\n\n【23】## Cocaine\n\n【24】\n There are no data to support the use of cocaine-specific interventions in the setting of cardiac arrest due to cocaine overdose. Resuscitation from cardiac arrest should follow standard BLS and ACLS algorithms, with specific antidotes used in the postresuscitation phase if severe cardiotoxicity or neurotoxicity is encountered.

{"seq_id": "bb219c84-95db-4a92-b2ae-fea2c8cefc18", "title": null, "text": "【0】页码:10\n\n【1】## The Legal\n\n【2】\n Where Abortion Is Legal\n\n【3】 *Rate per 100,000 live births; refers to any deaths associated with delivery\n\n【4】 SOURCES: Alan Guttmacher Institute (abortion rate data); Population Action International\n\n【5】 age of women using contraception rose from 19 to 24 percent, and the abortion rate dropped from 109 per 1,000 women to 76 per 1,000 women, according to Susan A. Cohen of the Alan Guttmacher Institute. The federation, however, now stands to lose $5 million in U.S.\n\n【6】AID money as a result of President Bush's rule. \"The construction of a firewall between abortion services and family planning means that when a woman gets an abortion, family planning is not there,\" contends Steven Biel, spokesperson for Population Action International. \"We know that the time when women are most motivated to get contraception is following an abortion, when they have just gone through the horrible experience of terminating a pregnancy.\" In places where abortion is illegal, the policy may not reverse trends away from abortion but instead may impair physicians' ability to take care of patients. Although the rule stipulates that organizations can treat women suffering from postabortion complications, many providers may become too scared to do even this, Biel says. \"The result we have seen most is that groups tend to overrespond and distance themselves from anything that has to do with abortion,\" he observes. Therefore, clinics may not keep manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) equipment on the premises, even though it is needed to treat postabortion distress (often caused by back-alley operations).\n\n【7】More than 78,000 women die every year from botched abortions. \"If you have ever seen a woman hemorrhage to death, you never want to see it again,\" says Adrienne Germain, president of the International Women's\n\n【8】 PROTESTERS in Brazil rally against\n\n【9】 the Bush family-planning decision.\n\n【10】 Health Coalition. \"It is one of the worst possible deaths.\" Women's groups that advocate safe abortion and receive U.S. funding will have to forfeit their right to speak. If they decide to forgo aid, they will lose money for contraceptives. That, in turn, may lead to more abortions—one of the policy's greatest ironies. Women who do not use contraception are nearly six times more likely to have an abortion than women who do, according to Cohen. Even absent the Mexico City Policy— which applies only to the $425-million family-planning budget of U.S. AID —the United Nations reports that there is a worldwide shortfall of $3.6 billion in meeting demands for family-planning services. This unmet need is reflected in 80 million unwanted pregnancies every year. \"We have more and more women who are interested in delaying or avoiding pregnancy,\" says John Bongaarts of the Population Council. \"All these women need contraception.\" They also need condoms to prevent the transmission of HIV. At least 34 million people worldwide have AIDS or are infected with HIV. And there are some 5.4 million additional HIV infections every year, out of a total of 333 million new cases of sexually transmitted disease, according to U.N. reports. U.S.\n\n【11】AID estimates that the paperwork involved in enforcing the Mexico City Policy—which requires certification by each organization and each group that subcontracts from it—will cost more than $500,000. That is equivalent to more than 19,379,000 condoms wholesale.\n\n【12】## Ultimate Stop Motion An Experimental Tour De Force Puts Pulses Of Light On Ice   By Graham P. Collins\n\n【13】\n ight is the fleetest of phenomena. Indeed, \"the speed of light\" is synonymous with the universe's ultimate speed limit. Yet even light slows down when it has to slog its way through matter—glass or optical fiber, for example, cuts light back to about 70 per-\n\n【14】 cent of its top speed, which is still fast enough to circumnavigate the earth five times in a second. Two and a half years ago physicists demonstrated how a specially prepared gas could slow light by a factor of 20 million, to the pace of a speeding bicycle.

Small farmers can see results in a demonstration plot and, if they want, try it themselves on a portion of their farm. If it works for them, they can expand or repeat it the next year. We have programs like this in Mexico, India and parts of Africa. By the third or fourth year, if it's working, the farmers will have made enough money from the experimentation phase to be able to run essentially on their own.\n\n【1】## And What About Profits For Monsanto?\n\n【2】\n We sell the seeds and the herbicide at market prices, and we subsidize the learning, the testing and the development of distribution channels so that we don't actually make a profit in the first several years. Only if the project is successful enough to become self-sustaining will we start making a profit. At this point, we haven't gotten that far with any of these programs.\n\n【3】 Let’s turn to the environmental effects of GM crops. What do you consider the most important benefits of the technology?\n\n【4】Lower use of pesticides is the environmental benefit that people relate to immediately, and it's huge for a product like Bt cotton.\n\n【5】[Editors' note: Bt crops have been genetically modified to pro¬ duce a bacterial protein that kills certain insect pests.] According to a recent report, 2.7 million pounds of pesticides have not been used in the past four years, and many, many more won't be used in the future as biotech expands in acreage and in traits.\n\n【6】Beyond that there are also yield benefits. The Bt corn we have today doesn't displace a whole lot of insecticides, but what it does do is boost the yields by a noticeable margin. It depends on the year and on the region, but the increase in yield can range from 5 to 15 percent. If you think about it, that leverages land use, water use, fertilizer use and all the pesticides that go into growing corn. You get a 10 percent greater corn harvest with the same resources that you were going to use anyway. You're getting more out of your resources.\n\n【7】Getting more from really good farmland, then setting aside land that is of marginal quality and returning it to habitat for wildlife is very beneficial to the environment. We can't continue to indefinitely expand our old practices—of chemical use, of water diversion, of plowing wild lands and converting them to farms, of nonagricultural sprawl and of the production of industrial waste.\n\n【8】 One of the benefits of biotech that we first heard about was nutritionally enhanced foods. But despite promises of healthier broccoli, we have Bt corn. The famous “golden rice” is not available to consumers yet and is still in very early stages of testing. Will we ever have nutritionally enhanced foods?\n\n【9】We're seeing progress across industry, academia and the nonprofit community. For example, we are collaborating with a nonprofit group, TERI [Tata Energy Research Institute] in India, on development of a product related to golden rice—golden mustard oil—that, like golden rice, is high in beta-carotene, a pre-\n\n【10】 cursor of vitamin A. This may help alleviate vitamin A deficiencies in places where mustard oil is a staple in the local diet.\n\n【11】While making improvements to food for the industrial world is not a priority for Monsanto, other companies and university researchers are working hard in this area. For example, Du Pont has developed a modified oil with an increased amount of the fatty acid oleic acid. This product has reduced levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids and is more stable upon storage.\n\n【12】Efforts are under way to modify other fatty acids to make oils more healthy for consumers. Also, there is research ongoing elsewhere to increase the amount of vitamin D in soybean oil.\n\n【13】Monsanto and other scientists have also been involved in research that may help reduce the likelihood of allergic responses to foods. We have been able to take a protein that is currently an allergen and modify specific amino acids in the protein to dramatically reduce the allergenic nature of the protein. Other scientists are using this and other methods to reduce the allergenic nature of some foods, such as peanuts and soybeans, which cause allergic reactions in a significant number of people.\n\n【14】## Monsanto Has Been One Of The Most Criticized, Even Despised, Corporations Because Of Its Role In The Development Of Genetically Modified Foods. Has It Ever Been Hard To Tell People\n\n【15】\n you’re an employee of Monsanto?\n\n【16】I've had a few people react negatively, but my experience is that when people meet you as a person, their reactions are very different than when they are commenting on the big nameless, faceless company.\n\n【17】I think the company is making an effort to address people's concerns about GM foods more openly. We've recognized that some genetic modifications are particularly bothersome. Among vegetarians, for instance, the idea of eating a vegetable that has an animal gene in it might raise questions. For certain cultures or religious groups, there could be similar concerns. So we decided it was better to avoid using animal genes in food crops.\n\n【18】I don't think it serves anybody's interest—including Monsanto's—to discount the potential risks of biotechnology. But for where we are today, and for what I see in the pipeline for the next few years, I really don't see a measurable risk from the GM products we are selling or developing. There have been numerous national and international scientific organizations that have reached this same conclusion, including the American Medical Association, the National Academy of Sciences, the World Health Organization and many others.\n\n【19】We at Monsanto have recently pledged to listen better to and engage in dialogue with concerned groups, to be more transparent in the methods we use and the data we have about safety, to respect the cultural and ethical concerns of others, to share our technology with developing countries, and to make sure we deliver real benefits to our customers and to the environment. I think this new attitude and new set of commitments will help improve both our company's image and the acceptance of this new technology.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "such as high-yielding corn hybrids, and I think we can use it in", "bbox": [61.0, 86.0, 394.0, 101.0]}, {"text": "the future with biotech products.

It is constituted by a palato¬ sagittal expansion screw, cemented at 90° to obtain bilateral molar distalization. The screw is linked to the bands of the first upper molars and to the upper second premolars (or on the upper second deciduous molars). Anchorage is ac¬ complished by a Nance button that is soldered to the body of the screw. The screw is activated twice a week. Knowing that each activation equals 0.2 mm, the appliance distalizes approximately 1.5 mm per month. The complete correction of a Class II molar relation (approximately 5 mm) will require, in average, 3 and a half months of treatment. At the end of the active phase of distalization, the screw is ferulized or blocked with acrylic and the arms that link the screw to the bands of the second premolars are cut off. The appliance now becomes a ferulized screw, a Nance button with bands on the molars. (1,36,45,49)\n Fig. 91. Passive Veltri.\n Fig. 92. Passive Veltri.\n Fig. 93. Active Veltri.\n Fig. 94.

There are also those that are not physiologic. like suction, that can be of a thumb or another finger, a pacifier or a lip; mouth breathing, lingual interposition in repose and immature deglutition. (5)\n\n【5】 Non-physiologic oral habits are one of the main etio¬ logic factors that cause malocclusions or dento-skeletal deformities, which can alter the normal development of the stomatognathic system, and can cause an unbalance between the oral and perioral muscle forces, which can finally lead to an osseous deformity that can have major or minor repercussions, depending on the age in which the habit begins; if the habit is picked up at a very young age, more damage will be caused because the bone has more modeling capacity at a very young age. (2) If we act soon we will be more capable of modifying the growth pattern of the jaws and of the dental arches. If we eliminate the deform¬ ing habit before the patient is three years old, the problem usually corrects itself spontaneously. (3.6.7.21.23.25)\n\n【6】 However, it is also certain that for a habit to be established during the growth and development of an infant there are factors that predispose the appearance or not of an oral habit; one of them is breast feeding. Breast feeding contributes much more than optimum feeding to the infant, because it has immunologic factors, anti- inflam¬ matory cells, growth factors, enzymes and hormones, that complement the development capacity of the child, it also benefits the overall health of the mother, it strengthens the bond between the mother and child and, during nursing, the set of oral muscles are stimulated and the structures of the stomatognathic system are mobilized,\n\n【7】 thus stimulating normal growth and development. Nev¬ ertheless, if the child is bottle fed, the suckling baby does not close his lips with the same force as a breast fed baby; the action of the tongue to regulate the excessive flow of milk is affected and all this brings as a consequence a weaker stimulation of the oral muscles and it will not promote the adequate growth and development of the stomatognathic system, which will favor the acquisition of non-nutritive sucking habits as thumb or finger suc¬ tion, pacifier, labial, or other object suction. The presence of some of these habits can alter the occlusal pattern in later stages of development of the child. (7)\n\n【8】 Some studies indicate that 81.8% of infants that were bottle fed had some type of non-nutritive sucking habit and 88.2% of infants that were breast fed did not have any non-nutritive sucking habit. (7)\n\n【9】 The consequences of the lack of breast feeding are inad¬ equate suction and deglutition patterns, which will affect the development of the stomatognathic system of the newborn causing occlusal alterations.

Intermittent or continuous sedation and/or analgesia can be used to achieve specific goals. Patients with post– cardiac arrest cognitive dysfunction may display agitation or frank delirium with purposeless movement and are at risk of self-injury. Opioids, anxiolytics, and sedative-hypnotic agents can be used in various combinations to improve patient-ventilator interaction and blunt the stress-related surge of endogenous catecholamines. Other agents with sedative and antipsychotic-tranquilizer properties, such as α 2 -adrenergic agonists,¹ 26 and butyrophenones¹ 27 are also used based on individual clinical circumstances.\n\n【3】If patient agitation is life-threatening, neuromuscular blocking agents can be used for short intervals with adequate sedation. Caution should be used in patients at high risk of seizures unless continuous electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring is available. In general sedative agents should be administered cautiously with daily interruptions and titrated to the desired effect. A number of sedation scales 128 – 133 and motor activity scales 134 were developed to titrate these pharmacological interventions to a clinical goal.\n\n【4】Shorter-acting medications that can be used as a single bolus or continuous infusion are usually preferred. There is little evidence to guide sedation/analgesia therapy immediately after ROSC. One observational study 135 found an association between use of sedation and development of pneumonia in intubated patients during the first 48 hours of therapy. However, the study was not designed to investigate sedation as a risk factor for either pneumonia or death in patients with cardiac arrest.\n\n【5】Although minimizing sedation allows a better clinical estimate of neurological status, sedation, analgesia, and occasionally neuromuscular relaxation are routinely used to facilitate induced hypothermia and to control shivering. The duration of neuromuscular blocker use should be minimized and the depth of neuromuscular blockade should be monitored with a nerve twitch stimulator.\n\n【6】It is reasonable to consider the titrated use of sedation and analgesia in critically ill patients who require mechanical ventilation or shivering suppression during induced hypothermia after cardiac arrest (Class IIb, LOE C). Duration of neuromuscular blocking agents should be kept to a minimum or avoided altogether.\n\n【7】## Cardiovascular System\n\n【8】\n ACS is a common cause of cardiac arrest. 14,16,34,35,134–147 The clinician should evaluate the patient's 12-lead ECG and cardiac markers after ROSC. A 12-lead ECG should be obtained as soon as possible after ROSC to determine whether acute ST elevation is present (Class I, LOE B).\n\n【9】Because it is impossible to determine the final neurological status of comatose patients in the first hours after ROSC, aggressive treatment of ST-elevation myocardial infarction\n\n【10】 (STEMI) should begin as in non–cardiac arrest patients, regardless of coma or induced hypothermia. Because of the high incidence of acute coronary ischemia, consideration of emergent coronary angiography may be reasonable even in the absence of STEMI. 14.16 Notably, PCI, alone or as part of a bundle of care, is associated with improved myocardial function 14 and neurological outcomes. 11.16 Therapeutic hypothermia can be safely combined with primary PCI after cardiac arrest caused by AMI. 11,31,33–35 Other details of ACS treatment are discussed in Part 10.\n\n【11】Patients with cardiac arrest may receive antiarrhythmic drugs such as lidocaine or amiodarone during initial resuscitation. There is no evidence to support or refute continued or prophylactic administration of these medications. 7.148–152\n\n【12】## Vasoactive Drugs For Use In Post–Cardiac Arrest Patients\n\n【13】\n## Vasopressors\n\n【14】\n Vasoactive drugs may be administered after ROSC to support cardiac output, especially blood flow to the heart and brain.\n\n【15】Drugs may be selected to improve heart rate (chronotropic effects), myocardial contractility (inotropic effects), or arterial pressure (vasoconstrictive effects), or to reduce afterload (vasodilator effects). Unfortunately many adrenergic drugs are not selective and may increase or decrease heart rate and afterload, increase cardiac arrhythmias, and increase myocardial ischemia by creating a mismatch between myocardial oxygen demand and delivery. Myocardial ischemia, in turn, may further decrease heart function. Some agents may also have metabolic effects that increase blood glucose, lactate, and metabolic rate. There is a paucity of data about which vasoactive drug to select first, although providers should become familiar with the differing adverse effects associated with these drugs, which might make a particular agent more or less appropriate for a specific patient. 153 Specific drug infusion rates cannot be recommended because of variations in pharmacokinetics (relation between drug dose and concentration) and pharmacodynamics (relation between drug concentration and effect) in critically ill patients, 154 , 155 so commonly used initial dose ranges are listed in Table 2. Vasoactive drugs must be titrated at the bedside to secure the intended effect while limiting side effects. Providers must also be aware of the concentrations delivered and compatibilities with previously and concurrently administered drugs.\n\n【16】In general, adrenergic drugs should not be mixed with sodium bicarbonate or other alkaline solutions in the IV line because there is evidence that adrenergic agents are inactivated in alkaline solutions. 156 , 157 Norepinephrine (levarterenol) and other catecholamines that activate α -adrenergic receptors may produce tissue necrosis if extravasation occurs.\n\n【17】Therefore, administration through a central line is preferred whenever possible. If extravasation develops, infiltrate 5 to 10 mg of phentolamine diluted in 10 to 15 mL of saline into the site of extravasation as soon as possible to prevent tissue death and sloughing.\n\n【18】 Downloaded from http://circ.ahajournals.org/ by guest on September 4, 2011", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "presumed or known pulmonary embolism, fibrinolytics may", "bbox": [60.0, 84.0, 376.0, 99.0]}, {"text": "be considered (Class IIb, LOE C).", "bbox": [60.0, 100.0, 242.0, 114.0]}], "type": "Text", "position": 3}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Sedation After Cardiac Arrest", "bbox": [60.0, 128.0, 250.0, 143.0]}], "type": "Section-header", "position": 4}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Patients with coma or respiratory dysfunction after ROSC are", "bbox": [60.0, 145.0, 375.0, 158.0]}, {"text": "routinely intubated and maintained on mechanical ventilation", "bbox": [60.0, 160.0, 376.0, 173.0]}, {"text": "for a period of time, which results in discomfort, pain, and", "bbox": [60.0, 175.0, 376.0, 189.0]}, {"text": "anxiety.

So when we design our\n\n【5】 appliances it is very important to evaluate the forces that they will generate during treatment. (12)\n\n【6】 Teeth are united to the maxillary bones by a peculiar type of joint, the dentoalveolar joint, different from any other present in the rest of the human body. This union is done by the periodontal insertion, represented by dental cement, periodontal ligament and alveolar bone. The periodontal ligament occupies a space of approximately 0.5 mm between the alveolar wall and the tooth cement and it is responsible for the dental joint. It is made out of collagen fibers that insert themselves in the root cement and in the alveolar bone intermingling with blood vessels, cellular elements, nerve endings and interstitial fluids. (14)\n\n【7】 Blood vessels are responsible for the periodontal ligament nourishment, and will provide a way of access for the cells responsible of bone remodeling. Existing nerve endings will transmit pressure sensation and proprioception. Peri¬ odontal fibers and interstitial fluids will provide together, during brief time periods, an effective physiologic force dissipater and shock absorption system. (3)\n\n【8】 When a force is applied to a tooth, it dislocates itself in the interior of the alveolar space, stretching some periodontal fibers and compressing other periodontal fibers. Simulta¬ neously, the liquid that fills the spaces between the fibers is compressed against the bone walls provoking a hydraulic resistance to tooth movement. 131 At this moment, the load is transferred to the alveolar bone and due to its porosity, the interstitial liquid drains toward neighboring tissues, diminishing the hydraulic pressure. This way, the root gets even closer to the alveolar wall, compressing the peri¬ odontal ligament closer to the side the force was applied", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "and the center of resistance of the tooth.", "bbox": [68.0, 83.0, 297.0, 99.0]}, {"text": "This distance (in a perpendicular way) is", "bbox": [69.0, 101.0, 297.0, 116.0]}, {"text": "the cause of moment in the tooth, giving", "bbox": [68.0, 118.0, 297.0, 133.0]}, {"text": "dental rotation as a result.

Cardiac arrest due to toxicity is managed in accordance with the current standards of BLS and ACLS. With few exceptions, there are no unique antidotes or toxin-specific interventions that are recommended during resuscitation from cardiac arrest.\n\n【4】Once return of spontaneous circulation is achieved, urgent\n\n【5】 consultation with a medical toxicologist or certified regional poison center is recommended, as the postarrest management of the critically poisoned patient may benefit from a thorough understanding of the toxic agent. Consultation is also recommended early in the management of a patient with potentially life-threatening poisoning, when appropriate interventions might prevent deterioration to cardiac arrest. In the United States a certified poison center can be reached by calling 1-800-222- 1222; in Canada, call 1-800-268-9017.\n\n【6】It is extremely difficult to conduct clinical trials of acute life-threatening poisoning. Challenges include the infrequency with which most specific conditions occur, the heterogeneity of presentation, and ethical challenges related to withholding established care from patients who are unable to provide informed consent because the patient has an altered mental status, the patient is suicidal, or there is a lack of time to explain treatment alternatives. 219 The majority of questions addressing cardiac arrest due to\n\n【7】 drug toxicity remain unanswered. Epidemiological studies are required to document the incidence rate of cardiac arrests secondary to drug toxicity and the safety and efficacy baseline rates for current therapeutic strategies. This section presents recommendations for the care of the patient with a toxicological problem causing cardiac arrest or severe cardiovascular instability (respiratory depression, hypotension, life-threatening alterations of cardiac conduction, etc). Some recommendations are evidence-based, but most research in this area consists of case reports, small case series, animal studies, and pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers. Virtually no toxicology research involves human cardiac arrest. Thus, many of these recommendations are based on expert consensus, and further research is needed to validate them.\n\n【8】## Initial Approach To The Critically Poisoned Patient\n\n【9】\n Management of the critically poisoned patient begins with airway protection, support of respiration and circulation, and rapid assessment. Patients may or may not be able to provide an accurate history of exposure to a toxic substance. Whenever possible, history gathering should include questioning of persons\n\n【10】 who accompany the patient, evaluation of containers, review of pharmacy records, and examination of the patient's prior medical record. 220 Many patients who ingest medications in a suicide attempt take more than 1 substance, and the number of substances ingested is greater in fatal than in nonfatal suicide attempts. 221 Comprehensive toxicology laboratory testing is virtually never available in a time frame that supports early resuscitation decisions. 222 Poisoned patients may deteriorate rapidly. Care for all adult\n\n【11】 patients who are critically ill or under evaluation for possible toxin exposure or ingestion, particularly when the history is uncertain, should begin in a monitored treatment area where the development of central nervous system depression, hemodynamic instability, or seizures can be rapidly recognized and addressed. 223 Gastrointestinal decontamination, once a mainstay in the\n\n【12】 management of ingested toxins, has a less significant role in poisoning treatment today. With rare exceptions, gastric lavage, whole bowel irrigation, and administration of syrup of ipecac are no longer recommended. 224 – 226 Administration of single-dose activated charcoal to adsorb ingested toxins is generally recommended for the ingestion of life-threatening poisons for which no adequate antidotal therapy is available and when the charcoal can be administered within 1 hour of poisoning. 228 Multipledose activated charcoal should be considered for patients who have ingested a life-threatening amount of specific toxins (eg, carbamazepine, dapsone, phenobarbital, quinine, or theophylline) for which a benefit of this strategy has been established. 229 Charcoal should not be administered for ingestions of caustic substances, metals, or hydrocarbons. 228 Charcoal should only be administered to patients with an intact or protected airway. In patients who are at risk for aspiration, endotracheal intubation and head-of-bed elevation should be performed before charcoal administration. 229,230 Because the decision to perform gastrointestinal decontamination is complex, multifactorial, and associated with risk, expert advice can be helpful.\n\n【13】## Toxidromes\n\n【14】\n A \"toxidrome\" is a clinical syndrome—a constellation of signs, symptoms, and laboratory findings—suggestive of the effects of a specific toxin. By recognizing these presentations, the clinician can establish a working diagnosis that guides initial management. Some common toxidromes are presented in the Table.\n\n【15】Practically every sign and symptom observed in poisoning can be produced by natural disease, and many clinical presentations associated with natural disease can be mimicked by some poison. 231 It is important to maintain a broad differential diagnosis, particularly when the history of toxic chemical exposure is unclear.\n\n【16】## Opioid Toxicity\n\n【17】\n There are no data to support the use of specific antidotes in the setting of cardiac arrest due to opioid overdose. Resuscitation from cardiac arrest should follow standard BLS and ACLS algorithms.\n\n【18】Naloxone is a potent antagonist of the binding of opioid medications to their receptors in the brain and spinal cord.\n\n【19】Administration of naloxone can reverse central nervous system\n\n【20】 Downloaded from http://circ.ahajournals.org/ by guest on September 4, 2011", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "calcium (calcium chloride [10%] 5 to 10 mL OR calcium", "bbox": [60.0, 84.0, 376.0, 99.0]}, {"text": "gluconate [10%] 15 to 30 mL IV over 2 to 5 minutes) may be", "bbox": [60.0, 100.0, 376.0, 113.0]}, {"text": "considered when hyperkalemia or hypermagnesemia is sus-", "bbox": [60.0, 115.0, 375.0, 129.0]}, {"text": "pected as the cause of cardiac arrest (Class IIb, LOE C).", "bbox": [60.0, 131.0, 345.0, 145.0]}], "type": "Text", "position": 3}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Part 12.7: Cardiac Arrest Associated With", "bbox": [73.0, 160.0, 364.0, 176.0]}, {"text": "Toxic Ingestions", "bbox": [163.0, 177.0, 274.0, 192.0]}], "type": "Section-header", "position": 4}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Poisoning has been likened to trauma on the cellular level,", "bbox": [60.0, 194.0, 375.0, 207.0]}, {"text": "destroying the natural workings of a victim's physiology. 218", "bbox": [60.0, 208.0, 376.0, 222.0]}, {"text": "Severe poisoning alters the function of a cellular receptor, ion", "bbox": [60.0, 224.0, 377.0, 238.0]}, {"text": "channel, organelle, or chemical pathway to the extent that critical", "bbox": [60.0, 240.0, 376.0, 254.0]}, {"text": "organ systems can no longer support life.", "bbox": [60.0, 254.0, 269.0, 269.0]}, {"text": "As with any patient in cardiac arrest, management of the", "bbox": [73.0, 271.0, 376.0, 284.0]}, {"text": "patient with a toxic exposure begins with support of airway,", "bbox": [60.0, 286.0, 377.0, 300.0]}, {"text": "breathing, and circulation.

That's the sensory-deprived state of personal computing today. PCs communicate with their users almost exclusively via images and sounds, ignoring all the other cues that humans rely on to perceive the world. Admittedly, interacting with your computer through the senses of smell and taste may not be absolutely essential. But now PC users can try the iFeel mouse, a device from peripherals manufacturer Logitech that adds the all-important sense of touch to desktop computing.\n\n【3】The human brain is exquisitely hardwired for touch. Anatomy textbooks often include a grotesque-looking diagram known as the homunculus, which distorts the human figure to show how much of the brain's sensory processing is devoted to each body part. Because large areas of the cortex interpret signals from the palms and fingers, the hands of the homunculus are enormous. This generous neural capacity allows us to sense minute variations in pressure and to detect barely perceptible vibrations, contributing to our remarkable dexterity.\n\n【4】Over the past two decades, computer scientists have struggled to build electromechanical contraptions that could provide the same kind of tactile feedback. The task has proved difficult: a touch-feedback peripheral must be small enough to fit in a hand, yet it must also offer substantial resistance to the hand's motion. In fact, accurately synthesizing tactile sensations in real time became possible only after recent advances in miniaturization and the introduction of faster microprocessors.\n TOUCH-FEEDBACK MOUSE allows PC users to feel a virtual surface. As the user moves the cursor across the screen, a small motor in the mouse responds to software signals embedded in the program or Web page.\n\n【5】 The first tactile devices to hit the market were designed for medical training.\n\n【6】Doctors-to-be use the instruments to virtually feel the right way to perform a catheterization or a spinal injection. Engineers and architects employ similar devices for computer-assisted design, allowing them to \"touch\" the contours of their three-dimensional models. And for a few years now, computer gamers have been playing with force-feedback joysticks that can simulate a machine gun's recoil or the stresses on an airplane's controls. But no touch-feedback device for general-purpose computing was available until the introduction of the iFeel mouse last year.\n\n【7】 The iFeel looks like an ordinary mouse (albeit one attractively finished in iridescent teal blue). And its retail price is modest—only $10 more than a comparable mouse without touch feedback. There are two models available: a simple symmetrical design that sells for $39 and a $59 premium version that has a contoured shape intended to fit the hand more comfortably.\n\n【8】Both are optical devices that detect movement with reflected light rather than with a less precise trackball.\n\n【9】At the pulsating heart of the new mouse is technology licensed from Immersion Corporation, which pioneered the development of touch-feedback sys-\n\n【10】 PHILIP ANDERSON", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "TECHNICALITIES", "bbox": [44.0, 51.0, 363.0, 99.0]}], "type": "Title", "position": 0}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Touchy-Feely Computing", "bbox": [44.0, 222.0, 509.0, 274.0]}, {"text": "A NEW MOUSE PICKS UP GOOD VIBRATIONS   BY STEVE DITLEA", "bbox": [44.0, 272.0, 429.0, 294.0]}], "type": "Section-header", "position": 1}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Imagine living with just two of your five", "bbox": [45.0, 326.0, 261.0, 342.0]}, {"text": "senses: vision and hearing.

To begin we must give to the patient a rubber object to bite and we must ask the patient to bite the object five minutes without stopping every time the patient feels the urge to bite his or her nails. We can also ask the patient to do the same exercise during five or ten minutes if the patient feels anxious. Another alternative to eliminate the habit is to place night guards on both dental arches covering the occlusal aspects of molars and premolars, in order to slightly lift the bite and to difficult the practice of the habit.\n\n【7】 Therapy with fixed intraoral appliances have demon¬ strated to be an effective tool eliminating finger or thumb sucking habits. 12 These fixed appliances are made of 0.036\" stainless steel wire, soldered to the bands of the upper molars, and they are going to cover the portion of the palate where the finger or thumb is placed during suction. This way, the satisfaction felt by the placement of the finger on the palate is annulled by the presence of the grill. (5,25)\n\n【8】 In this chapter we will show the different options to elimi¬ nate oral habits, these options will be divided in restricting and stimulating appliances.\n\n【9】 I. Restrictors: These appliances posses as only objective to avoid, through \"obstacles\" the continuity of the incorrect function that may or already has altered the occlusion.\n\n【10】These appliances present mechanical barriers like screens, bends and shields, placed where the tongue or other ex¬ ternal elements like fingers have or potentially can create any alteration. (22)\n\n【11】 Among the restrictive appliances we can name:\n\n【12】 Palatine shields.\n\n【13】Tongue shields.\n\n【14】Tongue spurs.\n\n【15】Graber trident.\n\n【16】TCA.\n\n【17】 The palatal grill is one of the most simple and well tolerated appliances and aids in the elimination of finger or thumb sucking habit. (25) The use of this appliance interrupts the finger suck¬ ing habit by impeding the placement of a finger or fingers on the palate, so the child does not feel the satisfaction derived from suction, thus the conduct is eliminated.\n\n【18】Economic and easy to make.\n\n【19】 II. Stimulators: These appliances are intended to thera¬ peutically resolve an altered function, aiding myofunctional therapy. Stimulators are also called Reminders, these ap¬ pliances are going to participate actively in the rehabilita¬ tion program, reeducating in a stable manner the faulty neuromuscular impulses. (22)\n\n【20】 Not well accepted by the patient.\n\n【21】It requires laboratory time to fabricate.\n\n【22】It is important to mention that the use of these appliances can cause certain temporary second¬ ary effects, like alterations in the feeding patterns, phonation and sleep, that will disappear in about three or seven days of use.\n\n【23】 Among these appliances we can find:\n\n【24】 3.\n\n【25】 Lip Bumper.\n\n【26】3.\n\n【27】Trainers.\n\n【28】4.\n\n【29】 1.\n\n【30】 2.\n\n【31】 l.\n\n【32】 3.\n\n【33】 4.\n\n【34】 5,\n\n【35】 2.\n\n【36】 3.\n\n【37】 1.\n\n【38】 2.\n\n【39】 1.\n\n【40】 Tucat pearl.\n\n【41】 2.\n\n【42】 Testa rocker.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "Correction", "bbox": [50.0, 86.0, 120.0, 102.0]}], "type": "Section-header", "position": 3}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Restricting appliances", "bbox": [387.0, 97.0, 555.0, 115.0]}], "type": "Section-header", "position": 4}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Palatal grill", "bbox": [387.0, 150.0, 462.0, 166.0]}], "type": "Section-header", "position": 5}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Advantages", "bbox": [387.0, 610.0, 473.0, 626.0]}], "type": "Section-header", "position": 6}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Disadvantages", "bbox": [387.0, 816.0, 492.0, 833.0]}], "type": "Section-header", "position": 7}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "In order to correct onychophagia, we must first make", "bbox": [50.0, 121.0, 365.0, 137.0]}, {"text": "the patient realize that he or she has a problem, that the", "bbox": [50.0, 139.0, 365.0, 155.0]}, {"text": "patient must want to stop the habit, taking in account that", "bbox": [50.0, 157.0, 365.0, 172.0]}, {"text": "this unsatisfied need to bite obeys to a psychoemotional", "bbox": [50.0, 174.0, 365.0, 189.0]}, {"text": "state of anxiety.

I’M Traveling To The Caribbean And\n\n【1】\n## Plan To Go Scuba Diving, But My Husband Says It’S Not Safe If I Have Asthma. What Should I Do?\n\n【2】\n In the past, asthma of any type and of any severity was viewed as an absolute contraindication to scuba diving.\n\n【3】Scuba diving requires inhalation of dry compressed air though a mouthpiece, which many people find uncomfortable. Scuba diving can, on a more serious note, lead to the development of a condition known as fatal arterial gas embolism and barotrauma. Asthma classically places an individual at increased risk of diving complications because of air trapping, bronchospasm, and mucus plugging in asthmatic airways. Asthma patients were advised that scuba diving was \"off limits,\" although snorkeling on the surface was acceptable. Today, with careful medical screening and medical preparation, some individuals with mild, well-controlled asthma can go scuba diving, after detailed medical evaluation and \"clearance\" by a physician familiar with diving and asthma. Studies performed by physicians with a specialty in diving medicine in the United States and abroad have yielded specific recommendations and guidelines. For example, people with exercise-induced asthma (EIA) should not dive. Similarly, any asthmatic who requires inhalation of an inhaled B 2 agonist \"rescue quick-relief\" inhaler should be prohibited from diving for at least 48 hours following the last dose of bronchodilator.\n\n【4】 Before answering your question, I would need to know more about your asthma, your overall level of fitness, as well as your swimming and diving skills.

In order to take over a person's breathing, the end of the endotracheal tube is connected to a ventilator.

Molly, who was then eight years old, suffered from a potentially fatal genetic blood disorder known as Fanconi anemia. But what made the procedure particularly unusual was that Adam might not have been born had his sister not been sick. He was conceived through in vitro fertilization, and physicians specifically selected his embryo from a group of others for implantation into his mother's womb after tests showed that he would not have the disease and that he would be the best tissue match for Molly.\n\n【4】Was this ethically appropriate? A panel of bioethicists decided that it was, because donating cord blood would have no effect on Adam's health.\n\n【5】Selectively conceiving a potential donor is only one of the myriad ethical issues surrounding umbilical cord blood transplantation. One of the most significant has to do not with how the blood is used but with the marketing campaigns aimed at prospective parents by for-profit companies that offer to collect and store a baby's cord blood—for a hefty fee—in case he or she might need it later.\n\n【6】Such companies market cord blood collection as \"biological insurance\" to expectant parents. But \"the odds are so extraordinarily against their child's ever needing it,\" says Paul Root Wolpe, a fellow at the University of Pennsylvania Health System Center for Bioethics. He fears that parents who can scarcely afford the service might feel impelled to buy it even though their families have no history of blood disorders.\n\n【7】Viacord, a cord blood–preserving company based in Boston, says that just five of their 6,500 clients have so far needed infusions of their stored cord blood. Moreover, only 20 percent have a family history of a blood disorder or are now in treatment.\n\n【8】The American Academy of Pediatrics issued a policy statement on umbilical cord blood banking in July 1999 cautioning that \"it is difficult to recommend that parents store their children's cord blood for future use\" unless a family member has had a blood disorder. Instead it encouraged parents to donate their baby's cord blood to public banks.\n\n【9】Questions have been raised in the past concerning the ownership of cord blood. But bioethicist Jeremy Sugarman of Duke University states that it is now fairly clear that although an infant owns his or her own cord blood, parents have legal guardianship over it—just as they do over the child—until he or she reaches age 18. Sugarman and Wolpe contributed to a 1997 consensus statement on the ethics of umbilical cord blood banking in the Journal of the American Medical Association .\n\n【10】Sugarman adds that it is perfectly appropriate for a parent to use one sibling's cord blood to treat another. If the first child develops a need for a transplantation later on, the fact that the parents already used his or her stored blood is unfortunate but not unethical.\n\n【11】Of more concern is how to ensure the safety of cord blood donated to cord banks.\n\n【12】What happens if parents donate a newborn's cord blood to a public bank and the child develops leukemia years later? If the donated blood has no identifying information to link it to the donor, there would be no way to prevent it from being used in another child. Stem cells in the umbilical cord blood of a child who later gets leukemia could also cause leukemia in a recipient. But keeping permanent records of donors carries privacy risks: What if the blood is transplanted into a recipient but doesn't take, and the sick child's parents want to track down the donor child for bone marrow cells?\n\n【13】Most public cord blood banks label samples so they can be linked to a particular donor for several years, at which time they destroy the identifying information. Wolpe says that this is a good trade-off but that risks will always be associated with donor cord blood, just as they are with donor adult blood. \"You try to keep it as safe as you can,\" he says, \"but people take a chance.\" — Carol Ezzell, staff writer\n\n【14】 ing sprung from the donor's stem cells.\n\n【15】But it took years for other physicians to recognize the potential of umbilical cord blood transplantation. In 1989 Hal E. Broxmeyer of the Indiana University School of Medicine, Edward A. Boyse of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City and their colleagues revived interest in the technique by showing that human cord blood contains as many stem cells as bone marrow does. That same year Broxmeyer, Eliane Gluckman of  Saint- Louis Hospital in Paris and their co-workers reported curing Fanconi anemia—a potentially fatal genetic disorder— in a five-year-old boy using blood from his baby sister's umbilical cord. Since then, approximately 75 percent of umbilical cord blood transplants have used cord blood from a nonrelative obtained from cord blood storage programs.\n\n【16】## What’S Bred In The Bone\n\n【17】\n UMBILICAL CORD BLOOD transplantation aims to obtain a source of stem cells that is the best possible match for a particular patient's tissue type. Tissue type is determined by a set of genes that make proteins called human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), which are found on the surfaces of all body cells. The immune system recognizes cells bearing the HLA proteins it has encountered since birth as normal, or belonging to the \"self.\" Any other HLA proteins are regarded as \"nonself,\" or foreign; cells carrying them are quickly killed.\n\n【18】There are six major HLA genes. Every person has two copies, or alleles, of each— one from each parent. (Each allele can come in more than 30 different types.) For bone marrow transplants, physicians aim to match the six alleles (of the total 12) that are most clinically relevant in transplantation. But because cord blood cells are immunologically different from bone marrow cells, doctors can use donor cord blood samples that match five—or even three—HLA alleles.\n\n【19】The genetic blueprints for making HLA proteins are found on chromosome 6. The rules of genetics dictate that the probability that two siblings will inherit the same maternal and paternal chromosome 6—and will therefore be good tissue-type matches—is only 25 percent.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "But Is It Ethical?", "bbox": [65.0, 105.0, 285.0, 140.0]}, {"text": "Marketing tactics and privacy issues raise eyebrows", "bbox": [65.0, 140.0, 334.0, 159.0]}], "type": "Section-header", "position": 0}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "LAST SEPTEMBER a little girl from California named Molly received a lifesaving", "bbox": [64.0, 164.0, 429.0, 186.0]}, {"text": "transplant of umbilical cord blood from her newborn brother, Adam.

There are many reasons why a person might develop a cough.\n\n【4】Each one of us has experienced a cough at some point in our lives, when ill with a respiratory infection or a head cold, for example. Most coughs due to colds are short lived. When a cough lasts longer than two or three weeks, or develops in a particular pattern, take note.

Cough that regularly occurs with exercise, in the setting of aerobic activity, strongly suggests the presence of asthma, unless proven otherwise.\n\n【5】 Exercise is considered a \"trigger\" in all persons with asthma. Exercise does not cause asthma but acts as a stimulus to bronchoconstriction in asthmatics and causes increased airway inflammation. In young children in particular, cough with exertion should never be ignored; it may be the \"tip off\" to the diagnosis of asthma.\n\n【6】## 19.

The orthodontic movements are going to act over the periodontum, so we must consider the relation between orthodontics and periodontics. Furthermore, the orthodontic treatment is going to improve the condi¬ tion of the patient, only if infection and inflammation are controlled. But apart from any esthetic consideration, malocclusion is the cause of many periodontal problems; fixed orthodontic appliances are the cause of de demise of the oral hygiene conditions of the patient. The lack of an appropriate dental hygiene program is an important factor that can initiate a case of gingivitis or periodontitis.\n\n【3】Some investigations about this topic have demonstrated the relation between periodontal disease and the use of braces.

The recommended dose is 160 to 325 mg. Chewable or soluble aspirin is absorbed more quickly than swallowed tablets. 178 , 179 Aspirin suppositories (300 mg) are safe and can be considered for patients with severe nausea, vomiting, or disorders of the upper gastrointestinal tract.\n\n【1】Other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDS) are contraindicated and should be discontinued in patients who are taking these medications. NSAIDs (except for aspirin), both nonselective as well as COX-2 selective agents, should not be administered during hospitalization for STEMI because of the increased risk of mortality, reinfarction, hypertension, heart failure, and myocardial rupture associated with their use (Class III, LOE C). 180–182\n\n【2】## Nitroglycerin (Or Glyceryl Trinitrate)\n\n【3】\n Nitroglycerin has beneficial hemodynamic effects, including dilation of the coronary arteries (particularly in the region of plaque disruption), the peripheral arterial bed, and venous capacitance vessels. The treatment benefits of nitroglycerin are limited, however, and no conclusive evidence has been shown to support the routine use of IV, oral, or topical nitrate therapy in patients with AMI. 183 With this in mind, these agents should be carefully considered, especially in the patient with low blood pressure and when their use would preclude the use of other agents known to be beneficial, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.\n\n【4】Patients with ischemic discomfort should receive up to 3 doses of sublingual or aerosol nitroglycerin at 3- to 5-minute intervals until pain is relieved or low blood pressure limits its use (Class I, LOE B). Topical nitrates are acceptable alternatives for patients who require anti-anginal therapy but who are hemodynamically stable and do not have ongoing refractory ischemic symptoms. Parenteral formulations, rather than long acting oral preparations, can be used acutely to enable titration in patients with obvious ACS, objective test abnormality, and ongoing discomfort. In patients with recurrent ischemia, nitrates are indicated in the first 24 to 48 hours.\n\n【5】The use of nitrates in patients with hypotension (SBP < 90 mm Hg or ≥ 30 mm Hg below baseline), extreme bradycardia (<50 bpm), or tachycardia in the absence of heart failure (> 100 bpm) and in patients with right ventricular infarction is contraindicated (Class III, LOE C). Caution is advised in patients with known inferior wall STEMI, and a right-sided ECG should be performed to evaluate RV infarction. Administer nitrates with extreme caution, if at all, to patients with inferior-wall MI and suspected right ventricular (RV) involvement because these patients require adequate RV preload. Nitroglycerin should not be administered to patients who had taken a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (eg, sildenafil) for erectile dysfunction within 24 hours (48 hours if tadalafil use).\n\n【6】Relief of chest discomfort with nitroglycerin is neither sensitive nor specific for ACS; gastrointestinal etiologies as well as other causes of chest discomfort can \"respond\" to nitroglycerin administration. 18, 184– 186\n\n【7】## Analgesia\n\n【8】\n Providers should administer analgesics, such as intravenous morphine, for chest discomfort unresponsive to nitrates.\n\n【9】Morphine is the preferred analgesic for patients with STEMI (Class I, LOE C). However, analysis of retrospective registry data raised a question about the potentially adverse effects of morphine in patients with UA/NSTEMI. 44 As a result, the ACC AHA UA/NSTEMI writing group reduced morphine use to a Class IIa recommendation for that patient population. 3\n\n【10】## Reperfusion Therapies (Figure 1, Box 7, 8) Acute Reperfusion Therapy Using Ppci Or Fibrinolytic Therapy\n\n【11】\n in patients with STEMI restores flow in the infarct-related artery, limits infarct size, and translates into early mortality benefit that is sustained over the next decade. 187 . 188 While optimal fibrinolysis restores normal coronary flow (TIMI 3) in 50% to 60% of subjects, PPCI is able to achieve restored flow in > 90% of subjects. The patency rates achieved with PPCI translates into reduced mortality and reinfarction rates as compared to fibrinolytic therapy. 189 This benefit is even greater in patients presenting with cardiogenic shock. PPCI also results in a decreased risk of intracranial hemorrhage and stroke, making it the reperfusion strategy of choice in the elderly and those at risk for bleeding complications.\n\n【12】## Fibrinolytics\n\n【13】\n Early fibrinolytic therapy is a well-established treatment modality for patients with STEMI who present within 12 hours of the onset of symptoms and who lack contraindications to its use. 188,190–193 Early reperfusion results in reduced mortality, and the shorter the time to reperfusion, the greater the benefit. A 47% reduction in mortality was noted when fibrinolytic therapy was provided within the first hour after onset of symptoms. 188 , 193 The major determinants of myocardial salvage and longterm prognosis are short time to reperfusion, 190 . 193 complete and sustained patency of the infarct-related artery with normal (TIMI grade 3) flow, 194, 195 and normal microvascular perfusion. 22, 196– 198 In the absence of contraindications, fibrinolytic therapy is recommended for STEMI if symptom onset has been within 12 hours of presentation and PCI is not available within 90 minutes of first medical contact (Class I, LOE A). Patients are evaluated for risk and benefit; for absolute and relative contraindications to therapy (see Table 5).\n\n【14】If fibrinolysis is chosen for reperfusion, the ED physician should administer fibrinolytics to eligible patients as early as possible according to a predetermined process of care developed by the ED and cardiology staff (Class I, LOE A). The goal is a door-to-needle time of less than 30 minutes with effort focused on shortening the time to therapy. Patients treated within the first 70 minutes of onset of symptoms have > 50% reduction in infarct size and 75% reduction in mortality rates. 199 For fibrinolytic therapy, it is estimated that 65 lives will be saved per 1000 patients treated if fibrinolytics are provided in the first hour, with a pooled total of 131 lives saved per 1000 patients treated if fibrinolytics are provided within the first 3 hours of onset of symptoms. 200 Although fibrinolytics may be beneficial if given within 12 hours after\n\n【15】 Downloaded from http://circ.ahajournals.org/ by guest on September 4, 2011", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "all patients with AMI, and in high-risk patients it reduced", "bbox": [60.0, 84.0, 376.0, 99.0]}, {"text": "nonfatal AMI and vascular death. 177 Aspirin is also effective", "bbox": [60.0, 100.0, 376.0, 113.0]}, {"text": "in patients with NSTEMI.

When you warm up, your goal is to perform enough activity to allow the bronchial tubes to \"open up\" a bit more.

{"seq_id": "8ad07b1e-4cf8-41db-b249-0a04ca405b1d", "title": null, "text": "【0】页码:117\n Two studies demonstrated 305 , 306 increased ROSC, hospital admission, and survival to hospital discharge associated with use of bicarbonate. However, the majority of studies showed no benefit 307 -309 or found a relationship with poor outcome. 304 , 310–312 There are few data to support therapy with buffers during cardiac arrest. There is no evidence that bicarbonate improves the likelihood of defibrillation or survival rates in animals with VF cardiac arrest. A wide variety of adverse effects have been linked to administration of bicarbonate during cardiac arrest. Bicarbonate may compromise CPP by reducing systemic vascular resistance. 313 It can create extracellular alkalosis that will shift the oxyhemoglobin saturation curve and inhibit oxygen release. It can produce hypernatremia and therefore hyperosmolarity. It produces excess CO 2 , which freely diffuses into myocardial and cerebral cells and may paradoxically contribute to intracellular acidosis. 314 It can exacerbate central venous acidosis and may inactivate simultaneously administered catecholamines.\n\n【1】In some special resuscitation situations, such as preexisting metabolic acidosis, hyperkalemia, or tricyclic antidepressant overdose, bicarbonate can be beneficial (see Part 12: \"Cardiac Arrest in Special Situations\"). However, routine use of sodium bicarbonate is not recommended for patients in cardiac arrest (Class III, LOE B). When bicarbonate is used for special situations, an initial dose of 1 mEq/kg is typical.\n\n【2】Whenever possible, bicarbonate therapy should be guided by the bicarbonate concentration or calculated base deficit obtained from blood gas analysis or laboratory measurement. To minimize the risk of iatrogenically induced alkalosis, providers should not attempt complete correction of the calculated base deficit. Other non–CO 2 -generating buffers such as carbicarb, THAM, or tribonate have shown potential for minimizing some adverse effects of sodium bicarbonate, including CO 2 generation, hyperosmolarity, hypernatremia, hypoglycemia, intracellular acidosis, myocardial acidosis, and \"overshoot\" alkalosis. 315–317 But clinical experience is greatly limited and outcome studies are lacking.\n\n【3】## Calcium\n\n【4】\n Studies of calcium during cardiac arrest have found variable results on ROSC, and no trial has found a beneficial effect on survival either in or out of hospital. 301 , 304 , 318 – 323 Routine administration of calcium for treatment of in-hospital and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is not recommended (Class III, LOE B).\n\n【5】## Fibrinolysis\n\n【6】\n Fibrinolytic therapy was proposed for use during cardiac arrest to treat both coronary thrombosis (acute coronary syndrome) with presumably complete occlusion of a proximal coronary artery and major life-threatening pulmonary embolism. Ongoing CPR is not an absolute contraindication to fibrinolysis. Initial studies were promising 324 – 330 and suggested benefit from fibrinolytic therapy in the treatment of victims of cardiopulmonary arrest unresponsive to standard therapy. But 2 large clinical trials 188 , 331 failed to show any\n\n【7】 improvement in outcome with fibrinolytic therapy during CPR. One of these showed an increased risk of intracranial bleeding associated with the routine use of fibrinolytics during cardiac arrest. 188 Fibrinolytic therapy should not be routinely used in cardiac arrest (Class III, LOE B). When pulmonary embolism is presumed or known to be the cause of cardiac arrest, empirical fibrinolytic therapy can be considered (Class IIa, LOE B; see Part 12).\n\n【8】## Iv Fluids\n\n【9】\n No published human study directly compares the outcome of routine IV fluid administration to no fluid administration during CPR. Most human and animal studies of fluid infusion during CPR did not have a control group, 332 – 343 and 2 animal studies showed that normothermic fluid infusion during CPR caused a decrease in CPP. 344–346 In addition to normothermic fluid, hypertonic and chilled fluids have been studied in animal and small human studies without a survival benefit 332 , 334 , 336 – 338 , 341 – 343 If cardiac arrest is associated with extreme volume losses, hypovolemic arrest should be suspected. These patients present with signs of circulatory shock advancing to PEA. In these settings intravascular volume should be promptly restored.\n\n【10】## Pacing\n\n【11】\n Electric pacing is generally not effective in cardiac arrest, and no studies have observed a survival benefit from pacing in cardiac arrest. 347–350 Existing evidence suggests that pacing by transcutaneous, transvenous, or transmyocardial means in cardiac arrest does not improve the likelihood of ROSC or survival outcome regardless of the timing of pacing administration (early or delayed in established asystole), location of arrest (in-hospital or out-of-hospital), or primary cardiac rhythm (asystole, PEA) targeted for treatment. Electric pacing is not recommended for routine use in cardiac arrest (Class III, LOE B).\n\n【12】## Precordial Thump\n\n【13】\n The potential utility of precordial thump in cardiac arrest has not been well studied. When hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachyarrhythmias were induced during electrophysiological testing, initial administration of a precordial thump appeared to be safe but rarely effective in terminating ventricular arrhythmias. 351 In a prospective observational study of patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, precordial thump was associated with ROSC when administered promptly to patients with responder-witnessed asystolic arrest. When administered for VF/VT or PEA arrest it was ineffective but resulted in no apparent harm. 352 In 3 case series 353 – 355 VF or pulseless VT was converted to a perfusing rhythm by a precordial thump. Conversely, other case series documented deterioration in cardiac rhythm, such as rate acceleration of VT, conversion of VT to VF, or development of complete AV block or asystole following the thump. 354 , 356–361\n\n【14】 Downloaded from http://circ.ahajournals.org/ by guest on September 4, 2011", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "Two studies demonstrated 305 , 306 increased ROSC, hos-", "bbox": [73.0, 83.0, 375.0, 98.0]}, {"text": "pital admission, and survival to hospital discharge associ-", "bbox": [60.0, 100.0, 375.0, 113.0]}, {"text": "ated with use of bicarbonate.

If the child's weight is unknown, it is reasonable to use a body length tape with precalculated doses (Class IIa, LOE C). 70–77 It is unclear if an adjustment in the calculation of resuscitation medications is needed in obese children. Use of the actual body weight in calculation of drug doses in obese patients may result in potentially toxic doses. Length-based tapes estimate the 50th percentile weight for length (ie, ideal body weight), which may, theoretically, result in inadequate doses of some medications in obese patients. Despite these theoretical considerations, there are no data regarding the safety or efficacy of adjusting the doses of resuscitation medications in obese patients. Therefore, regardless of the patient's habitus, use the actual body weight for calculating initial resuscitation drug doses or use a body length tape with precalculated doses (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【3】For subsequent doses of resuscitation drugs in both nonobese and obese patients, expert providers may consider adjusting doses to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. In general, the dose administered to a child should not exceed the standard dose recommended for adult patients.\n\n【4】## Medications (See Table 1)\n\n【5】\n## Adenosine\n\n【6】\n Adenosine causes a temporary atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction block and interrupts reentry circuits that involve the AV node. The drug has a wide safety margin because of its short half-life. Adenosine should be given only IV or IO, followed by a rapid saline flush to promote drug delivery to the central circulation. If adenosine is given IV, it should be administered as close to the heart as possible. (See also \"Arrhythmia.\")\n\n【7】## Amiodarone\n\n【8】\n Amiodarone slows AV conduction, prolongs the AV refractory period and QT interval, and slows ventricular conduction (widens the QRS). Expert consultation is strongly recommended prior to administration of amiodarone to a pediatric patient with a perfusing rhythm. (See also \"Arrhythmia.\")\n\n【9】## Precautions\n\n【10】\n Monitor blood pressure and electrocardiograph (ECG) during intravenous administration of amiodarone. If the patient has a perfusing rhythm, administer the drug as slowly (over 20 to 60 minutes) as the patient's clinical condition allows; if the patient is in VF/pulseless VT, give the drug as a rapid bolus.\n\n【11】Amiodarone causes hypotension through its vasodilatory property, and the severity is related to the infusion rate; hypotension is less common with the aqueous form of amiodarone. 207 Decrease the infusion rate if there is prolongation of the QT interval or heart block; stop the infusion if the QRS widens to > 50% of baseline or hypotension develops. Other potential complications of amiodarone include bradycardia and torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia.\n\n【12】Amiodarone should not be administered together with another drug that causes QT prolongation, such as procainamide, without expert consultation.\n\n【13】## Atropine\n\n【14】\n Atropine sulfate is a parasympatholytic drug that accelerates sinus or atrial pacemakers and increases the speed of AV conduction.\n\n【15】## Precautions\n\n【16】\n Small doses of atropine ( < 0.1 mg) may produce paradoxical bradycardia because of its central effect. 208 Larger than recommended doses may be required in special circumstances such as organophosphate poisoning 209 or exposure to nerve gas agents.\n\n【17】## Calcium\n\n【18】\n Calcium administration is not recommended for pediatric cardiopulmonary arrest in the absence of documented hypocalcemia, calcium channel blocker overdose, hypermagnesemia, or hyperkalemia (Class III, LOE B). Routine calcium administration in cardiac arrest provides no benefit 210–221 and may be harmful. 210–212\n\n【19】 If calcium administration is indicated during cardiac arrest, either calcium chloride or calcium gluconate may be considered. Hepatic dysfunction does not appear to alter the ability of calcium gluconate to raise serum calcium levels. 222 In critically ill children, calcium chloride may be preferred because it results in a greater increase in ionized calcium during the treatment of hypocalcemia. 222 A In the nonarrest setting, if the only venous access is peripheral, calcium gluconate is recommended because it has a lower osmolality than calcium chloride and is therefore less irritating to the vein.\n\n【20】## Epinephrine\n\n【21】\n The α -adrenergic-mediated vasoconstriction of epinephrine increases aortic diastolic pressure and thus coronary perfusion pressure, a critical determinant of successful resuscitation from cardiac arrest. 223 , 224 At low doses, the β -adrenergic effects may predominate, leading to decreased systemic vascular resistance; in the doses used during cardiac arrest, the vasoconstrictive α -effects predominate.\n\n【22】## Precautions\n\n【23】 • Do not administer catecholamines and sodium bicarbonate simultaneously through an IV catheter or tubing because alkaline solutions such as the bicarbonate inactivate the catecholamines.\n\n【24】• In patients with a perfusing rhythm, epinephrine causes tachycardia; it may also cause ventricular ectopy, tachyarrhythmias, vasoconstriction, and hypertension.\n\n【25】## Glucose\n\n【26】\n Because infants have a relatively high glucose requirement and low glycogen stores, they may develop hypoglycemia when energy requirements rise. 225 Check blood glucose concentration during the resuscitation and treat hypoglycemia promptly (Class I, LOE C). 226\n\n【27】## Lidocaine\n\n【28】\n Lidocaine decreases automaticity and suppresses ventricular arrhythmias, 227 but is not as effective as amiodarone for improving ROSC or survival to hospital admission among\n\n【29】 Downloaded from http://circ.ahajournals.org/ by guest on September 4, 2011", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "Medication Dose Calculation", "bbox": [60.0, 84.0, 239.0, 99.0]}], "type": "Section-header", "position": 3}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "To calculate the dose of resuscitation medications, use the", "bbox": [60.0, 100.0, 376.0, 113.0]}, {"text": "child's weight if it is known.

For this, orthodontists have tried for some years to reduce the depth of deep bites using dif¬ ferent mechanisms from the use of extra oral appliances (feared by the patients because of its anti esthetic effects), till the most recent elements described in the literature product of clinical investigation with basis in bioengineer¬ ing applied to the design of elements for dental movement control. Studies in Physics and Biomechanics have given us designs of arches and passive and active elements that are more efficient and plural. ( 12 )\n\n【2】 The options that we will review in this chapter for the opening of the anterior bite are as follows:\n\n【3】 n\n Anterior bite plane.\n\n【4】Anterior bite plane with intermaxillary elastics.\n\n【5】 Bite ramps.\n\n【6】 1\n\n【7】 Bypass.\n Incisal brace placement.\n\n【8】 Intrusion bend.\n\n【9】 Tip back.\n\n【10】 Reverse curve arch.\n Intrusion arch of Dr Oscar Quiros.\n\n【11】 Utility arch.\n\n【12】 CIA.\n Intrusive arch with loops.\n\n【13】Face bow.\n\n【14】## Anterior Bite Plane\n\n【15】\n With this additment the occlusal plane will open with the help of the anteroinferior teeth, which will contact the acrylic plate provoking a separation or posterior disclusion, facilitating the passive or forced eruption of molars and premolars, which will open the anterior bite. (4.11.15)\n\n【16】 Hemley, in 1938 affirmed that the bite plane slows the growth of the anterior alveolar process; meanwhile the posterior alveolar process continues growing. He also found that of 22 patients that used the bite plane, only one showed inferior incisor intrusion. Strang says that the\n\n【17】 bite plane induces molar extrusion but does not have an intrusive effect on the anterior segment. Sleichter studied the vertical changes of molars and incisors, and found that the height of the molar region increased while the anterior region had a minimal change.
