For face mask therapy, we must first begin with the rapid expansion of the maxilla to disarticulate the suture system; within a week or 10 days after the expansion has begun we can place the face mask. This is to facilitate the protraction of the maxilla.\n\n【12】2. The face mask is used generally until we have an overjet of 检查复数删除:<u>3</u> mm to 检查复数删除:<u>5</u> mm.\nThe skidding surfaces of the expander must cover the first and second deciduous molars and the first upper permanent molar.\n\n【13】4.

Some scientists worry tht viruses will pick up resistnce trits from virus-fighting GM crops nd evolve into hrd-tobet strins tht infect newly expnded repertoire of plnts.\nSome critics lso question the ecologicl sfety of emerging crops designed to resist drought, tolerte slt or deliver n extrnutritionl punch.

Since the 2005 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC , many instructive and encouraging examples have been published, describing ways in which that translation can be accomplished. Each system, whether in the hospital or in the community, must assess its performance and implement a strategy for improving care in cases of cardiac arrest. That strategy should support the building blocks of resuscitation: the BLS links of immediate recognition and emergency activation, early CPR, and rapid defibrillation.

Ideally, healthcare systems that routinely provide care to children at risk for cardiac arrest should have available manual defibrillators capable of dose adjustment. 148\n\n【1】##In-Hospital Use Of Aeds\n\n【2】At the time of the 2010 Consensus Conference, there were no published in-hospital randomized trials of AEDs versus manual defibrillators. Evidence from 检查复数删除:<u>1</u> study with historic controls, 检查复数删除:<u>152</u> 1 case series, 检查复数删除:<u>153 and 2</u> retrospective studies 删除2:<u>117,118</u> indicated higher rates of survival to hospital discharge when AEDs were used to treat adult VF or pulseless VT in the hospital. However, 检查复数删除:<u>1</u> before/after study did not show an improvement in survival to discharge or ROSC when in-hospital AEDs were implemented in noncritical areas of a hospital, 检查复数删除:<u>154 and 1</u> observational study with historical controls observed no improvement in survival to discharge when comparing biphasic AEDs to standard monophasic defibrillators.删除6:<u> 155 </u>The Gombotz and Hanefeld studies observed a decrease in the time interval from collapse to first shock delivery as well as increased ROSC and survival.\nDefibrillation may be delayed when patients develop SCA in unmonitored hospital beds and in outpatient and diagnostic facilities. In such areas, several minutes may elapse before centralized response teams arrive with the defibrillator, attach it, and deliver shocks.删除6:<u> 156 </u>Despite limited evidence, AEDs may be considered for the hospital setting as a way to facilitate early areas where staff have no rhythm recognition skills or defibrillators are used infrequently (Class IIb, LOE C).\nWhen hospitals deploy AEDs, first-responding personnel should also receive authorization and training to use an AED, with the goal of providing the first shock for any SCA within 3 minutes of collapse. The objective is to make goals for in-hospital use of AEDs consistent with goals established in the out-of-hospital setting.删除6:<u> 157 </u>Early defibrillation capability should be available in ambulatory care facilities, as well as throughout hospital inpatient areas. Hospitals should monitor collapse-to–first shock intervals and resuscitation outcomes.\n\n【3】##Fibrillation Waveform Analysis To\nPredict Outcome\n\n【4】There is evidence that VF waveforms change over time. 删除2:<u>158,139</u>\nSeveral retrospective case series, animal studies, and theoretical models suggest that it is possible to predict, with varying reliability, the success of attempted defibrillation by analyzing the VF waveform. 删除2:<u>18,40,160–177</u> However, there are currently no prospective studies that have identified optimal waveforms and/or timing. The value of VF waveform analysis to guide defibrillation management is uncertain (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【5】##\"Occult\" Versus \"False\" Asystole\n\n【6】In certain cases of cardiac arrest, it is difficult to be certain whether the rhythm is fine VF or asystole. In 1989, Losek 检查复数删除:<u>178</u> published a retrospective review of initial shock delivery for 49 children (infants through 19 years of age) in asystole compared with no shock delivery for 41 children in asystole and found no improvement in rhythm change, ROSC, or survival in the group that received the shocks. In 1993, the Nine City High-Dose\nEpinephrine Study Group published an analysis of 检查复数删除:<u>77</u> asystolic patients who received initial shock compared with 检查复数删除:<u>117</u> who received standard therapy.删除6:<u> 179 </u>There was a worse outcome of 段内删除换行-检查复数删除:<u>3</u> ROSC and survival for those who received shocks. Thus, it is not useful to shock asystole (Class III, LOE B).\n\n【7】Several case reports have described fires ignited by sparks from poorly applied defibrillator paddles in the presence of an oxygen-enriched atmosphere. 删除2:<u>180–185</u> Fires have been reported when ventilator tubing is disconnected from the endotracheal tube and then left adjacent to the patient's head, blowing oxygen across the chest during attempted defibrillation. 删除2:<u>181,183,185</u> It may be reasonable for rescuers to take precautions to minimize sparking during attempted defibrillation; try to avoid defibrillation in an oxygen-enriched atmosphere (Class IIb, LOE C).\nThe use of self-adhesive defibrillation pads and ensuring good pad–chest-wall contact will likely minimize the risk of sparks igniting during defibrillation. If manual paddles are used, gel pads are preferable to electrode pastes and gels, because the pastes and gels can spread between the 2 paddles, creating the potential for a spark (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【8】##Synchronized Cardioversion\n\n【9】Synchronized cardioversion is shock delivery that is timed (synchronized) with the QRS complex.

Human behavior is caused and shaped by various factors. Plenty of aggression has little or nothing to do with how people evaluate themselves. But if our hypothesis is right, inflated self-esteem increases the odds of aggression substantially. For those aggressive acts that do involve the perpetrators' self-regard, we believe that threatened egotism is crucial. Obviously, this new theory could have implications for designing effective methods to reduce violence.\nSo how does a social psychologist establish whether low or high self-esteem leads to violence? Because there is no perfect, general method for understanding complex questions about human beings, social scientists typically operate by conducting multiple studies with different methods. A single study can be challenged, especially if competing views exist. But when a consistent pattern emerges, the conclusions become hard to ignore.\nResearchers measure self-esteem by asking a standardized series of questions, such as \"How well do you get along with other people?\" and \"Are you generally successful in your work or studies?\" The individual chooses from a range of responses,", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": "\n## Several Years Ago A Youth Counselor Told Me About\n", "block_text_old": "\n## Several Years Ago A Youth Counselor Told Me About\n", "raw_context": [{"text": "Several years ago a youth counselor told me about", "bbox": [45.0, 501.0, 376.0, 518.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [44.0, 500.0, 375.0, 517.0], "position": 2, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n the dilemma he faced when dealing with violent young men.\nHis direct impressions simply didn't match what he had been taught.

It is therefore recommended that the application of cricoid pressure should be modified or discontinued if it impedes ventilation or the speed or ease of intubation.\nMonitoring capnography/capnometry is again recommended to confirm proper endotracheal tube (and other advanced airway) position and may be useful during CPR to assess and optimize quality of chest compressions.\n\n【6】•The optimal energy dose required for defibrillation (using either a monophasic or biphasic waveform) in infants and children is unknown.

It is therefore recommended that young victims of a sudden, unexpected cardiac arrest should have an unrestricted, complete autopsy when possible with appropriate preservation and genetic analysis of tissue. Detailed testing may reveal an inherited channelopathy that may also be present in surviving family members.\n\n【8】##Neonatal Resuscitation\n\n【9】The etiology of neonatal arrests is nearly always asphyxia.\nTherefore, the A-B-C sequence has been retained for resuscitation of neonates unless there is a known cardiac etiology.\n\n【10】##Assessment, Supplementary Oxygen, And\nPeripartum Suctioning\n\n【11】When assessing an infant's cardiorespiratory transition and need for resuscitation, the best indicators were found to be increasing heart rate, effective respirations, and good tone.\nPulse oximetry, with the probe attached to the right upper extremity, should be used to assess any need for supplementary oxygen. Studies demonstrate that healthy babies born at term start with an oxygen saturation of < 60% and will take > 10 minutes to reach a saturation of > 90%. Hyperoxia can be toxic, particularly to the preterm infant. For babies born at term, it is best to begin resuscitation with room air rather than 100% oxygen. Any supplementary oxygen administered should be regulated by blending oxygen and air, using oximetry to guide titration of the blend delivered.\nThe role of peripartum suctioning has been deemphasized.\nThere is no evidence to support airway suctioning in active babies, even in the presence of meconium. The available evidence does not support or refute the routine endotracheal suctioning of non-vigorous infants born through meconiumstained amniotic fluid.\n\n【12】##Chest Compressions\n\n【13】The recommended compression-ventilation ratio remains 3:检查复数删除:<u>1</u> because ventilation is critical to reversal of newborn asphyxial arrest and higher ratios may decrease minute ventilation. If the arrest is known to be of cardiac etiology, a higher ratio (15:2) should be considered. If epinephrine is indicated, a dose of 0.检查复数删除:<u>01</u> to 0.检查复数删除:<u>03</u> mg/kg should be administered IV as soon as possible. When using the endotracheal route it is likely that a larger dose (0.检查复数删除:<u>05</u> mg/kg to 0.检查复数删除:<u>1</u> mg/kg) will be required.\n\n【14】Postresuscitation Care (Post-Cardiac Arrest Care)\nTherapeutic hypothermia is recommended for babies born near term with evolving moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.

With exercise, the lungs' passages actually dilate and open up more. Exercise is good for the lungs! You have a responsibility to report any exercise-related symptoms to your physician or asthma specialist. Your treating doctor has a responsibility, in turn, to address the emergence of exercise-related symptoms and advise you on appropriate measures and treatment.\n\n【1】Successful treatment of asthma always includes a prescription for aerobic exercise. A balanced exercise program, tailored to a person's specific interests and abilities, is ideal and inherent to good health. Exercise can be separated into aerobic, flexibility, and anaerobic activities. The first achieves cardio-pul删除16:<u>¬ </u>monary fitness, the second targets the range of muscle and joint motion, and the third focuses on muscle build-up and strength. Pedaling a bicycle is an example of aerobic exercise. As you pedal faster, your heart and lungs work in tandem to provide oxygen to exercising muscles while excreting acids from the accumulating effort. Yoga is an example of a flexibility exercise. Weightlifting is an anaerobic exercise. A good exercise regimen can incorporate a balance of all three types of exercise, with particular emphasis on aerobic activities.\n\n【2】Studies have identified factors that tend to trigger asthmatic symptoms during exercise. A leading hypothesis implicates the rapid inhalation of dry, cold air as the major contributor to exercise-induced asthma.

The baldrick, a small aluminum tube crammed with 80 grams of plastic explosive and capped with a thin sheet of copper, pierces the outer casing of a bomb and ignites the plasterlike mixture of TNT and other explosive material inside. This action splits the bomb's casing and burns away its contents almost instantaneously, doing relatively little harm to the surrounding area. \"The munition is usually attacked explosively from the outside using a charge sufficiently violent to cause a chemical reaction but not hard enough to cause [a high-order] detonation,\" says Sidney Alford, a British explosives engineer who develops bomb disposal techniques used in Laos.\nA member of Inthavongsy's team places the baldrick 80 millimeters from the bomb and inserts a blasting cap wired to an electrical switchbox in a faraway bunker.

Pieces of shrapnel shriek through the air. Moments later Inthavongsy and her colleagues emerge from the bunker and return to the site. The demolition is successful.

It is approved by the FDA for treatment of moderate persistent or severe persistent asthma in adolescents and adults who meet two additional specific criteria. One is the presence of a positive skin test, or RAST blood test for a year-round allergen, such as dust mite or mold, for example. The second criterion requires that inhaled corticosteroid treatment be ineffective in adequately controlling the patient's asthmatic symptomatology.\n\n【1】##74. My Asthma Worsens Each Month Near My Period. Is That Possible?\n\n【2】Thirty to forty percent of women with asthma who menstruate experience exacerbation of their asthma symptoms in relation to the menstrual cycle. They consistently note increased asthma symptoms just before and during their period.

Because of difficulties with pulse assessments, interruptions in chest compressions for a pulse check should be minimized during the resuscitation, even to determine if ROSC has occurred.\nBecause of the difficulty in providing effective chest compressions while moving the patient during CPR, the resuscitation should generally be conducted where the patient is found (Class IIa, LOE C). This may not be possible if the environment is dangerous.\n\n【1】##Compression-Ventilation Ratio 删除图片5:<u>(Box 4)</u>\n\n【2】A compression-ventilation ratio of 30:2 is reasonable in adults, but further validation of this guideline is needed (Class IIb, LOE B删除2:<u>83,107–111</u> ). This 30:检查复数删除:<u>2</u> ratio in adults is based on a consensus among experts and on published case series. 2,删除2:<u>99–102</u>\nFurther studies are needed to define the best method for coordinating chest compressions and ventilations during CPR and to define the best compression-ventilation ratio in terms of survival and neurologic outcome in patients with or without an advanced airway in place.\nOnce an advanced airway is in place, 2 rescuers no longer need to pause chest compressions for ventilations. Instead, the compressing rescuer should give continuous chest compressions at a rate of at least 检查复数删除:<u>100</u> per minute without pauses for ventilation (Class IIa, LOE B). The rescuer delivering ventilation can provide a breath every 6 to 8 seconds (which yields 8 to 10 breaths per minute).\n\n【3】##Hands-Only Cpr\n\n【4】Only about 20% to 30% of adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrests receive any bystander CPR. 删除2:<u>29,48 – 51,112,113</u> Hands-Only (compression-only) bystander CPR substantially improves survival following adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrests compared with no bystander CPR. 删除2:<u>29,48 –51</u> Observational studies of adults with cardiac arrest treated by lay rescuers showed similar survival rates among victims receiving Hands-Only\nCPR versus conventional CPR with rescue breaths. 删除2:<u>29,48–51</u> Of note, some healthcare providers 删除2:<u>114 – 116</u> and laypersons 删除2:<u>116 , 117</u> indicate that reluctance to perform mouth-to-mouth ventilation for victims of cardiac arrest is a theoretical and potential barrier to performing bystander CPR. When actual bystanders were interviewed, however, such reluctance was not expressed; panic was cited as the major obstacle to laypersons performance of bystander CPR.删除6:<u> 118 </u>The simpler Hands-Only technique may help overcome panic and hesitation to act.\nHow can bystander CPR be effective without rescue breathing? Initially during SCA with VF, rescue breaths are not as important as chest compressions because the oxygen level in the blood remains adequate for the first several minutes after cardiac arrest. In addition, many cardiac arrest victims exhibit gasping or agonal gasps, and gas exchange allows for some oxygenation and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) elimination. 删除2:<u>110,111,119</u> If the airway is open, passive chest also provide some air exchange. 删除2:<u>19 , 110 , 111 , 119 – 122</u> However, at some time during prolonged CPR, supplementary oxygen with assisted ventilation is necessary. The precise interval for which the performance of Hands-Only CPR is acceptable is not known at this time. 删除2:<u>110 , 111 , 119 , 123 – 126</u>\nLaypersons should be encouraged to provide chest compressions (either Hands-Only or conventional CPR, including rescue breaths) for anyone with a presumed cardiac arrest (Class I, LOE B). No prospective study of adult cardiac arrest has demonstrated that layperson conventional CPR provides better outcomes than Hands-Only CPR when provided before\nEMS arrival. A recent large study of out-of-hospital pediatric cardiac arrests showed that survival was better when conventional CPR (including rescue breaths) as opposed to Hands- Only CPR was provided for children in cardiac arrest due to noncardiac causes.删除6:<u> 30 </u>Because rescue breathing is an important component for successful resuscitation from pediatric arrests (other than sudden, witnessed collapse of adolescents), from asphyxial cardiac arrests in both adults and children (eg, drowning, drug overdose) and from prolonged cardiac arrests, conventional CPR with rescue breathing is recommended for all trained rescuers (both in hospital and out of hospital) for those specific situations (Class IIa, LOE C 删除2:<u>109 , 123 , 127 – 129</u> ).\n\n【5】##Managing The Airway\n\n【6】As previously stated, a significant change in these Guidelines is to recommend the initiation of chest compressions before ventilations (CAB rather than ABC). This change reflects the growing evidence of the importance of chest compressions and the reality that setting up airway equipment takes time.\n\n【7】The ABC mindset may reinforce the idea that compressions should wait until ventilations have begun. This mindset can occur even when more than 检查复数删除:<u>1</u> rescuer is present because \"airway and breathing before ventilations\" is so ingrained in many rescuers. This new emphasis on CAB helps clarify that airway maneuvers should be performed quickly and efficiently so that interruptions in chest compressions are minimized and chest compressions should take priority in the resuscitation of an adult.\n\n【8】##Open The Airway: Lay Rescuer\n\n【9】The trained lay rescuer who feels confident that he or she can perform both compressions and ventilations should open the airway using a head tilt–chin lift maneuver (Class IIa, LOE B).\nFor the rescuer providing Hands-Only CPR, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of any specific passive airway (such as hyperextending the neck to allow passive ventilation).\n\n【10】Open the Airway: Healthcare Provider\nA healthcare provider should use the head tilt–chin lift maneuver to open the airway of a victim with no evidence of head or neck trauma. Although the head tilt–chin lift technique was developed using unconscious, paralyzed adult volunteers and has not been studied in victims with cardiac arrest, clinical 检查复数删除:<u>130</u> and radiographic evidence 删除2:<u>131 . 132</u> and a case series 检查复数删除:<u>133</u> have shown it to be effective (Class IIa, LOE B).\nBetween 0.检查复数删除:<u>12</u> and 3.7% of victims with blunt trauma have a spinal injury, 删除2:<u>134–136</u> and the risk of spinal injury is increased", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": "\nCPR until an AED arrives, the victim wakes up, or EMS personnel take over CPR (Class IIa, LOE B).\nHealthcare providers should interrupt chest compressions as infrequently as possible and try to limit interruptions to no longer than 10 seconds, except for specific interventions such as insertion of an advanced airway or use of a defibrillator (Class IIa, LOE C).

The incidence increases with age and people with certain medical conditions are simply more prone than others.\nThe disorder has been linked to cold sores, flu-like illness, diabetes, tumors, skull and facial injuries and Lyme disease.\n\n【3】Bell's palsy, as we've discussed, tends to appear suddenly out of the blue – symptoms may start appearing without even the slightest warning. So you may go to bed with a perfectly symmetrical face and when you wake up the next morning; you may notice that your face has collapsed on one side.\n\n【4】Some people feel numbness or weakness in their facial muscles a day or two before the symptoms first appear. If you notice pain behind your ear or normal sounds seem uncomfortably loud, do get it checked immediately.\n\n【5】The signs and symptoms of Bell's palsy tend to reach their peak within a day or two after appearing. Most patients feel that they are having a stroke, but here’s something you need to remember. In the case of stroke, muscle weakness is also felt in other parts of the body, not just your face.\n\n【6】##Prognosis And Chances Of Recovery\n\n【7】The prognosis for Bell’s palsy is generally good; however, recovery times may vary from person to person. The extent of nerve damage is what determines how soon the condition will go away. Most people start to get better within two weeks with complete recovery in about 3 to 6 months. A small number of people may take longer to recover.\n\n【8】The National Health Service UK states that 检查复数删除:<u>7</u> out of 10 people make a complete recovery. As mentioned earlier, the time will depend on the amount of nerve damage. The remaining 检查复数删除:<u>3</u> out of 10 people are stuck with the condition in severe cases, however, the majority of cases are treatable.\n\n【9】##What About Recurrence?", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": " 8.

In addition, reversible causes of cardiac arrest need to considered. While CPR in the pulseless trauma patient has overall been considered futile, several reversible causes of cardiac arrest in the context of trauma are correctible and their prompt treatment could be life-saving. These include hypoxia, hypovolemia, diminished cardiac output secondary to pneumothorax or pericardial tamponade, and hypothermia.\n\n【8】##Bls Modifications\n\n【9】When multisystem trauma is present or trauma involves the head and neck, the cervical spine must be stabilized. A jaw thrust should be used instead of a head tilt–chin lift to establish a patent airway. If breathing is inadequate and the patient's face is bloody, ventilation should be provided with a barrier device, a pocket mask, or a bag-mask device while maintaining cervical spine stabilization. Stop any visible hemorrhage using direct compression and appropriate dressings. If the patient is completely unresponsive despite rescue breathing, provide standard CPR and defibrillation as indicated.\n\n【10】##Acls Modifications\n\n【11】After initiation of BLS care, if bag-mask ventilation is inadequate, an advanced airway should be inserted while maintaining cervical spine stabilization.

What Is Influenza? Why Should I Get A Flu Shot (Influenza Vaccination)? Will The Flu Shot Make Me Ill?\n\n【2】Influenza is a serious respiratory disease caused by the influenza virus. Influenza viruses are classified as types A, B, or C. Influenza A is further classified into various subtypes. Influenza viruses of the A and B type are responsible for classic influenza illness. The disease is completely different from the common cold or the stomach flu. Influenza is a specific illness, but many people say that they \"have the flu\" to indicate that they are under the weather or ill in a general sort of way.\nInfluenza produces widespread, sporadic respiratory illness each year during fall and winter in the Northern hemisphere. It has also been known to occur in epidemic or pandemic forms. The symptoms of influenza include the sudden, abrupt onset of chills and high fever in the range of 102°F to 103°F. Severe generalized aches and pains, often most intense in the back and the legs, accompany the fever. Exhaustion is common, as is headache and loss of appetite.

Other diagnostic possibilities include MAT or sinus rhythm/tachycardia with frequent atrial premature beats. When there is doubt about the rhythm diagnosis and the patient is stable, a 12-lead ECG with expert consultation is recommended.\n\n【4】Therapy\nGeneral management of atrial fibrillation should focus on control of the rapid ventricular rate (rate control), conversion of hemodynamically unstable atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm (rhythm control), or both. Patients with an atrial fibrillation duration of > 48 hours are at increased risk for cardioembolic events, although shorter durations of atrial fibrillation do not exclude the possibility of such events. Electric or pharmacologic cardioversion (conversion to normal sinus rhythm) should not be attempted in these patients unless the patient is unstable. An alternative strategy is to perform cardioversion following anticoagulation with heparin and performance of transesophageal echocardiography to ensure the absence of a left atrial thrombus; see the ACC/AHA Guidelines for Management of Patients with\nAtrial Fibrillation. 检查复数删除:<u>429</u> 整段删除换行-检查复数删除:<u>4</u> Rate Control\nPatients who are hemodynamically unstable should receive ventricular rate control as directed by patient symptoms and hemodynamics. IV b -blockers and nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem 删除2:<u>430 – 433</u> are the drugs of choice for acute rate control in most individuals with atrial fibrillation and rapid ventricular response (Class IIa, LOE A). Digoxin 删除2:<u>434 – 436</u> and amiodarone 删除2:<u>437 . 438</u> may be used for rate control in patients with congestive heart failure; however, the potential risk of conversion to sinus rhythm with amiodarone should be considered before treating with this agent.\nA wide-complex irregular rhythm should be considered preexcited atrial fibrillation. Expert consultation is advised. Avoid\nAV nodal blocking agents such as adenosine, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, and possibly β -blockers in patients with pre-excitation atrial fibrillation because these drugs may cause a paradoxical increase in the ventricular response. Typically, patients with pre-excited atrial fibrillation present with very rapid heart rates and require emergent electric cardioversion.\nWhen electric cardioversion is not feasible or effective, or atrial fibrillation is recurrent, use of rhythm control agents (discussed below) may be useful for both rate control and stabilization of the rhythm.\n\n【5】Rhythm Control\nA variety of agents have been shown to be effective in terminating atrial fibrillation (pharmacologic or chemical cardioversion), although success between them varies and not all are available as parenteral formulations. Expert consultation is recommended.\n\n【6】##Polymorphic (Irregular) Vt\n\n【7】Polymorphic (irregular) VT requires immediate defibrillation with the same strategy used for VF.\nPharmacologic treatment to prevent recurrent polymorphic\nVT should be directed by the underlying cause of VT and the presence or absence of a long QT interval during sinus rhythm.\nIf a long QT interval is observed during sinus rhythm (ie, the 段内删除换行-检查复数删除:<u>3</u> VT is torsades de pointes), the first step is to stop medications known to prolong the QT interval. Correct electrolyte imbalance and other acute precipitants (eg, drug overdose or poisoning: see 段内删除换行-检查复数删除:<u>6</u> Part 12.7: \"Cardiac Arrest Associated With Toxic Ingestions\").\nAlthough magnesium is commonly used to treat torsades de pointes VT (polymorphic VT associated with long QT interval), it is supported by only 检查复数删除:<u>2</u> observational studies 删除2:<u>107 . 170</u> that showed effectiveness in patients with prolonged QT interval. One adult case series 检查复数删除:<u>439</u> showed that isoproterenol or ventricular pacing can be effective in terminating torsades de pointes associated with bradycardia and drug-induced QT prolongation. Polymorphic\nVT associated with familial long QT syndrome may be treated with IV magnesium, pacing, and/or β -blockers; isoproterenol should be avoided. Polymorphic VT associated with acquired long QT syndrome may be treated with IV magnesium. The addition of pacing or IV isoproterenol may be considered when polymorphic VT is accompanied by bradycardia or appears to be precipitated by pauses in rhythm.\nIn the absence of a prolonged QT interval, the most common cause of polymorphic VT is myocardial ischemia.

Its prin删除16:<u>¬ </u>ciple characteristics are high stiffness, low elastic memory, less accumulated energy, low friction level, moderate elastic module, it is easy to bend and has low cost. The energy saved in a steel wire is less than the energy in a TMA wire.\nThis is why these wires exert high forces that dissipate in short periods of time.\n\n【9】TMA is composed of 77.8% titanium, 11.3% of molibdenium, 6.6% zirconia and 4.3% of tin. It has a lesser elasticity modulus than steel and approximately the double than\nNiTi, greater recoverability, less force production, high friction level; it is difficult to bend and of higher cost.\n\n【10】Dr. Alfredo Bass and cols. made a study in 2005 comparing the mechanical properties of steel and TMA two and four loop arches.

But in ionic liquids, the positive charge is less focused: because the positive ions are large, the total charge is smeared out across several atoms. In addition, the big, irregular shapes don't form crystal structures at room temperature. \"It's like trying to stack bananas instead of oranges. Bananas just don't stack well,\" comments chemist James H. Davis, Jr., of the University of South Alabama. Unable to crystallize, the substance remains a liquid.\nServing as a new kind of solvent, however, may be just the start. \"This feels like a revolution in the making,\" says Robert B. Morland, an organic chemist at BP Amoco Chemicals in Naperville, Ill. He predicts that ionic in industrial chemistry. This is because, for a particular reaction, chemists can make an ionic liquid with the right positive and negative charge combination to dissolve the catalyst and the chemicals involved in a reaction; the liquid, however, does not affect the product of the reaction. The catalyst stays in the ionic liquid to be reused, and the product may even rise to the surface, where it can be skimmed off, he says. The 段内删除换行-检查复数删除:<u>3</u> French Petroleum Institute is getting ready to license for commercial use a dimer manufacturing process that exploits these very properties, according to Davis.\nDespite chemists' enthusiasm  ,  \" for industry to adopt ionic liquids there will have to be a unique advantage. It's not enough to be a bit more green,\" cautions Robin D. Rogers, director of the 段内删除换行-检查复数删除:<u>3</u> Center for Green Manufacturing at the University of Alabama. Expense is a major hurdle: right now a pound of ionic liquid costs about $检查复数删除:<u>4,000</u> to $5,000. The amount could drop to about $检查复数删除:<u>200</u> a pound, depending on composition and quantity, Morland says. But it is still pricey compared with organic solvents—per pound, acetone sells for about $0.检查复数删除:<u>15</u> and toluene about $0.10. Of course, because ionic liquids can be recycled, a few tons would replace many tons of organic solvent.\nToxicity and environmental tests also need to be conducted, Seddon says. Initial animal test results look good, but the generous bounty of possible ionic liquids creates a catch-检查复数删除:<u>22</u> situation, points out Albert Robertson, a senior chemist with specialty chemical maker Cytec Canada. Toxicity tests cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, so manufacturers are playing a waiting game, unwilling to start testing until they are certain they have the right ionic liquid. But proponents say the hurdles will just slow down the inevitable.\nSeddon and Rogers believe that major applications are some seven to 10 years away. A small-scale industrial application could emerge much sooner, in less than three years.\n</u>\n\n【4】Rebecca Renner is a geologist turned IONIC CRYSTAL called 1-octadecyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, as seen through polarizing filters.

In contrast, ionic solids, which consist of positively and negatively charged ions, dissolve readily in water.

The rescuer should intervene if the choking victim shows signs of severe airway obstruction. These include signs of poor air exchange and increased breathing difficulty, such as a silent cough, cyanosis, or inability to speak or breathe.

If abdominal thrusts are not effective, the rescuer may consider chest thrusts (Class IIb, LOE B). It is important to note that abdominal thrusts are not recommended for infants < 1 year of age because thrusts may cause injuries.\n\nChest thrusts should be used for obese patients if the rescuer is unable to encircle the victim's abdomen. If the choking victim is in the late stages of pregnancy, the rescuer should use chest thrusts instead of abdominal thrusts.\n\nIf the adult victim with FBAO becomes unresponsive, the rescuer should carefully support the patient to the ground, immediately activate (or send someone to activate) EMS, and then begin CPR.  The healthcare provider should carefully lower the victim to the ground, send someone to activate the emergency response system and begin CPR (without a pulse check). After 2 minutes, if someone has not already done so, the healthcare provider should activate the emeregency response system. A randomized trial of maneuvers to open the airway in cadavers 282 and 2 prospective studies in anesthetized volunteers 281 . 283 showed that higher sustained airway pressures can be generated using the chest thrust rather than the abdominal thrust. Each time the airway is opened during CPR, the rescuer should look for an object in the victim's mouth and if found, remove it. Simply looking into the mouth should not significantly increase the time needed to attempt the ventilations and proceed to the 30 chest compressions.\n\nNo studies have evaluated the routine use of the finger sweep to clear an airway in the absence of visible airway obstruction. The recommendation to use the finger sweep in past guidelines was based on anecdotal reports that suggested", "raw_context": [{"text": "Relief of Foreign-Body Airway Obstruction", "bbox": [404.0, 84.0, 638.0, 99.0]}, {"text": "When FBAO produces signs of severe airway obstruction,", "bbox": [404.0, 99.0, 720.0, 113.0]}, {"text": "rescuers must act quickly to relieve the obstruction.
