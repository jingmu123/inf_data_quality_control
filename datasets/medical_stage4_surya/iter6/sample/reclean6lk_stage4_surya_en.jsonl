These agents may have direct bronchodilator effects. In addition, the anesthetic effect of these drugs increases the ease of mechanical ventilation and reduces oxygen demand and carbon dioxide production.

Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), the most common method of delivering NIPPV, allows for separate control of inspiratory and expiratory pressures.\n\n【8】Endotracheal Intubation With Mechanical Ventilation删除多余换行:<u>\n</u>Endotracheal intubation is indicated for patients who present with apnea, coma, persistent or increasing hypercapnia, exhaustion, severe distress, and depression of mental status. Clinical judgment is necessary to assess the need for immediate endotracheal intubation for these critically ill patients. Endotracheal intubation does not solve the problem of small airway constriction in patients with severe asthma; thus, therapy directed toward relief of bronchoconstriction should be continued. Mechanical ventilation in the asthmatic patient can be difficult and associated risks require careful management. Intubation and positivepressure ventilation can trigger further bronchoconstriction and complications such as breath stacking that result from incomplete expiration, air trapping, and buildup of positive endexpiratory pressure (ie, intrinsic or auto-PEEP). This breath stacking can cause barotrauma. Decreasing tidal volume may avoid auto-PEEP and high peak airway pressures. Optimal ventilator management requires expert consultation and ongoing careful review of ventilation flow and pressure curves. Although endotracheal intubation introduces risks, it should be performed when necessary based on clinical condition.\nRapid sequence intubation is the technique of choice and should be performed by an expert in airway management. The provider should use the largest endotracheal tube available (usually 8 or 9 mm) to decrease airway resistance. Immediately after intubation, endotracheal tube placement should be confirmed by clinical examination and waveform capnography. A chest radiograph should then be performed.\n\n【9】##\nTroubleshooting After Intubation\n\n【10】When severe bronchoconstriction is present, breath stacking (so-called auto-PEEP) can develop during positive-pressure ventilation, leading to complications such as hyperinflation, tension pneumothorax, and hypotension. During manual or mechanical ventilation, a slower respiratory rate should be used with smaller tidal volumes (eg, 删除无关数字:<u>6 </u>to 8 mL/kg), 删除无关数字:<u>36 </u>shorter inspiratory time (eg, adult inspiratory flow rate 80 to 100 mL/min), and longer expiratory time (eg, inspiratory to expiratory ratio 1:4 or 1:5) than generally would be provided to patients without asthma. 删除无关数字:<u>37 </u>Management of mechanical ventilation will vary based on patient-ventilation characteristics. Expert consultation should be obtained.\nMild hypoventilation (permissive hypercapnia) reduces the risk of barotrauma. Hypercapnia is typically well tolerated. 删除无关数字:<u>38 . 39\n</u>Sedation is often required to optimize ventilation, decrease ventilator dyssynchrony (and therefore auto-PEEP), and minimize barotrauma after intubation. Because delivery of inhaled medications may be inadequate before intubation, the provider should continue to administer inhaled albuterol treatments through the endotracheal tube.\nFour common causes of acute deterioration in any intubated patient are recalled by the mnemonic DOPE (tube Displacement, tube Obstruction, Pneumothorax, Equipment failure).\nAuto-PEEP is another common cause of deterioration in patients with asthma. If the asthmatic patient's condition deteriorates or if it is difficult to ventilate the patient, check the ventilator for leaks or malfunction; verify endotracheal tube position; eliminate tube obstruction (eliminate any mucous plugs and kinks); evaluate for auto-PEEP; and rule out a pneumothorax.\nHigh-end expiratory pressure can be reduced quickly by separating the patient from the ventilator circuit; this will allow删除多余换行:<u>\n</u>PEEP to dissipate during passive exhalation. If auto-PEEP results in significant hypotension, assisting with exhalation by pressing on the chest wall after disconnection of the ventilator circuit will allow active exhalation and should lead to immediate resolution of hypotension. To minimize auto-PEEP, decrease the respiratory rate or tidal volume or both. If auto-PEEP persists and the patient displays ventilator dyssynchrony despite adequate sedation, paralytic agents may be considered.\nIn exceedingly rare circumstances, aggressive treatment for acute respiratory failure due to severe asthma will not provide adequate gas exchange. There are case reports that describe successful use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in adult and pediatric patients 删除2:<u>40 – 43</u>with severe asthma after other aggressive measures have failed to reverse hyoxemia and hypercarbia.\n\n【11】##\nBls Modifications\n\n【12】BLS treatment of cardiac arrest in asthmatic patients is unchanged.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": " patients with acute asthma. 29 Because the heliox mixture requires at least 70% helium for effect, it cannot be used if the patient requires > 30% oxygen.", "block_text_old": " patients with acute asthma. 29 Because the heliox mixture requires at least 70% helium for effect, it cannot be used if the patient requires > 30% oxygen.", "raw_context": [{"text": "patients with acute asthma. 29 Because the heliox mixture re-", "bbox": [60.0, 83.0, 375.0, 98.0]}, {"text": "quires at least 70% helium for effect, it cannot be used if the", "bbox": [60.0, 100.0, 375.0, 113.0]}, {"text": "patient requires > 30% oxygen.", "bbox": [60.0, 114.0, 218.0, 129.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [59.0, 82.0, 374.0, 128.0], "position": 8, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n## Methylxanthines\n", "block_text_old": "\n## Methylxanthines\n", "raw_context": [{"text": "Methylxanthines", "bbox": [60.0, 140.0, 151.0, 154.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [59.0, 139.0, 150.0, 153.0], "position": 3, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n\nAlthough once considered a mainstay in the treatment of acute asthma, methylxanthines are no longer recommended because of their erratic pharmacokinetics, known side effects, and lack of evidence of benefit. 30", "block_text_old": " Although once considered a mainstay in the treatment of acute asthma, methylxanthines are no longer recommended because of their erratic pharmacokinetics, known side effects, and lack of evidence of benefit. 30", "raw_context": [{"text": "Although once considered a mainstay in the treatment of acute", "bbox": [60.0, 153.0, 376.0, 167.0]}, {"text": "asthma, methylxanthines are no longer recommended because of", "bbox": [60.0, 169.0, 376.0, 183.0]}, {"text": "their erratic pharmacokinetics, known side effects, and lack of", "bbox": [60.0, 185.0, 376.0, 199.0]}, {"text": "evidence of benefit. 30", "bbox": [60.0, 200.0, 169.0, 214.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [59.0, 152.0, 375.0, 213.0], "position": 10, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n\nLeukotriene Antagonists\nLeukotriene antagonists improve lung function and decrease the need for short-acting β 2 -agonists for long-term asthma therapy, but their effectiveness during acute exacerbations of asthma is unproven.", "block_text_old": " Leukotriene Antagonists Leukotriene antagonists improve lung function and decrease the need for short-acting β 2 -agonists for long-term asthma therapy, but their effectiveness during acute exacerbations of asthma is unproven.", "raw_context": [{"text": "Leukotriene Antagonists", "bbox": [60.0, 225.0, 193.0, 239.0]}, {"text": "Leukotriene antagonists improve lung function and decrease the", "bbox": [60.0, 238.0, 376.0, 253.0]}, {"text": "need for short-acting β 2 -agonists for long-term asthma therapy,", "bbox": [60.0, 254.0, 376.0, 267.0]}, {"text": "but their effectiveness during acute exacerbations of asthma is", "bbox": [60.0, 269.0, 377.0, 283.0]}, {"text": "unproven.", "bbox": [60.0, 285.0, 112.0, 299.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [59.0, 224.0, 376.0, 298.0], "position": 12, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n## Inhaled Anesthetics\n", "block_text_old": "\n## Inhaled Anesthetics\n", "raw_context": [{"text": "Inhaled Anesthetics", "bbox": [60.0, 308.0, 168.0, 322.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [59.0, 307.0, 167.0, 321.0], "position": 5, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n\nCase reports in adults 31 and children 32 suggest a benefit of the potent inhalation anesthetics sevoflurane and isoflurane for patients with life-threatening asthma unresponsive to maximal conventional therapy.

With a wavelength of 13 nanometers—almost one twentieth the wavelength being readied for use in commercial chipmaking five years ago—EUV could be extended until the physical challenges of making atomicscale chips rendered existing semiconductor technologies unworkable. And the technology used a machine tool that bears some resemblance to those deployed in existing fabrication facilities.

It expresses itself as mass times acceleration (mass x acceleration) and is a vector that presents:\n\n【4】1. Intensity (measured in g).\n\n【5】2. Sense/Direction (straight or angular). The latter is included between the straight line and an axis of reference.\n删除无关数字:<u>3</u>. Modulus (sense or direction of the force). 删除1:<u>(13)</u>\n\n【6】A force is also defined as a vector with magnitude and direction.\nThe correct unit for force expression is the Newton (N). But in orthodontics forces are expressed normally in g. The conversion factor from g to Newtons is 1g=0.00981N, or 1N=101.937 g. 删除1:<u>(1.14)</u>\n\n【7】This vector is graphically defined by an arrow, indicating the direction of the force (bucco-lingual, mesio-distal, etc.) and the line of action, (where the force is going). The force direction (from buccal to lingual, from mesial to distal, etc.) is defined by the point of the arrow. The vector also shows us the force magnitude that is proportional to the length of the body of the arrow; the point of force application is indicated by the origin or tail of the arrow. 删除1:<u>(11.14)</u>\n\n【8】P oint of l l i l\n\n【9】删除图片4:<u>Fig. 删除无关数字:<u>1</u>. The vector is used to represent force graphically.</u>\n\n【10】The units employed in orthodontics are force and distance.\nForce is defined, as previously mentioned, as the action of a body (wire) over another body (tooth) that changes or tends to change the way the second body moves, due to a push or traction. In the metric system it is measured in g or g x mm 2 , depending if it is considered shear force or force times surface unit (pressure). 删除1:<u>(3)</u>\n\n【11】Sometimes we do not work in orthodontics with a single force, frequently two or more elements add up.\n\n【12】删除图片4:<u>Fig. 删除无关数字:<u>2</u>.

The dispatcher should also provide CPR instructions to help bystanders initiate CPR when cardiac arrest is suspected.\nBecause it is easier for rescuers receiving telephone CPR instructions to perform Hands-Only (compression-only) CPR than conventional CPR (compressions plus rescue breathing), dispatchers should instruct untrained lay rescuers to provide Hands-Only CPR for adults with SCA (Class I, LOE B). 删除无关数字:<u>29\n</u>While Hands-Only CPR instructions have broad applicability, instances remain when rescue breaths are critically important.\nDispatchers should include rescue breathing in their telephone CPR instructions to bystanders treating adult and pediatric victims with a high likelihood of an asphyxial cause of arrest (eg, drowning). 删除无关数字:<u>30 </u>The EMS system quality improvement process, including review of the quality of dispatcher CPR instructions provided to specific callers, is considered an important component of a high-quality lifesaving program (Class IIa, LOE B). 删除无关数字:<u>31 – 33</u>\n\n【3】##\nAdult Bls Sequence\n\n【4】The steps of BLS consist of a series of sequential assessments and actions, which are illustrated in the new simplified BLS algorithm 删除图片5:<u>(Figure 1)</u>. The intent of the algorithm is to present the steps of BLS in a logical and concise manner that is easy for all types of rescuers to learn, remember and perform.\nThese actions have traditionally been presented as a sequence of distinct steps to help a single rescuer prioritize actions.\nHowever, many workplaces and most EMS and in-hospital resuscitations involve teams of providers who should perform several actions simultaneously (eg, one rescuer activates the emergency response system while another begins chest compressions, and a third either provides ventilations or retrieves the bag-mask for rescue breathing, and a fourth retrieves and sets up a defibrillator).\n\n【5】##\nImmediate Recognition And Activation Of The删除多余换行:<u>\n</u>Emergency Response System\n\n【6】If a lone rescuer finds an unresponsive adult (ie, no movement or response to stimulation) or witnesses an adult who suddenly collapses, after ensuring that the scene is safe, the rescuer should check for a response by tapping the victim on the shoulder and shouting at the victim.

They process carcasses with tools of stone or metal. In so doing, they leave imprints of their presence and actions in the form of scars on the bones. These same imprints can be seen on butchered human skeletal remains.\nThe key to recognizing human cannibalism is to identify the patterns of processing—that is, the cut marks, hammering damage, fractures or burns seen on the remains—as well as the survival of different bones and parts of bones. Nutritionally valuable tissues, such as brains and marrow, reside within the bones and can be removed only with forceful hammering—and such forced entry leaves revealing patterns of bone damage. When human bones from archaeological sites show patterns of damage uniquely linked to butchery by other humans, the infer-\n\n【2】##\nence of cannibalism is strengthened. Judging which patterns are consistent with dietary butchery can be based on the associated archaeological record—particularly the nonhuman food-animal remains discovered in sites formed by the same culture—and checked against predictions embedded in ethnohistorical accounts.\nThis comparative system of determining cannibalism emphasizes multiple lines of osteological damage and contextual evidence. And, as noted earlier, it sets the standard for recognizing cannibalism very high. With this approach, for instance, the presence of cut marks on bones would not by themselves be considered evidence of cannibalism. For example, an American Civil War cemetery would contain skeletal remains with cut marks made by bayonets and swords, but this would not constitute evidence of cannibalism. Medical school cadavers are dissected, their bones cut-marked, but cannibalism is not part of this ritual.\nWith the threshold set so conservatively, most instances of past cannibalism will necessarily go unrecognized. A prac-\n\n【3】##\nChopping\n\n【4】Hack marks visible on the left side of this fragment of a human tibia are testament to the removal of muscle and tendon. Tools were also used to make finer slices, to remove tissue or to sever heads from bodies.\nArchaeologists have to be careful in their interpretations, however, because humans process their dead in many ways; not all slice or hack marks indicate cannibalism. tice from Papua New Guinea, where cannibalism was recorded ethnographically, illustrates this point. There skulls of the deceased were carefully cleaned and the brains removed. The dry, mostly intact skulls were then handled extensively, often creating a polish on their projecting parts. They were sometimes painted and even mounted on poles for display and worship. Soft tissue, including brain matter, was eaten at the beginning of this process; thus, the practice would be identified as ritual cannibalism. If such skulls were encountered in an archaeological context without modern informants describing the cannibalism, they would not constitute direct evidence for cannibalism under the stringent criteria that my colleagues and I advocate.\nNevertheless, adoption of these standards of evidence has led us to some clear determinations in other, older situations.\nThe best indication of prehistoric cannibalism now comes from the archaeological record of the American Southwest, where archaeologists have interpreted dozens of assemblages of human remains", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": "\nConsequently, scientists have set the standard for recognizing ancient cannibalism very high.

To date, intra-arterial administration of fibrinolytics has not been FDA approved.

The pending ASA acute ischemic stroke guidelines will provide greater detail about intra-arterial strategies.\n\n【1】参考删除-1:<u>\n##\nGeneral Stroke Care\n</u>\n\n【2】Recent studies establish that stroke unit care is superior to care in general medical wards, and the positive effects of stroke unit care can persist for years. The benefits from treatment in a stroke unit are comparable to the effects achieved with IV rtPA.\nPatients should be admitted to a stroke unit (if available) for careful observation 删除图片5:<u>(Box 11)</u>, including monitoring of blood pressure and neurologic status and physiologic optimization.\nGeneral stroke care, centered on physiologic optimization, includes prevention of hypoxia, management of hypertension, optimal glucose control, maintenance of euthermia, and nutritional support. Additional efforts center on prevention of complications associated with stroke (eg, aspiration pneumonia, deep venous thrombosis, urinary tract infections) and initiation of secondary stroke prevention.\nGiven the requirements for frequent neurologic assessment and vital sign measurements, especially after administration of IV rtPA, patients should be admitted as quickly as possible, ideally within 3 hours from arrival. 删除无关数字:<u>8 </u>If the patient's neurologic status deteriorates, an emergent CT scan is required to determine if cerebral edema or hemorrhage is responsible for the deterioration. Treatment of hemorrhage or edema should be started immediately as indicated.\n\n【3】##\nBlood Pressure Management\n\n【4】Blood pressure management varies depending on whether or not fibrinolytic or intra-arterial therapies were used. Current recommendations for control of blood pressure in patients who receive删除多余换行:<u>\n</u>IV rtPA or intra-arterial recanalization therapies are shown in Table 2. In those patients for whom recanalization is not planned, more liberal acceptance of hypertension is recommended, provided no other comorbid conditions require intervention (Table 3). Normal saline, administered at a rate of approximately 75 to 100 mL/h, is used to maintain euvolemia as needed. In stroke patients who may be relatively hypovolemic, careful administration of IV normal saline boluses may be appropriate.\n\n【5】Glycemic Control删除多余换行:<u>\n</u>Hyperglycemia is associated with worse clinical outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke,删除2:<u>88–95</u>but there is no direct evidence that active glucose control improves clinical outcome. 删除无关数字:<u>96 . 97 </u>There is contradictory evidence for the benefit of insulin treatment of hyperglycemia in other critically ill patients. 删除2:<u>98,99</u>Current AHA/ASA recommendations call for the use of insulin when the serum glucose level is greater than 185 mg/dL in patients with acute stroke (Class IIa, LOE C); however, the utility of administration of IV or subcutaneous insulin to lower blood glucose in patients with acute ischemic stroke when serum glucose is 删除0:<u>¶</u>185 mg/dL remains uncertain.\n\n【6】##\nTemperature Control\n\n【7】Hyperthermia in the setting of acute cerebral ischemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and should be managed aggressively (treat fever > 37.5°C [99.5°F]). 删除2:<u>100–103</u>Hypothermia has been shown to improve survival and functional outcome in patients following resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation (VF) sudden cardiac arrest; however, there are limited data on the role of hypothermia specific to acute ischemic stroke. At this time there is insufficient scientific evidence to recommend for or against the use of hypothermia in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【8】参考删除-1:<u>\n##\nDysphagia Screening\n</u>\n\n【9】All patients with stroke should be screened for dysphagia before they are given anything by mouth. A simple bedside screening evaluation involves asking the patient to sip water from a cup. If the patient can sip and swallow without difficulty, the patient is asked to take a large gulp of water and swallow. If there are no signs of coughing or aspiration after 30 seconds, then it is safe for the patient to have a thickened diet until formally assessed by a speech pathologist. Medications may be given in applesauce or jam. Any patient who fails a swallow test may be given medications such as aspirin rectally or, if appropriate for the medication, intravenously, intramuscularly, or subcutaneously.\n\n【10】##\nOther Stroke Management\n\n【11】Additional stroke care includes support of the airway, oxygenation and ventilation, and nutritional support. Seizure prophylaxis is not recommended, but for patients who experience a seizure, administration of anticonvulsants is recommended to prevent more seizures. 删除无关数字:<u>104 </u>In patients with severe stroke, posterior circulation stroke, and in younger patients, healthcare providers must observe for signs of increased intracranial pressure.\n\n【12】Advances in stroke care will have the greatest effect on stroke outcome if care is delivered within a regional stroke system designed to improve both efficiency and effectiveness. The ultimate goal of stroke care is to minimize ongoing injury, emergently recanalize acute vascular occlusions, and begin secondary measures to maximize functional recovery. These efforts will provide stroke patients with the greatest opportunity for a return to previous quality of life and decrease the overall societal burden of stroke.\n\n【13】##\nSummary", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": " experience is an important factor in ensuring adherence to protocol. 72 Adding a dedicated stroke team to a community hospital can increase the number of patients with acute stroke treated with fibrinolytic therapy and produce excellent clinical outcomes. 82 There is also strong evidence to avoid all delays and treat patients as soon as possible.

In order to move a tooth we must apply a force (elastics, wires, ligatures, coils, etc.) in such magnitude as to overcome friction, this way beginning dental movement. The level of friction depends on several factors, including the type of brace and arch wire used. Stainless steel braces slide with relative ease over stainless steel arch wires and not so well on wires that contain certain percentage of titanium (betatitanium or nickel-titanium) that present a rough surface and generate more friction; furthermore, a ceramic brace has a rough surface that also increases friction. The combination of ceramic braces and stainless steel arch wires produces a great deal of friction. Adding sliding mechanics for space closure will result in a high friction coefficient and more root resorption.

Manufacturers make these elastics with urethane, thus producing light and constant forces with greater deformation capacity. These chains have an active lifetime of 60 days once installed in the mouth.\nThis is because the molecular structure (molecular chain) is folded while the chain is inactive, but when the chain is extended the molecules unfold in a lineal and orderly fashion. The exposition to ozone and ultraviolet radiation breaks up the unsaturated double ligatures at molecular level, which results in flexibility reduction and less traction resistance. This is why manufacturers add antioxidants and ozone inhibitors that reduce these effects. 删除1:<u>( 删除2:<u>10 , 删除无关数字:<u>16</u></u>)</u>\n\n【12】Elastics absorb water and saliva in the mouth, which deforms permanently and destroys the chain at molecular level.

Complications are related to tourniquet pressure 66 and duration of occlusion,67 but there is insufficient evidence to determine a minimal critical time beyond which irreversible complications may occur. Because of the potential adverse effects of tourniquets and difficulty in their proper application, use of a tourniquet to control bleeding of the extremities is indicated only if direct pressure is not effective or possible (Class IIb, LOE B). Specifically designed tourniquets appear to be better than ones that are improvised, 删除无关数字:<u>60</u>.删除2:<u>68 – 71</u>but tourniquets should only be used with proper training (Class IIa, LOE B). If a tourniquet is used, make sure that you note the time it was applied and communicate that time to EMS personnel.\n\n【1】##\nPressure Points And Elevation\n\n【2】Elevation and use of pressure points are not recommended to control bleeding (Class III, LOE C).

Cold water appears to be as effective as warm water, but it is not as comfortable. If running water is unavailable, use any source of clean water. Wounds heal better with less infection if they are covered with an antibiotic ointment or cream and a clean occlusive dressing (Class IIa, LOE A).删除2:<u>83–85</u>Apply antibiotic ointment or cream only if the wound is an abrasion or a superficial injury and only if the victim has no known allergies to the antibiotic.\n\n【7】##\nBurns\n\n【8】Thermal Burns删除多余换行:<u>\n</u>Cool thermal burns with cold (15° to 25°C) tap water as soon as possible and continue cooling at least until pain is relieved (Class I, LOE B). 删除2:<u>86–93</u>Cooling reduces pain, edema, and depth of injury. It speeds healing and may reduce the need for excision and grafting of deep burns.

More frequent renewal of skills is needed, with a commitment to maintenance of certification similar to that embraced by many healthcare-credentialing organizations.\nResuscitation interventions are often performed simultaneously, and rescuers must be able to work collaboratively to minimize interruptions in chest compressions. Teamwork and leadership skills continue to be important, particularly for advanced cardiovascular life support (ACLS) and pediatric advanced life support (PALS) providers. 删除2:<u>36,84–89</u>Community and hospital-based resuscitation programs should systematically monitor cardiac arrests, the level of resuscitation care provided, and outcome. The cycle of measurement, interpretation, feedback, and continuous quality improvement provides fundamental information necessary to optimize resuscitation care and should help to narrow the knowledge and clinical gaps between ideal and actual resuscitation performance.\n\n【3】##\nHighlights Of The 2010 Guidelines\n\n【4】##\nThe Change From \"A-B-C\" To \"C-A-B\"\n\n【5】The newest development in the 2010 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC is a change in the basic life support (BLS) sequence of steps from \"A-B-C\" (Airway, Breathing, Chest compressions) to \"C-A-B\" (Chest compressions, Airway, Breathing) for adults and pediatric patients (children and infants, excluding newly borns). Although the experts agreed that it is important to reduce time to first chest compressions, they were aware that a change in something as established as the A-B-C sequence would require re-education of everyone who has ever learned CPR. The 2010 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC recommend this change for the following reasons:\n\n【6】删除10:<u>Downloaded from http://circ.ahajournals.org/ by guest on September 4, 删除无关数字:<u>2011</u></u>\n\n【7】•The vast majority of cardiac arrests occur in adults, and the highest survival rates from cardiac arrest are reported among patients of all ages with witnessed arrest and a rhythm of VF or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT). In these patients the critical initial elements of CPR are chest compressions and early defibrillation. 删除无关数字:<u>90\n</u>In the A-B-C sequence chest compressions are often delayed while the responder opens the airway to give mouth-to-mouth breaths or retrieves a barrier device or other ventilation equipment. By changing the sequence to删除多余换行:<u>\n</u>C-A-B, chest compressions will be initiated sooner and ventilation only minimally delayed until completion of the first cycle of chest compressions (30 compressions should be accomplished in approximately 18 seconds).\n\n【8】•Fewer than 50% of persons in cardiac arrest receive bystander删除多余换行:<u>\n</u>CPR.  There are probably many reasons for this, but one impediment may be the A-B-C sequence, which starts with the procedures that rescuers find most difficult: opening the airway and delivering rescue breaths. Starting with chest compressions might ensure that more victims receive CPR and that rescuers who are unable or unwilling to provide ventilations will at least perform chest compressions.\nIt is reasonable for healthcare providers to tailor the sequence of rescue actions to the most likely cause of arrest. For example, if a lone healthcare provider sees a victim suddenly collapse, the provider may assume that the victim has suffered a sudden VF cardiac arrest; once the provider has verified that the victim is unresponsive and not breathing or is only gasping, the provider should immediately activate the emergency response system, get and use an AED, and give CPR. But for a presumed victim of drowning or other likely asphyxial arrest the priority would be to provide about 5 cycles (about 2 minutes) of conventional CPR (including rescue breathing) before activating the emergency response system.

More clinical data are needed to define the diagnosis and management of seizures after cardiac arrest. Neuroprotective agents with anticonvulsant properties such as thiopental 196 and single-dose diazepam or magnesium or both198 given after ROSC have not improved neurological outcome in survivors. No studies have addressed whether anticonvulsant therapy improves outcome after cardiac arrest, and several studies demonstrated that post– cardiac arrest seizures were refractory to traditional anticonvulsant agents. 删除2:<u>199–201</u>The same anticonvulsant regimens for the treatment of seizures used for status epilepticus caused by other etiologies may be considered after cardiac arrest.

This time course suggests a potentially broad therapeutic window for neuroprotective drug therapy. However, the number of clinical trials performed to date is limited and has failed to demonstrate improved neurological outcome with potential neuroprotective drugs given after cardiac arrest.\nFew neuroprotective drugs have been tested in clinical trials, and only one published randomized trial 202 was performed in which a neuroprotective drug was combined with therapeutic hypothermia. No neuroprotection benefit was observed when patients (without hypothermia) were treated with thiopental, glucocorticoids, nimodipine, lidoflazine, diazepam, and magnesium sulfate.

However, many patients will die, remain permanently unresponsive, or remain permanently unable to perform independent activities. Early prognostication of neurological outcome is an essential component of post– cardiac arrest care. Most importantly, when decisions to limit or withdraw life-sustaining care are being considered, tools used to prognosticate poor outcome must be accurate and reliable with a false-positive rate (FPR) approaching 0%.\nPoor outcome is defined as death, persistent unresponsiveness, or the inability to undertake independent activities after 6 months. 删除无关数字:<u>203 </u>No prearrest or intra-arrest parameters (including arrest duration, bystander CPR, or presenting rhythm) alone or in combination accurately predict outcome in individual patients who achieve ROSC.\nA thorough neurological evaluation is needed to obtain accurate prognostic findings.

Molly, who was then eight years old, suffered from a potentially fatal genetic blood disorder known as删除多余换行:<u>\n</u>Fanconi anemia. But what made the procedure particularly unusual was that Adam might not have been born had his sister not been sick. He was conceived through in vitro fertilization, and physicians specifically selected his embryo from a group of others for implantation into his mother's womb after tests showed that he would not have the disease and that he would be the best tissue match for Molly.\nWas this ethically appropriate? A panel of bioethicists decided that it was, because donating cord blood would have no effect on Adam's health.\nSelectively conceiving a potential donor is only one of the myriad ethical issues surrounding umbilical cord blood transplantation.

But \"the odds are so extraordinarily against their child's ever needing it,\" says Paul Root Wolpe, a fellow at the University of Pennsylvania Health System Center for Bioethics. He fears that parents who can scarcely afford the service might feel impelled to buy it even though their families have no history of blood disorders.\nViacord, a cord blood–preserving company based in Boston, says that just five of their 6,500 clients have so far needed infusions of their stored cord blood. Moreover, only 20 percent have a family history of a blood disorder or are now in treatment.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics issued a policy statement on umbilical cord blood banking in July 1999 cautioning that \"it is difficult to recommend that parents store their children's cord blood for future use\" unless a family member has had a blood disorder. Instead it encouraged parents to donate their baby's cord blood to public banks.\nQuestions have been raised in the past concerning the ownership of cord blood. But bioethicist Jeremy Sugarman of Duke University states that it is now fairly clear that although an infant owns his or her own cord blood, parents have legal guardianship over it—just as they do over the child—until he or she reaches age 18. Sugarman and Wolpe contributed to a 1997 consensus statement on the ethics of umbilical cord blood banking in the Journal of the American Medical Association .\nSugarman adds that it is perfectly appropriate for a parent to use one sibling's cord blood to treat another. If the first child develops a need for a transplantation later on, the fact that the parents already used his or her stored blood is unfortunate but not unethical.\nOf more concern is how to ensure the safety of cord blood donated to cord banks.\nWhat happens if parents donate a newborn's cord blood to a public bank and the child develops leukemia years later? If the donated blood has no identifying information to link it to the donor, there would be no way to prevent it from being used in another child. Stem cells in the umbilical cord blood of a child who later gets leukemia could also cause leukemia in a recipient. But keeping permanent records of donors carries privacy risks: What if the blood is transplanted into a recipient but doesn't take, and the sick child's parents want to track down the donor child for bone marrow cells?\nMost public cord blood banks label samples so they can be linked to a particular donor for several years, at which time they destroy the identifying information. Wolpe says that this is a good trade-off but that risks will always be associated with donor cord blood, just as they are with donor adult blood. \"You try to keep it as safe as you can,\" he says, \"but people take a chance.\" — Carol Ezzell, staff writer ing sprung from the donor's stem cells.\nBut it took years for other physicians to recognize the potential of umbilical cord blood transplantation. In 1989 Hal删除多余换行:<u>\n</u>E. Broxmeyer of the Indiana University删除多余换行:<u>\n</u>School of Medicine, Edward A. Boyse of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City and their colleagues revived interest in the technique by showing that human cord blood contains as many stem cells as bone marrow does. That same year Broxmeyer, Eliane Gluckman of  Saint- Louis Hospital in Paris and their co-workers reported curing Fanconi anemia—a potentially fatal genetic disorder— in a five-year-old boy using blood from his baby sister's umbilical cord. Since then, approximately 75 percent of umbilical cord blood transplants have used cord blood from a nonrelative obtained from cord blood storage programs.\n</u>\n\n【2】##\nWhat’S Bred In The Bone\n\n【3】UMBILICAL CORD BLOOD transplantation aims to obtain a source of stem cells that is the best possible match for a particular patient's tissue type. Tissue type is determined by a set of genes that make proteins called human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), which are found on the surfaces of all body cells. The immune system recognizes cells bearing the HLA proteins it has encountered since birth as normal, or belonging to the \"self.\" Any other HLA proteins are regarded as \"nonself,\" or foreign; cells carrying them are quickly killed.\nThere are six major HLA genes. Every person has two copies, or alleles, of each— one from each parent. (Each allele can come in more than 30 different types.) For bone marrow transplants, physicians aim to match the six alleles (of the total 12) that are most clinically relevant in transplantation. But because cord blood cells are immunologically different from bone marrow cells, doctors can use donor cord blood samples that match five—or even three—HLA alleles.\nThe genetic blueprints for making删除多余换行:<u>\n</u>HLA proteins are found on chromosome 6.

Wolpe says that this is a good trade-off but that risks will always be associated with donor cord blood, just as they are with donor adult blood. \"You try to keep it as safe as you can,\" he says, \"but people take a chance.\" — Carol Ezzell, staff writer", "block_text_old": " LAST SEPTEMBER a little girl from California named Molly received a lifesaving transplant of umbilical cord blood from her newborn brother, Adam. Molly, who was then eight years old, suffered from a potentially fatal genetic blood disorder known as Fanconi anemia. But what made the procedure particularly unusual was that Adam might not have been born had his sister not been sick. He was conceived through in vitro fertilization, and physicians specifically selected his embryo from a group of others for implantation into his mother's womb after tests showed that he would not have the disease and that he would be the best tissue match for Molly.\n\nWas this ethically appropriate? A panel of bioethicists decided that it was, because donating cord blood would have no effect on Adam's health.\n\nSelectively conceiving a potential donor is only one of the myriad ethical issues surrounding umbilical cord blood transplantation. One of the most significant has to do not with how the blood is used but with the marketing campaigns aimed at prospective parents by for-profit companies that offer to collect and store a baby's cord blood—for a hefty fee—in case he or she might need it later.\n\nSuch companies market cord blood collection as \"biological insurance\" to expectant parents. But \"the odds are so extraordinarily against their child's ever needing it,\" says Paul Root Wolpe, a fellow at the University of Pennsylvania Health System Center for Bioethics. He fears that parents who can scarcely afford the service might feel impelled to buy it even though their families have no history of blood disorders.\n\nViacord, a cord blood–preserving company based in Boston, says that just five of their 6,500 clients have so far needed infusions of their stored cord blood. Moreover, only 20 percent have a family history of a blood disorder or are now in treatment.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics issued a policy statement on umbilical cord blood banking in July 1999 cautioning that \"it is difficult to recommend that parents store their children's cord blood for future use\" unless a family member has had a blood disorder. Instead it encouraged parents to donate their baby's cord blood to public banks.\n\nQuestions have been raised in the past concerning the ownership of cord blood. But bioethicist Jeremy Sugarman of Duke University states that it is now fairly clear that although an infant owns his or her own cord blood, parents have legal guardianship over it—just as they do over the child—until he or she reaches age 18. Sugarman and Wolpe contributed to a 1997 consensus statement on the ethics of umbilical cord blood banking in the Journal of the American Medical Association .\n\nSugarman adds that it is perfectly appropriate for a parent to use one sibling's cord blood to treat another. If the first child develops a need for a transplantation later on, the fact that the parents already used his or her stored blood is unfortunate but not unethical.\n\nOf more concern is how to ensure the safety of cord blood donated to cord banks.\n\nWhat happens if parents donate a newborn's cord blood to a public bank and the child develops leukemia years later? If the donated blood has no identifying information to link it to the donor, there would be no way to prevent it from being used in another child. Stem cells in the umbilical cord blood of a child who later gets leukemia could also cause leukemia in a recipient. But keeping permanent records of donors carries privacy risks: What if the blood is transplanted into a recipient but doesn't take, and the sick child's parents want to track down the donor child for bone marrow cells?\n\nMost public cord blood banks label samples so they can be linked to a particular donor for several years, at which time they destroy the identifying information.

Following the overview of bradyarrhythmias and summary of the initial evaluation and treatment of bradycardia, drugs used in the treatment of bradycardia are presented. See the Bradycardia Algorithm, Figure 3. Box numbers in the text refer to the numbered boxes in the algorithm.\n\n【3】Evaluation删除多余换行:<u>\n</u>Bradycardia is defined as a heart rate of < 60 beats per minute. However, when bradycardia is the cause of symptoms, the rate is generally < 50 beats per minute, which is the working definition of bradycardia used here 删除图片5:<u>(Figure 3, Box 1)</u>. A slow heart rate may be physiologically normal for some patients, whereas a heart rate of > 50 beats per minute may be inadequate for others. The Bradycardia Algorithm focuses on management of clinically significant bradycardia (ie, bradycardia that is inappropriate for the clinical condition).\nBecause hypoxemia is a common cause of bradycardia, initial evaluation of any patient with bradycardia should focus on signs of increased work of breathing (tachypnea, intercostal retractions, suprasternal retractions, paradoxical abdominal breathing) and oxyhemoglobin saturation as determined by pulse oximetry 删除图片5:<u>(Figure 3, Box 2 )</u>.

Is Caffeine Good For People With Asthma?\n\n【2】Caffeine is a naturally occurring compound. The German analytical chemist Friedrich Ferdinand Runge (1795-1867) discovered caffeine in 1819, apparently at the urging of Gœthe, who had encouraged Runge to study and analyze coffee. We now know that caffeine is naturally present in foods such as coffee beans, tea leaves, cacao beans (used to make chocolate), kola nuts, guarana, and maté. Caffeine is also frequently added to beverage products, such as carbonated soft drinks and drinks marketed as \"energy drinks.\" It is also available in pill form, either alone (NoDoze删除0:<u>®</u>,删除多余换行:<u>\n</u>Vivarin删除0:<u>®</u>), or as an additive, to aspirin for example, as in Anacin删除0:<u>®</u> and Excedrin删除0:<u>®</u>.\n\n【3】Research studies of the effect of caffeine in humans confirm that caffeine is a bronchodilator. It improves pulmonary function, and although it is a weak bronchodilator, it clearly has beneficial effects on direct measurements of lung function, such as the vital capacity, the FEV 1 , and expiratory flows (discussed in Question 28). Studies of the human metabolism of caffeine reveal that ingested caffeine is metabolized by the body and transformed into three separate compounds. Caffeine metabolites are paraxanthine, theobromine, and theophylline. Theophylline is a well-known bronchodilator, used in pill form for decades in the treatment of several lung ailments, including asthma, chronic obstructive bronchitis, and emphysema.

The oracle will tell you which way the coin will fall but may lie on just one occasion and may do so after seeing your bet for that flip.

What should your bets be in that case, and what final amount can you be sure to get no matter when (and if) the oracle chooses to lie?\nJust one more thing: you lose everything if you plan to make a bet on a particular move but end up having too little money at that time.\nWarm-up for the first problem: Suppose there are three flips and at most one lie.

Draw circles with a radius of 10 centimeters around each point. These circles must intersect at one or two points, and at least one of these points must lie within the original circle. Label this point Q.</u>\n\n【4】If Q is red, then the line segment B-Q is 10 centimeters long and bicolored.

This puzzle considers how to take advantage of the flaky oracles one is likely to find.\n\nYou have $100 to start with and 10 bets to make. Each bet turns on the result of a coin flip. The oracle will tell you which way the coin will fall but may lie on just one occasion and may do so after seeing your bet for that flip. You can find a counterparty who will give you even odds on any bet you make, so placing an x -dollar bet means he will return 2 x dollars to you if the oracle tells the truth about that flip and will pocket your bet if the oracle lies. How do you end up with the greatest possible final amount, no matter when the oracle chooses to lie?\n\nHere is a second problem: suppose you have to decide the amount of all your bets in advance without knowing when the oracle will lie. What should your bets be in that case, and what final amount can you be sure to get no matter when (and if) the oracle chooses to lie?\n\nJust one more thing: you lose everything if you plan to make a bet on a particular move but end up having too little money at that time.\n\nWarm-up for the first problem: Suppose there are three flips and at most one lie. You have $100. How much should you bet the first time? Given the outcome, how much should you bet the second and third times?

You may have decaffeinated tea if you desire.\n\n【7】4.

The lung symptoms develop later and come to dominate the picture with persistent and productive cough as an unmistakable feature. Fever can last up to 5 days in uncomplicated cases. After other symptoms subside, weakness and fatigue may linger for as long as several weeks.\n\nUnfortunately, not all persons who become ill with influenza have an uncomplicated course as described above. Severe, fulminant, or fatal pneumonia can complicate influenza. Influenza is responsible for more than 35,000 deaths and 110,000 hospitalizations each year in the U.S. alone. Many of the deaths and hospitalizations occur among persons with underlying health conditions that place them at increased risk for complications. Increasing age (age 50 years or older), as well as very young age (age 2 years or younger) also place individuals at increased risk of influenza complications. Pregnancy is a common risk for influenza complications. Asthma is also considered a risk.\nInfluenza can now be diagnosed in a few minutes in a doctor's office. If you have symptoms of influenza, your doctor may advise you to have a nasal wash performed to be tested for the influenza virus. If you test positive for influenza, you might then be a candidate for immediate treatment with the antiviral medicines oseltamivir (Tamiflu删除0:<u>®</u>), which is FDA approved for treatment of influenza for those aged 1 year and older, or zanamivir (Relenza删除0:<u>®</u>), which is approved for older children and adults. Zanamivir is administered by inhalation and may be less desirable in asthmatic individuals. Both medicines shorten the time period during which you can transmit influenza to others and help to reduce the severity and duration of your illness, provided they are taken very early in the course of influenza.

These arrhythmias are not due to a circulating circuit but to an excited automatic focus. Unlike the abrupt pattern of reentry, the characteristic onset and termination of these tachyarrhythmias are more gradual and analogous to how the sinus node behaves in gradually accelerating and slowing heart rate. These automatic arrhythmias include ectopic atrial tachycardia, MAT, and junctional tachycardia. These arrhythmias can be difficult to treat, are not responsive to cardioversion, and are usually controlled acutely with drugs that slow conduction through the AV node and thereby slow ventricular rate.\n\n【1】##\nTherapy\n\n【2】Vagal Maneuvers.  Vagal maneuvers and adenosine are the preferred initial therapeutic choices for the termination of stable PSVT 删除图片5:<u>(Figure 4, Box 7)</u>. Vagal maneuvers alone (Valsalva maneuver or carotid sinus massage) will terminate up to 25% of PSVTs. 删除2:<u>378–380</u>For other SVTs, vagal maneuvers and adenosine may transiently slow the ventricular rate and potentially assist rhythm diagnosis but will not usually terminate such arrhythmias.\n\n【3】Adenosine.  If PSVT does not respond to vagal maneuvers, give 6 mg of IV adenosine as a rapid IV push through a large (eg, antecubital) vein followed by a 20 mL saline flush (Class I, LOE B). If the rhythm does not convert within 1 to 2 minutes, give a 12 mg rapid IV push using the method above.\nBecause of the possibility of initiating atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rates in a patient with WPW, a defibrillator should be available when adenosine is administered to any patient in whom WPW is a consideration. As with vagal maneuvers, the effect of adenosine on other SVTs (such as atrial fibrillation or flutter) is to transiently slow ventricular rate (which may be useful diagnostically) but not afford their termination or meaningful lasting rate control.\nA number of studies 删除2:<u>381–398</u>support the use of adenosine in the treatment of stable PSVT. Although 2 randomized clinical trials 删除2:<u>383 , 删除无关数字:<u>386</u></u>documented a similar PSVT conversion rate between adenosine and calcium channel blockers, adenosine was more rapid and had fewer severe side effects than verapamil. Amiodarone as well as other antiarrhythmic agents can be useful in the termination of PSVT, but the onset of action of amiodarone is slower than that of adenosine, 删除无关数字:<u>399 </u>and the potential proarrhythmic risks of these agents favor the use of safer treatment alternatives.\nAdenosine is safe and effective in pregnancy. 删除无关数字:<u>400 </u>However, adenosine does have several important drug interactions.\nLarger doses may be required for patients with a significant blood level of theophylline, caffeine, or theobromine. The initial dose should be reduced to 3  mg in patients taking dipyridamole or carbamazepine, those with transplanted hearts, or if given by central venous access. Side effects with adenosine are common but transient; flushing, dyspnea, and chest discomfort are the most frequently observed. 删除无关数字:<u>401 </u>Adenosine should not be given to patients with asthma.\nAfter conversion, monitor the patient for recurrence and treat any recurrence of PSVT with adenosine or a longeracting AV nodal blocking agent (eg, diltiazem or β -blocker).\nIf adenosine or vagal maneuvers disclose another form of SVT (such as atrial fibrillation or flutter), treatment with a longer-acting AV nodal blocking agent should be considered to afford more lasting control of ventricular rate.\n\n【4】Calcium Channel Blockers and β -Blockers.  If adenosine or vagal maneuvers fail to convert PSVT 删除图片5:<u>(Figure 4, Box 7)</u>, PSVT recurs after such treatment, or these treatments disclose a different form of SVT (such as atrial fibrillation or flutter), it is reasonable to use longer-acting AV nodal blocking agents, such as the nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil and diltiazem) (Class IIa, LOE B) or β -blockers (Class IIa, LOE删除多余换行:<u>\n</u>C). These drugs act primarily on nodal tissue either to terminate the reentry PSVTs that depend on conduction through the AV node or to slow the ventricular response to other SVTs by blocking conduction through the AV node. The alternate mechanism of action and longer duration of these drugs may result in more sustained termination of PSVT or afford more sustained rate control of atrial arrhythmias (such as atrial fibrillation or flutter). A number of studies have established the effectiveness of verapamil 删除2:<u>381,383,384,386,394</u> 删除2:<u>398,402–405</u>and diltiazem 删除2:<u>402,406,407</u>in converting PSVT to normal sinus rhythm.\nFor verapamil, give a 2.5 mg to 5 mg IV bolus over 2 minutes (over 3 minutes in older patients). If there is no therapeutic response and no drug-induced adverse event, repeated doses of 5 mg to 10 mg may be administered every 15 to 30 minutes to a total dose of 20 mg. An alternative dosing regimen is to give a 5  mg bolus every 15 minutes to a total dose of 30  mg.\nVerapamil should be given only to patients with narrowcomplex reentry SVT or arrhythmias known with certainty to be of supraventricular origin. Verapamil should not be given to patients with wide-complex tachycardias. It should not be given to patients with impaired ventricular function or heart failure.\nFor diltiazem, give a dose of 15 mg to 20 mg (0.25 mg/kg) IV over 2 minutes; if needed, in 15 minutes give an additional IV dose of 20 mg to 25 mg (0.35 mg/kg). The maintenance infusion dose is 5 mg/hour to 15 mg/hour, titrated to heart rate.\nA wide variety of IV β -blockers are available for treatment of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. These include metoprolol, atenolol, propranolol, esmolol, and labetolol (the latter more commonly used for acute management of hypertension than for arrhythmias). In principle these agents exert their effect by antagonizing sympathetic tone in nodal tissue, resulting in slowing of conduction. Like calcium channel blockers, they also have negative inotropic effects and further reduce cardiac output in patients with heart failure. More detailed information is provided below. Side effects of β -blockers can include bradycardias, AV conduction delays, and hypotension. β -blockers should be used with caution in patients with obstructive pulmonary disease or congestive heart failure.\nCaution is advised when encountering pre-excited atrial fibrillation or flutter that conducts to the ventricles via both the AV node and an accessory pathway. Treatment with an AV nodal blocking agent (including adenosine, calcium blockers, β -blockers, or digoxin) is unlikely to slow the ventricular rate and in some instances may accelerate the ventricular response.\n\n【5】Therefore, AV nodal blocking drugs should not be used for pre-excited atrial fibrillation or flutter (Class III, LOE C).\nCaution is also advised to avoid the combination of AV nodal blocking agents that have a longer duration of action. For example, the short elimination half-life of adenosine affords follow-up treatment, if required, with a calcium channel blocker or b -blocker. Conversely the longer half-life of a calcium channel or β -blocker means their effects will overlap; profound bradycardia can develop if they are given serially.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": "\nYet another group of SVTs is referred to as automatic tachycardias.

The alternate mechanism of action and longer duration of these drugs may result in more sustained termination of PSVT or afford more sustained rate control of atrial arrhythmias (such as atrial fibrillation or flutter). A number of studies have established the effectiveness of verapamil 381,383,384,386,394, 398,402–405 and diltiazem 402,406,407 in converting PSVT to normal sinus rhythm.\nFor verapamil, give a 2.5 mg to 5 mg IV bolus over 2 minutes (over 3 minutes in older patients).

The term Bio删除16:<u>¬ </u>mechanics refers to the part of Mechanics that studies movement in relation with biological systems. 删除1:<u>(11)</u> Biome删除16:<u>¬ </u>chanical principles explain the mechanisms of action of the orthodontic appliances and of the force system utilized for dental movement. Common sense use of these concepts will lead to obtain more predictable, efficient and stable treatments. 删除1:<u>(4,删除2:<u>11,14</u></u>\n\n【9】The Mechanics principles and Static design are universal for all orthodontic appliances and do not change with time. When the physical principles of fixed or remov删除16:<u>¬ </u>able appliances are understood, it is possible then to have enough knowledge to build and place a determined appliance. Whoever gets to understand how these physics principles work, will be able to design, select and use orthodontic appliances for greater benefit of the patient. 删除1:<u>(1)</u>\n\n【10】Many different designs in appliances, methods, and phi删除16:<u>¬ </u>losophies are used, but we use forces in all of them, without them orthodontics would not exist. 删除1:<u>(13)</u>\n\n【11】##\nLaws Of Newton\n\n【12】In 1686, Newton presented the fundamental laws of Mechanics, their applications and results. 删除1:<u>(3)</u> The three laws of motion are the following:\n\n【13】1. The law of inertia: Every body continues in its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless it is compelled to change by the forces impressed on it (body in equilibrium). 删除1:<u>(3)</u> A dental malposition can never resolve itself spontaneously; because of this, forces must be applied in order to obtain move删除16:<u>¬ </u>ment. 删除1:<u>(13)</u> In orthodontics we can state that teeth tend to remain almost motionless, unless there is a force applied to provoke tooth displacement. 删除1:<u>(14)</u>\n\n【14】2. The law of acceleration: The change in motion is pro删除16:<u>¬ </u>portional to the motive force impressed and is made in the direction of a straight line in which the force is impressed. 删除无关数字:<u>3 1 </u>In orthodontics we can apply diverse forces with different intensities; it all depends on the tooth that we want to move. 删除1:<u>(13)</u> Said in another way, we can affirm that teeth move in the direction of the applied force, the larger the root volume, the larger the force that has to be exerted to produce physiologic movement. 删除1:<u>(14)</u>\n\n【15】3. The law of action and reaction: To every action there is always opposing and equal reaction. 删除1:<u>(3)</u> The \"secret\" in orthodontics is to minimize or eliminate the num删除16:<u>¬ </u>ber of secondary or collateral effects of treatment; for this to happen they must be understood and clearly identified. 删除1:<u>(13.14)</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": "# Action And Reaction\n", "block_text_old": "# Action And Reaction\n", "raw_context": [{"text": "Action and Reaction", "bbox": [71.0, 92.0, 372.0, 123.0]}], "block_type": "Title", "full_blocks": [70.0, 91.0, 371.0, 122.0], "position": 1, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n# Esequiel Rodriguez, Larry White, Rogelio Casasa, Adriana Natera\n", "block_text_old": "# Esequiel Rodriguez, Larry White, Rogelio Casasa, Adriana Natera\n", "raw_context": [{"text": "Esequiel Rodriguez, Larry White, Rogelio Casasa, Adriana Natera", "bbox": [70.0, 130.0, 512.0, 149.0]}], "block_type": "Title", "full_blocks": [69.0, 129.0, 511.0, 148.0], "position": 2, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n## Introduction\n", "block_text_old": "\n## Introduction\n", "raw_context": [{"text": "Introduction", "bbox": [71.0, 263.0, 167.0, 279.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [70.0, 262.0, 166.0, 278.0], "position": 3, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n\nIn order to have success in an orthodontic treatment, two factors must be combined: a good treatment plan and ex¬ cellent biomechanics.
