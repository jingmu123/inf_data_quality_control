Acceptable alternative positions are anterior-posterior, anterior-left infrascapular, and anterior-right infrascapular. Rhythm checks should be brief, and if an organized rhythm is observed, a pulse check should be performed. If there is any doubt about the presence of a pulse, chest compressions should be resumed immediately. If a cardiac monitor is attached to the patient at the time of arrest, the rhythm can be diagnosed before CPR is initiated.\n\n【7】 CPR Before Defibrillation During treatment of VF/pulseless VT healthcare providers must ensure that coordination between CPR and shock delivery is efficient. When VF is present for more than a few minutes, the myocardium is depleted of oxygen and metabolic substrates. A brief period of chest compressions can deliver oxygen and energy substrates and \"unload\" the volume-overloaded right ventricle, increasing the likelihood that a perfusing rhythm will return after shock delivery.删除2:<u> 141 </u>Performing CPR while a defibrillator is readied for use is\n\n【8】 strongly recommended for all patients in cardiac arrest (Class I, LOE B). Analyses of VF waveform characteristics predictive of shock success have documented that the shorter the time interval between the last chest compression and shock delivery, the more likely the shock will be successful.删除2:<u> 141 </u>A reduction of even a few seconds in the interval from pausing compressions to shock delivery can increase the probability of shock success.删除2:<u> 142 </u>The value of intentionally delaying defibrillation to perform CPR is less clear. One randomized controlled trial (RCT) 143 and one clinical trial144 involving adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest not witnessed by EMS personnel showed that survival was improved by a period of CPR performed before the first defibrillation shock when the EMS response interval was > 4 to 5 minutes. But 2 RCTs 145 .删除2:<u> 146 </u>demonstrated no improvement in ROSC or survival to hospital discharge in patients with out-ofhospital VF or pulseless VT who received CPR from EMS personnel for 1.5 to 3 minutes before defibrillation, regardless of EMS response interval. At this time the benefit of delaying defibrillation to perform CPR before defibrillation is unclear (Class IIb, LOE B).\n\n【9】 When a rhythm check by an automated external defibrillator (AED) reveals VF/VT, the AED will typically prompt to charge, \"clear\" the victim for shock delivery, and then deliver a shock, all of which should be performed as quickly as possible. CPR should be resumed immediately after shock delivery (without a rhythm or pulse check and beginning with chest compressions) and continue for 2 minutes before the next rhythm check.\n\n【10】When a rhythm check by a manual defibrillator reveals VF/VT, the first provider should resume CPR while the second provider charges the defibrillator. Once the defibrillator is charged, CPR is paused to \"clear\" the patient for shock delivery. After the patient is \"clear,\" the second provider gives a single shock as quickly as possible to minimize the interruption in chest compressions (\"hands-off interval\"). The first provider resumes CPR immediately after shock delivery (without a rhythm or pulse check and beginning with chest compressions) and continues for 2 minutes.\n\n【11】After 2 minutes of CPR the sequence is repeated, beginning with a rhythm check.\n\n【12】The provider giving chest compressions should switch at every 2-minute cycle to minimize fatigue. CPR quality should be monitored based on mechanical or physiologic parameters (see \"Monitoring During CPR\" below).\n\n【13】 VF Waveform Analysis to Predict Defibrillation Success Retrospective analysis of VF waveforms in multiple clinical studies suggests that it is possible to predict the success of defibrillation from the fibrillation waveform with varying reliability.删除2:<u> 141,147–166</u> No prospective human studies have specifically evaluated whether treatment altered by predicting success of defibrillation can improve successful defibrillation, rate of ROSC, or survival from cardiac arrest. The value of VF waveform analysis to guide management of defibrillation in adults with in-hospital and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is uncertain (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【14】 Waveform and Energy If a biphasic defibrillator is available, providers should use the manufacturer's recommended energy dose (eg, initial dose of 120 to 200 J) for terminating VF (Class I, LOE B). If the provider is unaware of the effective dose range, the provider may use the maximal dose (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【15】Second and subsequent energy levels should be at least equivalent, and higher energy levels may be considered if available (Class IIb, LOE B). If a monophasic defibrillator is used, providers should deliver an initial shock of 360 J and use that dose for all subsequent shocks. If VF is terminated by a shock but then recurs later in the arrest, deliver subsequent shocks at the previously successful energy level.\n\n【16】 When VF/pulseless VT persists after at least 1 shock and a 2-minute CPR period, a vasopressor can be given with the primary goal of increasing myocardial blood flow during CPR and achieving ROSC (see \"Medications for Arrest Rhythms\" below for dosing) (Class IIb, LOE A). The peak effect of an intravenous (IV)/intraosseous (IO) vasopressor given as a bolus dose during CPR is delayed for at least 1 to 2 minutes. The optimal timing of vasopressor administration during the 2-minute period of uninterrupted CPR has not been established. If a shock fails to generate a perfusing rhythm, then giving a vasopressor soon after the shock will optimize\n\n【17】 Use of a multimodal defibrillator in manual mode may reduce the duration of interruption of CPR required for rhythm analysis compared with automatic mode but could increase the frequency of inappropriate shock.删除2:<u> 139,140</u> Current evidence indicates that the benefit of using a multimodal defibrillator", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "VF/Pulseless VT", "bbox": [60.0, 262.0, 152.0, 277.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [59.0, 261.0, 151.0, 276.0], "position": 3}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Defibrillation Strategies", "bbox": [60.0, 655.0, 189.0, 670.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [59.0, 654.0, 188.0, 669.0], "position": 4}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Drug Therapy in VF/Pulseless VT", "bbox": [404.0, 808.0, 590.0, 822.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [403.0, 807.0, 589.0, 821.0], "position": 5}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Automatic Versus Manual Modes for", "bbox": [60.0, 888.0, 254.0, 903.0]}, {"text": "Multimodal Defibrillators", "bbox": [61.0, 903.0, 196.0, 916.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [59.0, 886.0, 253.0, 915.0], "position": 6}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "in manual instead of automatic mode during cardiac arrest is", "bbox": [403.0, 84.0, 720.0, 99.0]}, {"text": "uncertain (Class IIb, LOE C).", "bbox": [404.0, 100.0, 561.0, 113.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [402.0, 83.0, 719.0, 112.0], "position": 7}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "place the adhesive pads or paddles, and check the rhythm.", "bbox": [60.0, 84.0, 375.0, 99.0]}, {"text": "Paddles and electrode pads should be placed on the exposed", "bbox": [60.0, 100.0, 376.0, 113.0]}, {"text": "chest in an anterior-lateral position.

One of the best tips to speak in a better manner is to keep your head held high while talking.

This will help you sound clear.\n\n【2】 2. Keep your conversation short. Weariness and fatigue can also aggravate speech problems in people suffering from Bell's palsy. In this situation; you may consider cutting your sentences and conversation a bit short. You may use gestures, eye contact and other facial expressions to help you communicate efficiently.\n\n【3】 3.

The results confirmed the existence of the hypothesized plasma tail and revealed an unexpected structure that was dubbed the \"shoulder.\"\n\n【1】 explosively released into the upper atmosphere. Substorms and the attendant auroral displays continued through the rest of July 15 and into the morning of July 16.\n\n【2】During the storm's main phase, which began four hours after its start, the magnetic field strength on the earth's surface fell precipitously, dropping 300 nanoteslas below its normal value.\n\n【3】This phenomenon, the defining feature of geomagnetic storms, resulted from the rapid growth of the ring current. IMAGE's Energetic Neutral Atom imagers produced vivid pictures of this flow of ions and electrons around the earth as it reached its peak on July 16 and then began to diminish [ see top illustrations on page 91 ]. Once the transfer of energy from the solar wind abates, the flow of plasma into the inner magnetosphere slows, and ions are lost from the ring current more rapidly than new ones arrive. As the current weakens, the magnetic field on the earth's surface rebounds. The return to pre-storm levels usually takes one to a few days but may require more than a month in the case of major tempests.\n\n【4】Geomagnetic storms also change the shape of the plasmasphere. The enhanced flow of plasma from the magnetotail toward the earth erodes the plasmasphere by sweeping its charged particles toward the dayside magnetopause. When a storm subsides, the plasmasphere is refilled by ion outflow from the upper atmosphere. Scientists had hypothesized from modeling\n\n【5】 studies that the eroded material from the plasmasphere would form a long tail extending to the dayside magnetopause and that from there it would become lost in the solar wind. Global images of the plasmasphere from IMAGE's EUV instrument have now confirmed this 30-year-old hypothesis [ see illustration at left ]. At the same time, the images have revealed structures in the plasmasphere that raise new questions about its dynamic response to magnetospheric disturbances.\n\n【6】## On The Horizon Although Image Has Opened A New Window On The Magne-\n\n【7】tosphere, our view of space weather is still imperfect. Unlike terrestrial clouds, the clouds of plasma seen by IMAGE are completely transparent: nothing is hidden from sight, but depth perception is lacking. Thus, there will always be the need for satellites that make local measurements of the plasmas, as well as the fields and currents that govern their motion.\n\n【8】The next step for space weather observation will involve clusters of satellites acting like hurricane-hunter planes—they will go where the action is. The European Space Agency is conducting the first such mission, called Cluster II, which was launched in the summer of 2000. (A predecessor mission, Cluster I, was destroyed in a rocket explosion just after liftoff in 1996.) Cluster II consists of four closely grouped identical spacecraft designed to probe turbulent plasma phenomena in the magnetosphere and nearby solar wind. NASA is also planning a cluster mission for launch in 2006. The Magnetospheric Multiscale mission will study reconnection, charged particle acceleration, and turbulence at the dayside magnetopause and at specific locations in the magnetotail where substorms are triggered.\n\n【9】The space agencies are considering even more ambitious missions involving constellations of satellites: dozens of tiny spacecraft that will monitor large regions of space, just as the global weather networks now monitor conditions on the earth.\n\n【10】The first constellations will most likely observe the inner magnetosphere and the dayside magnetopause, with each cake-size craft recording the basic characteristics of the plasmas and magnetic fields.\n\n【11】The earth's magnetosphere is at once protective and dangerous. Its strong magnetic field shields humans from penetrating radiation that would otherwise be lethal. But the field is not strong enough to ward off the most powerful shock waves from the sun. Like the tornado belt or the tropical cyclone zone, the magnetosphere is a place of sudden storms. And that's why storm watchers such as the IMAGE satellite are so important.\n\n【12】ed\n\n【13】## More To Explore\n\n【14】From the Sun: Auroras, Magnetic Storms, Solar Flares, Cosmic Rays.\n\n【15】Edited by S.

Zaritsky\n\n【2】 T n contrast to adults, cardiac arrest in infants and children A does not usually result from a primary cardiac cause. More often it is the terminal result of progressive respiratory failure or shock, also called an asphyxial arrest. Asphyxia begins with a variable period of systemic hypoxemia, hypercapnea, and acidosis, progresses to bradycardia and hypotension, and culminates with cardiac arrest.删除2:<u> 1 </u>Another mechanism of cardiac arrest, ventricular fibrillation (VF) or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT), is the initial cardiac rhythm in approximately 5% to 15% of pediatric in-hospital and out-of-hospital cardiac arrests; 2–9 it is reported in up to 27% of pediatric in-hospital arrests at some point during the resuscitation.删除2:<u> 6 </u>The incidence of VF/ pulseless VT cardiac arrest rises with age.删除2:<u> 2.4</u> Increasing evidence suggests that sudden unexpected death in young people can be associated with genetic abnormalities in myocyte ion channels resulting in abnormalities in ion flow (see \"Sudden Unexplained Deaths,\" below).\n\n【3】Since 2010 marks the 50th anniversary of the introduction of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), 10 it seems appropriate to review the progressive improvement in outcome of pediatric resuscitation from cardiac arrest. Survival from in-hospital cardiac arrest in infants and children in the 1980s was around 9%.删除2:<u> 11,12</u> Approximately 20 years later, that figure had increased to 17%, 13 .删除2:<u> 14 </u>and by 2006, to 27%.删除2:<u> 15 -17</u> In contrast to those favorable results from in-hospital cardiac arrest, overall survival to discharge from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in infants and children has not changed substantially in 20 years and remains at about 6% (3% for infants and 9% for children and adolescents).删除2:<u> 7.9</u> It is unclear why the improvement in outcome from in-hospital cardiac arrest has occurred, although earlier recognition and management of at-risk patients on general inpatient units and more aggressive implementation of evidence-based resuscitation guidelines may have played a role. Implementation of a formal pediatric medical emergency team (MET) or rapid response team (RRT) as part of an\n\n【4】 emergency response system for a deteriorating inpatient has been shown to significantly decrease the incidence of cardiac and respiratory arrests, as well as hospital mortality rates in some large children's hospitals.删除2:<u> 18 -21</u> Such teams, often consisting of providers with expertise in assessment and initial management of acutely ill patients (critical-care nurses, respiratory therapists, and critical-care physicians), decreased the number of cardiac and respiratory arrests by as much as 72% 18 and hospital mortality by as much as 35% in institutions where the effect was studied.删除2:<u> 19 </u>Although it is possible that most of the impact is due to a decrease in respiratory arrests, this cannot be confirmed by the available published data. Implementation of a pediatric MET/RRT may be beneficial in facilities where children with high risk illnesses are present on general inpatient units (Class IIa, LOE B).\n\n【5】Despite the improved outcome of in-hospital CPR, a majority of children with in-hospital cardiac arrest and an even larger percentage of children with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest do not survive, or they are severely incapacitated if they do. Several studies, discussed later in this document, showed that the presence of family members during resuscitation has helped them deal with the inevitable trauma and grief following the death of a child. Therefore, whenever possible, provide family members with the option of being present during resuscitation of an infant or child (Class I, LOE B).\n\n【6】## Bls Considerations During Pals\n\n【7】Pediatric advanced life support (PALS) usually takes place in the setting of an organized response in an advanced healthcare environment. In these circumstances, multiple responders are rapidly mobilized and are capable of simultaneous coordinated action. Resuscitation teams may also have access to invasive patient monitoring that may provide additional information during the performance of basic life support (BLS).\n删除8:<u> The American Heart Association requests that this document be cited as follows: Kleinman ME, Chameides L, Schexnayder SM, Samson RA, Hazinski MF, Atkins DL, Berg MD, de Caen AR, Fink EL, Freid EB, Hickey RW, Marino BS, Nadkarni VM, Proctor LT, Qureshi FA, Sartorelli K, Topjian A, van der Jagt EW, Zaritsky AL.

Fundamental aspects of adult BLS include immediate recognition of sudden cardiac arrest and activation of the emergency response system, early performance of highquality CPR , and rapid defibrillation when appropriate. The 2010 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC contain several important changes but also have areas of continued emphasis based on evidence presented in prior years.\n\n【6】## Key Changes In The 2010 Aha Guidelines For Cpr And Ecc\n\n【7】• The BLS algorithm has been simplified, and \"Look, Listen and Feel\" has been removed from the algorithm. Performance of these steps is inconsistent and time consuming. For this reason the 2010 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC stress immediate activation of the emergency response system and starting chest compressions for any unresponsive adult victim with no breathing or no normal breathing (ie, only gasps).\n\n【8】 • Encourage Hands-Only (compression only) CPR for the untrained lay rescuer. Hands-Only CPR is easier to perform by those with no training and can be more readily guided by dispatchers over the telephone.\n\n【9】Initiate chest compressions before giving rescue breaths (C- A-B rather than A-B-C ). Chest compressions can be started immediately, whereas positioning the head, attaining a seal for mouth-to-mouth rescue breathing, or obtaining or assembling a bag-mask device for rescue breathing all take time. Beginning CPR with 30 compressions rather than 2 ventilations leads to a shorter delay to first compression.\n\n【10】• There is an increased focus on methods to ensure that high-quality CPR is performed. Adequate chest compressions require that compressions be provided at the appropriate depth and rate, allowing complete recoil of the chest after each compression and an emphasis on minimizing any pauses in compressions and avoiding excessive ventilation.\n\n【11】Training should focus on ensuring that chest compressions are performed correctly. The recommended depth of compression for adult victims has increased from a depth of 1½ to 2 inches to a depth of at least 2 inches.\n\n【12】• Many tasks performed by healthcare providers during resuscitation attempts, such as chest compressions, airway management, rescue breathing, rhythm detection, shock delivery, and drug administration (if appropriate), can be performed concurrently by an integrated team of highly trained rescuers in appropriate settings. Some resuscitations start with a lone rescuer who calls for help, resulting in the arrival of additional team members. Healthcare provider training should focus on building the team as each member arrives or quickly delegating roles if multiple rescuers are present. As additional personnel arrive, responsibilities for tasks that would ordinarily be performed sequentially by fewer rescuers may now be delegated to a team of providers who should perform them simultaneously.\n\n【13】## Key Points Of Continued Emphasis For The 2010 Aha Guidelines For Cpr And Ecc\n\n【14】• Early recognition of sudden cardiac arrest in adults is based on assessing responsiveness and the absence of normal breathing. Victims of cardiac arrest may initially have gasping respirations or even appear to be having a seizure.\n\n【15】These atypical presentations may confuse a rescuer, causing a delay in calling for help or beginning CPR. Training should focus on alerting potential rescuers to the unusual presentations of sudden cardiac arrest.\n\n【16】Minimize interruptions in effective chest compressions until ROSC or termination of resuscitative efforts. Any unnecessary interruptions in chest compressions (including longer than necessary pauses for rescue breathing) decreases CPR effectiveness.\n\n【17】Minimize the importance of pulse checks by healthcare providers. Detection of a pulse can be difficult, and even highly trained healthcare providers often incorrectly assess the presence or absence of a pulse when blood pressure is abnormally low or absent. Healthcare providers should take no more than 10 seconds to determine if a pulse is present.\n\n【18】Chest compressions delivered to patients subsequently found not to be in cardiac arrest rarely lead to significant", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "decrease the number of futile transports to the emergency", "bbox": [60.0, 83.0, 375.0, 99.0]}, {"text": "department (ED). 95,97–100", "bbox": [60.0, 101.0, 195.0, 113.0]}, {"text": "Certain characteristics of a neonatal in-hospital cardiac", "bbox": [72.0, 115.0, 375.0, 130.0]}, {"text": "arrest are associated with death, and these may be helpful in", "bbox": [60.0, 132.0, 376.0, 145.0]}, {"text": "guiding physicians in the decision to start and stop a neonatal", "bbox": [60.0, 147.0, 377.0, 161.0]}, {"text": "resuscitation attempt. 101–104 There is more variability in ter-", "bbox": [60.0, 162.0, 375.0, 176.0]}, {"text": "minating resuscitation rates across systems and physicians", "bbox": [60.0, 178.0, 377.0, 193.0]}, {"text": "when clinical decision rules are not followed, suggesting that", "bbox": [60.0, 194.0, 376.0, 207.0]}, {"text": "these validated and generalized rules may promote uniformity", "bbox": [60.0, 210.0, 375.0, 224.0]}, {"text": "in access to resuscitation attempts and full protocol care. 105", "bbox": [60.0, 226.0, 372.0, 239.0]}, {"text": "Offering select family members the opportunity to be", "bbox": [72.0, 240.0, 376.0, 255.0]}, {"text": "present during the resuscitation and designating staff within", "bbox": [60.0, 257.0, 376.0, 270.0]}, {"text": "the team to respond to their questions and offer comfort may", "bbox": [60.0, 272.0, 375.0, 287.0]}, {"text": "enhance the emotional support provided to the family during", "bbox": [60.0, 288.0, 375.0, 301.0]}, {"text": "cardiac arrest and after termination of a resuscitation attempt.", "bbox": [60.0, 303.0, 375.0, 318.0]}, {"text": "Identifying patients during the post–cardiac arrest period who", "bbox": [73.0, 320.0, 376.0, 333.0]}, {"text": "do not have the potential for meaningful neurologic recovery is", "bbox": [60.0, 334.0, 377.0, 349.0]}, {"text": "a major clinical challenge that requires further research.

If, on the other hand, long-term steroid pills are not tapered and are stopped abruptly, the adrenal glands will not have sufficient time to recover and to restart the manufacture of endogenous steroids. The body will be left without any steroids at all, and an \"adrenal crisis\"—a true medical emergency—may ensue.

During the energy crisis of the 1970s, Congress passed a law that required automobile manufacturers to improve the fuel economy of their cars and light trucks. The automakers promptly adopted cheap, ingenious ways to comply with the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards. Thanks largely to more advanced engines and computerized controls, the average gas mileage of new vehicles doubled over the next decade, reaching a high of 26.2 miles per gallon in 1987.\n\n【3】Since then, however, the average has slid to 24.5 mpg, even though automotive engineers are still brimming with ideas for enhancing fuel economy. The problem is that the CAFE standard for cars has been frozen at 27.5 mpg for the past 12 years, and the standard for light trucks is stuck at 20.7 mpg. Moreover, the phenomenal growth in the popularity of sport utility vehicles—which are classified as light trucks—has changed the mix of new vehicles and thus lowered the overall average.\n\n【4】Improving fuel economy is a worthy national goal: it would reduce America's dependence on imported oil and cut the carbon emissions that contribute to global warming. Indeed, the Bush administration recently expressed support for crafting new fuel-economy standards based in part on the recommendations of a National Academy of Sciences panel. The Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers opposes higher standards, but some engineers in Detroit privately concede that they could increase the fuel economy of most vehicles without raising their cost unduly. Opponents of CAFE say higher standards would encourage manu-\n\n【5】 facturers to make their vehicles lighter and hence less crashworthy. Trimming weight, however, need not threaten passenger safety, especially if automakers use more aluminum and other light but strong materials.\n\n【6】General Motors, Ford and DaimlerChrysler have already promised to boost the average gas mileage of their SUVs by 25 percent over the next five years. A report from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, a nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C., estimates that manufacturers could upgrade the fuel economy of midsize cars by more than 50 percent at a cost of about $1,000 per vehicle (which consumers would recoup at the gas pump in about three years). The most talked-about technology is the hybrid vehicle, which employs an electric motor to supplement a gas engine. But other innovations abound.\n\n【7】The integrated starter generator, for example, replaces a conventional generator with a battery system, and the variable displacement engine shuts down some of its cylinders when they aren't needed.\n\n【8】Raising the CAFE standards is the surest way to promote these technologies. Market forces alone cannot do the job, because fuel economy ranks low among most car buyers' priorities. The beauty of CAFE is its flexibility. The standards apply to all automakers, foreign and domestic alike, allowing each to choose any approach for improving the average fuel economy of its fleet. In contrast, the recently proposed tax credit for the purchase of hybrid or fuel-cell vehicles would subsidize one technology that may not prove competitive.\n\n【9】The Sierra Club and other environmental groups support raising the CAFE standard to 40 mpg for all vehicles by 2012, but many automotive experts say this goal is unrealistic. Taking economic and technical considerations into account, a reasonable strategy would be to raise the standard for light trucks to 27 mpg by 2007 and to 32 mpg by 2012, while lifting the standard for cars to 32 and 37 mpg by the same dates.\n\n【10】 THE EDITORS editors@sciam删除10:<u>.com</u>\n\n【11】 LAN TANNEN BAUM The Imageward", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "H SA Perspectives", "bbox": [89.0, 41.0, 472.0, 100.0]}], "block_type": "Title", "full_blocks": [88.0, 40.0, 471.0, 99.0], "position": 0}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Another Cup of CAFE, Please", "bbox": [44.0, 151.0, 590.0, 201.0]}], "block_type": "Title", "full_blocks": [43.0, 150.0, 589.0, 200.0], "position": 1}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Believe it or not, government regulation sometimes can", "bbox": [93.0, 247.0, 376.0, 261.0]}, {"text": "lead to technological innovation.

One prospective, randomized controlled trial in an EMS system with short out-of-hospital transport intervals 67 showed no survival advantage for endotracheal intubation over bag-mask ventilation in children; providers in this study had limited training and experience in intubation.\n\n【3】The endotracheal tube keeps the airway patent, permits suctioning of airway secretions, enables delivery of a high concentration of oxygen, provides an altemative route for the administration of some drugs, facilitates delivery of a selected tidal volume, and, with use of a cuff, may protect the airway from aspiration.\n\n【4】Indications for emergency endotracheal intubation are (1) the inability of the provider to ventilate the unconscious patient adequately with a bag and mask and (2) the absence of airway protective reflexes (coma or cardiac arrest). The provider must have appropriate training and experience in endotracheal intubation.\n\n【5】During CPR providers should minimize the number and duration of interruptions in chest compressions, with a goal to limit interruptions to no more than 10 seconds. Interruptions for supraglottic airway placement should not be necessary at all, whereas interruptions for endotracheal intubation can be minimized if the intubating provider is prepared to begin the intubation attempt—ie, insert the laryngoscope blade with the tube ready at hand—as soon as the compressing provider pauses compressions. Compressions should be interrupted only for the time required by the intubating provider to visualize the vocal cords and insert the tube; this is ideally less than 10 seconds. The compressing provider should be prepared to resume chest compressions immediately after the tube is passed through the vocal cords. If the initial intubation attempt is unsuccessful, a second attempt may be reasonable, but early consideration should be given to using a supraglottic airway.\n\n【6】In retrospective studies, endotracheal intubation has been associated with a 6% to 25% incidence of unrecognized tube misplacement or displacement.删除2:<u> 68–72</u> This may reflect inadequate initial training or lack of experience on the part of the provider who performed intubation, or it may have resulted from displacement of a correctly positioned tube when the patient was moved. The risk of tube misplacement, displacement, or obstruction is high, 67.70 especially when the patient is moved.删除2:<u> 73 </u>Thus, even when the endotracheal tube is seen to pass through the vocal cords and tube position is verified by chest expansion and auscultation during positive-pressure ventilation, providers should obtain additional confirmation of placement using waveform capnography or an exhaled CO 2 or esophageal detector device (EDD).删除2:<u> 74 </u>The provider should use both clinical assessment and confirmation devices to verify tube placement immediately after insertion and again when the patient is moved. However,\n\n【7】 no single confirmation technique is completely reliable.删除2:<u> 75 </u>, 76 Continuous waveform capnography is recommended in addition to clinical assessment as the most reliable method of confirming and monitoring correct placement of an endotracheal tube (Class I, LOE A).\n\n【8】If waveform capnography is not available, an EDD or nonwaveform exhaled CO 2 monitor in addition to clinical assessment is reasonable (Class IIa, LOE B). Techniques to confirm endotracheal tube placement are further discussed below.\n\n【9】 Clinical Assessment to Confirm Tube Placement Providers should perform a thorough assessment of endotracheal tube position immediately after placement. This assessment should not require interruption of chest compressions.\n\n【10】Assessment by physical examination consists of visualizing chest expansion bilaterally and listening over the epigastrium (breath sounds should not be heard) and the lung fields bilaterally (breath sounds should be equal and adequate). A device should also be used to confirm correct placement in the trachea (see below). If there is doubt about correct tube placement, use the laryngoscope to visualize the tube passing through the vocal cords. If still in doubt, remove the tube and provide bag-mask ventilation until the tube can be replaced.\n\n【11】 Use of Devices to Confirm Tube Placement Providers should always use both clinical assessment and devices to confirm endotracheal tube location immediately after placement and throughout the resuscitation. Two studies of patients in cardiac arrest 72 .删除2:<u> 77 </u>demonstrated 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity for waveform capnography in identifying correct endotracheal tube placement in victims of cardiac arrest. However, 3 studies demonstrated 64% sensitivity and 100% specificity when waveform capnography was first used for victims with prolonged resuscitation and transport times.删除2:<u> 78</u>– 80 All confirmation devices should be considered adjuncts to other confirmation techniques.\n\n【12】 Exhaled CO 2 Detectors.  Detection of exhaled CO 2 is one of several independent methods of confirming endotracheal tube position. Studies of waveform capnography to verify endotracheal tube position in victims of cardiac arrest have shown 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity in identifying correct endotracheal tube placement.删除2:<u> 72,77,81–88</u> Continuous waveform capnography is recommended in addition to clinical assessment as the most reliable method of confirming and monitoring correct placement of an endotracheal tube (Class I, LOE A).\n\n【13】Given the simplicity of colorimetric and nonwaveform exhaled CO 2 detectors, these methods can be used in addition to clinical assessment as the initial method for confirming correct tube placement in a patient in cardiac arrest when waveform capnography is not available (Class IIa, LOE B).\n\n【14】However, studies of colorimetric exhaled CO 2 detectors 89 – 94 and nonwaveform P ETCO 2 capnometers 77 , 90 , 95 indicate that the accuracy of these devices does not exceed that of auscultation and direct visualization for confirming the tracheal position of an endotracheal tube in victims of cardiac arrest.\n\n【15】When exhaled CO 2 is detected (positive reading for CO 2 ) in cardiac arrest, it is usually a reliable indicator of tube", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "EMS or healthcare system, and the patient's condition.", "bbox": [60.0, 84.0, 375.0, 99.0]}, {"text": "Frequent experience or frequent retraining is recommended", "bbox": [60.0, 100.0, 377.0, 113.0]}, {"text": "for providers who perform endotracheal intubation (Class I,", "bbox": [60.0, 115.0, 375.0, 129.0]}, {"text": "LOE B). 31. 66 EMS systems that perform prehospital intuba-", "bbox": [60.0, 129.0, 375.0, 146.0]}, {"text": "tion should provide a program of ongoing quality improve-", "bbox": [60.0, 147.0, 375.0, 160.0]}, {"text": "ment to minimize complications (Class IIa, LOE B).", "bbox": [60.0, 161.0, 336.0, 175.0]}, {"text": "No prospective randomized clinical trials have performed a", "bbox": [72.0, 177.0, 377.0, 190.0]}, {"text": "direct comparison of bag-mask ventilation versus endotra-", "bbox": [60.0, 193.0, 375.0, 207.0]}, {"text": "cheal intubation in adult victims of cardiac arrest.

The human respiratory system begins at the nose and includes the nasal passages, which allow air to pass by the back of the throat and to enter the windpipe, or trachea. The trachea sits below the voice box (larynx), and can be felt in the front of your neck as it descends behind the breastbone (sternum) into the upper chest. The trachea divides into two branches: the right mainstem bronchus and the left mainstem bronchus.

After the split, the right and left mainstem bronchi leading to each lung subdivide further into smaller and smaller tube-like passages, via the branching tracheo-bronchial tree. As the bronchi continue to subdivide into successively narrower and narrower bronchi, they ultimately end in the tiniest subdivision, the bronchiole.

BMI is a tool used in population studies of obesity because of its ease of measurement.\n\n【2】The BMI in most individuals correlates to measures of body fat. To calculate your BMI, you can use either metric or conventional American units. You need to know your weight measured in kilograms or in pounds, and your height measured in meters or inches. Then use one of the formulae below:\n\n【3】 **BMI = weight in kilograms + (height in meters × height in meters)\n\n【4】 **BMI = (weight in pounds ÷ height in inches ÷ height in inches) × 703.\n\n【5】 Obesity can be defined based on a person's BMI. An adult with a BMI of between 25–30 is considered overweight, and an adult with a BMI of 30 or greater meets criteria for a diagnosis of obesity. Note that BMI is used differently in children and adolescents. The interpretation of BMI values in children and adolescents requires an adjustment for age.\n\n【6】 Bronchiectasis: A lung disease that causes abnormal, permanent dilatation of the small bronchiolar air tubes and passages that lead to the lung alveoli. Bronchiectasis causes a wide spectrum of disease. In its mildest form, bronchiectasis can be inapparent, asymptomatic, and silent. When more extensive, bronchiectasis can\n\n【7】 lead to recurrent lung infection, along with symptoms of breathlessness, cough, mucus production, and wheezing.\n\n【8】 Bronchiole: The fine, tapered, thinwalled breathing passages that branch and extend from the bronchus, and end in the alveolar air sacs.\n\n【9】 Bronchiolitis: An inflammation of the tiniest bronchial tubes. Bronchiolitis can be secondary to an infection (\"infectious bronchiolitis\"), or from a non-infectious cause such as cigarette smoking (\"smoker's bronchiolitis\").\n\n【10】 Bronchitis: An inflammation of the lining of the larger bronchial tubes.\n\n【11】Bronchitis can be acute, as from infection, or chronic, as in the case of tobacco abuse.

In fact, fibrinolytic therapy is generally not recommended for patients presenting between 12 and 24 hours after onset of symptoms based on the results of the LATE and EMERAS trials, 201.204 unless continuing ischemic pain is present with continuing ST-segment elevation (Class IIb, LOE B). Fibrinolytic therapy should not be administered (Class III, LOE B) to patients who present greater than 24 hours after the onset of symptoms.\n\n【10】## Risks Of Fibrinolytic Therapy\n\n【11】Physicians who administer fibrinolytic agents must be aware of the indications, contraindications, benefits, and major risks of administration so that they are able to weigh the net clinical benefit for each patient (see Table 5).删除2:<u> 203,204</u> This net clinical benefit requires integration of relative and absolute contraindications versus overall potential clinical gain.\n\n【12】Patients who present early after symptom onset with extensive ECG changes (consistent with a large AMI) and a\n\n【13】 low risk of intracranial bleeding receive the greatest benefit from fibrinolytic therapy.删除2:<u> 190 </u>Patients who have symptoms highly suggestive of ACS and ECG findings consistent with LBBB are also appropriate candidates for intervention because they have the highest mortality rate when LBBB is due to extensive AMI.  Inferior wall STEMI also benefits from fibrinolysis, yet the magnitude of this outcome improvement is markedly less robust. More extensive inferior STEMI presentations, of course, demonstrate more robust benefit when undergoing fibrinolysis; inferior wall STEMI with RV involement is such an example. Fibrinolytics have been shown to be beneficial across a spectrum of patient subgroups with comorbidities such as previous MI, diabetes, tachycardia, and hypotension.删除2:<u> 190 </u>Although superior to placebo, the lack of efficacy in the setting of cardiogenic shock makes referral for PPCI an optimal strategy in this setting.\n\n【14】Although older patients ( > 75 years) have a higher risk of death, their absolute benefit appears to be similar to that of younger patients. The incidence of stroke does increase with advancing age, 205.206 reducing the relative benefit of fibrinolytic therapy. Older age is the most important baseline variable predicting nonhemorrhagic stroke.删除2:<u> 206 </u>Although 1 large trial reported lower early and 1-year mortality rates with accelerated administration of tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) in patients < 85 years of age, 207 a retrospective analysis found no specific survival advantage and possible risk for patients > 75 years of age.删除2:<u> 208 </u>Intracranial Hemorrhage\n\n【15】 Fibrinolytic therapy is associated with a small but definite increase in the risk of hemorrhagic stroke, which contributes to increased mortality.删除2:<u> 190 </u>More intensive fibrinolytic regimens using rtPA (alteplase) and heparin pose a greater risk than streptokinase and aspirin.删除2:<u> 200,209</u> Clinical factors that may help risk-stratify patients at the time of presentation are age ( = 65 years), low body weight ( < 70 kg), hypertension on presentation ( > 180/110 mm Hg), and use of rtPA. The number of risk factors can be used to estimate the frequency of stroke, which ranges from 0.25% with no risk factors to 2.5% with 3 risk factors.删除2:<u> 204 </u>Several risk factor estimates are available for use by clinicians, including Simoons, 204 the Co-Operative Cardiovascular Project, 210 and the In-Time 2 trial.删除2:<u> 211</u>\n\n【16】## Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (Pci)\n\n【17】Coronary angioplasty with or without stent placement is the treatment of choice for the management of STEMI when it can be performed effectively with a door-to-balloon time < 90 minutes by a skilled provider (performing > 75 PCIs per year) at a skilled PCI facility (performing > 200 PCIs annually, of which at least 36 are primary PCI for STEMI) (Class I, LOE A).删除2:<u> 2,212,213</u> PPCI may also be offered to patients presenting to non-PCI centers when prompt transfer can result in an effective ballon time of < 90 minutes from first medical contact as a systems goal.删除2:<u> 214

I'm also a regular participant in aerobic class at a neighborhood gym. I find that a routine that includes warm-up stretches, about half an hour of more rapid movement, some weight lifting and some mat work is good for overall toning, as well as mood and relaxation. Although the indoor air of the gym is rather stuffy, I don't need inhaled medication when I work out there.

This appliance distalizes in a bodily manner because the distalization force is located near the center of resistance of the molars.删除3:<u> (5,6,10,36,44)</u>\n\n【23】 This appliance is very similar to the Pendulum, but it has two advantages.

Second, the Distal Jet can easily convert into a Nance button after the molar distalization has taken place.删除3:<u> (5.6.44)</u>\n\n【24】 The Distal Jet is composed of:\n\n【25】 A Nance button anchored to the premolars.\n\n【26】1.\n\n【27】2.\n\n【28】Two 0.036\" wires.\n\n【29】Two telescopic tubes imbedded in the acrylic of the 3.\n\n【30】Nance button.\n\n【31】Two NiTi open coils.\n\n【32】4.\n\n【33】Two stops or screws.\n\n【34】5.\n\n【35】 The distalizing wires can be 0.036\" stainless steel wire; the distal part of the wire, bent as a bayonet, is going to be inserted in the palatine sheaths of both molars, and the mesial ends are inserted in the telescopic tubes that are imbedded in the acrylic of the Nance button. This is go删除16:<u>¬ </u>ing to work as a piston because the wire can slide freely in the telescopic tube. Over each tube a NiTi open coil and a screw are slipped on. The distalizing force is given by the total compression of the coil, which is accomplished by sliding the screw distally and adjusting it to its new position. The pair of telescopic tubes will be parallel to the occlusal plane and as close as possible to the center of resistance of the molar.删除3:<u> (5.6.44)</u>\n\n【36】 The Nance button can be anchored on the first or second premolar. If the first premolars are used as anchorage, the second premolars will move with the molars during distalization, but the loss of anchorage and the overjet will increase. If we anchor the Nance button to the second premolars, we will have less anchorage loss, but the treatment time will increase because the canine and the premolars would have to be distalized in mass.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "5.", "bbox": [72.0, 87.0, 86.0, 102.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [71.0, 86.0, 85.0, 101.0], "position": 2}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "6.", "bbox": [72.0, 124.0, 85.0, 137.0]}, {"text": "7.", "bbox": [72.0, 139.0, 85.0, 155.0]}, {"text": "8.", "bbox": [72.0, 159.0, 86.0, 172.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [71.0, 123.0, 85.0, 171.0], "position": 3}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "It produces a pendular molar movement, so it is pos¬", "bbox": [98.0, 87.0, 384.0, 102.0]}, {"text": "sible that a posterior cross bite may develop.", "bbox": [98.0, 104.0, 344.0, 119.0]}, {"text": "The TMA wires can impinge in the palatine mucosa.", "bbox": [99.0, 121.0, 382.0, 137.0]}, {"text": "The occlusal rests can debond.", "bbox": [99.0, 139.0, 268.0, 155.0]}, {"text": "The anterior bite can open due to the fact that the", "bbox": [99.0, 157.0, 386.0, 171.0]}, {"text": "appliance distalizes molars rapidly.

Hypothermia also impairs coagulation, and any ongoing bleeding should be controlled before decreasing temperature.\n\n【2】In summary, we recommend that comatose (ie, lack of meaningful response to verbal commands) adult patients with ROSC after out-of-hospital VF cardiac arrest should be cooled to 32°C to 34°C (89.6°F to 93.2°F) for 12 to 24 hours (Class I, LOE B). Induced hypothermia also may be considered for comatose adult patients with ROSC after in-hospital cardiac arrest of any initial rhythm or after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with an initial rhythm of pulseless electric activity or asystole (Class IIb, LOE B). Active rewarming should be avoided in comatose patients who spontaneously develop a mild degree of hypothermia ( > 32°C [89.6°F]) after resuscitation from cardiac arrest during the first 48 hours after ROSC. (Class III, LOE C).\n\n【3】## Hyperthermia\n\n【4】After resuscitation, temperature elevation above normal can impair brain recovery.

Case series 70–74 and studies 75–80 suggest that there is an association between poor survival outcomes and pyrexia ≥ 37.6°C. In patients with a cerebrovascular event leading to brain ischemia, studies 75–80 demonstrate worsened short-term outcome and long-term mortality. By extrapolation this data may be relevant to the global ischemia and reperfusion of the brain that follows cardiac arrest. Patients can develop hyperthermia after rewarming posthypothermia treatment. This late hyperthermia should also be identified and treated. Providers should closely monitor patient core temperature after ROSC and actively intervene to avoid hyperthermia (Class I, LOE C).\n\n【5】## Organ-Specific Evaluation And Support\n\n【6】The remainder of Part 9 focuses on organ-specific measures that should be included in the immediate post–cardiac arrest period.\n\n【7】## Pulmonary System\n\n【8】Pulmonary dysfunction after cardiac arrest is common. Etiologies include hydrostatic pulmonary edema from left ven-\n\n【9】 tricular dysfunction; noncardiogenic edema from inflammatory, infective, or physical injuries; severe pulmonary atelectasis; or aspiration occurring during cardiac arrest or resuscitation. Patients often develop regional mismatch of ventilation and perfusion, contributing to decreased arterial oxygen content. The severity of pulmonary dysfunction often is measured in terms of the Pao 2 /F 10 2 ratio. A Pao 2 /F 10 2 ratio of ≤ 300 mm Hg usually defines acute lung injury. The acute onset of bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray and a pulmonary artery pressure 删除0:<u>¶</u> 18 mm Hg or no evidence of left atrial hypertension are common to both acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). A Pao 2 /F io 2 ratio < 300 or < 200 mm Hg separates acute lung injury from ARDS, respectively.删除2:<u> 81 </u>Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), a lung-protective strategy for mechanical ventilation, and titrated F IO 2 are strategies that can improve pulmonary function and Pao 2 while the practitioner is determining the pathophysiology of the pulmonary dysfunction.\n\n【10】Essential diagnostic tests in intubated patients include a chest radiograph and arterial blood gas measurements. Other diagnostic tests may be added based on history, physical examination, and clinical circumstances. Evaluation of a chest radiograph should verify the correct position of the endotracheal tube and the distribution of pulmonary infiltrates or edema and identify complications from chest compressions (eg, rib fracture, pneumothorax, and pleural effusions) or pneumonia.\n\n【11】Providers should adjust mechanical ventilatory support based on the measured oxyhemoglobin saturation, blood gas values, minute ventilation (respiratory rate and tidal volume), and patient-ventilator synchrony. In addition, mechanical ventilatory support to reduce the work of breathing should be considered as long as the patient remains in shock. As spontaneous ventilation becomes more efficient and as concurrent medical conditions allow, the level of support may be gradually decreased.\n\n【12】The optimal F IO 2 during the immediate period after cardiac arrest is still debated. The beneficial effect of high F IO 2 on systemic oxygen delivery should be balanced with the deleterious effect of generating oxygen-derived free radicals during the reperfusion phase. Animal data suggests that ventilations with 100% oxygen (generating Pao 2 >350 mm Hg at 15 to 60 minutes after ROSC) increase brain lipid peroxidation, increase metabolic dysfunctions, increase neurological degeneration, and worsen short-term functional outcome when compared with ventilation with room air or an inspired oxygen fraction titrated to a pulse oximeter reading between 94% and 96%.删除2:<u> 82 -87</u> One randomized prospective clinical trial compared ventilation for the first 60 minutes after ROSC with 30% oxygen (resulting in Pao 2 =110 ± 25 mm Hg at 60 minutes) or 100% oxygen (resulting in Pao 2 =345 ±174 mm Hg at 60 minutes).删除2:<u> 88 </u>This small trial detected no difference in serial markers of acute brain injury, survival to hospital discharge, or percentage of patients with good neurological outcome at hospital discharge but was inadequately powered to detect important differences in survival or neurological outcome.\n\n【13】Once the circulation is restored, monitor systemic arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation.

Taking either medicine later in the course of an established influenza infection does not provide benefit. Oseltamivir is also approved for the prevention (prophylaxis) of influenza in exposed and at-risk adults, as well as adolescents aged 13 years and older.\n\n【1】Neither oseltamivir nor zanamivir are considered a substitute for influenza vaccination.\n\n【2】 The single best way to prevent influenza is vaccination (Table 30). Vaccination against influenza virus causes the body's immune system to manufacture protective antibodies.

The treatment should be implemented according to the studied protocols, which currently include commencement within 6 hours following birth, continuation for 72 hours, and slow rewarming over at least 4 hours. Therapeutic hypothermia should be administered under clearly defined protocols similar to those used in published clinical trials and in facilities with the capabilities for multidisciplinary care and longitudinal follow-up (Class IIa, LOE A). Studies suggest that there may be some associated adverse effects, such as thrombocytopenia and increased need for inotropic support.\n\n【1】## Guidelines For Withholding And Discontinuing Resuscitation\n\n【2】For neonates at the margins of viability or those with conditions which predict a high risk of mortality or morbidity, attitudes and practice vary according to region and availability of resources. Studies indicate that parents desire a larger role in decisions to initiate resuscitation and continue life support of severely compromised newborns.\n\n【3】Opinions among neonatal providers vary widely regarding the benefits and disadvantages of aggressive therapies in such newborns.\n\n【4】## Withholding Resuscitation\n\n【5】It is possible to identify conditions associated with high mortality and poor outcome in which withholding resuscitative efforts may be considered reasonable, particularly when there has been the opportunity for parental agreement (Class IIb, LOE C 101 , 102 ).\n\n【6】 A consistent and coordinated approach to individual cases by the obstetric and neonatal teams and the parents is an important goal. Noninitiation of resuscitation and discontinuation of life-sustaining treatment during or after resuscitation are ethically equivalent, and clinicians should not hesitate to withdraw support when functional survival is highly unlikely.删除2:<u> 103 </u>The following guidelines must be interpreted according to current regional outcomes:\n • When gestation, birth weight, or congenital anomalies are associated with almost certain early death and when unacceptably high morbidity is likely among the rare survivors, resuscitation is not indicated. Examples include extreme prematurity (gestational age < 23 weeks or birth weight < 400 g), anencephaly, and some major chromosomal abnormalities, such as trisomy 13 (Class IIb, LOE C).\n In conditions associated with a high rate of survival and acceptable morbidity, resuscitation is nearly always indicated. This will generally include babies with gestational age ≥ 25 weeks and those with most congenital malformations (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【7】• In conditions associated with uncertain prognosis in which survival is borderline, the morbidity rate is relatively high, and the anticipated burden to the child is high, parental desires concerning initiation of resuscitation should be supported (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【8】 Assessment of morbidity and mortality risks should take into consideration available data, and may be augmented by use of published tools based on data from specific populations. Decisions should also take into account changes in medical practice that may occur over time.\n\n【9】删除13:<u>删除11:<u>删除10:<u>Mortality and morbidity data by gestational age compiled from data collected by perinatal centers in the US and several other countries may be found on the Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) website (www.</u>aap.org/nrp).</u></u>\n\n【10】A link to a computerized tool to estimate mortality and morbidity from a population of extremely low-birth-weight babies born in a network of regional perinatal centers may be found at that site. However, unless conception occurred via in vitro fertilization, techniques used for obstetric dating are accurate to only ±3 to 4 days if applied in the first trimester and to only ±1 to 2 weeks subsequently.\n\n【11】Estimates of fetal weight are accurate to only ±15% to 20%. Even small discrepancies of 1 or 2 weeks between estimated and actual gestational age or a 100- to 200-g difference in birth weight may have implications for survival and long-term morbidity. Also, fetal weight can be misleading if there has been intrauterine growth restriction, and outcomes may be less predictable. These uncertainties underscore the importance of not making firm commitments about withholding or providing resuscitation until you have the opportunity to examine the baby after birth.\n\n【12】## Discontinuing Resuscitative Efforts\n\n【13】In a newly born baby with no detectable heart rate, it is appropriate to consider stopping resuscitation if the heart rate remains undetectable for 10 minutes (Class IIb, LOE C 104 – 106 ). The decision to continue resuscitation efforts beyond 10 minutes with no heart rate should take into consideration factors such as the presumed etiology of the arrest, the gestation of the baby, the presence or absence of complications, the potential role of therapeutic hypothermia, and the parents' previously expressed feelings about acceptable risk of morbidity.\n\n【14】## Structure Of Educational Programs To Teach Neonatal Resuscitation\n\n【15】Studies have demonstrated that use of simulation-based learning methodologies enhances performance in both real-life clinical situations and simulated resuscitations, 107– 110 although a few studies have found no differences when compared to standard or other nonsimulated training.删除2:<u> 111 </u>, 112 Also, studies examining briefings or debriefings of resuscitation team performance have generally shown improved knowledge or skills.删除2:<u> 113–118</u> Interpretation of data is complicated by the heterogeneity and limitations of the studies, including a paucity of data about clinical outcomes. Based on available evidence, it is recommended that the AAP/ AHA Neonatal Resuscitation Program adopt simulation, briefing, and debriefing techniques in designing an education program for the acquisition and maintenance of the skills necessary for effective neonatal resuscitation (Class IIb, LOE C).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy should be offered", "bbox": [60.0, 84.0, 377.0, 99.0]}, {"text": "therapeutic hypothermia.

We don't yet know how many cameras will be required for a given use of tele-immersion, but currently a good guess is that seven is the minimum adequate for casual conversation, whereas 60 cameras might be needed for the most demanding applications, such as long-distance surgical demonstration, consultation and training.\n\n【10】Our computational needs go beyond processing the image streams from the sea of cameras. Still more processors are required to resynthesize and render the scene from shifting perspectives as a participant's head moves during a session.\n\n【11】Initially we used a large custom graphics computer, but more recently we have been able instead to draft commodity processors with low-cost graphics cards, using one processor per eye. Additional processors are required for other tasks, such as combining the results from each of the camera trios, running the imperceptible structured light, measuring the head motion of the user, maintaining the user interface, and running virtual-object simulations.\n\n【12】Furthermore, because minimizing ap-\n\n【13】 parent latency is at the heart of tele-immersion engineering, significant processing resources will eventually need to be applied to predictive algorithms. Information traveling through an optical fiber reaches a destination at about two thirds the speed of light in free space because it is traveling through the fiber medium instead of a vacuum and because it does not travel a straight path but rather bounces around in the fiber channel. It therefore takes anywhere from 25 to 50 milliseconds for fiber-bound bits of information to cross the continental U.S., without any allowances for other inescapable delays, such as the activities of various network signal routers.\n\n【14】By cruel coincidence, some critical aspects of a virtual world's responsiveness should not be subject to more than 30 to 50 milliseconds of delay. Longer delays result in user fatigue and disorientation, a degradation of the illusion and, in the worst case, nausea.

One study in preterm infants showed that initiation of resuscitation with a blend of oxygen and air resulted in less hypoxemia or hyperoxemia, as defined by the investigators, than when resuscitation was initiated with either air or 100% oxygen followed by titration with an adjustable blend of air and oxygen.删除2:<u> 46 </u>In the absence of studies comparing outcomes of neo-\n\n【14】 lation of small numbers of preterm infants in the intensive care unit and in the delivery room has been reported, and such detectors may help to identify airway obstruction.删除2:<u> 55</u>.删除6:<u> 56 </u>However, it is unclear whether the use of CO 2 detectors during mask ventilation confers additional benefit above clinical assessment alone (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【15】删除4:<u> natal resuscitation initiated with other oxygen concentrations or targeted at various oxyhemoglobin saturations, it is recommended that the goal in babies being resuscitated at birth, whether born at term or preterm, should be an oxygen saturation value in the interquartile range of preductal saturations (see table in Figure) measured in healthy term babies following vaginal birth at sea level (Class IIb, LOE B). These targets may be achieved by initiating resuscitation with air or a blended oxygen and titrating the oxygen concentration to achieve an Spo 2 in the target range as described above using pulse oximetry (Class IIb, LOE C). If blended oxygen is not available, resuscitation should be initiated with air (Class IIb, LOE B). If the baby is bradycardic (HR < 60 per minute) after 90 seconds of resuscitation with a lower concentration of oxygen, oxygen concentration should be increased to 100% until recovery of a normal heart rate (Class IIb, LOE B).</u>\n\n【16】 Many experts recommend administration of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to infants who are breathing spontaneously, but with difficulty, following birth, although its use has been studied only in infants born preterm. A multicenter randomized clinical trial of newborns at 25 to 28 weeks gestation with signs of respiratory distress showed no significant difference in the outcomes of death or oxygen requirement at 36 weeks postmenstrual age between infants started on CPAP versus those intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation in the delivery room.

In reviewing the medical literature, members of the International First Aid Science Advisory Board once again found a paucity of evidence to guide first aid interventions. Very little research is being conducted in first aid, and many of the following recommendations are extrapolated from the experience of healthcare professionals. It is important to recognize the limitations of the evidence that supports many of these guidelines so that research can be undertaken and future guidelines can be based on a larger body of scientific evidence.\n\n【5】## Definition Of First Aid\n\n【6】We define first aid as the assessments and interventions that can be performed by a bystander (or by the victim) with minimal or no medical equipment. A first aid provider is defined as someone with formal training in first aid, emergency care, or medicine who provides first aid. First aid assessments and interventions should be medically\n\n【7】 sound and based on scientific evidence or, in the absence of such evidence, on expert consensus. Administration of first aid must not delay activation of the emergency medical services (EMS) system or other medical assistance when required. We strongly believe that education in first aid should be universal: everyone can learn first aid and everyone should.\n\n【8】The scope of first aid is not purely scientific; it is influenced by both training and regulatory issues. The definition of scope is therefore variable, and should be defined according to circumstances, need, and regulatory requirements.\n\n【9】## Calling For Help\n\n【10】A first aid provider must be able to recognize when help is needed and how to get it. First aid providers should learn how and when to access the EMS system, how to activate the on-site emergency response plan (ERP), and how to contact the Poison Control Center (see \"Poison Emergencies\" below).\n\n【11】## Positioning The Victim\n\n【12】As a general rule a victim should not be moved, especially if you suspect, from the victim's position or the nature of the injury, that the victim may have a spinal injury (see \"Spine Stabilization\" below). There are times, however, when the victim should be moved:\n • If the area is unsafe for the rescuer or the victim, move the victim to a safe location if it is safe to do so.\n\n【13】• If the victim is face down and is unresponsive, turn the victim face up.\n • If the victim has difficulty breathing because of copious secretions or vomiting, or if you are alone and have to leave an unresponsive victim to get help, place the victim in a modified High Arm IN Endangered Spine (HAINES) recovery position: 9.10 Extend one of the victim's arms above the head and roll the body to the side so the victim's head rests on the extended arm. Bend both legs to stabilize\n\n【14】 the victim (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【15】• If a victim shows evidence of shock, have the victim lie supine. If there is no evidence of trauma or injury, raise the feet about 6 to 12 inches (about 30° to 45°) (Class IIb, LOE C). Do not raise the feet if the movement or the position causes the victim any pain.\n\n【16】 The evidence for a benefit to raising the feet is extrapolated from leg raising studies on volume expansion; there are no studies on the effect of leg raising as a first aid maneuver for shock. The results of the volume expansion studies are contradictory with some showing an increase in cardiac output, 11–13 while others show no change in cardiac output or mean arterial pressure 14 – 18 with leg raising.\n\n【17】## Oxygen\n\n【18】There is insufficient evidence to recommend routine use of supplementary oxygen by a first aid provider for victims complaining of chest discomfort 19 .删除2:<u> 20 </u>or shortness of breath 21 .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "International First Aid Science Advisory Board", "bbox": [104.0, 82.0, 334.0, 97.0]}, {"text": "Table.", "bbox": [61.0, 84.0, 93.0, 96.0]}, {"text": "Member Organizations", "bbox": [60.0, 98.0, 172.0, 111.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [59.0, 81.0, 333.0, 110.0], "position": 3}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "American Academy of Pediatrics", "bbox": [60.0, 120.0, 194.0, 134.0]}, {"text": "American Burn Association", "bbox": [60.0, 137.0, 172.0, 151.0]}, {"text": "American College of Emergency Physicians", "bbox": [60.0, 153.0, 237.0, 170.0]}, {"text": "American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine", "bbox": [60.0, 173.0, 317.0, 187.0]}, {"text": "American College of Surgeons", "bbox": [60.0, 189.0, 185.0, 203.0]}, {"text": "American Heart Association", "bbox": [60.0, 206.0, 174.0, 220.0]}, {"text": "American Pediatric Surgical Association", "bbox": [60.0, 224.0, 222.0, 238.0]}, {"text": "American Red Cross", "bbox": [60.0, 240.0, 146.0, 255.0]}, {"text": "American Red Cross Advisory Council on First Aid, Aquatics, Safety and", "bbox": [60.0, 258.0, 354.0, 273.0]}, {"text": "Preparedness (ACFASP)", "bbox": [60.0, 273.0, 157.0, 287.0]}, {"text": "American Safety & Health Institute (ASHI)", "bbox": [60.0, 289.0, 230.0, 303.0]}, {"text": "Austrian Red Cross", "bbox": [60.0, 306.0, 141.0, 320.0]}, {"text": "Canadian Red Cross", "bbox": [60.0, 324.0, 145.0, 338.0]}, {"text": "Divers Alert Network.", "bbox": [60.0, 341.0, 146.0, 354.0]}, {"text": "European Reference Center on First Aid Education", "bbox": [60.0, 358.0, 266.0, 372.0]}, {"text": "Egyptian Red Crescent", "bbox": [60.0, 376.0, 154.0, 390.0]}, {"text": "French Red Cross", "bbox": [59.0, 393.0, 136.0, 407.0]}, {"text": "Grenada Red Cross", "bbox": [60.0, 410.0, 141.0, 423.0]}, {"text": "Hong Kong Red Cross", "bbox": [60.0, 428.0, 152.0, 442.0]}, {"text": "Hungarian Red Cross", "bbox": [60.0, 445.0, 148.0, 458.0]}, {"text": "International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies", "bbox": [60.0, 462.0, 328.0, 475.0]}, {"text": "Medic First Aid International", "bbox": [60.0, 480.0, 177.0, 494.0]}, {"text": "National Association of EMS Educators", "bbox": [60.0, 497.0, 219.0, 510.0]}, {"text": "National Association of EMS Physicians", "bbox": [60.0, 514.0, 222.0, 528.0]}, {"text": "National Athletic Trainers' Association", "bbox": [60.0, 532.0, 217.0, 546.0]}, {"text": "National Safety Council", "bbox": [60.0, 549.0, 157.0, 562.0]}, {"text": "Norwegian Red Cross", "bbox": [60.0, 567.0, 150.0, 580.0]}, {"text": "Occupational Safety and Health Administration", "bbox": [60.0, 584.0, 250.0, 597.0]}, {"text": "Red Cross Society of China", "bbox": [60.0, 602.0, 174.0, 615.0]}, {"text": "Resuscitation Council of Asia", "bbox": [60.0, 618.0, 180.0, 632.0]}, {"text": "St. John Ambulance, UK", "bbox": [60.0, 636.0, 161.0, 649.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [58.0, 119.0, 353.0, 648.0], "position": 4}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Previous reports 5–8 have noted the paucity of scientific", "bbox": [72.0, 676.0, 375.0, 691.0]}, {"text": "evidence supporting many interventions in prehospital emer-", "bbox": [60.0, 693.0, 375.0, 708.0]}, {"text": "gency care.

Remember that following hyperoxygenation, the oxyhemoglobin saturation detected by pulse oximetry may not decline for as long as 3 minutes even without effective ventilation.删除2:<u> 106 </u>, 107 • If you are still uncertain, perform direct laryngoscopy and visualize the endotracheal tube to confirm that it lies between the vocal cords.\n\n【5】• In hospital settings, perform a chest x-ray to verify that the tube is not in a bronchus and to identify proper position in the midtrachea.\n\n【6】 After intubation, secure the tube; there is insufficient evidence to recommend any single method. After securing the tube, maintain the patient's head in a neutral position; neck flexion may push the tube farther into the airway, and extension may pull the tube out of the airway.删除2:<u> 108,109</u> If an intubated patient's condition deteriorates, consider the following possibilities (mnemonic DOPE):\n • Displacement of the tube • Obstruction of the tube • Pneumothorax • Equipment failure\n\n【7】## Exhaled Or End-Tidal Co 2 Monitoring\n\n【8】When available, exhaled CO 2 detection (capnography or colorimetry) is recommended as confirmation of tracheal tube position for neonates, infants, and children with a perfusing cardiac rhythm in all settings (eg, prehospital, emergency department [ED], ICU, ward, operating room) (Class I, LOE C) 110–114 and during intrahospital or interhospital transport (Class IIb, LOE C).删除2:<u> 113,116</u> Remember that a color change or the presence of a capnography waveform confirms tube position in the airway but does not rule out right mainstem bronchus intubation. During cardiac arrest, if exhaled CO 2 is not detected, confirm tube position with direct laryngoscopy (Class IIa, LOE C) 110 , 117 – 120 because the absence of CO 2 may reflect very low pulmonary blood flow rather than tube misplacement.\n\n【9】Confirmation of endotracheal tube position by colorimetric end-tidal CO 2 detector may be altered by the following:\n\n【10】 • If the detector is contaminated with gastric contents or acidic drugs (eg, endotracheally administered epinephrine),\n\n【11】 a consistent color rather than a breath-to-breath color change may be seen.\n • An intravenous (IV) bolus of epinephrine121 may transiently reduce pulmonary blood flow and exhaled CO 2 below the limits of detection.删除2:<u> 120 </u>• Severe airway obstruction (eg, status asthmaticus) and pulmonary edema may impair CO 2 elimination below the limits of detection.删除2:<u> 120,122–124</u> • A large glottic air leak may reduce exhaled tidal volume through the tube and dilute CO 2 concentration.\n\n【12】## Esophageal Detector Device (Edd)\n\n【13】If capnography is not available, an esophageal detector device (EDD) may be considered to confirm endotracheal tube placement in children weighing > 20 kg with a perfusing rhythm (Class IIb, LOE B), 125.126 but the data are insufficient to make a recommendation for or against its use in children during cardiac arrest.\n\n【14】## Transtracheal Catheter Oxygenation And Ventilation\n\n【15】Transtracheal catheter oxygenation and ventilation may be considered for patients with severe airway obstruction above the level of the cricoid cartilage if standard methods to manage the airway are unsuccessful. Note that transtracheal ventilation primarily supports oxygenation as tidal volumes are usually too small to effectively remove carbon dioxide.\n\n【16】This technique is intended for temporary use while a more effective airway is obtained. Attempt this procedure only after proper training and with appropriate equipment (Class IIb, LOE C).删除2:<u> 127</u>\n\n【17】## Suction Devices\n\n【18】A properly sized suction device with an adjustable suction regulator should be available. Do not insert the suction catheter beyond the end of the endotracheal tube to avoid injuring the mucosa. Use a maximum suction force of -80 to -120 mm Hg for suctioning the airway via an endotracheal tube. Higher suction pressures applied through large-bore noncollapsible suction tubing and semirigid pharyngeal tips are used to suction the mouth and pharynx.\n\n【19】## Cpr Guidelines For Newborns With Cardiac Arrest Of Cardiac Origin\n\n【20】删除7:<u>Recommendations for infants differ from those for the newly born (ie, in the delivery room and during the first hours after birth) and newborns (during their initial hospitalization and in the NICU). The compression-to-ventilation ratio differs (newly born and newborns – 3:1; infant two rescuer - 15:2) and how to provide ventilations in the presence of an advanced airway differs (newly born and newborns – pause after 3 compressions; infants – no pauses for ventilations).\n\n【21】This presents a dilemma for healthcare providers who may also care for newborns outside the NICU. Because there are no definitive scientific data to help resolve this dilemma, for ease of training we recommend that newborns (intubated or not) who require CPR in the newborn nursery or NICU receive CPR using the same technique as for the newly born in the delivery room (ie, 3:1 compression-to-ventilation ratio</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "the presence of water vapor in the tube, 105 is completely", "bbox": [60.0, 84.0, 376.0, 98.0]}, {"text": "reliable, use both clinical assessment and confirmatory de-", "bbox": [60.0, 100.0, 375.0, 113.0]}, {"text": "vices to verify proper tube placement immediately after", "bbox": [60.0, 115.0, 376.0, 130.0]}, {"text": "intubation, again after securing the endotracheal tube, during", "bbox": [60.0, 131.0, 375.0, 145.0]}, {"text": "transport, and each time the patient is moved (eg, from", "bbox": [60.0, 147.0, 377.0, 161.0]}, {"text": "gurney to bed) (Class I, LOE B).", "bbox": [60.0, 162.0, 237.0, 176.0]}, {"text": "The following are methods for confirming correct position:", "bbox": [73.0, 177.0, 377.0, 192.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [59.0, 83.0, 376.0, 191.0], "position": 2}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "• Look for bilateral chest movement and listen for equal", "bbox": [60.0, 204.0, 377.0, 218.0]}, {"text": "breath sounds over both lung fields, especially over the", "bbox": [71.0, 219.0, 376.0, 233.0]}, {"text": "axillae.", "bbox": [71.0, 234.0, 111.0, 248.0]}, {"text": "• Listen for gastric insufflation sounds over the stomach.", "bbox": [60.0, 250.0, 376.0, 264.0]}, {"text": "They should not be present if the tube is in the trachea. 104", "bbox": [72.0, 265.0, 376.0, 280.0]}, {"text": "• Check for exhaled CO 2 (see \"Exhaled or End-Tidal CO 2", "bbox": [60.0, 280.0, 376.0, 296.0]}, {"text": "Monitoring,\" below).", "bbox": [71.0, 296.0, 184.0, 310.0]}, {"text": "• If there is a perfusing rhythm, check oxyhemoglobin", "bbox": [60.0, 311.0, 377.0, 326.0]}, {"text": "saturation with a pulse oximeter.

This can be horizontal or oblique, depending on the location of the extra oral support and the outer arm.\n\n【11】Center of resistance: It is a point located near 4.\n\n【12】the trifurcate of the roots of the first upper molar.\n\n【13】All the force that passes through the center of resistance of the tooth will promote a translation movement of the tooth and there will be no inclina删除16:<u>¬ </u>tion. Based on this principle, when we use cervical traction, we must angle the external arm of the face bow above the occlusal plane, so the resultant force applied to the upper molar passes though its center of resistance, annulling the inclination effect on the molar. Therefore, if the molar is being inclined by the use of the facial bow, we must proceed to the correction of the position of the external arm.\n\n【14】Fulcrum: It is the center of rotation of the dental 5.\n\n【15】movement and its localization varies depending on the line of force.

It is the stuff of headlines and horror films, drawing people in and mesmerizing them despite their aversion. Cannibalism represents the ultimate taboo for many in Western societies—something to relegate to other cultures, other times, other places.\n\n【2】Yet the understanding of cannibalism derived from the past few centuries of anthropological investigation has been too unclear and incomplete to allow either a categorical rejection of the practice or a fuller appreciation of when, where and why it might have taken place.\n\n【3】New scientific evidence is now bringing to light the truth about cannibalism.\n\n【4】It has become obvious that long before the invention of metals, before Egypt's pyramids were built, before the origins of agriculture, before the explosion of Upper Paleolithic cave art, cannibalism could be found among many different peoples—as well as among many of our ancestors. Broken and scattered human bones, in some cases thousands of them, have been discovered from the prehistoric pueblos of the American Southwest to the islands of the Pacific. The osteologists and archaeologists studying these ancient occurrences are using increasingly sophisticated analytical tools and methods. In the past several years, the re-\n\n【5】 sults of their studies have finally provided convincing evidence of prehistoric cannibalism.\n\n【6】 Human cannibalism has long intrigued anthropologists, and they have worked for decades to classify the phenomenon. Some divide the behavior according to the affiliation of the consumed. Thus, endocannibalism refers to the consumption of individuals within a group, exocannibalism indicates the consumption of outsiders, and autocannibalism covers everything from nail biting to torture-induced self-consumption. In addition, anthropologists have come up with classifications to describe perceived or known motivations. Survival cannibalism is driven by starvation. Historically documented cases include the Donner Party— whose members were trapped during the harsh winter of 1846–47 in the Sierra Nevada—and people marooned in the Andes or the Arctic with no other food. In contrast, ritual cannibalism occurs when members of a family or community consume their dead during funerary rites in order to inherit their qualities or honor their memory. And pathological\n\n【7】 A U T H O R\n\n【8】 cannibalism is generally reserved for criminals who consume their victims or  , more often, for fictional characters such as Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs.\n\n【9】 Despite these distinctions, however, most anthropologists simply equate the term \"cannibalism\" with the regular, culturally encouraged consumption of human flesh. This dietary, customary, gourmet, gustatory or gastronomic cannibalism, as it is variously called, is the phenomenon on which ethnographers have focused much of their attention. In the age of ethnographic exploration—which lasted from the time of Greek historian Herodotus in about 400 B.C. to the early 20th century—the non-Western world and its inhabitants were scrutinized by travelers, missionaries, military personnel and anthropologists. These observers told tales of gastronomic human cannibalism in different places, from Mesoamerica to the Pacific islands to central Africa.\n\n【10】Controversy has often accompanied\n\n【11】 these claims.

The signs and symptoms of stroke include sudden weakness or numbness of the face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body; sudden confusion; trouble speaking or understanding; sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes; sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination; or sudden severe headache with no known cause. Educational efforts need to couple the knowledge of the signs and symptoms of stroke with action— call 911.\n\n【5】## 911 And Ems Dispatch\n\n【6】EMS systems of care include both 911 emergency medical dispatch centers and EMS response personnel. It is imperative that the stroke system of care provide education and training to 911 and EMS personnel to minimize delays in prehospital dispatch, assessment, and transport. Emergency medical telecommunicators must identify and provide high-priority dispatch to patients with stroke symptoms. Current literature suggests that 911 telecommunicators do not recognize stroke well and that the use of scripted stroke-specific screens during a 911 call may be helpful.删除2:<u> 10,28</u> Studies are ongoing to investigate the effectiveness of such a stroke assessment tool for 911 telecommunicators.删除2:<u> 29 </u>, 30 In settings where ground transport to a stroke center is potentially long, air medical services may be used.

Under these circumstances, reconnection takes place along a wide equatorial belt, opening up nearly the entire outer boundary of the magnetosphere to the solar wind. For other orientations of the IMF, reconnection still happens, but it may be more localized in the higher latitudes, where the released energy mainly flows around the magnetosphere rather than into it.\n\n【2】The transfer of magnetic energy from the solar wind radi-\n\n【3】 cally alters the shape of the magnetosphere. When reconnection is initiated on the dayside magnetopause, the interconnected IMF and geomagnetic field lines are swept back by the solar wind over the earth's poles, pouring energy into the northern and southern lobes of the long magnetotail on the nightside.\n\n【4】As the lobes swell with the added magnetic energy, the plasma sheet that lies between them begins to thin. The process continues until the field lines of the northern and southern lobes, which have opposite directions, are pressed together and themselves reconnect.\n\n【5】This second reconnection releases the solar wind's magnet-\n\n【6】 ic field, enabling it to continue its flow through the solar system. At the same time, it allows the earth's magnetic field lines, which have been stretched tailward during the loading of the lobes, to snap back into their normal configuration. The abrupt movement of the field lines heats and accelerates the ions and electrons in the plasma sheet, injecting them into the inner part of the magnetosphere. Some of these particles, traveling along geomagnetic field lines, dive into the upper atmosphere above the earth's poles, stimulating auroral emissions at x-ray, ultraviolet, visible and radio wavelengths as they collide with oxygen atoms and nitrogen molecules. The entire sequence of events— from dayside reconnection to nightside reconnection to auroras—is known as a magnetospheric substorm.\n\n【7】In addition to transferring magnetic energy to the tail lobes, dayside reconnection also intensifies the electric field across the magnetotail. The stronger field, in turn, increases the flow of ions and electrons from the plasma sheet to the inner magnetosphere.\n\n【8】This flow feeds into the earth's ring current, which is carried by charged particles circling the planet above its equator at altitudes between 6,400 and 38,000 kilometers. During longer periods of dayside reconnection— which occur when the IMF's orientation remains consistently southward— the sustained enhancement\n\n【9】 JAMES L.

Burch earned his Ph.D. in space science from Rice University in 1968.\n\n【10】His main research interests are auroral processes, magnetic reconnection and magnetospheric imaging. He is a Fellow of the American Geophysical Union and current chairman of the Committee on Solar and Space Physics of the National Research Council.\n\n【11】 of the earthward plasma flow greatly increases the number and energies of the charged particles in the ring current. An extended period of southward IMF can also lead to a rapid succession of substorms, each of which injects more particles toward the earth. The resulting growth in strength of the ring current is the classic hallmark of a full-fledged geomagnetic storm.\n\n【12】## Here Comes The Sun The Orientation Of The Imf Turns Southward Quite Fre-\n\n【13】quently, so magnetospheric substorms are fairly common: on average, they happen a few times every day and last for one to three hours. But major geomagnetic storms such as the Bastille Day event are much rarer. Although they can occur anytime during the 11-year solar cycle, they are most frequent in the solar maximum period.\n\n【14】Until the early 1990s, it was widely believed that solar flares triggered geomagnetic storms. Space and solar physicists, however, had been assembling evidence that pointed strongly to another culprit, and in 1993 John T. Gosling of Los Alamos National Laboratory wove the various threads of evidence together in an article in the Journal of Geophysical Research that challenged the \"solar flare myth.\" Gosling set forth a compelling argument for the central role of coronal mass ejections in setting off large geomagnetic storms. Scientists still do not know what causes these violent eruptions in the sun's corona, but the phenomenon most likely involves a reconfiguration of the magnetic field lines there. CMEs are often, but not always, associated with solar flares.\n\n【15】Not all CMEs cause geomagnetic storms. Most of the eruptions are not directed at the earth, and of those that are, only about one in six is \"geoeffective\"—strong enough to trigger a storm. The primary factor is the CME's speed relative to that of the solar wind. Only fast CMEs are geoeffective. Why?\n\n【16】When fast CMEs plow through the slower solar wind, they produce interplanetary shock waves, which are responsible for the high-energy particle showers and the severe deformations of the earth's magnetic field. Even more important, a fast-moving CME compresses the solar wind ahead of it, thereby increasing the strength of the magnetic field in the compressed region and in the front part of the CME itself. Moreover, this draping of the field around the CME tends to tilt the IMF more along the north-south direction, which causes a stronger reconnection when the IMF encounters the earth's magnetic field.\n\n【17】A weaker kind of geomagnetic storm occurs during the declining phase of the solar cycle and near the solar minimum period. These disturbances, which tend to recur in phase with the sun's 27-day rotational period, are set off by the interaction between fast solar winds emanating from holes in the corona and slower winds arising from the sun's equatorial streamer belt.\n\n【18】Although CMEs are not the primary cause of recurrent storms, they may contribute to their intensity.\n\n【19】With the launch of IMAGE last year, researchers finally had the means to obtain global views of the minute-by-minute progress of a large geomagnetic storm.

Time delays to PCI range from 45 to 120 minutes and are associated with age, symptom duration, and location of infarction. These delays may negate the benefit of PCI over fibrinolytics.删除2:<u> 86,242</u> In addition, the benefit of PCI over fibrinolytics is offset when PCI is carried out in low-volume PCI centers.删除2:<u> 212 </u>PCI has been shown to be superior to fibrinolysis on the combined end points of short-term death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and stroke.\n\n【1】Pinto and colleagues86 have performed a very important analysis of the \"PCI versus fibrinolysis\" consideration in the STEMI patient. Their analysis asked the following questions for the patient with STEMI: How long should the practitioner wait for PCI in a patient who is fibrinolytic eligible? And, in this waiting period for PCI, when is the benefit of the catheter-based therapy lost and fibrinolysis becomes the preferred option? Time recommendations– essentially the answer to the above questions—are provided with respect to patient age, infarct duration, and MI anatomic location. This paper provides the emergency physician with the total elapsed time that he or she should wait for PCI, at which point the survival benefit of the invasive strategy is lost and the patient should receive a fibrinolytic agent. These times include the following:\n • For patients presenting within 2 hours of symptom onset: 94 minutes\n • For patients presenting beyond 2 hours of symptom onset: 190 minutes\n • For patients less than 65 years of age: 71 minutes • For patients greater than 65 years of age: 155 minutes • Anterior STEMI: 115 minutes • Nonanterior STEMI: 112 minutes\n\n【2】 Further analysis combined commonly encountered clinical variables in typical STEMI presentations:\n\n【3】 • Patient presentation within 2 hours of symptom onset and\n\n【4】 –anterior STEMI with age < 65 years: 40 minutes –anterior STEMI with age > 65 years: 107 minutes —non-anterior STEMI with age <65 years: 58 minutes –non-anterior STEMI with age > 65 years: 168 minutes\n\n【5】 • Patient presentation beyond 2 hours of symptom onset and\n\n【6】 –anterior STEMI with age < 65 years: 43 minutes anterior STEMI with age > 65 years: 148 minutes –nonanterior STEMI with age <65 years: 103 minutes -nonanterior STEMI with age > 65 years: 179 minutes\n\n【7】 Post hoc analysis and theoretical constructs have addressed the time delay that mitigates the benefit of PPCI as compared to fibrinolytic therapy in the absence of randomized trials.\n\n【8】The time delay has been analyzed to be between 60 and 120 minutes.删除2:<u> 86,243–2436</u> Taking these into consideration, the recent European Society of Cardiology recommendation extended the time delay indicating that PPCI should be performed within 2 hours from first medical contact except in those\n\n【9】 patients with a large amount of myocardium is at risk (maximum delay of 90 minutes).删除2:<u> 242</u>c The ACC AHA 2009 Focused STEMI Writing Group noted, \"There has been discussion about whether the recommended door-to-balloon time (or first medical contact to balloon time) should be greater than 90 minutes. However, the writing group continues to believe that the focus should be on developing systems of care to increase the number of patients with timely access to PCI rather than extending the acceptable window for door-to-balloon time.'' 1 Delays to reperfusion therapy are not without negative consequence as noted in a subset of patients in the GRACE (Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events) database. The authors of this registry examined the outcome impact of treatment delays on STEMI patients receiving reperfusion therapy. This study involved 3959 patients from 106 hospitals in 14 countries who presented within 6 hours of chest pain onset and underwent either PCI (55%) or fibrinolysis (45%). Delays in reperfusion were associated with increased mortality for both treatment strategies, yet were more pronounced in those patients receiving fibrinolysis.删除2:<u> 2434 </u>A cooperative and interdisciplinary effort between emergency medicine and cardiology, as well as among the EMS agencies, the catheterization laboratory, and the CCU, has the potential to reduce markedly the door-totherapy time in STEMI patients and therefore limit delays in providing this time-sensitive treatment. Prior agreement between the ED and cardiovascular physicians at institutions with invasive capability must be obtained so that consideration of PCI does not introduce further delays in fibrinolytic drug administration; such cooperation can limit additional delays in the administration of fibrinolytic agents in patients who are considered for PCI in AMI.\n\n【10】A systems of care approach involving a reperfusion team or \"STEMI alert\" system mobilizes hospital-based resources, optimizing the approach to the patient. This system, whether activated by data gathered in the ED or prehospital-based information, has the potential to offer time-sensitive therapies in a rapid fashion to these ill patients.\n\n【11】In summary, for patients presenting within 12 hours of symptom onset and electrocardiographic findings consistent with STEMI, reperfusion should be initiated as soon as possible – independent of the method chosen (Class I, LOE A). Primary PCI performed at a high-volume center within 90 minutes of first medical contact by an experienced operator that maintains an appropriate expert status is reasonable, as it improves morbidity and mortality as compared with immediate fibrinolysis ( < 30 minutes doorto-needle) (Class I, LOE A). If PCI cannot be accomplished within 90 minutes of first medical contact, independent of the need for emergent transfer, then fibrinolysis is recommended, assuming the patient lacks contraindications to such therapy (Class I, LOE B). For those patients with a contraindication to fibrinolysis, PCI is recommended despite the delay, rather than foregoing reperfusion therapy (Class I, LOE A). For those STEMI patients presenting in shock, PCI (or CABG) is the preferred reperfusion treatment.

{"seq_id": "2a18af6e-547e-4179-96a8-e5cd753ff08c", "title": null, "text": "【0】页码:13\n• Since 2005 considerable new data have emerged on the use of tourniquets to control bleeding. This experience comes primarily from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan. There is no question that tourniquets do control bleeding, but if left on too long, they can cause gangrene distal to the application and systemic complications, including shock and death. Protocols for the proper use of tourniquets to control bleeding exist, but there is no experience with civilian use or how to teach the proper application of tourniquets to first aid providers. Studies have shown that not all tourniquets are the same, and some manufactured tourniquets perform better than others and better than tourniquets that are improvised.\n\n【1】Because of its importance, the issue of spinal stabilization was once again reviewed. Unfortunately very little new data are available, and it is still not clear whether secondary spinal cord injury is a real problem and whether the methods recommended for spinal stabilization or movement restriction are effective.\n\n【2】• The literature regarding first aid for snake bites was once again reviewed. In the 2005 review evidence was found for a beneficial effect from pressure immobilization for neurotoxic snake bites, but it now appears that there is a benefit even for non-neurotoxic snake bites. The challenge is that the range of pressure needed under the immobilization bandage appears to be critical and may be difficult to teach or estimate in the field.\n\n【3】• A new section on jellyfish stings has been added and new\n\n【4】 recommendations for treatment have been made.\n\n【5】• The literature on the first aid treatment of frostbite was reviewed. There continues to be evidence of potential harm in thawing of a frozen body part if there is any chance of refreezing. The literature is mixed on the benefit of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents as a first aid treatment for frostbite. Chemical warmers should not be used because they may generate temperatures capable of causing tissue injury.\n • Oral fluid replacement has been found to be as effective as IV fluid in exercise- or heat-induced dehydration. The best oral fluid appears to be a carbohydrate-electrolyte mixture.\n\n【6】## Conflict Of Interest Management\n\n【7】Throughout the 2010 evidence evaluation process the AHA and the International Liaison Committee on Resusciation (ILCOR) followed rigorous conflict of interest (COI) policies to ensure that the potential for commercial bias was minimized. The COI process was based on the successful policies and actions used in developing the 2005 International Consensus on CPR and ECC Science With Treatment Recommendations .删除2:<u> 168,169</u> In 2007 ILCOR modified the COI management policies to be used for the 2010 evidence evaluation process, further enhancing and building on the process used in 2005. Modifications ensured that commercial relationships were identified as early as possible to avoid potential conflicts by reassigning the role to a participant who had no conflicts before work began. The revisions also took into account changes in AHA policies, approved by the AHA Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee in 2009, regarding requirements for scientific statement and guideline writing group chairs and members.\n\n【8】 The COI policies and actions for the 2010 evidence evaluation process 170 described in full in Part 2 of this publication applied to the entire 5-year consensus development process—before, during, and after the actual 2010 International Consensus Conference. The policies applied to all aspects of the evidence evaluation process, including selection of leaders and members of ILCOR task forces and writing groups, selection of topics for worksheets, selection of worksheet authors, presentation and discussion of worksheets, development of final Consensus on Science statements, and, for the AHA, creation of the 2010 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC that follow in this publication. The policies applied to all volunteers and staff involved in the process, including all leaders and members of ILCOR committees (Conference Planning Committee, Editorial Board, and Task Forces for resuscitation areas), all evidence evaluation worksheet authors, and all 2010 International Consensus Conference participants.\n\n【9】As in 2005, during the entire 2010 International Consensus Conference every participant used his or her assigned number when speaking as a presenter, panelist, moderator, or commentator from the floor. For the duration of each speaker's comments, a slide was displayed with the speaker's name, institution, and any commercial relationships the speaker had disclosed so that the audience could assess the impact these relationships might have on the speaker's input. All participants were encouraged to raise any concerns with the moderators or identified COI leads for the conference. Depending on the nature of the relationship and their role in the guidelines process, participants were restricted from some activities (ie, leading, voting, deciding, writing) that directly or indirectly related to that commercial interest. Although the focus of the evidence evaluation process was evaluation of the scientific data and translation of that evidence into treatment recommendations and guidelines, attention to potential conflicts of interest was omnipresent throughout the process, helping ensure evidence-based guidelines free of commercial influence.\n\n【10】## Summary\n\n【11】As we mark the 50th anniversary of modern-era CPR, we must acknowledge that, despite measurable progress aimed at its prevention, cardiac arrest—both in and out of the hospital—continues to be a major public health challenge.\n\n【12】Over these 50 years, scientific knowledge about arrest pathophysiology and resuscitation mechanisms has increased substantially. In our ongoing commitment to ensure optimal community-based care for all victims of cardiac arrest, we must continue to effectively translate the science of resuscitation into clinical care and improved resuscitation outcomes.\n\n【13】## Acknowledgments\n\n【14】The writing group gratefully acknowledges the extraordinary dedication and contributions of the AHA ECC staff, especially Kara Robinson, as well as David Barnes, Jennifer Denton, Lana Gent, Colleen Halverson, Jody Hundley, Alicia Pederson, Tanya Semenko, and Nina Tran.

Relatively few independent studies have been published, but manufacturers have conducted extensive analyses, because they are legally required to ensure that the foods they sell meet federal safety standards. In the past, the companies have submitted test results to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration voluntarily in advance of sale. But an FDA rule proposed in January should make such review mandatory.\n\n【2】The manufacturers' studies typically begin by comparing the GM version under consideration with conventionally bred plants of the same variety, to see whether the addition of a foreign gene significantly alters the GM plant's chemical makeup and nutritional value. If the proteins made from the inserted genes are the only discernible differences, those proteins are checked for toxicity by feeding them to animals in quantities thousands of times higher than humans would ever consume.\n\n【3】If the genetic modification leads to more extensive changes, toxicity testers may feed the complete GM food to lab animals.\n\n【4】To assess the allergy-inducing potential, scientists check the\n\n【5】 to be abandoned before they had a chance to hit grocery shelves. \"I don't know of any evidence that any product on the market is unsafe,\" says Peter Day, director of the Institute of Biomolecular Research at Rutgers University.\n\n【6】The safety tests are not necessarily foolproof, though. For example, GM plants often cannot make enough of the foreign protein for use in feeding studies. So researchers have bacteria churn out the proteins. But a protein made by plants, the form people would consume, might be slightly different from the one made by microbes—a difference that might theoretically affect the safety assessment of that protein. And studies using whole GM foods are limited by the amount of any food that can be introduced into an animal's diet without generating nutritional imbalances that can confound the test results. This effect is one reason that scientists have criticized a controversial 1999 study claiming that the foreign DNA in GM potatoes led to abnormalities in the intestinal lining in rats.\n\n【7】Beyond the acute safety considerations, some critics fear that GM foods will do harm more insidiously, by hastening the spread of antibiotic resistance in disease-causing bacteria.\n\n【8】When food designers genetically alter a plant, they couple the\n\n【9】## Detractors Cite Several Reasons For Concern.\n\n【10】Perhaps Proteins Made From The Foreign Genes Will Be Directly Toxic To\nHumans.

Proteins are also treated with acid to mimic the environment they will encounter in the stomach; most known allergens are quite stable and survive such treatment unscathed. Finally, investigators consider the original source of the protein. \"There is no way that a peanut gene will ever be allowed into a strawberry,\" observes T. J. Higgins of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization in Australia: too many people are allergic to proteins in peanuts.\n\n【12】Arguably, the testing system has worked well so far. It showed that the protein in StarLink corn might be allergenic (hence the animal-feed-only approval) and led other products— such as soybeans that contained a protein from Brazil nuts—\n\n【13】## More To Explore\n\n【14】删除8:<u>Adequacy of Methods for Testing the Safety of Genetically Modified Foods.

Often the marker genes render plant cells resistant to antibiotics that typically kill them. At issue is the possibility that resistance genes might somehow jump from GM foods to bacteria in a consumer's gut, thereby aggravating the already troubling rise of antibiotic resistance among disease-causing bacteria.\n\n【19】The chances of such transfer are reportedly remote—\"less likely than winning a national lottery three times in a row,\" notes Hans Günter Gassen of the Institute of Biochemistry at the University of Technology in Darmstadt, Germany. Even so, to allay public concern, the use of antibiotic resistance genes will probably be phased out in the next five years.\n\n【20】Meanwhile many consumers remain disturbed that most safety tests are performed by the very corporations that produce GM foods. Steve L. Taylor, head of the department of food science and technology at the University of Nebraska, admits that some may view the practice as unseemly. But, he asks, who else should shoulder the burden—and the expense? \"I'd rather see the companies spend the money than have the government use my tax dollars,\" he adds. \"I don't care if we're talking about bicycles or GM corn, it's their obligation to prove that their products are safe.\" No doubt concerned scientists and citizens will continue watching to see that they do so.\n\n【21】e</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "to people in developing nations who suffer from malnutrition.", "bbox": [61.0, 86.0, 391.0, 101.0]}, {"text": "Advocates note, too, that every genetically engineered food", "bbox": [81.0, 103.0, 391.0, 118.0]}, {"text": "crop has been thoroughly tested for possible health effects.

The 1980s were difficult for him. In 1986, he lost his older brother who died of prostate cancer. In the same phase, Ralph Nader developed this condition which adversely affected the left side of his face.\n\n【1】 For several months, Nader had to put up with half of his face being paralyzed and a droopy eyelid. Due to Bell’s palsy, he also suffered from excessive tearing and could not blink his left eye. Nader started wearing sunglasses to hide these effects, but he dealt with the condition fearlessly.\n\n【2】## Graeme Garden\n\n【3】Famous British television presenter, comedian, actor and author, Graeme Garden was also diagnosed with Bell's palsy. In December 2002, Garden felt some changes in his face. He commented that he was unable to whistle. And after that he noticed that the left side of his face started to go numb.\n\n【4】 Garden, while recalling his experience with this condition commented that it became embarrassing to eat and drink. Smiling too became uncomfortable for him because it looked like a half smile rather than a full one.\n\n【5】 He also pointed out that it was tremendously difficult to articulate sounds, especially the sounds of the letter F and P. However; he managed to recover from the condition down the road.\n\n【6】## Jean Chretien\n\n【7】Jean Chretien served as the Prime Minister of Canada from 1993-2003. Apart from his political career, he is also a renowned lawyer and author. The former Canadian Prime Minister developed Bell’s palsy at a very young age, when he was merely 12 years old.

Christy G. Turner II of Arizona State University conducted pioneering work on unusual sets of broken and burned human skeletal remains from Anasazi sites in Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n【2】He saw a pattern suggestive of cannibalism: site after site containing human remains with the telltale signs. Yet little in the history of the area's more recent Puebloan peoples suggested that cannibalism was a widespread practice, and some modern tribes who claim descent from the Anasazi have found claims of cannibalism among their ancestors disturbing.\n\n【3】The vast majority of Anasazi burials involve whole, articulated skeletons frequently accompanied by decorated ceramic vessels that have become a favorite target of pot hunters in this area. But, as Turner recorded, several dozen sites had fragmented, often burned human remains, and a larger pattern began to emerge. Over the past three decades the total number of human bone specimens from these sites has grown to tens of thousands, representing dozens of individuals spread across 800 years of prehistory and tens of thousands of square kilometers of the American Southwest.\n\n【4】The assemblage that I analyzed 10 years ago from an Anasazi site in the Mancos Canyon of southwestern Colorado, for instance, contained 2,106 pieces of bone from at least 29 Native American men, women and children.\n\n【5】These assemblages have been found in settlements ranging from small pueblos to large towns and were often contemporaneous with the abandonment of the dwellings. The bones frequently show evidence of roasting before the flesh was removed. They invariably indicate that people extracted the brain and cracked the limb bones for marrow after removing the muscle tissue.

Meditation helps calm the overactive mind, thereby reenergizing you, increasing your stamina, and improving your powers of concentration. Through the regular use of meditation, it is within your grasp to create a sense of inner peace and have a clear mind.\n\n【2】## What Is Meditation?\n\n【3】A Good Way To Grasp\n\n【4】the real essence of true meditation is to consider a lake. Think about how you can clearly see the bottom of the lake when the surface is still. However, when there are a lot of waves, you are unable to see much below the surface at all. This is the perfect analogy for the mind: when your mind is still, you are better able to experience inner calm.\n\n【5】## Where & When To Meditate\n\n【6】You are free to meditate wherever you are comfortable, but there are some considerations to bear in mind. If you choose to meditate indoors, pick a room that is warm, clutter-free, and away from distracting noises. If you go outside, find somewhere with as little activity as possible but where you are safe and able to relax fully. Meditation can be practiced at any time of day or night, but it is easier to train your mind if you are able to set a regular time slot.\n MEDITATING TOGETHER You do not have to meditate alone.

As our bodies grow through adolescence to adulthood, so too do our lungs. Adolescence represents a second \"vulnerable\" window. Recent scientific studies indicate that teenagers who smoke are left with lung function that is less than predicted when compared to healthy nonsmoking teens. The finding of stunted lung function development in adolescent smokers is especially notable in girls.\n\n【3】## 8. What Causes Asthma?\n\n【4】Multiple causes and the interaction of several factors may be necessary to cause the disease. Studies have implicated a familial component. The tendency to develop asthma has an inherited basis. If one or both parents have asthma, for example, their child has a greater likelihood of developing asthma, as compared to another child whose parents have no personal history of asthma.

As the liquid slowly drains out of the alveolus, it also exerts hydraulic resistance against the dental movement. Periodontal fi删除16:<u>¬ </u>bers and interstitial liquid act in conjunction, against the forces applied on the tooth, making it return to its original position. It is a paradox, but bone is the most malleable tissue of the human body, adapting to the forces that act upon it. It reacts by depositing osseous tissue in the areas exposed to traction forces and to resorb osseous tissue in areas where pressure is exerted. Orthodontic movement is only possible because of this malleability. This way, the root gets even closer to the alveolar wall, compressing the peri删除16:<u>¬ </u>odontal ligament on the side where the force is applied and stretching the fibers on the opposite side. Osteoclasts are responsible for cortical alveolar resorption where ligament compression occurs. In the phase where ligament disten删除16:<u>¬ </u>sion occurs, osteoblasts and fibroblasts, the cells that form bone tissue and collagen fibers, are present. Clinically, this period is characterized by moderate tooth pain submitted to pressure but without movement. Around two days after the force application, osteoclasts and osteoblasts initiate the remodeling process. Slowly the alveolus dislocates in the direction of the applied force, with the subsequent orthodontic movement.删除3:<u> (23)</u>\n\n【5】 Burstone defines optimal force as the one that provides a rapid dental movement, with no patient discomfort and no tissue damage (no bone loss or root resorption), be删除16:<u>¬ </u>ing this the most physiologic orthodontic force.删除3:<u> (23)</u>Many investigators (Storey, Smith, Brian Lee, Ricketts, among others) evaluated the optimal necessary force for dental\n\n【6】 movement; this was obtained by measuring the root sur删除16:<u>¬ </u>face exposed to movement, the so called affronted root surface. Because pressure is defined as force times surface unit, the applied force must vary depending on the size of the root surface involved and the direction of the proposed movement.删除3:<u> (19)</u> Brian Lee proposed 200 g/cm2 as the optimal pressure for efficient movement, half of what Brian Lee had put forward. According to studies made by Iwasaki, 60 g of force produce a distal canine movement of an average of 1.23 mm per month.删除3:<u> (16, 19)</u>\n\n【7】 Ricketts clinically showed that intrusion of the inferior incisors with utility arches is efficiently done applying 15 to 20 g per tooth or 60 to 80 g for the four lower incisors; upper incisors have a root surface transversal section that is almost double in size compared to the lower incisors, so the force required for intrusion is double compared to the force required for the lower incisors, approximately to 160 g for all four upper incisors or 40 g per tooth.\n\n【8】 The recommended forces for dental movement, according to Ricketts, are shown next page.删除3:<u> (16,19)</u>\n\n【9】 Periodontal fibers and interstitial liquid form together a shock absorbing and physiologic force dissipating system.\n\n【10】during occlusal function and orthodontic movement.\n\n【11】When there is a rise in the orthodontic force, the periodon删除16:<u>¬ </u>tal ligament will present zones with excessive pressure. In these zones, more often on the compression side, blood circulation slows or shuts down, and degeneration or ne删除16:<u>¬ </u>crosis of the periodontal fibers sets in. This phenomenon is known as hyalinization (aseptic necrosis). The greater the number of hyalinization areas present, the slower the orthodontic movement will be, therefore the greater the force is, the slower dental movement will be. Histologically speaking, during hyalinization we will observe periodon删除16:<u>¬ </u>tal tissue necrosis in the compression zone, blood vessel obliteration, a diminished blood supply and anoxia (lack of oxygen) in the conjunctive tissue.

Administration of high-dose insulin in patients with shock refractory to other measures may be considered (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【1】Although the ideal human dose has not been determined, a commonly used protocol calls for IV administration of 1 U/kg regular insulin as a bolus, accompanied by 0.5 g/kg dextrose, followed by continuous infusions of 0.5 to 1 U/kg per hour of insulin and 0.5 g/kg per hour of dextrose.删除2:<u> 269 </u>The insulin infusion is titrated as needed to achieve adequate hemodynamic response, whereas the dextrose infusion is titrated to maintain serum glucose concentrations of 100 to 250 mg/dL (5.5 to 14 mmol/L).\n\n【2】Very frequent serum glucose monitoring (up to every 15 minutes) may be needed during the initial phase of dextrose titration. Sustained infusions of concentrated dextrose solutions (> 10%) require central venous access. Insulin causes potassium to shift into the cells. Moderate hypokalemia is common during high-dose insulin-euglycemia therapy, and animals treated with aggressive potassium repletion developed asystole.删除2:<u> 266 </u>To avoid overly aggressive potassium repletion, 1 human protocol targets potassium levels of 2.5 to 2.8 mEq/L.删除2:<u> 269</u>\n\n【3】## Calcium\n\n【4】One human case report 270 and a large-animal study 271 suggest that calcium may be helpful in β -blocker overdose. Administration of calcium in patients with shock refractory to other measures may be considered (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【5】One approach is to administer 0.3 mEq/kg of calcium (0.6 mL/kg of 10% calcium gluconate solution or 0.2 mL/kg of 10% calcium chloride solution) IV over 5 to 10 minutes, followed by an infusion of 0.3 mEq/kg per hour.删除2:<u> 269 </u>The infusion rate is titrated to adequate hemodynamic response.\n\n【6】Serum ionized calcium levels should be monitored, and severe hypercalcemia (ionized calcium levels greater than twice the upper limits of normal) should be avoided. Sustained infusions of IV calcium require central venous access.\n\n【7】## Other Therapies\n\n【8】Case reports have suggested that in patients who remain critically hypotensive despite maximal vasopressor therapy, specific interventions using intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation, ventricular assist devices, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or other extra corporeal life support (ECLS) devices may be lifesaving.删除2:<u> 272 -274</u> While evidence remains weak, at least two human case reports indicate a possible benefit from lipid emulsion infusion for overdose by β -blockers.删除2:<u> 275,276</u> Animal studies are mixed.删除2:<u> 277–280</u> Because this area of therapy is rapidly evolving, 281– 283 prompt consultation with a medical toxicologist or other specialists with up-to-date knowledge is recommended when managing treatment-refractory hypotension from β -blocker overdosage.\n\n【9】## Calcium Channel Blockers\n\n【10】There are no data to support the use of specific antidotes in the setting of cardiac arrest due to calcium channel blocker overdose. Resuscitation from cardiac arrest should follow standard BLS and ACLS algorithms.\n\n【11】Calcium channel blocker overdose also may cause lifethreatening hypotension and bradycardia that are refractory to\n\n【12】 standard agents. Treatment with high-dose insulin has been described in a number of clinical case reports 284 – 295 and animal studies.删除2:<u> 296–299</u> High-dose insulin, in the doses listed in the β -blocker section above, may be effective for restoring hemodynamic stability and improving survival in the setting of severe cardiovascular toxicity associated with toxicity from a calcium channel blocker overdose (Class IIb, LOE B).\n\n【13】Limited evidence supports the use of calcium in the treatment of hemodynamically unstable calcium channel overdose refractory other blocker to treatments.删除2:<u> 285,286,289,290,292–294,297,300–303</u> Administration of calcium in patients with shock refractory to other measures may be considered (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【14】There is insufficient and conflicting evidence to recommend the use of glucagon 289,290,294,296,297,300,303–306 in the treatment of hemodynamically unstable calcium channel blocker overdose.\n\n【15】## Digoxin And Related Cardiac Glycosides\n\n【16】Digoxin poisoning can cause severe bradycardia and lifethreatening arrhythmias, including ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and high degrees of AV nodal blockade. Other plant- and animal-derived cardiac glycosides may produce similar effects, including those found in oleander, lily-of-the-valley, toad skin, and some herbal medications.\n\n【17】There are no data to support the use of specific antidotes in the setting of cardiac arrest due to digoxin overdose. Resuscitation from cardiac arrest should follow standard BLS and ACLS algorithms, with specific antidotes used in the postcardiac arrest phase if severe cardiotoxicity is encountered.\n\n【18】Antidigoxin Fab antibodies should be administered to patients with severe life-threatening cardiac glycoside toxicity (Class I, LOE B).删除2:<u> 307–316</u> One vial of antidigoxin Fab is standardized to neutralize 0.5 mg of digoxin. Although the ideal dose is unknown, a reasonable strategy is as follows:\n\n【19】 • If the ingested dose of digoxin is known, administer 2 vials of Fab for every milligram of digoxin ingested.\n\n【20】In cases of chronic digoxin toxicity or when the ingested dose is not known, calculate the number of vials to administer by using the following formula: serum digoxin concentration (ng/mL) × weight (kg)/100.\n\n【21】• In critical cases in which therapy is required before a serum digoxin level can be obtained or in cases of life-threatening toxicity due to cardiac glycosides, administer empirically 10 to 20 vials.\n\n【22】 Hyperkalemia is a marker of severity in acute cardiac glycoside poisoning and is associated with poor prognosis.删除2:<u> 317 </u>Antidigoxin Fab may be administered empirically to patients with acute poisoning from digoxin or related cardiac glycosides whose serum potassium level exceeds 5.0 mEq/L.删除2:<u> 318</u>\n\n【23】## Cocaine\n\n【24】There are no data to support the use of cocaine-specific interventions in the setting of cardiac arrest due to cocaine overdose. Resuscitation from cardiac arrest should follow standard BLS and ACLS algorithms, with specific antidotes used in the postresuscitation phase if severe cardiotoxicity or neurotoxicity is encountered.

Do Allergies Cause Asthma?\n\n【1】The answer depends on what you mean by \"cause.\" On one hand, the condition we call \"asthma\" is a disease that is different from allergy. On the other hand, allergies and asthma frequently coexist in a given individual. An individual with significant allergies is more likely to also carry a diagnosis of asthma than someone without any allergies. Specific allergies can also be a type of external trigger for asthma exacerbations and increasing symptoms. For example, a child with asthma who is also allergic to cats will likely develop symptoms of his asthma if exposed to cats. For that child, cat exposure will worsen asthma, but it won't cause it.\n\n【2】 The most severe form of an allergic reaction is called anaphylaxis. An anaphylactic reaction, especially if untreated, can involve the respiratory system and the lungs. It leads to bronchospasm and narrowed airways, with edema or swelling of the air passages. The anaphylactic allergic response can cause wheezing, cough, and difficulty breathing—symptoms indistinguishable from asthma. An anaphylactic reaction can occur in response to many agents, including bee venom and certain medications. It is considered a true medical emergency because it is potentially life threatening.\n\n【3】## 10.

The townspeople are skeptical at first but soon bring small offerings: a head of cabbage, a bunch of carrots, a bit of beef. In the end, the cauldron is filled with enough hearty soup to feed everyone. The moral: cooperation can produce significant achievements, even from meager, seemingly insignificant contributions.\n\n【1】 Researchers are now using a similar cooperative strategy to build supercomputers, the powerful machines that can perform billions of calculations in a second. Most conventional supercomputers employ parallel processing: they contain arrays of ultrafast microprocessors that work in tandem to solve complex problems such as forecasting the weather or simulating a nuclear explosion. Made by IBM, Cray and other computer vendors, the machines typically cost tens of millions of dollars—far too much for a research team with a modest budget. So over the past few years, scientists at national laboratories and universities have learned how to construct their own supercomputers by linking inexpensive PCs and writing software that allows these ordinary computers to tackle extraordinary problems.\n\n【2】In 1996 two of us (Hargrove and Hoffman) encountered such a problem in our work at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Tennessee. We were trying to draw a national map of ecoregions, which are defined by environmental conditions: all areas with the same climate, landforms and soil characteristics fall into the same ecoregion. To create a high-resolution map of the continental U.S., we divided the country into 7.8 million square cells, each with an area of one square kilometer. For each cell we had to consider as many as 25 variables, ranging from average monthly precipitation to the nitrogen content of the soil. A single PC or workstation could not accomplish the task. We needed a parallel-processing supercomputer—and one that we could afford!\n\n【3】Our solution was to construct a com-\n\n【4】 puting cluster using obsolete PCs that ORNL would have otherwise discarded.\n\n【5】Dubbed the Stone SouperComputer because it was built essentially at no cost, our cluster of PCs was powerful enough to produce ecoregion maps of unprecedented detail. Other research groups have devised even more capable clusters that rival the performance of the world's best supercomputers at a mere fraction of their cost. This advantageous price-toperformance ratio has already attracted the attention of some corporations, which plan to use the clusters for such complex tasks as deciphering the human genome.

The latter decisions may be in conflict with the living will or advance directive; at the time of the unforeseen circumstances they are considered to be valid expressions of the patient's best interests.删除2:<u> 14 </u>A comprehensive healthcare advance directive combines the living will and the durable power of attorney for health care into one legally binding document.\n\n【1】As a patient's medical condition and desire for types of medical treatment may change over time, all types of advance directives should be revisited regularly. Most importantly the presence of an advance directive, a living will, or a durable power of attorney for health care is closely associated with ensuring that personal preferences match the actual care received, as documented in a survey of surrogates for patients of at least 60 years of age who died between 2000 and 2006 and required surrogate decision making at some point in their care.删除2:<u> 14 </u>A Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAR) order is given by a licensed physician or alternative authority as per local regulation, and it must be signed and dated to be valid.删除2:<u> 15</u>.删除6:<u> 16 </u>In many settings, \"Allow Natural Death\" (AND) is becoming a preferred term to replace DNAR, to emphasize that the order is to allow natural consequences of a disease or injury, and to emphasize ongoing end-of-life care.删除2:<u> 17 </u>The DNAR order should explicitly describe the resuscitation interventions to be performed in the event of a life-threatening emergency. In most cases, a DNAR order is preceded by a documented discussion with the patient, family, or surrogate decision maker addressing the patient's wishes about resuscitation interventions. In addition, some jurisdictions may require confirmation by a witness or a second treating physician.\n\n【2】Surrogate Decision Makers In the event of incapacity, an adult may require a surrogate decision maker to make medical decisions. In the event that the individual has a durable power of attorney for health care, the person appointed by that document is authorized to make medical decisions within the scope of authority granted by the document. If the individual has a court-appointed guardian with authority to make healthcare decisions, the guardian becomes the authorized surrogate.\n\n【3】If there is no court-appointed or other authority, a close relative or friend can become a surrogate decision maker. Most jurisdictions have laws that designate the legally authorized surrogate decision maker for an incompetent patient who has not identified a decision maker through a durable power of attorney for health care. Surrogate decision makers should base their decisions on the individual's previously expressed preferences, if known; otherwise, surrogates should make decisions based on their understanding of what constitutes the best interests of the individual.\n\n【4】Pediatric Decision Making As a general rule, minors are considered incompetent to provide legally binding consent about their health care. Parents or guardians are generally empowered to make healthcare decisions on their behalf, and in most situations, parents are given wide latitude in terms of the decisions they make on behalf of their children. Parental authority is not absolute, however, and when a parent or guardian's decision appears to place the child at significant risk of serious harm as compared to other options, medical providers may seek to involve state agencies (eg, child\n\n【5】 protective services or a court determination) to allow treatment of the child over parental objections.删除2:<u> 18 </u>A child should be involved in decision making at a level appropriate for the child's maturity. Children should be asked to consent to healthcare decisions when able within the legal definition of a consenting adult based on local policy and legislation. Children < 14 years of age (in Canada) and < 18 years of age (in the US) rarely possess the legal authority to consent to their health care except under specific legally defined situations (emancipated minors, mature minors, and for specific health conditions such as sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy-related care). In situations where an older child will not consent, the dissent should be carefully considered by the treating provider.\n\n【6】## Principle Of Futility\n\n【7】Patients or families may ask for care that is highly unlikely to improve health outcomes. Healthcare providers, however, are not obliged to provide such care when there is scientific and social consensus that the treatment is ineffective. If the purpose of a medical treatment cannot be achieved, the treatment can be considered futile.\n\n【8】An objective criterion for medical futility was defined in 1990 for interventions and drug therapy as imparting a < 1% chance of survival.删除2:<u> 19 </u>Although this criterion may be controversial, it remains a basis for current futility research. An obvious example of an inappropriate or futile intervention is providing CPR for a patient who has suffered irreversible death. Without objective signs of irreversible death (eg, decapitation, rigor mortis, or decomposition) and in the absence of known advance directives declining resuscitative attempts, full resuscitation should be offered.\n\n【9】Conditions such as irreversible brain damage or brain death cannot be reliably assessed or predicted at the time of cardiac arrest. Withholding resuscitation and the discontinuation of life-sustaining treatment during or after resuscitation are ethically equivalent.

Paddles and self-adhering pads appear to be equally effective.删除2:<u> 268 </u>Self-adhering pads should be pressed firmly on the chest so that the gel on the pad completely touches the child's chest.\n\n【1】An appropriate paddle or self-adhesive pad size is\n • \"Adult\" size (8 to 10 cm) for children > 10 kg ( > approximately 1 year) • \"Infant\" size for infants < 10 kg\n\n【2】## Interface\n\n【3】The electrode–chest wall interface is part of the self-adhesive pad; in contrast, electrode gel must be applied liberally on manually applied paddles. Do not use saline-soaked pads, ultrasound gel, bare paddles, or alcohol pads.\n\n【4】## Paddle Position\n\n【5】Follow package directions for placement of self-adhesive AED or monitor/defibrillator pads.\n\n【6】Place manual paddles over the right side of the upper chest and the apex of the heart (to the left of the nipple over the left lower ribs) so the heart is between the two paddles.

It has been observed that in children with VF, an initial monophasic dose of 2 J/kg is only effective in terminating ventricular fibrillation 18% to 50% of the time, 269 .删除2:<u> 270 </u>while similar doses of biphasic shocks are effective 48% of the time.删除2:<u> 268 </u>Children with out-of-hospital VF cardiac arrest often receive more than 2 J/kg, 271 , 272 and one in-hospital cardiac arrest study 268 showed that children received doses between 2.5 and 3.2 J/kg to achieve ROSC.\n\n【9】Energy doses > 4 J/kg (up to 9 J/kg) have effectively defibrillated children 272 – 274 and pediatric animals 275 with negligible adverse effects. Based on data from adult studies 276 .删除2:<u> 277 </u>and pediatric animal models, 278 – 280 biphasic shocks appear to be at least as effective as monophasic shocks and less harmful.\n\n【10】It is acceptable to use an initial dose of 2 to 4 J/kg (Class IIa, LOE C), but for ease of teaching an initial dose of 2 J/kg may be considered (Class IIb, LOE C). For refractory VF, it is reasonable to increase the dose to 4 J/kg (Class IIa, LOE C).\n\n【11】Subsequent energy levels should be at least 4 J/kg, and higher energy levels may be considered, not to exceed 10 J/kg or the adult maximum dose (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【12】## Aeds\n\n【13】Many AEDs can accurately detect VF in children of all ages.删除2:<u> 271</u>, 281– 283 They can differentiate \"shockable\" from \"nonshockable\" rhythms with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity.删除2:<u> 281,282</u> It is recommended that systems and institutions that have AED programs and that care for children should use AEDs with a high specificity to recognize pediatric shockable rhythms and a pediatric attenuating system\n\n【14】 that can be used for infants and children up to approximately 25 kg (approximately 8 years of age).删除2:<u>274,284</u> If an AED with an attenuator is not available, use an AED with standard electrodes (Class IIa, LOE C).\n\n【15】In infants < 1 year of age a manual defibrillator is preferred. If a manual defibrillator is not available, an AED with a dose attenuator may be used. An AED without a dose attenuator may be used if neither a manual defibrillator nor one with a dose attenuator is available (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【16】## Integration Of Defibrillation With Resuscitation Sequence\n\n【17】删除7:<u>The following are important considerations:\n\n【18】 • Provide CPR until the defibrillator is ready to deliver a shock; after shock delivery, resume CPR, beginning with chest compressions. Minimize interruptions of chest compressions. In adults with prolonged arrest 285,286 and in animal models, 287 defibrillation is more likely to be successful after a period of effective chest compressions.\n\n【19】Ideally chest compressions should be interrupted only for ventilations (until an advanced airway is in place), rhythm check, and shock delivery. If a \"shockable\" rhythm is still present, continue chest compressions after a rhythm check (when possible) while the defibrillator is charging (so chest compressions are delivered until shock delivery).\n\n【20】(Step 3) Give 1 shock (2 J/kg) as quickly as possible and immediately resume CPR, beginning with chest compressions. If 1 shock fails to eliminate VF, the incremental benefit of another immediate shock is low, and resumption of CPR is likely to confer a greater value than another shock. CPR may provide coronary perfusion, increasing the likelihood of defibrillation with a subsequent shock. It is important to minimize the time between chest compressions and shock delivery and between shock delivery and resumption of postshock compressions.\n\n【21】• (Step 4) Continue CPR for about 2 minutes. In in-hospital settings with continuous invasive monitoring, this sequence may be modified at the expert provider's discretion (see, also Part 8.2: \"Management of Cardiac Arrest\"). If sufficient rescuers are present, obtain vascular (IO or IV) access.\n\n【22】• After 2 minutes of CPR, check the rhythm; recharge the defibrillator to a higher dose (4 J/kg).\n\n【23】• (Step 5) If a \"shockable\" rhythm persists, give another shock (4 J/kg). If rhythm is \"nonshockable,\" continue with the asystole/PEA algorithm (Steps 10 and 11).\n\n【24】• (Step 6) Immediately resume chest compressions. Continue CPR for approximately 2 minutes. During CPR give epinephrine 0.01 mg/kg (0.1 mL/kg of 1:10 000 concentration), maximum of 1 mg (Class I, LOE B) every 3 to 5 minutes. It is helpful if a third rescuer prepares the drug doses before the rhythm is checked so epinephrine can be administered as soon as possible. Epinephrine should be administered during chest compressions, but the timing of drug administration is less important than the need to minimize interruptions in chest compressions. Just prior to the rhythm check, the rescuer operating the defibrillator should prepare to recharge the defibrillator (4 J/kg or more</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "Use the largest paddles or self-adhering electrodes 265 – 267 that", "bbox": [60.0, 85.0, 376.0, 98.0]}, {"text": "will fit on the child's chest without touching (when possible,", "bbox": [60.0, 100.0, 375.0, 113.0]}, {"text": "leave about 3 cm between the paddles or electrodes).

Control ongoing bleeding where possible and replace lost volume if the losses appear to have significantly compromised circulating blood volume. Cardiac arrest resuscitation will likely be ineffective in the presence of uncorrected severe hypovolemia.\n\n【8】Treatment of PEA requires identification and treatment of reversible causes, such as severe hypovolemia, hypothermia, cardiac tamponade, or tension pneumothorax.删除2:<u> 399 </u>Development of bradyasystolic rhythms often indicates the presence of severe hypovolemia, severe hypoxemia, or cardiorespiratory failure. Ventricular fibrillation (VF) and pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT) are treated with CPR and defibrillation. For treatment recommendations regarding cardiac tamponade in traumatic cardiac arrest, see Part 12.14: \"Cardiac Arrest Caused by Cardiac Tamponade.\" Resuscitative thoracotomy may be indicated in selected patients. A review of the literature from 1966 to 1999, carried out by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma, found a survival rate of 7.8% (11.2% for penetrating injuries and 1.6% for blunt lesions) in trauma victims who would otherwise have 100% mortality.删除2:<u> 400 </u>Practitioners should consult the guidelines for withholding or terminating resuscitation, which were developed for victims of traumatic cardiac arrest by a joint committee of the National Association of EMS Physicians and the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma.删除2:<u> 401,402</u>\n\n【9】 When the victim is extremely cold but has maintained a perfusing rhythm, the rescuer should focus on interventions that prevent further loss of heat and begin to rewarm the victim immediately. Additional interventions include the following:\n\n【10】 • Preventing additional evaporative heat loss by removing wet garments and insulating the victim from further environmental exposures. Passive rewarming is generally adequate for patients with mild hypothermia (temperature > 34°C [93.2°F]).\n\n【11】• For patients with moderate (30°C to 34°C [86°F to 93.2°F]) hypothermia with a perfusing rhythm, external warming techniques are appropriate.删除2:<u> 406 </u>Passive rewarming alone will be inadequate for these patients.删除2:<u> 407 </u>• For patients with severe hypothermia (<30°C [86°F]) with a perfusing rhythm, core rewarming is often used, although some have reported successful rewarming with active external warming techniques.删除2:<u> 408,409</u> Active external warming techniques include forced air or other efficient surfacewarming devices.\n\n【12】• Patients with severe hypothermia and cardiac arrest can be rewarmed most rapidly with cardiopulmonary bypass.删除2:<u> 406,410–415</u> Alternative effective core rewarming techniques include warm-water lavage of the thoracic cavity 413.416-420 and extracorporeal blood warming with partial bypass.删除2:<u> 421–423</u> • Adjunctive core rewarming techniques include warmed IV or intraosseous (IO) fluids and warm humidified oxygen.删除2:<u> 424 </u>Heat transfer with these measures is not rapid, and should be considered supplementary to active warming techniques.\n\n【13】• Do not delay urgent procedures such as airway management and insertion of vascular catheters. Although these patients may exhibit cardiac irritability, this concern should not delay necessary interventions.\n\n【14】 Commotio cordis is VF triggered by a blow to the anterior chest during a cardiac repolarization.删除2:<u> 403 </u>, 404 Blunt cardiac injury may result in cardiac contusion with injured myocardium and risk of ECG changes and arrhythmias. Even a small blow to the anterior chest during a cardiac repolarization, such as that imparted by the strike of a baseball or hockey puck, may trigger VF, so-called commotio cordis.删除2:<u> 405 </u>Events causing commotio cordis are most commonly seen in young persons up to 18 years of age who are engaged in sports but may occur during daily activities. Prompt recognition that a precordial blow may cause VF is critical. Rapid defibrillation is often life-saving for these frequently young victims of cardiac arrest. Provision of immediate BLS care using an automated external defibrillator (AED) and ACLS for VF in this setting is appropriate.\n\n【15】 Beyond these critical initial steps, the treatment of severe hypothermia (temperature <30°C [86°F]) in the field remains controversial. Many providers do not have the time or equipment to assess core body temperature or to institute aggressive rewarming techniques, although these methods should be initiated when available.\n\n【16】 When the victim is hypothermic, pulse and respiratory rates may be slow or difficult to detect, 425 , 426 and the ECG may even show asystole. If the hypothermic victim has no signs of life, begin CPR without delay. If the victim is not breathing, start rescue breathing immediately.\n\n【17】The temperature at which defibrillation should first be attempted in the severely hypothermic patient and the number of defibrillation attempts that should be made have not been\n\n【18】 Unintentional or accidental hypothermia is a serious and preventable health problem. Severe hypothermia (body temperature <30°C [86°F]) is associated with marked depression of critical body functions, which may make the victim appear clinically dead during the initial assessment.

My Asthma Is Active; How Do I Know\n\n【1】## Whether I Should Go To The Nearest Hospital Emergency Room?\n\n【2】Gemma'S Comment:\n\n【3】Emergencies can be scary. During a vacation at a popular seaside resort in the northeast, I was caught on the beach as a squall came up, blowing sand in my face and mouth.\n\n【4】Because my children were playing happily, I delayed leaving the beach, and by the time I did, I was gasping for breath, almost unable to climb up the dunes. By the time I got to an emergency room later that evening, my breathing was very labored. The treatment was scary, too. I was given a shot of adrenaline, which made breathing easy, and sent home. The adrenaline kept me \"wired\" (i.e., extremely tense and unable to sleep) for more than a day. I should add that this emergency occurred twenty years ago, and that I was treated in a small regional hospital, better prepared to deal with boating accidents than breathing problems. I'm sure the treatment would be better today.\n\n【5】 The inability to gain control of an asthma exacerbation is the major reason for proceeding to the nearest hospital for emergency treatment (Table 23). The simple fact that your asthma is more active might not in itself warrant an emergency room visit. If your asthma responds to increased \"stepped-up\" treatment as advocated in the NAEPP's guidelines, or as outlined in your asthma care plan, then you might simply need to check in with your asthma provider. If your asthma symptoms do not respond to the increased treatment, or if your symptoms worsen despite such treatment, then a visit to the emergency room is indicated.

The Bimetric Distalizer, commercialized by Rocky Mountain Orthodontics (RMO), produces maxillary molar distalizing movement. This arch is \"bimetric\" because the anterior segment is made of 0.022\" stainless steel wire and the posterior segment is made with 0.040\" stainless steel wire. At the canine level sliding hooks for Class II elastics use are inserted. At the premolar level we find an omega shaped stop.

There are many non-extraction treatment modalities for Class II malocclusion. One of them consists in converting the Class II molar relation into a Class I molar relation; in order to accomplish this we must distally displace the upper first molars.删除3:<u> (15,38)</u>\n\n【4】 The most frequent dentoskeletal disharmony in the Anglo-Saxon population is the Class II malocclusion.\n\n【5】This distoclusion may be the result of a retrognatic man删除16:<u>¬ </u>dible, of a prognathic maxilla or a combination of both, although some authors ( McNamara, Hilgers, Chaconas, Proffit) coincide in that mandibular deficiencies are more common than maxillary excesses, but in many occasions the distal relation is a product of the mesiogresion of the posterosuperior sectors that bring as a consequence the lack of proper space for the correct alignment of the anterior teeth.删除3:<u> (23,35)</u> Dentally, the mesiobuccal cusp of the first upper molar occludes in front of the buccal sulcus of the first lower molar. The disadvantage of this lies in the lack of available space in the upper dental arch, creating the need to utilize appliances that can generate or stretch the available space in order to act distally and transversely.删除3:<u> (36,38)</u>\n\n【6】 One of the first appliances used for molar distalization was the Head Gear, used by Angle in 1887. In 1961 Kloehn pro删除16:<u>¬ </u>posed the early treatment with the head gear to redirect the growth of the maxilla and exert \"a slight force on the teeth that must be moved\". The objective of Kloehn was to distal删除16:<u>¬ </u>ize the upper molars in order to obtain a functional relation with the lower teeth. Graber noticed that, when the extra oral traction was used upon the first upper molar, when the second upper molar had not fully erupted, the first molar\n\n【7】 inclined distally but did not move in a bodily manner. In order to prevent the inclination of the molar, Cetlin in 1983 combined the extra oral force with an intraoral force. He used the first force partially and the intraoral force (with removable appliances) was used full time. The force of the removable appliances, used constantly, inclines the crown distally and the head gear controls the position of the root, resulting in a bodily movement of the molar.删除3:<u> (29)</u> The principle of extra oral distalization is that the line of action must pass through the center of resistance of the molar. In order to accomplish a successful distalization treatment the amount of force applied and the time of use are very important. There are many criteria over the amount of force that must be applied and the time of use of the head gear. Tenenbaum suggests 12 ounces or 300 g, a force that can be incremented. Muir and Reed recommend 500 g per side. The extra oral traction must be worn for at least 12 hours a day, but preferably it must be between 14 to 16 hours in average.删除3:<u> (5,29,33,36,38)</u>\n\n【8】 The extra oral arch must be separated 3 mm to 5 mm from the anterior teeth approximately and must be adjusted each time we to obtain a desired movement.删除3:<u> (29.36)</u>\n\n【9】 During distalization we must be sure the molars do not have any occlusal interferences, in case there are, we should place an anterior bite plane in order to aid in the distalization. Unilateral distal movements will be done modifying the outer arm of the appliance (Please refer to Open Bite chapter).\n\n【10】 The use of the extra oral arch can provoke many movements:\n\n【11】 1.\n\n【12】 2.\n\n【13】 A distal force and a flattening of the occlusal plane, in which the extra oral traction must be applied over the center of resistance of the molar.\n\n【14】A distal force and a settlement of the occlusal plane, in which the extra oral traction must be applied under the center of resistance of the molar.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "Distalizers", "bbox": [60.0, 87.0, 219.0, 122.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [59.0, 86.0, 218.0, 121.0], "position": 1}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Esequiel Rodríguez, Rogelio CasasaAdriana Natera, Claudia Razo", "bbox": [62.0, 129.0, 500.0, 148.0]}], "block_type": "Title", "full_blocks": [61.0, 128.0, 499.0, 146.0], "position": 2}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Introduction", "bbox": [61.0, 276.0, 158.0, 295.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [60.0, 275.0, 157.0, 293.0], "position": 3}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "The search for new treatment modalities that avoid dental", "bbox": [62.0, 314.0, 375.0, 330.0]}, {"text": "extractions (especially premolars) has gained great im¬", "bbox": [61.0, 331.0, 373.0, 347.0]}, {"text": "portance in the practice of contemporary orthodontics;", "bbox": [61.0, 349.0, 375.0, 364.0]}, {"text": "this has created a growing tendency to avoid, as much as", "bbox": [61.0, 366.0, 375.0, 381.0]}, {"text": "possible, any treatment that includes extractions.

In 2001, Dr. Martinez and his co-workers reported that females who became overweight or obese between the ages of 6 and 11 years of age had an increased risk for developing new asthma symptoms during early adolescence. They found that girls—but not boys—who became overweight between 6 and 11 years of age were 5 to 7 times more likely to develop new asthma symptoms at ages 11 and 13, compared to girls who did not become overweight or obese at ages 6 and 11 years. Boys who became significantly overweight between 6 and 11 years of age did not exhibit an increased risk for the development of asthma or asthmalike symptoms. The strongest association between overweight status and asthma risk was seen in females who underwent puberty before the age of 11 years. Being overweight is associated with earlier onset of puberty.\n\n【1】Could there be a common factor that leads to overweight status in girls, followed by early puberty and then the development of asthma? The findings are especially interesting because it has long been observed that new cases of asthma in females are especially common in the adolescent years. Further, the male (2:1) preponderance of asthma seen in young, school-age children changes over to a female preponderance by adulthood. A role for female hormones has long been suspected, and the data from the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study supports this theory and suggests avenues for further research.\n\n【2】 Apart from consideration of the links between obesity and asthma risk, being overweight is medically undesirable.

This way vertical loops perform horizontal movements better (mesiodistal movements for example), and horizontal loops perform vertical movements better (intrusion/extru删除16:<u>¬ </u>sion movements for example).\n\n【26】 Principle 3. The more wire a loop has, less force it will exert.\n\n【27】Loops with helixes have more wire length, and because the force exerted by a wire is inversely proportional to the cube of its length, the force exerted by the wire over the teeth is less.删除3:<u> (8)</u>\n\n【28】## A)   Open \"I\" Loop\n\n【29】This vertical loop is 7 mm high and is made on the arch wire.

You can also add green tea to your diet plan as it is known to protect the myelin sheath.\n\n【2】## Vitamin C\n\n【3】Vitamin C is one of the most potent natural immune system boosters, so get your hands on those juicy lemons and oranges. You can also try guava and grapefruits to ensure that your body gets an adequate supply of vitamin C. Surprisingly; generous intake of this vitamin also protects the myelin sheath as this nutrient is also a powerful anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidizing agent.\n\n【4】 Vitamin A and D are valuable supports for your immune system. You can go for orange fruits and veggies such as papaya, carrots and oranges that are rich sources of vitamin A. Cod liver oil is another good source of vitamin A, D and essential fatty acids.\n\n【5】## Essential Fatty Acids\n\n【6】Your brain is composed of 60% fat, and you require good fats like fat omega-3 and omega-6 to maintain a healthy brain. Be sure you include rich sources of omega-6 in your diet such as chicken, fish, walnuts and extra virgin olive oil.\n\n【7】Both omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids help reduce nerve inflammation and improve electrical transmission.\n\n【8】## Fruits\n\n【9】Bananas are an excellent choice as they are packed with several nutrients like potassium. Citrus fruits, grapes and tropical fruits, not only are an ideal substitute for sweets and candies but are full of powerful immune boosters especially Vitamin C, which is essential for those suffering from Bell's palsy.\n\n【10】Eating a cup of blueberries daily can also alleviate symptoms of facial palsy as the berries have incredible anti-inflammatory and healing properties.\n\n【11】 Here's another friendly reminder: Try to eat raw veggies and fresh fruits as they are loaded with vital nutrients.

While there will always be certain obstacles that momentarily prevent us from achieving greatness, with dedication and commitment, we can always emerge victorious in the end.\n\n【2】 My life has been no different, filled with battles at various stages in life – one of the biggest battles being Bell's palsy. At 34, I'm having the time of my life. But having to deal with \"Bell's Palsy\" wasn't always easy. I knew I had to be strong to fit in and define my presence in this world. I wish that this book existed when I first started looking for information on Bell's palsy. I had to scour through countless books, message boards and various other literature to find valuable information on this condition back then. That's why I have written this book, which contains everything you need to know about Bell's palsy, all in one place.\n\n【3】 Earlier in my life, I couldn't be bothered about how my face looked or what anyone said about me. Like every other happy-go-lucky child, I was busy having fun and looking forward to my next trip to the park.\n\n【4】 Unfortunately, Bell's palsy is a condition that you firstly can't hide and secondly, cannot be oblivious about. A drooping face is certainly not normal for anyone to have or see. Staying in foster care didn't help much and there was barely any improvement in my condition. I'm grateful to my parents who adopted me at 11 months and brought me home. Today, after 34 years, I don’t want to blame anyone. What would have happened had I received timely medical attention? Would this condition have gone away in a few weeks? Was there a chance of full recovery? I really don't know the answers.\n\n【5】 But what I do know is that I'm writing this book to let people know that vast improvement, even 100% recovery is possible with the right treatment and management procedures. With great advancement in medicine and various treatment options available, you may not have to live with Bell's palsy forever.\n\n【6】 Most of the time, I don't even think of my palsy as a disadvantage because it taught me to exhibit other strengths of mine. However, my journey wasn't the smoothest. My insecurities were real. The issue was that I had a huge adjustment to make. What I saw in the mirror was a person with an unusual smile.

Historically a variety of techniques have been recommended to reduce the incidence of MAS. Suctioning of the oropharynx before delivery of the shoulders was considered routine until a randomized controlled trial demonstrated it to be of no value.删除2:<u> 26 </u>Elective and routine endotracheal intubation and direct suctioning of the trachea were initially recommended for all meconium-stained newborns until a randomized controlled trial demonstrated that there was no value in performing this procedure in babies who were vigorous at birth.删除2:<u> 27 </u>Although depressed infants born to mothers with meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF) are at increased risk to develop MAS, 28 .删除2:<u> 29 </u>tracheal suctioning has not been associated with reduction in the incidence of MAS or mortality in these infants.删除2:<u> 30,31</u> The only evidence that direct tracheal suctioning of meconium may be of value was based on comparison of suctioned babies with historic controls, and there was apparent selection bias in the group of intubated babies included in those studies.删除2:<u> 32 </u>– 34 In the absence of randomized, controlled trials, there is insufficient evidence to recommend a change in the current practice of performing endotracheal suctioning of nonvigorous babies with meconium-stained amniotic fluid (Class IIb, LOE C). However, if attempted intubation is prolonged and unsuccessful, bag-mask ventilation should be considered, particularly if there is persistent bradycardia.\n\n【8】 The initial steps of resuscitation are to provide warmth by placing the baby under a radiant heat source, positioning the head in a \"sniffing\" position to open the airway, clearing the airway if necessary with a bulb syringe or suction catheter, drying the baby, and stimulating breathing. Recent studies have examined several aspects of these initial steps. These studies are summarized below.\n\n【9】 Very low-birth-weight ( < 1500 g) preterm babies are likely to become hypothermic despite the use of traditional techniques for decreasing heat loss.删除2:<u> 12 </u>For this reason additional warming techniques are recommended (eg, prewarming the delivery room to 26°C, 13 covering the baby in plastic wrapping (food or medical grade, heat-resistant plastic) (Class I, LOE A 14 .删除2:<u> 15 </u>), placing the baby on an exothermic mattress (Class IIb, LOE B 16 ), and placing the baby under radiant heat (Class IIb, LOE C 17 ). The infant's temperature must be monitored closely because of the slight, but described risk of hyperthermia when these techniques are used in combination (Class IIb, LOE B 16 ). Other techniques for maintaining temperature during stabilization of the baby in the delivery room have been used (eg, prewarming the linen, drying and swaddling, placing the baby skin-to-skin with the mother and covering both with a blanket) and are recommended, but they have not been studied specifically (Class IIb, LOE C). All resuscitation procedures, including endotracheal intubation, chest compression, and insertion of intravenous lines, can be performed with these temperature-controlling interventions in place (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【10】Infants born to febrile mothers have been reported to have a higher incidence of perinatal respiratory depression, neonatal seizures, and cerebral palsy and an increased risk of mortality.删除2:<u> 18</u>.删除6:<u> 19 </u>Animal studies indicate that hyperthermia during or after ischemia is associated with progression of cerebral injury. Lowering the temperature reduces neuronal damage.删除2:<u> 20 </u>Hyperthermia should be avoided (Class IIb, LOE C). The goal is to achieve normothermia and avoid iatrogenic hyperthermia.\n\n【11】 There is a large body of evidence that blood oxygen levels in uncompromised babies generally do not reach extrauterine values until approximately 10 minutes following birth. Oxyhemoglobin saturation may normally remain in the 70% to 80% range for several minutes following birth, thus resulting in the appearance of cyanosis during that time. Other studies have shown that clinical assessment of skin color is a very poor indicator of oxyhemoglobin saturation during the immediate neonatal period and that lack of cyanosis appears to be a very poor indicator of the state of oxygenation of an uncompromised baby following birth.\n\n【12】Optimal management of oxygen during neonatal resuscitation becomes particularly important because of the evidence that either insufficient or excessive oxygenation can be harmful to the newborn infant. Hypoxia and ischemia are known to result in injury to multiple organs. Conversely there is growing experimental evidence, as well as evidence from studies of babies receiving resuscitation, that adverse outcomes may result from even brief exposure to excessive oxygen during and following resuscitation.\n\n【13】 There is evidence that suctioning of the nasopharynx can create bradycardia during resuscitation 21 .删除2:<u> 22 </u>and that suctioning of the trachea in intubated babies receiving mechanical ventilation in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) can be associated with deterioration of pulmonary compliance and oxygenation and reduction in cerebral blood flow velocity when performed routinely (ie, in the absence of obvious nasal or oral secretions).删除2:<u> 23 </u>, 24 However, there is also evidence that suctioning in the presence of secretions can decrease respiratory resistance.删除2:<u> 25 </u>Therefore it is recommended that suctioning immediately following birth (including suctioning with a bulb syringe) should be reserved for babies who have obvious obstruction to spontaneous breathing or who require positive-pressure ventilation (PPV) (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【14】删除4:<u> Numerous studies have defined the percentiles of oxygen saturation as a function of time from birth in uncompromised babies born at term (see table in Figure). This includes saturations measured from both preductal and postductal sites, following both operative and vaginal deliveries, and those occurring at sea level and at altitude.删除2:<u> 35 </u>– 40</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "Initial Steps", "bbox": [176.0, 85.0, 260.0, 100.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [175.0, 84.0, 259.0, 99.0], "position": 3}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "When Meconium is Present", "bbox": [405.0, 84.0, 555.0, 99.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [404.0, 83.0, 554.0, 98.0], "position": 4}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Temperature Control", "bbox": [60.0, 225.0, 194.0, 239.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [59.0, 224.0, 193.0, 238.0], "position": 5}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Assessment of Oxygen Need and Administration", "bbox": [404.0, 531.0, 703.0, 546.0]}, {"text": "of Oxygen", "bbox": [404.0, 547.0, 471.0, 560.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [403.0, 530.0, 702.0, 559.0], "position": 6}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Clearing the Airway", "bbox": [60.0, 722.0, 187.0, 738.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [59.0, 721.0, 186.0, 737.0], "position": 7}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "When Amniotic Fluid Is Clear", "bbox": [60.0, 743.0, 226.0, 757.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [59.0, 742.0, 225.0, 756.0], "position": 8}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Pulse Oximetry", "bbox": [404.0, 884.0, 501.0, 899.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [403.0, 883.0, 500.0, 898.0], "position": 9}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Aspiration of meconium before delivery, during birth, or", "bbox": [404.0, 98.0, 720.0, 113.0]}, {"text": "during resuscitation can cause severe meconium aspiration", "bbox": [403.0, 114.0, 720.0, 127.0]}, {"text": "syndrome (MAS).

However, the decision to limit care should never be made on the basis of a single prognostic parameter, and expert consultation may be needed.\n\n【1】## Neurological Assessment\n\n【2】The neurological examination is the most widely studied parameter to predict outcome in comatose post–cardiac arrest patients.\n\n【3】Prognostication of functional outcome has not been established in noncomatose patients. Neurological examination for this purpose can be reliably undertaken only in the absence of confounding factors (hypotension, seizures, sedatives, or neuromuscular blockers). On the basis of existing studies, no clinical neurological signs reliably predict poor outcome < 24 hours after cardiac arrest.删除2:<u> 204,205</u> Among adult patients who are comatose and have not been treated with hypothermia, the absence of both pupillary light and corneal reflexes at ≥ 72 hours after cardiac arrest predicted poor outcome with high reliability.删除2:<u> 204 </u>The absence of vestibulo-ocular reflexes at ≥ 24 hours (FPR 0%, 95% CI 0% to 14%) 205.206 or Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score < 5 at ≥ 72 hours (FPR 0%, 95% CI 0% to 6%) 204 , 207 , 208 are less reliable for predicting poor outcome or were studied only in limited numbers of patients. Other clinical signs, including myoclonus, 209–213 are not recommended for predicting poor outcome (Class III, LOE C).\n\n【4】## Eeg\n\n【5】No electrophysiological study reliably predicts outcome in comatose patients during the first 24 hours after ROSC. In normothermic patients without significant confounders (sedatives, hypotension, hypothermia, neuromuscular blockade, or hypoxemia), an EEG pattern showing generalized suppression to < 20 µ V , burst-suppression pattern associated with generalized epileptic activity, or diffuse periodic complexes on a flat background is associated with a poor outcome (FPR 3%, 95% CI 0.9% to 11%).删除2:<u> 203 </u>One week after the initial arrest event, specific EEG findings may be useful for predicting poor outcomes in comatose cardiac arrest survivors, 161,203,204,206,214–221 The prognostic accuracy of malignant EEG patterns appears to be less reliable in patients treated with hypothermia. Status epilepticus in post-ROSC patients treated with hypothermia has an FPR of 7% (95% CI 1% to 25%) to 11.5% (95% CI 3% to 31%) for predicting poor outcome.删除2:<u> 218,222</u> In the absence of confounding factors such as sedatives, hypotension, hypothermia, neuromuscular blockade, seizures, or hypoxemia, it may be helpful to use an unprocessed EEG interpretation observed ≥ 24 hours after ROSC to assist with the prediction of a poor outcome in comatose survivors of cardiac arrest not treated with hypothermia (Class IIb, LOE B).\n\n【6】## Evoked Potentials\n\n【7】Abnormalities in evoked potentials are associated with poor outcomes. Bilateral absence of the N20 cortical response to median nerve SSEPs predicts poor outcome (FPR 0%, 95% CI 0% to 3%).删除2:<u> 161.203</u> Although other evoked potential measurements\n\n【8】 (for example, Brain stem Auditory Evoked Potentials) have been associated with poor outcomes in comatose cardiac arrest survivors, they are either less reliable predictors of poor outcome than SSEPs or have not been studied in enough patients to establish their reliability. Bilateral absence of the N20 cortical response to median nerve stimulation after 24 hours predicts poor outcome in comatose cardiac arrest survivors not treated with therapeutic hypothermia (Class IIa, LOE A).\n\n【9】The impact of therapeutic hypothermia on the prognostic accuracy of SSEPs has not been adequately studied.\n\n【10】## Neuroimaging\n\n【11】The most studied neuroimaging modalities are magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) of the brain. Extensive cortical and subcortical lesions on MRI are associated with poor neurological outcome.删除2:<u> 223–253</u> These studies varied widely in the MRI parameters used, sample size, and interval after arrest when testing occurred.\n\n【12】CT imaging to detect brain injury and predict functional outcome is supported by several studies.删除2:<u> 233 </u>, 244 , 245 , 247 , 248 , 254 – 267 The timing of CT in these studies varied widely. CT parameters associated with poor outcome were varied and included quantitative measure of gray matter:white matter Hounsfield unit ratio and qualitative description of brain structures. A nonenhanced CT scan can also provide information about structural lesions, stroke, or intracranial hemorrhage that may have contributed to cardiac arrest.删除2:<u> 268,269</u> Other less utilized and investigated neuroimaging modalities have included single-photon emission computed tomography.删除2:<u> 253,267,270</u> cerebral angiography 244 and transcranial Doppler 240 A nuclear imaging study observed that abnormal tracer uptake in the cerebral cortices was associated with poor outcome in one case report.删除2:<u> 248 </u>Despite tremendous potential, neuroimaging has yet to be proved as an independently accurate modality for prediction of outcome in individual comatose survivors of cardiac arrest and specific neuroimaging modalities cannot be recommended for predicting poor outcome after cardiac arrest.\n\n【13】## Blood And Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarkers\n\n【14】There has been extensive clinical research exploring biomarkers in the blood (plasma or serum) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as early predictors of poor outcome in comatose cardiac arrest survivors. Biomarkers that are predictive of neurological outcome are typically released from dying neurons or glial cells in the brain (eg, neuron-specific enolase [NSE], S100B, GFAP, CK-BB) and can be measured in the blood or CSF. The primary advantage of biomarkers is that levels are unlikely to be confounded by sedation or neuromuscular blockade, which are commonly used in the first few days after cardiac arrest. However, for most biomarkers, only an association with outcome has been reported. When using a cutoff value that results in an FPR of 0% for predicting poor outcome, the 95% CI is unacceptably high due to the small number of patients studied.\n\n【15】The most promising and extensively studied biomarker is serum NSE, which has been reported to have a 0% FPR (95% CI 0% to 3%) for predicting poor outcome when measured between 24 and 72 hours after cardiac arrest.删除2:<u> 203 </u>.删除2:<u> 204 </u>Other", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "potentials (SSEPs) and select physical examination findings", "bbox": [60.0, 84.0, 377.0, 99.0]}, {"text": "at specific time points after ROSC in the absence of con-", "bbox": [60.0, 100.0, 375.0, 113.0]}, {"text": "founders (such as hypotension, seizures, sedatives, or neuro-", "bbox": [60.0, 115.0, 375.0, 130.0]}, {"text": "muscular blockers) are the most reliable early predictors of", "bbox": [60.0, 132.0, 377.0, 145.0]}, {"text": "poor outcome in patients not undergoing therapeutic hypo-", "bbox": [60.0, 147.0, 375.0, 160.0]}, {"text": "thermia.

As noted above, successful treatment with β 2 -agonists may cause an initial decrease in oxygen saturation because the resultant bronchodilation can initially increase the ventilation-perfusion mismatch.\n\n【11】 When combined with nebulized β -adrenergic agents and corticosteroids, IV magnesium sulfate can moderately improve pulmonary function in patients with asthma.删除2:<u> 19 </u>Magnesium causes relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle independent of serum magnesium level, with only minor side effects (flushing, lightheadedness). A Cochrane meta-analysis of 7 studies concluded that IV magnesium sulfate improves pulmonary function and reduces hospital admissions, particularly for patients with the most severe exacerbations of asthma.删除2:<u> 20 </u>The use of nebulized magnesium sulfate as an adjunct to nebulized β -adrenergic agents has been reported in a small case series to improve FEV1 and Spo 2 , 21 although a prior meta-analysis demonstrated only a trend toward improved pulmonary function with nebulized magnesium.删除2:<u> 22 </u>For those with severe refractory asthma, providers may consider IV magnesium at the standard adult dose of 2 g administered over 20 minutes.\n\n【12】 Short-acting β -agonists provide rapid, dose-dependent bronchodilation with minimal side effects. Because the dose delivered depends on the patient's lung volume and inspiratory flow rate, the same dose can be used in most patients regardless of age or size. Studies have shown no difference in the effects of continuous versus intermittent administration of nebulized albuterol 8.9 ; however, continuous administration was more effective in a subset of patients with severe exacerbations of asthma.删除2:<u> 8 </u>A Cochrane meta-analysis showed no overall difference between the effects of albuterol delivered by metered-dose inhaler spacer or nebulizer.删除2:<u> 10 </u>If prior use of a metered-dose inhaler has not been effective, use of a nebulizer is reasonable.\n\n【13】Although albuterol is sometimes administered intravenously (IV) in severe asthma, a systematic review of 15 clinical trials found that IV β 2 -agonists, administered by either bolus or infusion, did not lead to significant improvements in any clinical outcome measure.删除2:<u> 9 </u>Levalbuterol is the R-isomer of albuterol. Comparisons with\n\n【14】 Epinephrine and terbutaline are adrenergic agents that can be given subcutaneously to patients with acute severe asthma. The dose of subcutaneous epinephrine (concentration 1:1000) is 0.01 mg/kg, divided into 3 doses of approximately 0.3 mg administered at 20-minute intervals. Although the nonselective adrenergic properties of epinephrine may cause an increase in heart rate, myocardial irritability, and increased oxygen demand, its use is well-tolerated, even in patients > 35 years of age.删除2:<u> 23 </u>Terbutaline is given in a subcutaneous dose of 0.25 mg, which can be repeated every 20 minutes for 3 doses. There is no evidence that subcutaneous epinephrine or terbutaline has advantages over inhaled β 2 -agonists. Epinephrine has been administered IV (initiated at 0.25 mcg/min to 1 mcg/min continuous infusion) in severe asthma; however, 1 retrospective investigation indicated a 4% incidence of serious side effects. There is no evidence of improved outcomes with IV epinephrine compared with selective inhaled β 2 -agonists.删除2:<u> 24</u>\n\n【15】 albuterol have produced mixed results, with some studies showing a slightly improved bronchodilator effect in the treatment of acute asthma in the ED.删除2:<u> 11 </u>There is no evidence that levalbuterol should be favored over albuterol.\n\n【16】One of the most common adjuncts used with β -agonist treatment, particularly in the first hours of treatment, include anticholinergic agents (see \"Adjunctive Therapies\" below for more detail). When combined with short-acting β -agonists, anticholinergic agents such as ipratropium can produce a clinically modest improvement in lung function compared with short-acting β -agonists alone.删除2:<u> 12,13</u>\n\n【17】 Systemic corticosteroids are the only treatment for the inflammatory component of asthma proven to be effective for acute asthma exacerbations. Because the antiinflammatory effects after administration may not be apparent for 6 to 12 hours, corticosteroids should be administered early. The early use of systemic steroids hastens the resolution of airflow obstruction and may reduce admission to the hospital.删除2:<u> 14 </u>Although there may be no difference in clinical effects between oral and IV formulations of corticosteroids, 15. 16 the IV route is preferable in patients with severe asthma. In adults a typical initial dose of methylprednisolone is 125 mg (dose range: 40 mg to 250 mg); a typical dose of dexamethasone is 10 mg.\n\n【18】 Ketamine is a parenteral, dissociative anesthetic with bronchodilatory properties that also can stimulate copious bronchial secretions. One case series 25 suggested substantial efficacy, whereas 2 published randomized trials in children 26 .删除2:<u> 27 </u>found no benefit of ketamine when compared with standard care. Ketamine has sedative and analgesic properties that may be useful if intubation is planned.\n\n【19】 Heliox is a mixture of helium and oxygen (usually a 70:30 helium to oxygen ratio mix) that is less viscous than ambient air.\n\n【20】Heliox has been shown to improve the delivery and deposition of nebulized albuterol 28 ; however, a recent meta-analysis of clinical trials did not support its use as initial treatment for\n\n【21】 Ipratropium bromide is an anticholinergic bronchodilator pharmacologically related to atropine.

Once the earth formed 4.5 billion years ago, asteroid impacts periodically shattered and sterilized the planet's surface for another half a billion years. And yet, within a few hundred million years of that hellish age, microscopic life appeared in abundance. Sometime in the interim, the first living entity must have been crafted from air, water and rock.\n\n【2】Of those three raw materials, the atmosphere and oceans\n\n【3】 have long enjoyed the starring roles in origins-of-life scenarios. But rocks, and the minerals of which they are made, have been called on only as bit players or simply as props.\n\n【4】Scientists are now realizing that such limited casting is a mistake. Indeed, a recent flurry of fascinating experiments is revealing that minerals play a crucial part in the basic chemical reactions from which life must have arisen.\n\n【5】The first act of life's origin story must have introduced collections of carbon-based molecules that could make copies of themselves. Achieving even this nascent step in evolution entailed a sequence of chemical transformations, each of which added a level of structure and complexity to a group of organic molecules. The most abundant carbon-based compounds available on the ancient earth were gases with only one atom of carbon per molecule, namely, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and methane. But the essential building blocks of living organisms—energy-rich sugars, membrane-forming lipids and complex amino acids—may include more than a dozen carbon atoms per molecule. Many of these molecules, in turn, must bond together to form chainlike polymers and other molecular arrays in order to accomplish life's chemical tasks. Linking small molecules into these complex, extended structures must have been\n\n【6】 especially difficult in the harsh conditions of the early earth, where intense ultraviolet radiation tended to break down clusters of molecules as quickly as they could form.\n\n【7】Carbon-based molecules needed protection and assistance to enact this drama. It turns out that minerals could have served at least five significant functions, from passive props to active players, in life-inducing chemical reactions.\n\n【8】Tiny compartments in mineral structures can shelter simple molecules, while mineral surfaces can provide the scaffolding on which those molecules assemble and grow. Beyond these sheltering and supportive functions, crystal faces of certain minerals can actively select particular molecules resembling those that were destined to become biologically important. The metallic ions in other minerals can jumpstart meaningful reactions like those that must have converted simple molecules into self-replicating entities. Most surprising, perhaps, are the recent indications that elements of dissolved minerals can be incorporated into biological molecules. In other words, minerals may not have merely helped biological molecules come together, they might have become part of life itself.\n\n【9】## Protection From The Elements\n\n【10】FOR THE BETTER PART of a century, following the 1859 publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species, a parade of scientists speculated on life's chemical origins.\n\n【11】Some even had the foresight to mention rocks and minerals in their inventive scenarios.

Lidocaine, however, has no proven short- or long-term efficacy in cardiac arrest. Lidocaine may be considered if amiodarone is not available (Class IIb, LOE B). The initial dose is 1 to 1.5 mg/kg IV. If VF/pulseless VT persists, additional doses of 0.5 to 0.75 mg/kg IV push may be administered at 5- to 10-minute intervals to a maximum dose of 3 mg/kg.\n\n【8】 Other Vasopressors There are no alternative vasopressors (norepinephrine, phenylephrine) with proven survival benefit compared with epinephrine.删除2:<u> 268,281,282</u>\n\n【9】 There is no evidence that any antiarrhythmic drug given routinely during human cardiac arrest increases survival to hospital discharge. Amiodarone, however, has been shown to increase short-term survival to hospital admission when compared with placebo or lidocaine.\n\n【10】 Two observational studies 290 .删除2:<u> 291 </u>showed that IV magnesium sulfate can facilitate termination of torsades de pointes (irregular/polymorphic VT associated with prolonged QT interval). Magnesium sulfate is not likely to be effective in terminating irregular/polymorphic VT in patients with a normal QT interval.删除2:<u> 291</u>\n\n【11】 IV amiodarone affects sodium, potassium, and calcium channels and has α - and β -adrenergic blocking properties. It can be considered for treatment of VF or pulseless VT unresponsive to shock delivery, CPR, and a vasopressor. In blinded randomized controlled clinical trials in adults with refractory VF/pulseless VT in the out-of-hospital setting, 134 , 136 paramedic administration of amiodarone (300 mg 134 or 5 mg/kg 136 ) improved hospital admission rates when compared with administration of placebo 134 or 1.5 mg/kg of lidocaine.删除2:<u> 136 </u>Additional studies 283–287 documented consistent improvement in termination of arrhythmias when amiodarone was given to humans or animals with VF or hemodynamically unstable VT. A higher incidence of bradycardia and hypotension was reported for amiodarone in one out-of-hospital study.删除2:<u> 134 </u>A canine study 288 noted that administration of a vasoconstrictor before amiodarone prevented hypotension. The adverse hemodynamic effects of the IV formulation of amiodarone are attributed to vasoactive solvents (polysorbate 80 and benzyl alcohol). When administered in the absence of these solvents, an analysis of the combined data of 4 prospective clinical trials of patients with VT (some hemodynamically unstable) showed that amiodarone produced no more hypotension than lidocaine.删除2:<u> 286 </u>A formulation of IV amiodarone without these vasoactive solvents was approved for use in the United States.\n\n【12】Amiodarone may be considered for VF or pulseless VT unresponsive to CPR, defibrillation, and a vasopressor therapy (Class IIb, LOE B). An initial dose of 300 mg IV/IO can be followed by 1 dose of 150 mg IV/IO. Although anecdotally administered IO without known adverse effects, there is limited experience with amiodarone given by this route.\n\n【13】 A number of doses of magnesium sulfate have been used clinically, and an optimal dosing regimen has not been established. When VF/pulseless VT cardiac arrest is associated with torsades de pointes, providers may administer an IV/IO bolus of magnesium sulfate at a dose of 1 to 2 g diluted in 10 mL D 5 W (Class IIb, LOE C). See Part 8.3: \"Management of Symptomatic Bradycardia and Tachycardia\" for additional information about management of torsades de pointes not associated with cardiac arrest.\n\n【14】Three RCTs 292–294 did not identify a significant benefit from use of magnesium compared with placebo among patients with VF arrest in the prehospital, intensive care unit, and emergency department setting, respectively. Thus, routine administration of magnesium sulfate in cardiac arrest is not recommended (Class III, LOE A) unless torsades de pointes is present.\n\n【15】 Atropine sulfate reverses cholinergic-mediated decreases in heart rate and atrioventricular nodal conduction. No prospective controlled clinical trials have examined the use of atropine in asystole or bradycardic PEA cardiac arrest.\n\n【16】Lower-level clinical studies provide conflicting evidence of the benefit of routine use of atropine in cardiac arrest.删除2:<u> 34,295–304</u> There is no evidence that atropine has detrimental effects during bradycardic or asystolic cardiac arrest. Available evidence suggests that routine use of atropine during PEA or asystole is unlikely to have a therapeutic benefit (Class IIb, LOE B). For this reason atropine has been removed from the cardiac arrest algorithm.\n\n【17】 A retrospective review 289 demonstrated an association between improved hospital admission rates and use of lidocaine (compared with standard treatment) in patients with out-of-hospital VF cardiac arrest. But there is inadequate evidence to recommend the use of lidocaine in patients who have refractory VT/VF, defined as VT/VF not terminated by defibrillation or that continues to recur after defibrillation during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest or inhospital cardiac arrest.\n\n【18】Lidocaine is an alternative antiarrhythmic of long-standing and widespread familiarity with fewer immediate side effects\n\n【19】 Tissue acidosis and resulting acidemia during cardiac arrest and resuscitation are dynamic processes resulting from no blood flow during arrest and low blood flow during CPR.\n\n【20】These processes are affected by the duration of cardiac arrest, level of blood flow, and arterial oxygen content during CPR.\n\n【21】Restoration of oxygen content with appropriate ventilation with oxygen, support of some tissue perfusion and some cardiac output with high-quality chest compressions, then rapid ROSC are the mainstays of restoring acid-base balance during cardiac arrest.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "Antiarrhythmics", "bbox": [60.0, 171.0, 165.0, 186.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [59.0, 170.0, 164.0, 185.0], "position": 3}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Magnesium Sulfate", "bbox": [404.0, 204.0, 511.0, 218.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [403.0, 203.0, 510.0, 217.0], "position": 4}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Amiodarone", "bbox": [60.0, 287.0, 129.0, 301.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [59.0, 286.0, 128.0, 300.0], "position": 5}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Interventions Not Recommended for Routine Use", "bbox": [404.0, 575.0, 710.0, 589.0]}, {"text": "During Cardiac Arrest", "bbox": [404.0, 591.0, 547.0, 605.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [403.0, 573.0, 709.0, 604.0], "position": 6}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Atropine", "bbox": [404.0, 612.0, 453.0, 625.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [403.0, 611.0, 452.0, 624.0], "position": 7}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Lidocaine", "bbox": [60.0, 803.0, 116.0, 816.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [59.0, 802.0, 115.0, 815.0], "position": 8}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Sodium Bicarbonate", "bbox": [404.0, 823.0, 516.0, 836.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [403.0, 822.0, 515.0, 834.0], "position": 9}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "than may be encountered with other antiarrhythmics.

Spinal cord injury is rare among fatal drowning victims.删除2:<u> 271 </u>Victims with obvious clinical signs of injury, alcohol intoxication, or a history of diving into shallow water are at a higher risk of spinal cord injury, and health care providers may consider stabilization and possible immobilization of the cervical and thoracic spine for these victims.删除2:<u> 272</u>\n\n【1】## Hypothermia\n\n【2】In an unresponsive victim with hypothermia, assessments of breathing and pulse are particularly difficult because heart rate and breathing may be very slow, depending on the degree of hypothermia.\n\n【3】 If the victim is unresponsive with no normal breathing, lay rescuers should begin chest compressions immediately (see Part 12: \"Cardiac Arrest in Special Situations\"). If the adult victim is unresponsive with no breathing or no normal breathing (ie, only gasping), healthcare providers can check for a pulse, but should start CPR if a pulse is not definitely felt within 10 seconds. Do not wait to check the victim's temperature and do not wait until the victim is rewarmed to start CPR. To prevent further heat loss, remove wet clothes from the victim; insulate or shield the victim from wind, heat, or cold; and if possible, ventilate the victim with warm, humidified oxygen.\n\n【4】Avoid rough movement, and transport the victim to a hospital as soon as possible. If VF is detected, emergency personnel should deliver shocks using the same protocols used for the normothermic cardiac arrest victim (see Part 12: \"Cardiac Arrest in Special Situations\").\n\n【5】For the hypothermic patient in cardiac arrest, continue resuscitative efforts until the patient is evaluated by advanced care providers. In the out-of-hospital setting, passive warming can be used until active warming is available.\n\n【6】## Foreign-Body Airway Obstruction (Choking)\n\n【7】FBAO is an uncommon, but preventable, cause of death.删除2:<u> 273 </u>Most reported cases of FBAO occur in adults while they are eating.删除2:<u> 274 </u>Most reported episodes of choking in infants and children occur during eating or play when parents or childcare providers are present. The choking event is therefore commonly witnessed, and the rescuer usually intervenes while the victim is still responsive. Treatment is usually successful, and survival rates can exceed 95%.删除2:<u> 275</u>\n\n【8】## Recognition Of Foreign-Body Airway Obstruction\n\n【9】Because recognition of FBAO is the key to successful outcome, it is important to distinguish this emergency from fainting, heart attack, seizure, or other conditions that may cause sudden respiratory distress, cyanosis, or loss of consciousness.\n\n【10】Foreign bodies may cause either mild or severe airway obstruction. The rescuer should intervene if the choking victim shows signs of severe airway obstruction. These include signs of poor air exchange and increased breathing difficulty, such as a silent cough, cyanosis, or inability to speak or breathe. The victim may clutch the neck, demonstrating the universal choking sign. Quickly ask, \"Are you choking?\" If the victim indicates \"yes\" by nodding his head without speaking, this will verify that the victim has severe airway obstruction.\n\n【11】 Relief of Foreign-Body Airway Obstruction When FBAO produces signs of severe airway obstruction, rescuers must act quickly to relieve the obstruction. If mild obstruction is present and the victim is coughing forcefully, do not interfere with the patient's spontaneous coughing and breathing efforts. Attempt to relieve the obstruction only if signs of severe obstruction develop: the cough becomes silent, respiratory difficulty increases and is accompanied by stridor, or the victim becomes unresponsive. Activate the EMS system quickly if the patient is having difficulty breathing. If more than one rescuer is present, one rescuer should phone 911 while the other rescuer attends to the choking victim.\n\n【12】The clinical data about effectiveness of maneuvers to relieve FBAO are largely retrospective and anecdotal. For responsive adults and children > 1 year of age with severe FBAO, case reports show the feasibility and effectiveness of back blows or \"slaps,\" 276 – 278 abdominal thrusts, 275 – 277 , 279 , 280 and chest thrusts.删除2:<u> 276 </u>, 281 In 1 case series of 513 choking episodes for which EMS was summoned, 275 approximately 50% of the episodes of airway obstruction were relieved prior to arrival of EMS. EMS intervention with abdominal thrusts successfully relieved the obstruction in more than 85% of the remaining cases. The few patients with persistent obstruction usually responded to suction or the use of Magill forceps.\n\n【13】Less than 4% died.删除2:<u> 275 </u>Although chest thrusts, back slaps, and abdominal thrusts are feasible and effective for relieving severe FBAO in conscious (responsive) adults and children ≥ 1 year of age, for simplicity in training it is recommended that abdominal thrusts be applied in rapid sequence until the obstruction is relieved (Class IIb, LOE B). If abdominal thrusts are not effective, the rescuer may consider chest thrusts (Class IIb, LOE B). It is important to note that abdominal thrusts are not recommended for infants < 1 year of age because thrusts may cause injuries.\n\n【14】Chest thrusts should be used for obese patients if the rescuer is unable to encircle the victim's abdomen. If the choking victim is in the late stages of pregnancy, the rescuer should use chest thrusts instead of abdominal thrusts.\n\n【15】If the adult victim with FBAO becomes unresponsive, the rescuer should carefully support the patient to the ground, immediately activate (or send someone to activate) EMS, and then begin CPR.  The healthcare provider should carefully lower the victim to the ground, send someone to activate the emergency response system and begin CPR (without a pulse check). After 2 minutes, if someone has not already done so, the healthcare provider should activate the emeregency response system. A randomized trial of maneuvers to open the airway in cadavers 282 and 2 prospective studies in anesthetized volunteers 281 .删除2:<u> 283 </u>showed that higher sustained airway pressures can be generated using the chest thrust rather than the abdominal thrust. Each time the airway is opened during CPR, the rescuer should look for an object in the victim's mouth and if found, remove it. Simply looking into the mouth should not significantly increase the time needed to attempt the ventilations and proceed to the 30 chest compressions.\n\n【16】No studies have evaluated the routine use of the finger sweep to clear an airway in the absence of visible airway obstruction.

What’S New In Asthma Treatment?\n\n【1】Asthma is a condition that is of great interest to physicians, researchers, epidemiologists, and public health experts.

Development of dry powder inhalers (DPIs) is a recent phenomenon.\n\n【2】So, too, is the design of novel medication based on the basic science of asthma. The leukotriene antagonist medications, for example, were designed based on the specific study of leukotrienes, which are produced in greater numbers in allergic and asthmatic persons.

In our case, we try to replicate the bone-crushing pressures and scalding temperatures typical of a deep-sea hydrothermal vent.\n\n【6】Most of our experiments test the interactions among ingredients enclosed in welded gold capsules, which are roughly the size of a daily vitamin pill. We place as many as six capsules into Yoder's \"bomb\"—a massive steel pressure chamber that squeezes the tiny capsules to pressures approaching 2,000 atmospheres and heats them to about 250 degrees C.\n\n【7】One of our primary goals in these organic-synthesis experiments—and one of life's fundamental chemical reactions—is\n\n【8】 ers have harnessed this reaction to manufacture molecules with virtually any desired number of carbon atoms. Our first organic-synthesis experiments in 1996, and much more extensive research by Thomas McCollom of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, demonstrate that F-T reactions can build molecules with 30 or more carbon atoms under some hydrothermal-vent conditions in less than a day. If this process manufactures large organic molecules from simple inorganic chemicals throughout the earth's hydrothermal zones today, then it very likely did so in the planet's prebiological past.\n\n【9】When we conduct experiments using nickel or cobalt sulfides, we see that carbon addition occurs primarily by carbonylation—the insertion of a carbon and\n\n【10】 rich variety of complex organic molecules.\n\n【11】Our 1,500 hydrothermal organic synthesis experiments at Carnegie have done more than supplement the catalogue of interesting molecules that must have been produced on the early earth. These efforts reveal another, more complex behavior of minerals that may have significant consequences for the chemistry of life.\n\n【12】Most previous origins-of-life studies have treated minerals as solid and unchanging—stable platforms where organic molecules could assemble. But we are finding that in the presence of hot water at high pressure, minerals start to dissolve. In the process, the liberated atoms and molecules from the minerals can become crucial reactants in the primordial soup.\n\n【13】## The Heart Of The Matter\n\n【14】OUR FIRST DISCOVERY of minerals as reactants was an unexpected result of our recent catalysis experiments led by Cody. As expected, carbonylation reactions produced 10-carbon decanoic acid from a mixture of simple molecules inside our gold capsules.

We find that many common minerals, including most oxides and sulfi des of iron, copper and zinc, promote carbon addition by a routine industrial process known as Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) synthesis.\n\n【18】This process can build chainlike organic molecules from carbon monoxide and hydrogen. First, carbon monoxide and hydrogen react to form methane, which has one carbon atom. Adding more carbon monoxide and hydrogen to the methane produces ethane, a two-carbon molecule, and then the reaction repeats itself, adding a carbon atom each time. In the chemical industry, research-\n\n【19】 oxygen molecule, or carbonyl group. Carbonyl groups readily attach themselves to nickel or cobalt atoms, but not so strongly that they cannot link to other molecules and jump ship to form larger molecules. In one series of experiments, we observed the lengthening of the nine-carbon molecule nonyl thiol to form 10-carbon decanoic acid, a compound similar to the acids that drive metabolic reactions in living cells. What is more, all the reactants in this experiment—a thiol, carbon monoxide and water—are readily available near sulfide-rich hydrothermal vents. By repeating these simple kinds of reactions— adding a carbonyl group here or a hydroxide group there—we can synthesize a\n\n【20】 MAGNETITE: CATALYZES BIOCHEMICAL REACTIONS", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "MORE TO EXPLORE", "bbox": [48.0, 92.0, 189.0, 108.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [47.0, 91.0, 188.0, 107.0], "position": 0}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Beginnings of Cellular Life.

With this rule, a single + grows into four more +'s, each of which grows likewise, and so forth.\n\n【1】Such weedlike proliferation does not shed much light on the principles of replication, because there is no significant machine. Of course, that invites the question of how you would tell a \"significant\" machine from a trivially prolific automata.\n\n【2】No one has yet devised a satisfactory answer. What is clear, however, is that the replicating structure must in some sense be complex. For example, it must consist of multiple, diverse components whose interactions collectively bring about replication—the proverbial \"whole must be greater than the sum of the parts.\" The existence of multiple distinct components permits a self-description to be stored within the replicating structure.\n\n【3】In the years since von Neumann's seminal work, many researchers have probed the domain between the complex and the trivial, developing replicators that require fewer components, less space or simpler rules. A major step forward was taken in 1984 when Christopher G. Langton, then at the University of Michigan, observed that looplike storage devices—which had formed modules of earlier self-replicating machines—could be programmed to replicate on their own. These devices typically consist of two pieces: the loop itself, which is a string of components that circulate around a rectangle, and a construction arm, which protrudes from a corner of the rectangle into the surrounding space. The circulating components constitute a recipe for the loop—for example, \"go three squares ahead, then turn left.\" When this recipe reaches the construction arm, the automata rules make a copy of it.  One copy continues around the loop; the other goes down the arm, where it is interpreted as instructions.\n\n【4】By giving up the requirement of universal construction, which was central to von Neumann's approach, Langton showed that a replicator could be constructed from just seven unique components occupying only 86 cells. Even smaller and simpler self-replicating loops have been devised by one of us (Reggia) and our colleagues [ see box on next page ]. Be-\n\n【5】 cause they have multiple interacting components and include a self-description, they are not trivial. Intriguingly, asymmetry plays an unexpected role: the rules governing replication are often simpler when the components are not rotationally symmetric than when they are.\n\n【6】## Emergent Replication All These Self-Replicating Struc-\n\n【7】tures have been designed through ingenuity and much trial and error. This process is arduous and often frustrating; a small change to one of the rules results in an entirely different global behavior, most likely the disintegration of the structure in question. But recent work has gone beyond the direct-design approach.\n\n【8】Instead of tailoring the rules to suit a par-\n\n【9】 ticular type of structure, researchers have experimented with various sets of rules, filled the cellular-automata grid with a \"primordial soup\" of randomly selected components and checked whether selfreplicators emerged spontaneously.\n\n【10】In 1997 Hui-Hsien Chou, now at Iowa State University, and Reggia noticed that as long as the initial density of the free-floating components was above a certain threshold, small self-replicating loops reliably appeared. Loops that collided underwent annihilation, so there was an ongoing process of death as well as birth.\n\n【11】Over time, loops proliferated, grew in size and evolved through mutations triggered by debris from past collisions.

It is reasonable to administer a 300-mg oral dose of clopidogrel to ED patients with suspected ACS (without ECG or cardiac marker changes) who are unable to take aspirin because of hypersensitivity or major gastrointestinal intolerance (Class IIa, LOE B).\n\n【4】Providers should administer a 300-mg oral dose of clopidogrel to ED patients up to 75 years of age with STEMI who receive aspirin, heparin, and fibrinolysis (Class I, LOE B).\n\n【5】There is little evidence on the use of a loading dose of clopidogrel in patients aged ≥ 75 years of age with NSTEMI and STEMI treated by PPCI, and patients > 75 years of age were excluded in the studies on STEMI treated by fibrinolysis, therefore the ideal dose of clopidogrel in patients over 75 years of age has yet to be delineated. In the ED the choice of immediate antiplatelet therapy (as well as protocols for STEMI and NSTEMI) should be guided by local interdisciplinary review of ongoing clinical trials, guidelines, and recommendations.\n\n【6】 The use and efficacy of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors for treatment of patients with UA/NSTEMI has been well established.删除2:<u> 274 </u>– 279 These trials were conducted prior to contemporary conservative and invasive strategies, and ongoing questions have been investigated concerning their timing (eg, upsteam initiation) and use combined with other contemporary agents (eg, clopidogrel).\n\n【7】Two recent studies do not support the routine use of upstream GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors.删除2:<u> 280,281</u> Other studies have documented benefit largely in patients who have elevated cardiac troponin and a planned invasive strategy or specific subsets such as those patients with diabetes or significant ST-segment depression on the presenting ECG.删除2:<u> 282–286</u> The current evidence supports a selective strategy for the use of GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors in the use of dual platelet inhibitor treatment of patients with planned invasive strategy taking into consideration the ACS risk of the patient and weighing this against the potential bleeding risk. There is no current evidence supporting the routine use of GP IIb/ IIIa inhibitor therapy prior to angiography in patients with STEMI and use of these agents upstream is uncertain. Use of GP IIb/ IIIa inhibitors should be guided by local interdisciplinary review of ongoing clinical trials, guidelines, and recommendations.\n\n【8】 Controversy surrounds the administration of β -adrenergic receptor blockers in the setting of ACS. Several studies have shown reduced mortality 287 .删除2:<u> 288 </u>and decreased infarct size 289 – 291 with early IV β -blocker use. Early β -blocker administration may help prevent dangerous arrhythmias 288,290,292,293 and reduce reinfarction, but there is an increased incidence of cardiogenic shock.\n\n【9】Recent evidence shows no particular benefit to the IV administration of β -blockers on either mortality, infarct size, prevention of arrhythmias, or reinfarction 294 – 301 There may be, however, a statistically significant short-term benefit to 6-week mortality when IV β -blockers were given to low-risk (ie, Killip Class I) patients.删除2:<u> 296 </u>IV β -blockers may also be beneficial for NSTEMI. One study 302 suggested that the earlier the IV β -blockers were administered, the greater the effect seen on infarct size and mortality. Of note, none of the papers reviewed showed that β -blockers caused irreversible harm when given early in the development of suspected ACS.  Balancing the evidence overall for non-ST-segment elevation ACS patients, current ACC/AHA Guidelines recommend β -blockers be initiated orally within the first 24 hours after hospitalization.删除2:<u> 3 </u>Contraindications to β -blockers are moderate to severe LV failure and pulmonary edema, bradycardia (<60 bpm), hypotension (SBP < 100 mm Hg), signs of poor peripheral perfusion, second-degree or third-degree heart block, or reactive airway disease. Studies of β -blockers varied significantly in the treatment times used, with no high quality papers studying the administration of b -blockers in the prehospital setting or in the very early ED setting (ie, within the first hour of a suspected ACS).\n\n【10】For patients with ACS, there is no evidence to support the routine administration of IV β -blockers in the prehos-\n\n【11】 Prasugrel is an oral thienopyridine prodrug that irreversably binds to the ADP receptor to inhibit platelet aggregation.\n\n【12】Prasugrel may be associated with a reduction in combined event rate (cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal infarction, and nonfatal stroke) with no benefit in mortality compared to clopidogrel but with an overall resultant increase in major bleeding (as compared to clopidogrel) when administered after angiography to patients with NSTEMI undergoing PCI.删除2:<u> 268–272</u> Risk factors associated with a higher rate of bleeding with prasugrel use are age ≥ 75 years, previous stroke or TIA, and body weight less than 60 kg.\n\n【13】Small improvements in combined event rate (cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal infarction, and nonfatal stroke) and/or mortality are observed when prasugrel (compared to clopidogrel) is administered before or after angiography to patients with NSTEMI and STEMI managed with PCI.删除2:<u> 268 </u>– 271 , 273 , 274 Prasugrel (60 mg oral loading dose) may be substituted for clopidogrel after angiography in patients determined to have non-ST-segment elevation ACS or STEMI who are more than 12 hours after symptom onset prior to planned PCI (Class IIa, LOE B). There is no direct evidence for the use of prasugrel in the ED or prehospital settings. In patients who are not at high risk for bleeding, administration of prasugrel (60-mg oral loading dose) prior to angiography in patients determined to have STEMI ≤ 12 hours after the initial symptoms may be substituted for administration of clopidogrel (Class IIa, LOE B).

Is It True That Asthma Is On The Upswing?\n\n【1】Yes, there are more \"cases\" of asthma now than ever before in the United States. The prevalence of asthma is increasing in other industrialized countries worldwide as well. Prevalence is the total number of cases of a disease in a population at any given point in time. Of great concern to physicians are urban neighborhoods, such as parts of Harlem and of the South Bronx in New York City, where asthma in children has become epidemic and represents a health crisis.\n\n【2】## Gemma'S Comment:\n\n【3】Is asthma more common in urban than rural areas? Environmental factors are very important in the city, but many of the \"triggers\" that plague urban environments may also be found in rural areas, such as volatile organic compounds (found in varnishes, aerosol sprays, household disinfectants, and similar products), peeling paint, mold, decaying wood in older buildings, not to mention the heavy smoke from those 'romantic' wood fires that vacationers love to build when they go to the country.

Therefore, when in place before cardiac arrest, it is reasonable to consider using continuous Scvo 2 measurement to monitor quality of CPR, optimize chest compressions, and detect ROSC during chest compressions or when rhythm check reveals an organized rhythm (Class IIb, LOE C). If Scvo 2 is <30%, it is reasonable to consider trying to improve the quality of CPR by optimizing chest compression parameters (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【8】 value of using quantitative waveform capnography in nonintubated patients to monitor and optimize CPR quality and detect ROSC is uncertain (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【9】 CPP (coronary perfusion pressure=aortic relaxation [\"diastolic\"] pressure minus right atrial relaxation [\"diastolic\"] pressure) during CPR correlates with both myocardial blood flow and ROSC.删除2:<u> 168,192,220</u> Relaxation pressure during CPR is the trough of the pressure waveform during the relaxation phase of chest compressions and is analogous to diastolic pressure when the heart is beating. Increased CPP correlates with improved 24-hour survival rates in animal studies 193 and is associated with improved myocardial blood flow and ROSC in animal studies of epinephrine, vasopressin, and angiotensin II.删除2:<u> 193–195</u> In one human study ROSC did not occur unless a CPP ≥ 15 mm Hg was achieved during CPR.删除2:<u> 168 </u>However, monitoring of CPP during CPR is rarely available clinically because measurement and calculation require simultaneous recording of aortic and central venous pressure.\n\n【10】A reasonable surrogate for CPP during CPR is arterial relaxation (\"diastolic\") pressure, which can be measured using a radial, brachial, or femoral artery catheter. These closely approximate aortic relaxation pressures during CPR in humans.删除2:<u> 211.221</u> The same study that identified a CPP threshold of ≥ 15 mm Hg for ROSC also reported that ROSC was not achieved if aortic relaxation \"diastolic\" pressure did not exceed 17 mm Hg during CPR.删除2:<u> 168 </u>A specific target arterial relaxation pressure that optimizes the chance of ROSC has not been established. It is reasonable to consider using arterial relaxation \"diastolic\" pressure to monitor CPR quality, optimize chest compressions, and guide vasopressor therapy. (Class IIb, LOE C). If the arterial relaxation \"diastolic\" pressure is < 20 mm Hg, it is reasonable to consider trying to improve quality of CPR by optimizing chest compression parameters or giving a vasopressor or both (Class IIb, LOE C). Arterial pressure monitoring can also be used to detect ROSC during chest compressions or when a rhythm check reveals an organized rhythm (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【11】 During cardiac arrest, pulse oximetry typically does not provide a reliable signal because pulsatile blood flow is inadequate in peripheral tissue beds. But the presence of a plethysmograph waveform on pulse oximetry is potentially valuable in detecting ROSC, and pulse oximetry is useful to ensure appropriate oxygenation after ROSC.\n\n【12】 Arterial blood gas monitoring during CPR is not a reliable indicator of the severity of tissue hypoxemia, hypercarbia (and therefore adequacy of ventilation during CPR), or tissue acidosis.删除2:<u> 222 </u>Routine measurement of arterial blood gases during CPR has uncertain value (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【13】 No studies specifically examine the impact of echocardiography on patient outcomes in cardiac arrest. However, a number of studies suggest that transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography have potential utility in diagnosing treatable causes of cardiac arrest such as cardiac tamponade, pulmonary embolism, ischemia, and aortic dissection.删除2:<u> 223 </u>– 227 In addition, 3 prospective studies 228–230 found that absence of cardiac motion on sonography during resuscitation of patients in cardiac arrest was highly predictive of inability to achieve ROSC: of the 341 patients from the 3 studies, 218 had no detectable cardiac activity and only 2 of these had ROSC (no data on survival-to-hospital discharge were reported). Transthoracic or transesophageal echocardiography may be considered to diagnose treatable causes of cardiac arrest and guide treatment decisions (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【14】 During cardiac arrest, provision of high-quality CPR and rapid defibrillation are of primary importance and drug administration is of secondary importance. After beginning CPR and attempting defibrillation for identified VF or pulseless VT, providers can establish IV or IO access. This should be performed without interrupting chest compressions. The primary purpose of IV/IO access during cardiac arrest is to provide drug therapy. Two clinical studies 134 .删除2:<u> 136 </u>reported data suggesting worsened survival for every minute that antiarrhythmic drug delivery was delayed (measured from time of dispatch). However, this finding was potentially biased by a concomitant delay in onset of other ACLS interventions. In one study136 the interval from first shock to administration of an antiarrhythmic drug was a significant predictor of survival.\n\n【15】 When oxygen consumption, arterial oxygen saturation (SaO 2 ), and hemoglobin are constant, changes in ScvO 2 reflect changes in oxygen delivery by means of changes in cardiac output. Scvo 2 can be measured continuously using oximetric tipped central venous catheters placed in the superior vena cava. Scvo 2 values normally range from 60% to 80%. During cardiac arrest and CPR these values range from 25% to 35%, indicating the inadequacy of blood flow produced during CPR. In one clinical study the failure to achieve Scvo 2 of 30% during CPR was associated with failure to achieve ROSC.删除2:<u> 169 </u>Scvo 2 also helps to rapidly detect ROSC without interrupting chest compressions to check rhythm and pulse. When available, continuous Scvo 2 monitoring is a potentially useful indicator of cardiac output and", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "Coronary Perfusion Pressure and Arterial", "bbox": [60.0, 149.0, 289.0, 163.0]}, {"text": "Relaxation Pressure", "bbox": [60.0, 164.0, 170.0, 178.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [59.0, 148.0, 288.0, 177.0], "position": 3}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Pulse Oximetry", "bbox": [404.0, 222.0, 488.0, 237.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [403.0, 221.0, 487.0, 236.0], "position": 4}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Arterial Blood Gases", "bbox": [404.0, 342.0, 519.0, 356.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [403.0, 341.0, 518.0, 355.0], "position": 5}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Echocardiography", "bbox": [404.0, 448.0, 504.0, 461.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [403.0, 447.0, 503.0, 460.0], "position": 6}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Access for Parenteral Medications During", "bbox": [404.0, 716.0, 664.0, 732.0]}, {"text": "Cardiac Arrest", "bbox": [404.0, 733.0, 499.0, 747.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [403.0, 715.0, 663.0, 746.0], "position": 7}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Central Venous Oxygen Saturation", "bbox": [60.0, 755.0, 251.0, 769.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [59.0, 754.0, 250.0, 768.0], "position": 8}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Timing of IV/IO Access", "bbox": [404.0, 755.0, 535.0, 769.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [403.0, 754.0, 534.0, 768.0], "position": 9}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "oxygen delivery during CPR.

Two-finger chest compression technique in infant (1 rescuer).</u>\n\n【1】## Start Chest Compressions\n\n【2】During cardiac arrest, high-quality chest compressions generate blood flow to vital organs and increase the likelihood of ROSC. If the infant or child is unresponsive and not breathing, give 30 chest compressions.\n\n【3】The following are characteristics of high-quality CPR:\n • Chest compressions of appropriate rate and depth. \"Push fast\": push at a rate of at least 100 compressions per minute. \"Push hard\": push with sufficient force to depress at least one third the anterior-posterior (AP) diameter of the chest or approximately 1 ½ inches (4 cm) in infants and 2 inches (5 cm) in children (Class I, LOE C). Inadequate compression depth is common 32 -34 even by health care providers.\n\n【4】• Allow complete chest recoil after each compression to\n allow the heart to refill with blood.\n\n【5】• Minimize interruptions of chest compressions.\n\n【6】• Avoid excessive ventilation.\n\n【7】 For best results, deliver chest compressions on a firm surface.删除2:<u> 35 </u>, 36\n\n【8】删除4:<u> For an infant, lone rescuers (whether lay rescuers or healthcare providers) should compress the sternum with 2 fingers 删除5:<u>(Figure 2)</u> placed just below the intermammary line (Class IIb, LOE C).删除2:<u> 37–41</u> Do not compress over the xiphoid or ribs. Rescuers should compress at least one third the depth of the chest, or about 4 cm (1.5 inches).</u>\n\n【9】For a child, lay rescuers and healthcare providers should compress the lower half of the sternum at least one third of the AP dimension of the chest or approximately 5 cm (2 inches) with the heel of 1 or 2 hands. Do not press on the xiphoid or the ribs. There are no data to determine if the 1- or 2-hand method produces better compressions and better outcome (Class IIb, LOE C). In a child manikin study, higher chest compression pressures were obtained 42 with less rescuer fatigue 43 with the 2-hand technique. Because children and rescuers come in all sizes, rescuers may use either 1 or 2 hands to compress the child's chest. Whichever you use, make sure to achieve an adequate compression depth with complete release after each compression.\n\n【10】After each compression, allow the chest to recoil completely (Class IIb, LOE B) because complete chest re-\n\n【11】 expansion improves the flow of blood returning to the heart and thereby blood flow to the body during CPR.删除2:<u> 44 -46</u> During pediatric CPR incomplete chest wall recoil is common, particularly when rescuers become fa删除16:<u>¬ </u>tigued.删除2:<u> 32</u>, 47, 48 Incomplete recoil during CPR is associated with higher intrathoracic pressures and significantly decreased venous return, coronary perfusion, blood flow, and cerebral perfusion.删除2:<u> 45</u>.删除6:<u> 46 </u>Manikin studies suggest that techniques to lift the heel of the hand slightly, but completely, off the chest can improve chest recoil, but this technique has not been studied in humans.删除2:<u> 44 </u>.删除2:<u> 49 </u>Automated CPR feedback devices hold promise as monitors of CPR quality parameters, including chest recoil, by providing real-time, corrective feedback to the rescuer. However, there is currently insufficient evidence for or against their use in infants and children.\n\n【12】Rescuer fatigue can lead to inadequate compression rate, depth, and recoil.删除2:<u> 32,47,30</u> The quality of chest compressions may deteriorate within minutes even when the rescuer denies feeling fatigued.删除2:<u> 51.52</u> Rescuers should therefore rotate the compressor role approximately every 2 minutes to prevent compressor fatigue and deterioration in quality and rate of chest compressions. Recent data suggest that when feedback devices are used and compressions are effective, some rescuers may be able to effectively continue past the 2-minute interval.删除2:<u> 47 </u>The switch should be accomplished as quickly as possible (ideally in less than 5 seconds) to minimize interruptions in chest compressions.\n\n【13】Resuscitation outcomes in infants and children are best if chest compressions are combined with ventilations (see below), but if a rescuer is not trained in providing ventilations, or is unable to do so, the lay rescuer should continue with chest compressions (\"Hands-Only\" or compression-only CPR) until help arrives.\n\n【14】## Open The Airway And Give Ventilations\n\n【15】删除7:<u>For the lone rescuer a compression-to-ventilation ratio of 30:2 is recommended. After the initial set of 30 compressions, open the airway and give 2 breaths. In an unresponsive infant or child, the tongue may obstruct the airway and interfere with ventilations.删除2:<u> 53–55</u> Open the airway using a head tilt–chin lift maneuver for both injured and noninjured victims (Class I, LOE B).\n\n【16】To give breaths to an infant, use a mouth-to-mouth-andnose technique; to give breaths to a child, use a mouth-tomouth technique.删除2:<u>56 </u>Make sure the breaths are effective (ie, the chest rises). Each breath should take about 1 second. If the chest does not rise, reposition the head, make a better seal, and try again.删除2:<u> 56 </u>It may be necessary to move the child's head through a range of positions to provide optimal airway patency and effective rescue breathing.\n\n【17】In an infant, if you have difficulty making an effective seal over the mouth and nose, try either mouth-to-mouth or mouth-to-nose ventilation (Class IIb, LOE C).删除2:<u> 57–59</u> If you use the mouth-to-mouth technique, pinch the nose closed.

Link, Chair; Dianne L. Atkins; Rod S. Passman; Henry R. Halperin; Ricardo A. Samson; Roger D. White; Michael T. Cudnik; Marc D. Berg; Peter J. Kudenchuk; Richard E. Kerber\n\n【2】## Overview\n\n【3】This chapter presents guidelines for defibrillation with manual defibrillators and automated external defibrillators (AEDs), synchronized cardioversion, and pacing. AEDs may be used by lay rescuers and healthcare providers as part of basic life support. Manual defibrillation, cardioversion, and pacing are advanced life support therapies.\n\n【4】## Defibrillation Plus Cpr: A Critical Combination\n\n【5】Early defibrillation is critical to survival from sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) for several reasons 1 : the most frequent initial rhythm in out-of-hospital witnessed SCA is ventricular fibrillation (VF), 2 the treatment for ventricular fibrillation is defibrillation, 3 the probability of successful defibrillation diminishes rapidly over time, 4 and VF tends to deteriorate to asystole over time.删除2:<u> 15.6</u> Several studies have documented the effects of time to defibrillation and the effects of bystander CPR on survival from SCA. For every minute that passes between collapse and defibrillation, survival rates from witnessed VF SCA decrease 7% to 10% if no CPR is provided.删除2:<u> 1 </u>When bystander CPR is provided, the decrease in survival rates is more gradual and averages 3% to 4% per minute from collapse to defibrillation.删除2:<u> 1.2.5.7</u> CPR can double 1.3 or triple 4 survival from witnessed SCA at most intervals to defibrillation.\n\n【6】If bystanders provide immediate CPR, many adults in VF can survive with intact neurologic function, especially if defibrillation is performed within 5 to 10 minutes after SCA.删除2:<u>8.9</u> CPR prolongs VF, delays the onset of asystole, 10–12 and extends the window of time during which defibrillation can occur. Basic CPR alone, however, is unlikely to terminate VF and restore a perfusing rhythm.\n\n【7】## New Recommendations To Integrate Cpr And Aed Use\n\n【8】To treat VF SCA, rescuers must be able to rapidly integrate CPR with use of the AED. To give the victim the best chance of survival, 3 actions must occur within the first moments of a\n\n【9】 cardiac arrest 1 : activation of the emergency medical services (EMS) system, 2 provision of CPR, and operation of an AED.删除2:<u> 3 </u>When 2 or more rescuers are present, activation of EMS and initiation of CPR can occur simultaneously.\n\n【10】Delays to either the start of CPR or the start of defibrillation reduce survival from SCA.  In the 1990s, some predicted that CPR could be rendered obsolete by the widespread development of community AED programs. However, Cobb 9 noted that as more of Seattle's first responders were equipped with AEDs, survival rates from SCA unexpectedly fell. This decline was attributed to reduced emphasis on CPR, and there is growing evidence to support this view. Part 5: \"Adult Basic Life Support\" summarizes the evidence on the importance of provision of high-quality CPR (including chest compressions of adequate rate and depth, allowing full chest recoil after each compression and minimizing interruptions in compressions).\n\n【11】Two critical questions about integration of CPR with defibrillation were evaluated during the 2010 International Consensus Conference on CPR and Emergency Cardiovascular Care.删除2:<u> 13 </u>The first question concerned whether CPR should be provided before defibrillation is attempted. The second question concerned the number of shocks to be delivered in a sequence before the rescuer resumes CPR.\n\n【12】## Shock First Versus Cpr First\n\n【13】When any rescuer witnesses an out-of-hospital arrest and an AED is immediately available on-site, the rescuer should start CPR and use the AED as soon as possible. Healthcare providers who treat cardiac arrest in hospitals and other facilities with AEDs on-site should provide immediate CPR and should use the AED/defibrillator as soon as it is available. These recommendations are designed to support early CPR and early defibrillation, particularly when an AED is available within moments of the onset of SCA.\n\n【14】In studies in which EMS call-to-arrival intervals were 4 9 to 5 8 minutes or longer, 1 ½ to 3 minutes of CPR before defibrillation increased the rate of initial resuscitation (return of spontaneous circulation or ROSC), survival to hospital discharge, 8. 9 and 1-year survival 8 when compared with immediate defibrillation\n删除8:<u> The American Heart Association requests that this document be cited as follows: Link MS, Atkins DL, Passman RS, Halperin HR, Samson RA, White RD, Cudnik MT, Berg MD, Kudenchuk PJ, Kerber RE.

Importantly, use of these agents for atrial-based SVTs, such as atrial fibrillation and flutter can result in their termination, which may be undesirable in the absence of precautions to prevent the thromboembolic complications that may result from such conversion.\n\n【2】删除4:<u>## Wide-Complex Tachycardia 删除5:<u>(Figure 4, Boxes 5, 6, And 7)</u></u>\n\n【3】删除4:<u>Evaluation The first step in the management of any tachycardia is to determine if the patient's condition is stable or unstable 删除5:<u>(Figure 4, Box 3 )</u>.

At this point the provider should consider the need to obtain expert consultation. If the patient becomes unstable at any time, proceed with synchronized cardioversion or unsynchronized defibrillation should the arrhythmia deteriorate to VF or be due to a polymorphic VT.</u>\n\n【5】Wide-complex tachycardias are defined as those with a QRS ≥ 0.12 second. The most common forms of widecomplex tachycardia are\n\n【6】 • VT or VF\n • SVT with aberrancy\n • Pre-excited tachycardias (associated with or mediated by an accessory pathway) • Ventricular paced rhythms\n\n【7】 The third step in management of a tachycardia is to determine if the rhythm is regular or irregular. A regular wide-complex tachycardia is likely to be VT or SVT with aberrancy. An irregular wide-complex tachycardia may be atrial fibrillation with aberrancy, pre-excited atrial fibrillation (ie, atrial fibrillation using an accessory pathway for antegrade conduction), or polymorphic VT/torsades de pointes.\n\n【8】Providers should consider the need for expert consultation when treating wide-complex tachycardias.\n\n【9】 Therapy for Regular Wide-Complex Tachycardias In patients with stable undifferentiated wide-QRS complex tachycardia, a reasonable approach is to try to identify the wide-complex tachycardia as SVT or VT and treat based on the algorithm for that rhythm.\n\n【10】If the etiology of the rhythm cannot be determined, the rate is regular, and the QRS is monomorphic, recent evidence suggests that IV adenosine is relatively safe for both treatment and diagnosis 7 (Class IIb, LOE B). However, adenosine should not be given for unstable or for irregular or polymorphic wide-\n\n【11】 complex tachycardias, as it may cause degeneration of the arrhythmia to VF (Class III, LOE C). If the wide-complex tachycardia proves to be SVT with aberrancy, it will likely be transiently slowed or converted by adenosine to sinus rhythm; if due to VT there will be no effect on rhythm (except in rare cases of idiopathic VT), and the brevity of the transient adenosine effect should be reasonably tolerated hemodynamically. Because close attention to these varying responses may help to diagnose the underlying rhythm, whenever possible, continuous ECG recording is strongly encouraged to provide such written documentation. This documentation can be invaluable in helping to establish a firm rhythm diagnosis even if after the fact. Typically, adenosine is administered in a manner similar to treatment of PSVT: as a 6 mg rapid IV push; providers may follow the first dose with a 12 mg bolus and a second 12 mg bolus if the rate fails to convert. When adenosine is given for undifferentiated wide-complex tachycardia, a defibrillator should be available.\n\n【12】Depending on the underlying rhythm, the response to adenosine challenge can be variable. Some studies 408–412 showed that adenosine converted an undifferentiated wide-complex tachycardia to sinus rhythm. Another study 413 showed poor rates of conversion to sinus rhythm in patients known to have VT. The following adverse effects were reported in patients with preexcited atrial fibrillation treated with adenosine: conversion to atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response in one patient later found to have preexcitation, conversion to VF in one patient with known WPW, 414 conversion to VF in 4 patients with pre-excited atrial fibrillation, 415 conversion to VF in 2 patients with WPW, 416 and a single case of VF in a patient with VT.删除2:<u> 417 </u>Verapamil is contraindicated for wide-complex tachycardias unless known to be of supraventricular origin (Class III, LOE B). Adverse effects when the rhythm was due to VT were shown in 5 small case series.删除2:<u> 414–418</u> Profound hypotension was reported in 11 of 25 patients known to have VT treated with verapamil.删除2:<u> 418 </u>For patients who are stable with likely VT, IV antiarrhythmic drugs or elective cardioversion is the preferred treatment strategy. If IV antiarrhythmics are administered, procainamide (Class IIa, LOE B), amiodarone (Class IIb, LOE B), or sotalol (Class IIb, LOE B) can be considered. Procainamide and sotalol should be avoided in patients with prolonged QT.  If one of these antiarrhythmic agents is given, a second agent should not be given without expert consultation (Class III, LOE B). If antiarrhythmic therapy is unsuccessful, cardioversion or expert consultation should be considered (Class IIa, LOE C).\n\n【13】One randomized comparison found procainamide (10 mg/kg) to be superior to lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg) for termination of hemodynamically stable monomorphic VT.删除2:<u> 419 </u>Procainamide can be administered at a rate of 20 to 50 mg/min until the arrhythmia is suppressed, hypotension ensues, QRS duration increases > 50%, or the maximum dose of 17 mg/kg is given. Maintenance infusion is 1 to 4 mg/min. Procainamide should be avoided in patients with prolonged QT and congestive heart failure.\n\n【14】IV sotalol (100 mg IV over 5 minutes) was found to be more effective than lidocaine (100 mg IV over 5 minutes) when administered to patients with spontaneous hemodynamically stable sustained monomorphic VT in a double-blind randomized trial within a hospital setting.删除2:<u> 420 </u>In a separate study of 109 patients with a history of spontaneous and inducible sustained", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "Although antiarrhythmic medications (eg, amiodarone, pro-", "bbox": [73.0, 84.0, 375.0, 99.0]}, {"text": "cainamide, or sotalol) can also be used to treat SVTs, the higher", "bbox": [60.0, 100.0, 375.0, 113.0]}, {"text": "toxicity and risk for proarrhythmia make these medications less", "bbox": [60.0, 115.0, 375.0, 129.0]}, {"text": "desirable alternatives to the described AV nodal blocking agents.", "bbox": [60.0, 131.0, 375.0, 145.0]}, {"text": "A possible exception is in patients with pre-excited atrial", "bbox": [60.0, 147.0, 376.0, 160.0]}, {"text": "arrhythmias; the typical AV nodal blocking drugs are contrain-", "bbox": [60.0, 161.0, 375.0, 175.0]}, {"text": "dicated in these patients and rate control may be achieved with", "bbox": [60.0, 177.0, 376.0, 190.0]}, {"text": "antiarrhythmic medications.

Supplementary oxygen administration may be beneficial as part of first aid for divers with a decompression injury (Class IIb, LOE C 22 ).\n\n【1】## Medical Emergencies\n\n【2】## Breathing Difficulties\n\n【3】The incidence of acute asthma is increasing, especially in urban populations.删除2:<u> 23 </u>Many victims with asthma take a prescribed bronchodilator medication and can self-administer it.删除2:<u> 24 </u>– 26 First aid providers are not expected to make a diagnosis of asthma, but they may assist the victim in using the victim's prescribed bronchodilator medication (Class IIa, LOE B) under the following conditions:\n • The victim states that he or she is having an asthma attack or symptoms associated with a previously diagnosed breathing disorder, and the victim has the prescribed medications or inhaler in his or her possession.\n\n【4】• The victim identifies the medication and is unable to administer it without assistance.删除2:<u> 24</u>\n\n【5】 First aid providers should become familiar with inhalers so that they can assist a victim with an acute asthma attack in using the inhaler.\n\n【6】## Anaphylaxis\n\n【7】Allergies are relatively common, but only a small proportion of people with allergies develop anaphylactic reactions. An anaphylactic reaction is a progressive series of signs and symptoms characterized by swelling, breathing difficulty, an itching rash, and eventually shock, which, if left untreated, may lead to death. Some of these signs and symptoms can also be present in other conditions, and first aid rescuers should not be expected to make a diagnosis of anaphylaxis.删除2:<u> 27–30</u> Older patients who suffer from anaphylactic reactions know their signs and symptoms and many carry a lifesaving epinephrine auto-injector. With proper training, parents can be taught to correctly use an auto-injector to administer epinephrine to their allergic children.删除2:<u> 31 </u>All too often, however, neither the victim nor family members know how to correctly use an auto-injector.删除2:<u> 32–34</u> First aid providers should be familiar with the epinephrine auto-injector so that they can help a victim with an anaphylactic reaction to self-administer it. First aid providers should also know how to administer the auto-injector if the victim is unable to do so, provided that the medication has been prescribed by a physician and state law permits it (Class IIb, LOE B).\n\n【8】In retrospective studies 35 -37 18% to 35% of patients having signs of anaphylaxis required a second dose of epinephrine if symptoms persisted or progressed after the first dose. Because of the difficulty in making a diagnosis of anaphylaxis 27 – 30 , 38 , 39 and the potential harm from epinephrine if the diagnosis is incorrect, 40– 43 first aid providers are advised to seek medical assistance if symptoms persist, rather than routinely administering a second dose of epinephrine. In unusual circumstances, when advanced medical assistance is not available, a second dose of\n\n【9】 epinephrine may be given if symptoms of anaphylaxis persist (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【10】## Seizures\n\n【11】The general principles of first aid management of seizures are to\n\n【12】 • Ensure an open airway.\n . Prevent injury.\n\n【13】 Do not restrain the victim during a seizure. Do not try to open the victim's mouth or try to place any object between the victim's teeth or in the mouth. Restraining the victim may cause musculoskeletal or soft-tissue injury. Placing an object in the victim's mouth may cause dental damage or aspiration (Class IIa, LOE C). It is not unusual for the victim to be unresponsive or confused for a short time after a seizure.\n\n【14】## Chest Discomfort\n\n【15】Because it is very difficult, even for the healthcare professional, to differentiate chest discomfort of cardiac origin from other chest discomfort, the first aid provider should assume that chest discomfort is cardiac until proven otherwise.\n\n【16】Cardiac chest discomfort is often described as \"crushing\" or \"pressing\" and is often accompanied by shortness of breath or perspiration. But cardiac chest discomfort may not have these classical characteristics, especially in women. Call EMS immediately for anyone with chest discomfort. Do not delay and do not try to transport the patient to a healthcare facility yourself.\n\n【17】While waiting for EMS to arrive, the first aid provider may\n\n【18】 encourage the victim to chew 1 adult (not enteric coated) or 2 low-dose \"baby\" aspirin if the patient has no allergy to aspirin or other contraindication to aspirin, such as evidence of a stroke or recent bleeding (Class IIa, LOE A).删除2:<u> 44–46</u>\n\n【19】## Injury Emergencies\n\n【20】## Bleeding\n\n【21】Control of bleeding is a basic skill of first aid and one of the few actions with which a first aid provider can critically influence outcome.\n\n【22】## Direct Pressure\n\n【23】Bleeding is best controlled by applying pressure until bleeding stops 47 – 53 or EMS rescuers arrive (Class I, LOE A). The amount of pressure applied and the time the pressure is held are the most important factors affecting successful control of bleeding. The pressure must be firm, and it must be maintained for a long time. Methods of applying pressure include\n • Manual pressure on gauze or other cloth placed over the bleeding source. If bleeding continues, do not remove the gauze; add more gauze on top and apply more pressure.\n\n【24】• If it is not possible to provide continuous manual pressure, wrap an elastic bandage firmly over gauze to hold it in place with pressure.删除2:<u> 54 </u>– 57", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "(Class IIb, LOE C).

Will GM crops pollinate nearby plants, casting their genes into the wild to create superweeds that grow unchecked? What are the odds that the genetically engineered traits will lose their ability to protect against insects and invasive weeds, leaving GM plants suddenly vulnerable?\n\n【1】## At What Cost To Wildlife?\n\n【2】in 1998 a swiss study provoked widespread worry that Bt plants can inadvertently harm unlucky creatures. In this laboratory experiment, green lacewing caterpillars proved more likely to die after eating European corn-borer caterpillars that had fed on Bt corn instead of regular corn. The flames of fear erupted again a year later, when Cornell University entomologist John Losey and his colleagues reported that they had fed milkweed leaves dusted with Bt corn pollen to monarch butterfly larvae in the lab and that those larvae, too, had died.\n\n【3】\"That was the straw that broke the camel's back,\" says David\n\n【4】 from plots of GM corn, estimating how much of it drifts onto plants such as milkweed and, finally, determining the exposure of butterfly and moth larvae to the protein. Much of that work, done during the 2000 growing season, is slated to be reported to the EPA shortly.\n\n【5】 According to the agency, however, preliminary studies evaluating the two most common Bt corn plants (from Novartis and Monsanto) already indicate that monarch larvae encounter Bt corn pollen on milkweed plants—but at levels too low to be toxic. What is toxic? The EPA estimates that the insects face no observable harm when consuming milkweed leaves laden with up to 150 corn pollen grains per square centimeter of leaf surface. Recent studies of milkweed plants in and around the cornfields of Maryland, Nebraska and Ontario report far lower levels of Bt pollen, ranging from just six to 78 grains of Bt corn pollen per square centimeter of milkweed leaf surface. \"The weight of the evidence suggests Bt corn pollen in the field does not pose a hazard to monarch larvae,\" concludes EPA scientist\n\n【6】## The Weight Of Evidence Suggests That Pollen\nFrom Insect-Resistant Corn Plants In The Field Does Not Pose A Hazard To The Larvae Of Monarch Butterflies. But The Jury Is Still Out.\n\n【7】Pimentel, also an entomologist at Cornell. Suddenly, all eyes turned to the organisms munching GM plant leaves, nipping modified pollen or wriggling around in the soil below the plants—organisms that play vital roles in sustaining plant populations. Another alarming study relating to monarch butterflies appeared last August.\n\n【8】But the lab bench is not a farm field, and many scientists question the usefulness of these early experiments. The lab insects, they note, consumed far higher doses of Bt toxin than they would outside, in the real world. So researchers have headed into nature themselves, measuring the toxin in pollen\n\n【9】 Zigfridas Vaituzis, who heads the agency's team studying the ecological effects of Bt crops.\n\n【10】But the jury is still out. \"There's not much evidence to weigh,\" notes Jane Rissler of the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n\n【11】\"This issue of nontarget effects is just a black hole, and EPA has very little good data at this point to conclude whether the monarch butterfly problem is real, particularly in the long term.\" In an EPA meeting on GM crops last fall, Vaituzis acknowledged the lack of long-term data on Bt crops and insect populations. Such studies \"require more time than has been available since the registration of Bt crops,\" Vaituzis remarked. The EPA ,\n\n【12】## Three Worries\n\n【13】INNOCENT CREATURES\n\n【14】 WILL BE HURT by insecticides\n\n【15】 built into many GM crops.\n\n【16】 What the research says: Laboratory studies indicate that nontarget insects, such as monarch butterflies, could be harmed, but field studies suggest that the risk is small.\n\n【17】 as genes that give crops the ability to kill insect pests or to withstand herbicides find their way into weeds.\n\n【18】What the research says: Studies have found no superweeds, but anecdotal reports have surfaced. Because pollen from GM plants can often fertilize weedy relatives of those plants, GM crops should not be grown near such relatives.\n\n【19】 3 GM CROPS WILL SUDDENLY FAIL because insect pests will evolve tolerance to built-in insecticides and because weeds will evolve immunity to herbicides sprayed over fields of herbicide-tolerant GM plants.\n\n【20】 What the research says: No failures have been documented, but they are likely to occur.

The definition states: \"Occupational asthma is a disease characterized by variable air flow limitation and/or airway hyperresponsiveness due to causes and conditions attributable to a particular occupational environment and not to stimuli encountered outside the workplace.\"\n\n【1】 There are two general types of true occupational asthma (OA). Experts have classified the two types as \"asthma with latency\" and \"asthma without latency.\" The first type of OA is asthma that develops over time, caused by repeated inhalation of sensitizing work exposures to a specific substance, usually a large protein. Examples of sensitizing agents include formaldehyde, mineral dusts, animal proteins, flours, and grains. More that 250 different workplace substances have been reported to cause occupational asthma.\n\n【2】Many different manufacturing industries are involved, from baking, to veterinary work, to paint and circuit board production. Interestingly, not all workers in a certain industry and with clear-cut exposure actually go on to develop asthma. Studies suggest that atopy and cigarette smoking may predispose some persons to the development of occupational asthma. The second, more unusual type of OA involves the emergence of \"new\" asthma after a single, intense, and often dramatic exposure to potent respiratory irritants, such as bleach, chlorine gas, or strong acids, for example.\n\n【3】Chemical spills and workplace accidents are often implicated. The term \"RADS\" was coined by Dr. Stuart M. Brooks and his co-workers in 1985.

Unwitting insects or the right wind might carry GM crop pollen to weedy plant relatives, fertilizing them. And if that happens, the newly endowed plants could break ecological rank, becoming \"superweeds\" that are unusually resistant to eradication by natural predators or pesticides. Scientists have stopped asking if such gene flow is possible. \"In many cases,\" says Cornell ecologist Allison Power, \"we know gene flow will occur. The question now is, What will the consequences be?\" So far no scientific studies have found evidence of GM crops causing superweeds, and a 10-year study reported in Nature in February found no weedlike behavior by GM potatoes, beets, corn or canola planted in England. But worrisome anecdotes have appeared. Canadian farmers, in particular, have described GM canola escaping from farm fields and invading wheat crops like a weed. This canola also resisted pesticide sprays.\n\n【3】Power's studies of gene flow from virus-resistant GM plants give further reason for precaution. For now, virus-resistant crops stake a small share of the GM landscape, but they are likely to become more prevalent, particularly in the developing world. Power investigates gene flow in cultivated grain crops— wheat, barley and oats—engineered to contain genes that make the plants resistant to the barley yellow dwarf virus (which\n\n【4】 damages some 100 grass species). These GM grain crops could be on the market within the next decade.\n\n【5】Power's work, carried out in the laboratory, indicates that wild oats—a weedy relative of cultivated oats—can \"catch\" the genes conferring resistance to barley yellow dwarf virus. If that happened in the field, she says, wild oats might run amok in the western U.S., outcompeting native grasses with kudzu-like intensity. Every GM crop, Power cautions, brings its own environmental personality and its own risks.\n\n【6】In the U.S., at least, landscape logistics make it rather unlikely that herbicide-tolerant or Bt crops will spread their biotech genes to weeds. That's because the GM crops sown in this country have no close relatives in the regions where they grow; most plants can pollinate others only if the recipients and the donors have certain features in common, such as the same chromosome number, life cycle or preferred habitat. A known exception to the \"no relatives\" rule in the U.S. is wild cotton growing in Hawaii and southern Florida, which, by virtue of its unusual similarity to GM cotton, can accept the GM pollen. To separate the wild and biotech plants from each other, the EPA has ordered companies not to sell GM cotton south of Florida's Interstate 60 or in Hawaii.\n\n【7】But it may prove harder to avoid creating superweeds outside North America, where weedy relatives of cultivated crops are common. Wild cotton, for instance, creeps past the Florida Keys, across the Gulf of Mexico and into Mexico. In South America, a weedy corn relative, teosinte, dresses the edges of domesticated cornfields.

Bronchoscopy is said to be \"diagnostic\" when it is carried out to assist physicians in investigating a lung abnormality. A bronchoscopy is \"therapeutic\" when performed to remove excess lung secretions or to retrieve aspirated (inhaled) foreign bodies. There are two types of bronchoscopes (the instruments used to perform bronchoscopy): flexible bronchoscopes and rigid bronchoscopes.\n\n【3】 Flexible bronchoscopy is also called flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy, or FOB.

The bronchoscopist passes the bronchoscope instrument (or scope, for short) through the nose or the mouth, through the vocal cords, and into the trachea. From there, the bronchoscopist can enter and visually inspect the main bronchi and all narrower divisions. The scope enters the lung passages the same way air does. The scope has a light at its tip, as well as a channel, through which the bronchoscopist can inject local numbing medication, pass biopsy tweezers, and suck up any secretions.

Molly, who was then eight years old, suffered from a potentially fatal genetic blood disorder known as Fanconi anemia. But what made the procedure particularly unusual was that Adam might not have been born had his sister not been sick. He was conceived through in vitro fertilization, and physicians specifically selected his embryo from a group of others for implantation into his mother's womb after tests showed that he would not have the disease and that he would be the best tissue match for Molly.\n\n【3】Was this ethically appropriate? A panel of bioethicists decided that it was, because donating cord blood would have no effect on Adam's health.\n\n【4】Selectively conceiving a potential donor is only one of the myriad ethical issues surrounding umbilical cord blood transplantation. One of the most significant has to do not with how the blood is used but with the marketing campaigns aimed at prospective parents by for-profit companies that offer to collect and store a baby's cord blood—for a hefty fee—in case he or she might need it later.\n\n【5】Such companies market cord blood collection as \"biological insurance\" to expectant parents. But \"the odds are so extraordinarily against their child's ever needing it,\" says Paul Root Wolpe, a fellow at the University of Pennsylvania Health System Center for Bioethics. He fears that parents who can scarcely afford the service might feel impelled to buy it even though their families have no history of blood disorders.\n\n【6】Viacord, a cord blood–preserving company based in Boston, says that just five of their 6,500 clients have so far needed infusions of their stored cord blood. Moreover, only 20 percent have a family history of a blood disorder or are now in treatment.\n\n【7】The American Academy of Pediatrics issued a policy statement on umbilical cord blood banking in July 1999 cautioning that \"it is difficult to recommend that parents store their children's cord blood for future use\" unless a family member has had a blood disorder. Instead it encouraged parents to donate their baby's cord blood to public banks.\n\n【8】Questions have been raised in the past concerning the ownership of cord blood. But bioethicist Jeremy Sugarman of Duke University states that it is now fairly clear that although an infant owns his or her own cord blood, parents have legal guardianship over it—just as they do over the child—until he or she reaches age 18. Sugarman and Wolpe contributed to a 1997 consensus statement on the ethics of umbilical cord blood banking in the Journal of the American Medical Association .\n\n【9】Sugarman adds that it is perfectly appropriate for a parent to use one sibling's cord blood to treat another. If the first child develops a need for a transplantation later on, the fact that the parents already used his or her stored blood is unfortunate but not unethical.\n\n【10】Of more concern is how to ensure the safety of cord blood donated to cord banks.\n\n【11】What happens if parents donate a newborn's cord blood to a public bank and the child develops leukemia years later? If the donated blood has no identifying information to link it to the donor, there would be no way to prevent it from being used in another child. Stem cells in the umbilical cord blood of a child who later gets leukemia could also cause leukemia in a recipient. But keeping permanent records of donors carries privacy risks: What if the blood is transplanted into a recipient but doesn't take, and the sick child's parents want to track down the donor child for bone marrow cells?\n\n【12】Most public cord blood banks label samples so they can be linked to a particular donor for several years, at which time they destroy the identifying information. Wolpe says that this is a good trade-off but that risks will always be associated with donor cord blood, just as they are with donor adult blood. \"You try to keep it as safe as you can,\" he says, \"but people take a chance.\" — Carol Ezzell, staff writer\n\n【13】 ing sprung from the donor's stem cells.\n\n【14】But it took years for other physicians to recognize the potential of umbilical cord blood transplantation. In 1989 Hal E. Broxmeyer of the Indiana University School of Medicine, Edward A. Boyse of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City and their colleagues revived interest in the technique by showing that human cord blood contains as many stem cells as bone marrow does. That same year Broxmeyer, Eliane Gluckman of  Saint- Louis Hospital in Paris and their co-workers reported curing Fanconi anemia—a potentially fatal genetic disorder— in a five-year-old boy using blood from his baby sister's umbilical cord. Since then, approximately 75 percent of umbilical cord blood transplants have used cord blood from a nonrelative obtained from cord blood storage programs.\n\n【15】## What’S Bred In The Bone\n\n【16】UMBILICAL CORD BLOOD transplantation aims to obtain a source of stem cells that is the best possible match for a particular patient's tissue type. Tissue type is determined by a set of genes that make proteins called human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), which are found on the surfaces of all body cells. The immune system recognizes cells bearing the HLA proteins it has encountered since birth as normal, or belonging to the \"self.\" Any other HLA proteins are regarded as \"nonself,\" or foreign; cells carrying them are quickly killed.\n\n【17】There are six major HLA genes. Every person has two copies, or alleles, of each— one from each parent. (Each allele can come in more than 30 different types.) For bone marrow transplants, physicians aim to match the six alleles (of the total 12) that are most clinically relevant in transplantation. But because cord blood cells are immunologically different from bone marrow cells, doctors can use donor cord blood samples that match five—or even three—HLA alleles.\n\n【18】The genetic blueprints for making HLA proteins are found on chromosome 6. The rules of genetics dictate that the probability that two siblings will inherit the same maternal and paternal chromosome 6—and will therefore be good tissue-type matches—is only 25 percent.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "But Is It Ethical?", "bbox": [65.0, 105.0, 285.0, 140.0]}, {"text": "Marketing tactics and privacy issues raise eyebrows", "bbox": [65.0, 140.0, 334.0, 159.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [64.0, 104.0, 333.0, 158.0], "position": 0}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "LAST SEPTEMBER a little girl from California named Molly received a lifesaving", "bbox": [64.0, 164.0, 429.0, 186.0]}, {"text": "transplant of umbilical cord blood from her newborn brother, Adam.

However, in 2 randomized controlled trials, 14. 15 a period of 1 ½ to 3 minutes of CPR by EMS personnel before defibrillation did not improve ROSC or survival to hospital discharge in patients with out-of-hospital VF or pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT) compared with immediate defibrillation, regardless of EMS response interval, in systems with low overall survival. In 1 retrospective before/after study, 16 immediate CPR by EMS personnel was associated with no significant difference in survival to discharge but significantly improved neurological status at 30 days or 1 year compared with immediate defibrillation in patients with out-of-hospital VF. In a retrospective observational study, 17 probability of survival was increased if chest compressions were performed during a higher proportion of the initial CPR period as compared to a lower proportion.\n\n【1】When VF is present for more than a few minutes, the myocardium is depleted of oxygen and metabolic substrates. A brief period of chest compressions can deliver oxygen and energy substrates, increasing the likelihood that a shock may terminate VF (defibrillation) and a perfusing rhythm will retum (ie, ROSC).删除2:<u> 18 </u>When an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is not witnessed by EMS personnel, EMS may initiate CPR while checking the ECG rhythm and preparing for defibrillation. There is insufficient evidence to determine if 1 ½ to 3 minutes of CPR should be provided prior to defibrillation. CPR should be performed while a defibrillator is being readied (Class I, LOE B). One cycle of CPR consists of 30 compressions and 2 breaths. When compressions are delivered at a rate of about 100 per minute, 5 cycles of CPR should take roughly 2 minutes (range: about 1 ½ to 3 minutes).\n\n【2】EMS system medical directors may consider implementing\n\n【3】 a protocol that allows EMS responders to provide CPR while preparing for defibrillation of patients found by EMS personnel to be in VF. In practice, however, CPR can be initiated while the AED is being readied.\n\n【4】With in-hospital SCA, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute CPR before defibrillation. However, in monitored patients, the time from VF to defibrillation should be under 3 minutes. When 2 or more rescuers are present, one rescuer should begin CPR while the other activates the emergency response system and prepares the defibrillator.\n\n【5】## 1-Shock Protocol Versus 3-Shock Sequence\n\n【6】At the time of the 2010 Consensus Conference, there were 2 new published human studies that compared a 1-shock protocol versus a 3-stacked-shock protocol for treatment of VF cardiac arrest. Evidence from these 2 well-conducted pre/post design 19.20 studies suggested significant survival benefit with the singleshock defibrillation protocol compared with 3-stacked-shock protocols. If 1 shock fails to eliminate VF, the incremental benefit of another shock is low, and resumption of CPR is likely to confer a greater value than another shock. This fact, combined with the data from animal studies documenting harmful effects from interruptions to chest compressions and human studies suggesting a survival benefit with a 1-shock protocol, indicate that it is reasonable to use 1-shock for VF, then immediate CPR (Class IIa, LOE B).\n\n【7】First-shock efficacy for biphasic shocks is comparable or better than 3 monophasic shocks.删除2:<u> 21–25</u> Although the optimal\n\n【8】 energy level for defibrillation using any of the monophasic or biphasic waveforms has not been determined, a recommendation for higher initial energy when using a monophasic waveform was weighed by expert consensus with consideration of the potential negative effects of a high first-shock energy versus the negative effects of prolonged VF.  The consensus was that rescuers using monophasic defibrillators should give an initial shock of 360 J; if VF persists after the first shock, second and subsequent shocks of 360 J should be given. This single dose for monophasic shocks is designed to simplify instructions to rescuers but is not a mandate to recall monophasic AEDs for reprogramming. If the monophasic AED being used is programmed to deliver a different first or subsequent dose, that dose is acceptable.\n\n【9】After shock delivery, the rescuer should not delay resumption of chest compressions to recheck the rhythm or pulse. After about 5 cycles of CPR (about 2 minutes, although this time is not firm), ideally ending with compressions, the AED should then analyze the cardiac rhythm and deliver another shock if indicated (Class I, LOE B). If a nonshockable rhythm is detected, the AED should instruct the rescuer to resume CPR immediately, beginning with chest compressions (Class I, LOE B).\n\n【10】Concern that chest compressions in the presence of a postshock organized rhythm might provoke recurrent VF has been expressed by 1 animal and 2 human studies, 26–28 but this has not been shown to adversely affect survival if the current algorithms are followed.删除2:<u> 19,20</u> Furthermore, in animal studies, frequent or long interruptions in precordial chest compressions for rhythm analysis 29 or rescue breathing 30.31 were associated with postresuscitation myocardial dysfunction and reduced survival rates. Data from a prospective observational study showed that interruption in chest compressions is associated with a decreased probability of successful conversion of VF to a perfusing rhythm after shock.删除2:<u> 32 </u>In a recent clinical observational study of out-of-hospital CPR 33 and an inhospital study of CPR 34 by healthcare providers, chest compressions were performed only for 51% 33 to 76% 34 of total CPR time.\n\n【11】The rhythm analysis for a 3-shock sequence performed by commercially available AEDs can result in delays of up to 37 seconds between delivery of the first shock and delivery of the first postshock compression.删除2:<u> 29 </u>This delay is difficult to justify in light of the first-shock efficacy of > 90% reported by current biphasic defibrillators.删除2:<u> 28 </u>, 35 – 39 AED manufacturers should seek innovative methods to decrease the amount of time chest compressions are interrupted for AED operation. Training materials for lay rescuers should emphasize the importance of continued CPR until basic or advanced life support personnel take over CPR or the victim begins to move.\n\n【12】Shortening the interval between the last compression and the shock by even a few seconds can improve shock success (defibrillation and ROSC).删除2:<u> 18,32,40</u> Thus, it is reasonable for healthcare providers to practice efficient coordination between CPR and defibrillation to minimize the hands-off interval between stopping compression and administering shock (Class IIa, LOE C). For example, when 2 rescuers are present, the rescuer operating the AED should be prepared to deliver a shock as soon as the compressor removes his or her hands from the victim's chest and all rescuers are \"clear\" of contact with the victim.

When prehospital providers are trained in the use of advanced supraglottic airways such as the esophageal-tracheal tube, laryngeal tube, and the laryngeal mask airway, they appear to be able to use these devices safely and can provide ventilation that is as effective as that provided with a bag and mask or an endotracheal tube.删除2:<u> 12,35</u> – 41 Advanced airway interventions are technically complicated. Failure can occur; thus maintenance of skills through frequent experience or practice is essential.删除2:<u> 42 </u>It is important to remember that there is no evidence that advanced airway measures improve survival rates in the setting of out-ofhospital cardiac arrest. During CPR performed by providers trained in its use, the supraglottic airway is a reasonable alternative to bag-mask ventilation (Class IIa, LOE B) and endotracheal intubation (Class IIa, LOE A).\n\n【1】 Esophageal-Tracheal Tube The advantages of the esophageal-tracheal tube (Combitube) are similar to the advantages of the endotracheal tube when either is compared with bag-mask ventilation: isolation of the airway, reduced risk of aspiration, and more reliable ventilation. The advantages of the esophageal-tracheal tube over the endotracheal tube are related chiefly to ease of training.删除2:<u> 12.43</u> Ventilation and oxygenation with the esophageal-tracheal tube compare favorably with those achieved with the endotracheal tube.删除2:<u> 44 </u>In several controlled clinical trials involving both inhospital and out-of-hospital resuscitation of adults, providers with all levels of experience were able to insert the esophageal-tracheal tube and deliver ventilation comparable to that achieved with endotracheal intubation.删除2:<u> 35 </u>.删除2:<u> 45 </u>– 48 In a retrospective study no difference in outcome was observed in patients treated with the esophageal-tracheal tube compared with those treated with endotracheal intubation.删除2:<u> 38 </u>The esophageal-tracheal tube is reported to provide successful ventilation during CPR in 62% to 100% of patients.删除2:<u> 35,45–49</u> For healthcare professionals trained in its use, the esophagealtracheal tube is an acceptable alternative to both bag-mask ventilation (Class IIa, LOE C) or endotracheal intubation (Class IIa, LOE A) for airway management in cardiac arrest.\n\n【2】Fatal complications may occur with use of the esophagealtracheal tube if the position of the distal lumen of the esophageal-tracheal tube in the esophagus or trachea is identified incorrectly. For this reason, confirmation of tube placement is essential. Other possible complications related to the use of the esophageal-tracheal tube are esophageal trauma, including lacerations, bruising, and subcutaneous emphysema.删除2:<u> 45</u>, 50, 51 Laryngeal Tube\n\n【3】 The advantages of the laryngeal tube (Laryngeal Tube or King LT) are similar to those of the esophageal-tracheal tube; however, the laryngeal tube is more compact and less complicated to insert (unlike the esophageal-tracheal tube, the laryngeal tube can only go into the esophagus). At this time there are limited data published on the use of the laryngeal tube in cardiac arrest.删除2:<u> 40,41</u> ,52 ,53 In one case series assessing 40 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients, insertion of the laryngeal tube by trained paramedics was successful and ventilation was effective in 85% of patients.删除2:<u> 41 </u>For 3 patients, ventilation was ineffective because of cuff rupture; for 3 other\n\n【4】 patients, ventilation was ineffective because of massive regurgitation and aspiration before laryngeal tube placement.\n\n【5】Another out-of-hospital assessment of 157 attempts at laryngeal tube placement revealed a 97% success rate in a mixed population of cardiac arrest and noncardiac arrest patients.删除2:<u> 40 </u>For healthcare professionals trained in its use, the laryngeal tube may be considered as an alternative to bag-mask ventilation (Class IIb, LOE C) or endotracheal intubation for airway management in cardiac arrest (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【6】 Laryngeal Mask Airway The laryngeal mask airway provides a more secure and reliable means of ventilation than the face mask.删除2:<u> 54,55</u> Although the laryngeal mask airway does not ensure absolute protection against aspiration, studies have shown that regurgitation is less likely with the laryngeal mask airway than with the bag-mask device and that aspiration is uncommon. When compared with the endotracheal tube, the laryngeal mask airway provides equivalent ventilation 49.55 ; successful ventilation during CPR has been reported in 72% to 97% of patients.删除2:<u> 36 </u>, 37 , 44 , 56 – 58 Because insertion of the laryngeal mask airway does not require laryngoscopy and visualization of the vocal cords, training in its placement and use is simpler than that for endotracheal intubation. The laryngeal mask airway also may have advantages over the endotracheal tube when access to the patient is limited, 59.60 there is a possibility of unstable neck injury, 61 or appropriate positioning of the patient for endotracheal intubation is impossible.\n\n【7】Results from studies in anesthetized patients comparing the laryngeal mask airway with endotracheal intubation, as well as additional studies comparing it with other airways or ventilation techniques support the use of the laryngeal mask airway for airway control in a variety of settings by nurses, respiratory therapists, and EMS personnel, many of whom had not previously used this device.删除2:<u> 12 </u>, 39 , 44 , 55 , 62 – 65 After successful insertion, a small proportion of patients cannot be ventilated with the laryngeal mask airway.删除2:<u> 12,44,55</u> With this in mind, it is important for providers to have an alternative strategy for airway management. Providers who insert the laryngeal mask airway should receive adequate initial training and then should practice insertion of the device regularly.\n\n【8】Success rates and the occurrence of complications should be monitored closely. For healthcare professionals trained in its use, the laryngeal mask airway is an acceptable alternative to bagmask ventilation (Class IIa, LOE B) or endotracheal intubation (Class IIa, LOE C) for airway management in cardiac arrest.\n\n【9】## Endotracheal Intubation\n\n【10】The endotracheal tube was once considered the optimal method of managing the airway during cardiac arrest. However, intubation attempts by unskilled providers can produce complications, such as trauma to the oropharynx, interruption of compressions and ventilations for unacceptably long periods, and hypoxemia from prolonged intubation attempts or failure to recognize tube misplacement or displacement. It is now clear that the incidence of complications is unacceptably high when intubation is performed by inexperienced providers or monitoring of tube placement is inadequate.

One small uncontrolled study documented paradoxical slowing of the heart rate and high-degree AV block when atropine was administered to patients after cardiac transplantation.删除2:<u> 369 </u>Avoid relying on atropine in type II second-degree or thirddegree AV block or in patients with third-degree AV block with a new wide-QRS complex where the location of block is likely to be in non-nodal tissue (such as in the bundle of His or more distal conduction system). These bradyarrhythmias are not likely to be responsive to reversal of cholinergic effects by atropine and are preferably treated with TCP or β -adrenergic support as temporizing measures while the patient is prepared for transvenous pacing 删除5:<u>(Figure 3, Box 6 )</u>.</u>\n\n【1】 Pacing TCP may be useful for the treatment of symptomatic bradycardias. There are limited studies comparing TCP with drug therapy for the treatment of symptomatic bradycardia. A randomized controlled trial in which atropine and glycopyrrolate were compared with TCP showed few differences in outcome and survival, although the TCP group obtained a more consistent heart rate.删除2:<u> 363 </u>In a study evaluating the feasibility of treatment with dopamine as compared with TCP, no differences were observed between treatment groups in survival to hospital discharge.删除2:<u> 370 </u>TCP is, at best, a temporizing measure.

Dopamine hydrochloride is a catecholamine with both α - and β -adrenergic actions. It can be titrated to more selectively target heart rate or vasoconstriction. At lower doses dopamine has a more selective effect on inotropy and heart rate; at higher doses (>10 mcg/kg per minute), it also has vasoconstrictive effects. Dopamine infusion may be used for patients with symptomatic bradycardia, particularly if associated with hypotension, in whom atropine may be inappropriate or after atropine fails (Class IIb, LOE B).

Epinephrine is a catecholamine with α - and b -adrenergic actions. Epinephrine infusion may be used for patients with symptomatic bradycardia, particularly if associated with hypotension, for whom atropine may be inappropriate or after atropine fails (Class IIb, LOE B). Begin the infusion at 2 to 10 mcg/min and titrate to patient response. Use of vasoconstrictors requires that the recipient be assessed for adequate intravascular volume and volume status supported as needed.\n\n【7】 Isoproterenol.  Isoproterenol is a β -adrenergic agent with β -1 and β -2 effects, resulting in an increase in heart rate and vasodilation. The recommended adult dose is 2 to 10 mcg/ min by IV infusion, titrated according to heart rate and rhythm response.\n\n【8】## Tachycardia\n\n【9】删除4:<u>This section summarizes the management of a wide variety of tachyarrhythmias.

Mechanical piston devices may be considered for use by properly trained personnel in specific settings for the treatment of adult cardiac arrest in circumstances (eg, during diagnostic and interventional procedures) that make manual resuscitation difficult (Class IIb, LOE C). Rescuers should attempt to limit substantial interruptions in CPR during deployment. The device should be programmed to deliver high-quality CPR, ensuring an adequate compression depth of at least 2 inches (5 cm)—this may require conversion from a percent of chest depth, a rate of at least 100 compressions per minute, and a compression duration of approximately 50% of the cycle length.\n\n【1】## Load-Distributing Band Cpr Or Vest Cpr The Load-Distributing Band (Ldb) Is A Circumferential Chest\n\n【2】compression device composed of a pneumatically or electrically actuated constricting band and backboard.

One multicenter prospective randomized controlled trial 104 , 104 λ comparing LDB-CPR (Autopulse device) to manual CPR for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest demonstrated no improvement in 4-hour survival and worse neurologic outcome when the device was used. These results raised concerns about possible harm with use of this device. Further studies are required to determine whether site-specific factors 105 and experience with deployment of the device106 could influence its efficacy.\n\n【3】The LDB may be considered for use by properly trained personnel in specific settings for the treatment of cardiac arrest (Class IIb, LOE B). However, there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of the LDB in the treatment of cardiac arrest.\n\n【4】## Extracorporeal Techniques And Invasive Perfusion Devices\n\n【5】## Extracorporeal Cpr\n\n【6】For the purpose of these Guidelines, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and cardiopulmonary bypass are considered together as different forms of extracorporeal CPR (ECPR; an alternative term may be extracorporeal life support or ECLS) when either is used for resuscitation for cardiac arrest. Both are sophisticated\n\n【7】 techniques for circulating blood outside the body with or without extracorporeal oxygenation, with the goal of supporting the body's circulation in the absence of an adequately functioning cardiac pump. The initiation of ECPR and the management of a patient on ECPR require highly trained personnel and specialized equipment.\n\n【8】Although there are no data from randomized studies to support the routine use of ECPR, in case series and observational studies the use of ECPR for in-hospital 107 .删除2:<u> 108 </u>and out-of-hospital 109 – 111 cardiac arrest has been associated with improved survival when compared with conventional CPR in patients < 75 years old with potentially correctable conditions. However, supportive studies consisted of small numbers of patients, and some had unbalanced comparison groups with respect to age, witnessed arrest, bystander CPR, and the quality of conventional CPR.\n\n【9】There are no randomized studies that compare ECPR with conventional CPR for patients in cardiac arrest. However, data from several case series have demonstrated the feasibility and safety of ECPR in highly specialized centers.删除2:<u> 108,110,111</u> Observational studies of adults in both the in-hospital 107 and out-of-hospital 109 settings have demonstrated an association between ECPR use and improved survival when compared with conventional CPR in patients with potentially correctable conditions. These studies had small numbers of patients, and some had unbalanced comparison groups with respect to age, witness status, bystander CPR, and the quality of conventional CPR. Please refer to the Pediatrics section for discussion and specific recommendations related to the pediatric population (See Part 14: \"Pediatric Advanced Life Support\").\n\n【10】There is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine\n\n【11】 use of ECPR for patients in cardiac arrest. However, in settings where ECPR is readily available, it may be considered when the time without blood flow is brief and the condition leading to the cardiac arrest is reversible (eg, accidental hypothermia drug intoxication) or amenable to heart transplantation (eg, myocarditis) or revascularization (eg, acute myocardial infarction) (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【12】## Summary\n\n【13】A variety of CPR techniques and devices may improve hemodynamics or short-term survival when used by welltrained providers in selected patients. All of these techniques and devices have the potential to delay chest compressions and defibrillation. In order to prevent delays and maximize efficiency, initial training, ongoing monitoring, and retraining programs should be offered to providers on a frequent and ongoing basis.

The Standard Model predicts that the muon's magnetic moment will precess at a certain rate, called g −2 (\" g minus two\"). (The value g isn't exactly 2 because, thanks to the uncertainty principle, particles and forces briefly pop into existence and affect the muons.) But using measurements 5.6 times more precise than ever before, researchers calculated that g − 2 exceeds the value predicted by the Standard Model by about four parts per million. A 1 percent chance remains that the finding is merely a statistical fluke, but many researchers think it is evidence of long-sought new physics beyond the Standard Model, such as supersymmetry.

In a study published in the February 8 Nature , Seth Bordenstein and his colleagues at the University of Rochester wrote that a parasitic bacterium, Wolbachia pipientis , prevented two closely related species of wasps (genus Nasonia ) from producing hybrid offspring—it rendered the sperm of one species incompatible with the eggs of the other. Wasps treated with bacteria-killing antibiotics could interbreed freely, and none of the offspring exhibited the genetic defects that indirectly cause speciation, such as those that produce sterility or death. Infection with Wolbachia therefore probably preceded other barriers to reproduction between these closeand ly related wasp species.\n\n【8】—Alison McCook\n\n【9】## Astrochemistry\n\n【10】## Heavenly Seeds\n\n【11】Did life on the earth originate from molecules deposited by meteorites or comets? In the January 30 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers report experimenting with a mixture of simple compounds known to exist in interstellar space: water, methanol, ammonia and carbon monoxide. The scientists mimicked a space environment by freezing the mixture to temperatures close to absolute zero, then exposing it to harsh ultraviolet radiation. The procedure produced an oily residue composed of hundreds of complex organic molecules.\n\n【12】Even more striking, when immersed in water the organic molecules in the residue formed tiny hollow droplets that resembled cell membranes. Although the droplets themselves are far from being alive, similar structures could have been precursors of the first primitive life-forms.\n\n【13】-Mark Alpert\n\n【14】删除11:<u>删除10:<u>## Www.</u>Sciam删除10:<u>.Com</u></u>\n\n【15】The first analysis of the human genome was published in February.

The B-vitamins collectively are included under the list of essential 'micronutrients' and are quite useful in converting proteins and carbohydrates into energy. Also, there is a strong link between the B-vitamins, i.e. B-1, B-6, B-12 and cell repair.\n\n【7】 You can get B-vitamins by consuming enriched whole grains, dark green vegetables, nuts, and most meat and dairy products. It is a good idea to talk about your specific vitamin B requirements with your healthcare provider before adding any multi-vitamins or supplements to your diet.\n\n【8】 A study held at Oregon State University concluded that athletes who lack B- vitamins in their diet are unable to repair damaged cells and muscles at the same pace as their peers who consume a diet rich in vitamin B. Even a minor vitamin B deficiency can result in reduced performance and poor muscle recovery.\n\n【9】 Adding B-vitamins to your diet can help speed up recovery and ease the symptoms of facial paralysis.\n\n【10】## Vitamin B-12\n\n【11】Vitamin B-12 plays a vital role in the maintenance of various physiological functions.

In the bustling community of Puerto San Carlos, a mature turtle is worth $50 to $200.

They confirm the activity when the processing patterns seen on human remains match those seen on the bones of other animals consumed for food. Archaeologists have long argued for such a comparison between human and faunal remains at a site. They reason that damage to animal bones and their arrangement can clearly show that the animals had been slaughtered and eaten for food. And when human remains are unearthed in similar cultural contexts, with similar patterns of damage, discard and preservation, they may reasonably be interpreted as evidence of cannibalism.\n\n【1】When one mammal eats another, it usually leaves a record of its activities in the form of modifications to the consumed animal's skeleton. During life, varying amounts of soft tissue, much of it with nutritive value, cover mammalian bones. When the tissue is removed and prepared, the bones often retain a record of this processing in the form of gnawing marks and fractures. When humans eat\n\n【2】 ence of cannibalism is strengthened. Judging which patterns are consistent with dietary butchery can be based on the associated archaeological record—particularly the nonhuman food-animal remains discovered in sites formed by the same culture—and checked against predictions embedded in ethnohistorical accounts.\n\n【3】This comparative system of determining cannibalism emphasizes multiple lines of osteological damage and contextual evidence. And, as noted earlier, it sets the standard for recognizing cannibalism very high. With this approach, for instance, the presence of cut marks on bones would not by themselves be considered evidence of cannibalism. For example, an American Civil War cemetery would contain skeletal remains with cut marks made by bayonets and swords, but this would not constitute evidence of cannibalism. Medical school cadavers are dissected, their bones cut-marked, but cannibalism is not part of this ritual.\n\n【4】With the threshold set so conservatively, most instances of past cannibalism will necessarily go unrecognized. A prac-\n\n【5】 tice from Papua New Guinea, where cannibalism was recorded ethnographically, illustrates this point. There skulls of the deceased were carefully cleaned and the brains removed. The dry, mostly intact skulls were then handled extensively, often creating a polish on their projecting parts. They were sometimes painted and even mounted on poles for display and worship. Soft tissue, including brain matter, was eaten at the beginning of this process; thus, the practice would be identified as ritual cannibalism. If such skulls were encountered in an archaeological context without modern informants describing the cannibalism, they would not constitute direct evidence for cannibalism under the stringent criteria that my colleagues and I advocate.\n\n【6】Nevertheless, adoption of these standards of evidence has led us to some clear determinations in other, older situations.\n\n【7】The best indication of prehistoric cannibalism now comes from the archaeological record of the American Southwest, where archaeologists have interpreted dozens of assemblages of human remains\n\n【8】## One Of The Challenges Facing Archaeologists Is The Amazing Variety Of Ways In Which People Dispose Of Their Dead.\n\n【9】other animals, however, they mark bones with more than just their teeth. They process carcasses with tools of stone or metal. In so doing, they leave imprints of their presence and actions in the form of scars on the bones. These same imprints can be seen on butchered human skeletal remains.\n\n【10】The key to recognizing human cannibalism is to identify the patterns of processing—that is, the cut marks, hammering damage, fractures or burns seen on the remains—as well as the survival of different bones and parts of bones. Nutritionally valuable tissues, such as brains and marrow, reside within the bones and can be removed only with forceful hammering—and such forced entry leaves revealing patterns of bone damage. When human bones from archaeological sites show patterns of damage uniquely linked to butchery by other humans, the infer-\n\n【11】## Chopping\n\n【12】Hack marks visible on the left side of this fragment of a human tibia are testament to the removal of muscle and tendon. Tools were also used to make finer slices, to remove tissue or to sever heads from bodies.\n\n【13】Archaeologists have to be careful in their interpretations, however, because humans process their dead in many ways; not all slice or hack marks indicate cannibalism.\n\n【14】##", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "Consequently, scientists have set the", "bbox": [63.0, 86.0, 261.0, 101.0]}, {"text": "standard for recognizing ancient canni-", "bbox": [44.0, 104.0, 261.0, 117.0]}, {"text": "balism very high.

{"seq_id": "4897604c-0aed-4487-bd31-04281a6ebab5", "title": null, "text": "【0】页码:281\n## Pain In Orthodontics\n\n【1】One of the major concerns of our patients when they begin orthodontic treatment is pain, for this reason we must know the etiology, pathogenesis and possible solutions to this problem. Some of the most frequent questions are: ¿Does orthodontic treatment hurt? ¿Why does dental movement hurt? ¿How long will the pain last? ¿How can we eliminate pain during treatment? We will try to explain this as easily as possible and without complications.\n\n【2】 Teeth are bound to the alveolar bone through the peri删除16:<u>¬ </u>odontal insertion, which is composed by the root ce删除16:<u>¬ </u>ment, the periodontal ligament and the alveolar bone.\n\n【3】The cement (completely avascular) is barely modified by orthodontic forces, but all the attention lays on the two other components: the periodontal ligament and the alveolar bone.删除3:<u> (9.27)</u>\n\n【4】 The periodontal ligament occupies a space of 0.5 mm between the alveolar wall and the cement, this ligament is responsible for the dental joint. It is constituted mainly of collagen fibers inserted on one side in the root cement and the other side in alveolar bone. It is mingled with blood vessels, cellular elements, nerve endings and interstitial liquid. Blood vessels are responsible for nutrition of the periodontal ligament and will serve as an access vehicle for the cells responsible for cortical bone and ligament remod删除16:<u>¬ </u>eling. The existing nervous endings will transmit pressure sensation and proprioceptive notion. Periodontal fibers and interstitial liquid together form, an effective shock absorbing and force dissipater system of the physiologic forces applied for a brief period during the orthodontic movement.删除3:<u> (13 , 27 )</u>\n\n【5】 The third and last component of the periodontium is alveo删除16:<u>¬ </u>lar bone that can be divided in two parts: the fasciculated portion (hard laminated portion of bone), that lines the internal surface of the alveolus and the lamellar portion (spongy bone). As in cement, the fasciculated portion receives the insertion of the periodontal fibers. The pro删除16:<u>¬ </u>cess occurs in this manner: when force is applied on the tooth, it moves inside the alveolar socket, this provokes the stretching of some periodontal fibers and the compression of other fibers. At the same time the interstitial liquid of the fibers is also compressed against the osseous walls. As the liquid slowly drains out of the alveolus, it also exerts hydraulic resistance against dental movement. Periodontal fibers and interstitial liquid act in conjunction against the\n\n【6】 forces applied on the tooth, making it return to its original position. It is a paradox, but bone is the most malleable tissue of the human body, adapting to the forces that act upon it. It reacts by depositing osseous tissue in the areas exposed to traction forces and to absorb osseous tissue in areas where pressure is exerted. Orthodontic movement is only possible because of this malleability. This way, the root gets even closer to the alveolar wall, compressing the peri删除16:<u>¬ </u>odontal ligament on the side where the force is applied and stretching the fibers on the opposite side. Osteoclasts are responsible for cortical alveolar resorption where ligament compression occurs. In the phase where ligament disten删除16:<u>¬ </u>sion occurs, osteoblasts and fibroblasts, the cells that form bone tissue and collagen fibers are present. Clinically, this period is characterized by moderate pain in teeth submit删除16:<u>¬ </u>ted to pressure but without movement. Around two days after the force is applied, osteoclasts and osteoblasts initiate the remodeling process. Slowly the alveolus dislocates in the direction of the applied force, with the sub sequential orthodontic movement.删除3:<u> (27)</u>\n\n【7】 ¿What happens at cellular level? The tissue response is similar to an inflammatory process, in which histamine is liberated by the mastocytes of the attacked region. This histamine has immediate action over the blood vessels of the periodontal ligament provoking vasodilatation and opens spaces between endotelial cells that conform the walls provoking a permeability increase (this first local re删除16:<u>¬ </u>action is called immediate response); later, prostaglandins are produced which increase vasodilatation and vascular permeability. Due to this increase of permeability mono删除16:<u>¬ </u>cytes come out of the interior of the blood vessels and they fuse and convert into multinuclear cells called osteo删除16:<u>¬ </u>clasts, which are responsible for resorption of the alveolar cortical bone in which the ligament is being pressed . On the other hand, in the region with periodontal ligament tension undifferentiated mesenchyma cells transform into osteoblast and fibroblasts that form osseous tissue and collagen fibers respectively. Clinically this period is characterized by a slight or moderate dental pain without tooth movement. All this happens from the first seconds the orthodontic force is applied till the second day (the first 24-48 hours).删除3:<u> (9.19,27)</u>\n\n【8】 On the third day, the osteoblasts and the osteoclasts initi删除16:<u>¬ </u>ate the bone remodeling process, with apposition on the periodontal fiber tension side and resorption on the osseous side compressed by the ligaments. In this moment, the tooth begins to move in the direction of the applied force and pain disappears.删除3:<u> ( 27 )</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "Pain in orthodontics", "bbox": [62.0, 92.0, 215.0, 109.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [61.0, 91.0, 214.0, 108.0], "position": 2}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "One of the major concerns of our patients when they begin", "bbox": [62.0, 135.0, 376.0, 152.0]}, {"text": "orthodontic treatment is pain, for this reason we must", "bbox": [62.0, 153.0, 376.0, 169.0]}, {"text": "know the etiology, pathogenesis and possible solutions to", "bbox": [61.0, 169.0, 376.0, 188.0]}, {"text": "this problem.

Severe hypokalemia will alter cardiac tissue excitability and conduction. Hypokalemia can produce ECG changes such as U waves, T-wave flattening, and arrhythmias (especially if the patient is taking digoxin), particularly ventricular arrhythmias, 205 , 206 which, if left untreated, deteriorate to PEA or asystole.\n\n【4】Several studies reported an association with hypokalemia and development of ventricular fibrillation, 207–210 whereas a single animal study reported that hypokalemia lowered the ventricular fibrillation threshold.删除2:<u> 211 </u>However, the management of hypokalemia in the setting of cardiotoxicity, specifically torsades de\n\n【5】 pointes, is largely based on historical case reports that report slow infusion of potassium over hours.删除2:<u> 212 </u>The effect of bolus administration of potassium for cardiac arrest suspected to be secondary to hypokalemia is unknown and ill advised (Class III, LOE C).\n\n【6】## Sodium (Na + )\n\n【7】Sodium is the major intravascular ion that influences serum osmolality. Sodium abnormalities are unlikely to lead to cardiac arrest, and there are no specific recommendations for either checking or treating sodium during cardiac arrest. Disturbances in sodium level are unlikely to be the primary cause of severe cardiovascular instability.\n\n【8】## Magnesium (Mg ++ )\n\n【9】Magnesium is an essential electrolyte and an important cofactor for multiple enzymes, including ATPase. Magnesium is necessary for the movement of sodium, potassium, and calcium into and out of cells and plays an important role in stabilizing excitable membranes. The presence of a low plasma magnesium concentration has been associated with poor prognosis in cardiac arrest patients.删除2:<u> 208 </u>, 213– 216\n\n【10】## Hypermagnesemia\n\n【11】Hypermagnesemia is defined as a serum magnesium concentration > 2.2 mEq/L (normal: 1.3 to 2.2 mEq/L). Neurological symptoms of hypermagnesemia include muscular weakness, paralysis, ataxia, drowsiness, and confusion. Hypermagnesemia can produce vasodilation and hypotension.删除2:<u> 217 </u>Extremely high serum magnesium levels may produce a depressed level of consciousness, bradycardia, cardiac arrhythmias, hypoventilation, and cardiorespiratory arrest.删除2:<u> 208 </u>, 215 , 216\n\n【12】 ACLS Modifications in Management of Cardiac Arrest and Severe Cardiotoxicity Due to Hypermagnesemia Administration of calcium (calcium chloride [10%] 5 to 10 mL or calcium gluconate [10%] 15 to 30 mL IV over 2 to 5 minutes) may be considered during cardiac arrest associated with hypermagnesemia (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【13】## Hypomagnesemia\n\n【14】Hypomagnesemia, defined as a serum magnesium concentration < 1.3 mEq/L, is far more common than hypermagnesemia.\n\n【15】Hypomagnesemia usually results from decreased absorption or increased loss of magnesium from either the kidneys or intestines (diarrhea). Alterations in thyroid hormone function, certain medications (eg, pentamidine, diuretics, alcohol), and malnourishment can also induce hypomagnesemia.\n\n【16】## Acls Modifications In Management Of Cardiac Arrest And Severe Cardiotoxicity Due To Hypomagnesemia\n\n【17】Hypomagnesemia can be associated with polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, including torsades de pointes, a pulseless form (polymorphic) of ventricular tachycardia.

{"seq_id": "91fbe388-1e2d-451a-a836-2a1ceb6ca034", "title": null, "text": "【0】页码:80\n## Several Years Ago A Youth Counselor Told Me About\n\n【1】the dilemma he faced when dealing with violent young men.\n\n【2】His direct impressions simply didn't match what he had been taught. He saw his violent clients as egotists with a grandiose sense of personal superiority and entitlement, but his textbooks told him that these young toughs actually suffered from low self-esteem. He and his staff decided they couldn't go against decades of research, regardless of what they had observed, and so they tried their best to boost the young men's opinions of themselves, even though this produced no discernible reduction in their antisocial tendencies.\n\n【3】The view that aggression stems from low self-esteem has long been common knowledge. Counselors, social workers and teachers all over the country have been persuaded that improving the self-esteem of young people is the key to curbing violent behavior and to encouraging social and academic success. Many schools have students make lists of reasons why they are wonderful people or sing songs of self-celebration.\n\n【4】Many parents and teachers are afraid to criticize kids, lest it cause serious psychological damage and turn some promising youngster into a dangerous thug or pathetic loser. In some sports leagues, everyone gets a trophy.\n\n【5】A number of people have questioned whether these feelgood exercises are really the best way to build self-esteem. But what about the underlying assumption? When my colleagues and I began looking into the matter in the early 1990s, we found article after article citing the \"well- known fact\" that low self-esteem causes violence. Yet we were unable to find any book or paper that offered a formal statement of that theory,\n\n【6】 let alone empirical evidence to support it. Everybody knew it, but nobody had ever proved it.\n\n【7】Unfortunately for the low self-esteem theory, researchers have gradually built up a composite image of what it is like to have low self-esteem, and that image does not mesh well with what we know about aggressive perpetrators. People who have a negative view of themselves are typically muddling through life, trying to avoid embarrassment, giving no sign of a desperate need to prove their superiority. Aggressive attack is risky; people with low self-esteem tend to avoid risks. When people with low self-esteem fail, they usually blame themselves, not others.\n\n【8】Faced with these incongruities, we cast about for an alternative theory. A crucial influence on our thinking was the seemingly lofty self-regard of prominent violent people. Saddam Hussein is not known as a modest, cautious, self-doubting individual. Adolf Hitler's exaltation of the \"master race\" was hardly a slogan of low selfesteem. These examples suggest that self-esteem is indeed an important cause of aggression—high, that is, not low self-esteem.\n\n【9】We eventually formulated our hypothesis in terms of threatened egotism. Not all people who think highly of themselves are prone to violence. That favorable opinion must be combined with some external threat to the opinion. Somebody must question it, dispute it, undermine it. People like to think well of themselves, and so they are loath to make downward revisions in their self-esteem. When someone suggests such a revision, many individuals—those with inflated, tenuous and unstable forms of high self-esteem—prefer to shoot the messenger.\n\n【10】## Pride Comes Before A Fall\n\n【11】it would be foolish to assert that aggression always stems from threatened egotism or that threatened egotism always results in aggression. Human behavior is caused and shaped by various factors. Plenty of aggression has little or nothing to do with how people evaluate themselves. But if our hypothesis is right, inflated self-esteem increases the odds of aggression substantially. For those aggressive acts that do involve the perpetrators' self-regard, we believe that threatened egotism is crucial. Obviously, this new theory could have implications for designing effective methods to reduce violence.\n\n【12】So how does a social psychologist establish whether low or high self-esteem leads to violence? Because there is no perfect, general method for understanding complex questions about human beings, social scientists typically operate by conducting multiple studies with different methods. A single study can be challenged, especially if competing views exist. But when a consistent pattern emerges, the conclusions become hard to ignore.\n\n【13】Researchers measure self-esteem by asking a standardized series of questions, such as \"How well do you get along with other people?\" and \"Are you generally successful in your work or studies?\" The individual chooses from a range of responses,", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "Several years ago a youth counselor told me about", "bbox": [45.0, 501.0, 376.0, 518.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [44.0, 500.0, 375.0, 517.0], "position": 2}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "the dilemma he faced when dealing with violent young men.", "bbox": [44.0, 519.0, 375.0, 533.0]}, {"text": "His direct impressions simply didn't match what he had been", "bbox": [44.0, 535.0, 376.0, 549.0]}, {"text": "taught.

Thus, frequent interruptions of chest compressions prolong the duration of low coronary perfusion pressure and flow.\n\n【7】Manikin studies, 25,69 .删除2:<u> 74 </u>as well as in- and out-of-hospital adult human studies, 33,34,75 have documented long interruptions in chest compressions.

If, within 10 seconds, you don't feel a pulse or are not sure if you feel a pulse, begin chest compressions (Class IIa, LOE C).

Half a dozen vendors, plus in-house departments at major manufacturers, produced $800 million worth in 2000. The market is growing because the interfaces are easy-to-use, durable and inexpensive.\n\n【4】Touch screens employ one of three physics principles for detecting the point of touch. Pressing a \"resistive\" design with a finger or other stylus raises a voltage. In \"capacitive\" models, a finger draws a minute current (this method is often used for cursor pads on notebook computers). In other designs, a finger or stylus interrupts a standing pattern of acoustic waves or infrared lights that blanket the surface.\n\n【5】Resistive screens are the oldest, most widely used and least expensive, and they work with any stylus (finger, pen). Capacitive screens must be touched by a finger or an electrically grounded stylus to conduct current. Wave screens are the newest and most expensive. Surface acoustic wave screens must be touched by a finger or a soft stylus such as a pencil eraser to absorb energy; infrared screens work with any stylus.\n\n【6】The different technologies may be used in the same applications, although pros and cons lead to prevalent combinations: resistive screens for industrial controls and Palm Pilots; capacitive screens for slot machines; wave screens for ATMs and indoor kiosks.\n\n【7】Most people are unaware of the type of screen they are using. But tricks can help you tell, according to Frank Shen of Elo TouchSystems in Fremont, Calif., the largest U.S. maker. Push the screen lightly with your fingernail (not your skin). If it responds, it could be resistive or infrared. In this case, place two separated fingers against the screen at the same time. If the cursor moves beneath one finger, the unit is infrared (software registers the first touch); if the cursor moves between the fingers, it is resistive (the points are averaged). If the unit does not respond to your fingernail, again place two separated fingers against it. If the cursor moves beneath one finger, the unit is acoustic wave; if the cursor moves between the fingers, it is capacitive.\n\n【8】-Mark Fischetti\n\n【9】## Resistive\n\n【10】A glass panel that lies against a cathode-ray tube (CRT) or liquidcrystal display (LCD) is coated with a conductive material.

Mucus can also be produced in increased quantities as a consequence of irritation of the mucus-producing glands, as often occurs transiently in asthma exacerbations, and on a more long-term basis in chronic smokers. Doctors often use the phrase \"mucus hypersecretion\" when extra mucus develops.\n\n【1】 NAEPP: The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program, abbreviated NAEPP, was founded in 1989 under the auspices of the National Institute of Health's National Heart Lung and Blood Institute. The NAEPP aims to improve asthma care in the U.S. by teaching health professionals, asthma patients, and the general public about asthma. The NEAPP's panel of experts has published several \"expert panel reports\" with guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma.\n\n【2】 Nebulizer: A nebulizer is a device that transforms a respiratory drug in liquid form into a fine mist of medicine particles that are easily inhaled into the respiratory passages. It is powered by a machine or compressor that runs off electrical current or batteries. Nebulizers are used in babies and very young children with asthma who cannot use an MDI or DPI.\n\n【3】They are also often used in an emergency setting. Several different classes of asthma medicines are available for nebulization, including β 2 agonists and inhaled corticosteroid preparations.\n\n【4】 Nocturnal: Taking place or occurring during the night. Asthmatic exacerbations, for example, usually include nocturnal symptoms.\n\n【5】 NSAIDs:        Non-steroidal      antiinflammatory drugs are often referred to as NSAIDs. The different types of NSAIDs are all potent anti-inflammatory drugs, widely prescribed for the treatment of pain, fever, and conditions such as arthritis. Some NSAIDs are available over the counter; others require a physician's prescription. As a rule, NSAIDs \"cross react\" with aspirin, and are contraindicated in persons with aspirin-sensitive asthma.\n\n【6】Obesity: Obesity refers to the condi-\n\n【7】 tion of being significantly overweight, or obese. A person is obese is they weight more than 30% above their ideal body weight for their given age, height, and gender.\n\n【8】Another definition of obesity involves computation of the BMI.\n\n【9】An overweight adult has a BMI of between 25 and 30, while an obese adult has a BMI of 30 or greater.\n\n【10】 Obstructive dysfunction: A pattern of abnormality detected by pulmonary function testing. Several different lung conditions lead to obstructive dysfunction on spirometry, one of the PFTs. Asthma is one of the conditions that, on testing, demonstrates obstructive dysfunction.

IgE is an antibody. IgE is produced by the body in minute quantities and normally circulates in the bloodstream in very small amounts. Under certain conditions however, the body's (and blood or serum) level of IgE can rise significantly. High serum IgE levels have, for example, been associated with persistent wheezing, allergy, and bronchial hyperresponsiveness.\n\n【1】IgE plays a pivotal role in allergy, in asthma, and in the other \"atopic diseases,\" such as eczema, seasonal allergic rhinitis, peanut allergy, anaphylaxis, and hives. To better understand the central role of IgE, it is important to first review our understanding of the body's allergic response.\n\n【2】 When a person has an allergy to a specific allergen, the allergy has developed over time. In order for an allergy to emerge, a person must first be exposed to an allergen. With continued exposure, \"sensitization\" to the allergen takes place, and only then, with continued exposure to the allergen, will an allergic response develop. The genesis of a specific allergy in an individual with certain innate genetic characteristics requires at least two successive steps: a preliminary exposure to an allergen, followed by sensitization to that same allergen. Many individuals are not \"allergy prone,\" meaning that even though they may have repeated, frequent allergen exposure, their immune system does not become sensitized, and allergic symptoms never develop. Consider, for example, two siblings who live in a home with a cat. One child has no allergic symptoms. The other child experiences itchy eyes, runny nose, chest tightness, and wheezing upon any exposure", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "ə|/15911] Vd1169H A :6mq15A", "bbox": [546.0, 82.0, 569.0, 266.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [545.0, 81.0, 568.0, 265.0], "position": 0}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Immunoglobulin E, abbreviated IgE, is a protein pro-", "bbox": [69.0, 68.0, 425.0, 87.0]}, {"text": "duced by the body and was first identified in the mid-", "bbox": [69.0, 89.0, 426.0, 108.0]}, {"text": "1960s.

This process is best known from the manufacturing of glass, which is an amorphous form of silica. Although rapid cooling works for making amorphous silica, it does not work for liquid water. Water droplets tend to crystallize even when cooled rapidly. As a result, amorphous ice was discovered only when, in 1935, scientists investigated the behavior of water vapor deposited slowly in a vacuum.\n\n【12】This discovery was of special interest to astronomers, because they knew that water behaves differently in the vacuum of space than it does on Earth. Most people know that a water molecule consists of one oxygen atom chemically bonded to two atoms of hydrogen. But what makes water such a mutable substance is that the oxygen atom has two negatively charged, paired electrons that can form weak bonds with the positively charged hydrogen atoms of a nearby water molecule. At temperatures below freezing, the water molecules move into their most stable configurations, thus strengthening the so-called hydrogen bonds, and the resulting ice becomes neatly organized over many hundreds of molecules.\n\n【13】The particular stacking pattern that develops as water freezes depends on pressure. The pattern forms one of 12 known phases of crystalline water ice, but only one—hexagonal ice—occurs naturally on Earth. The oxygen atoms form a sixfold pattern, which we see in the shape of snowflakes.\n\n【14】At temperatures well below freezing, the oxygen atoms can stack in a cubic pattern or, as in the case of amorphous ice, can even be prevented from forming any noticeable order at all.\n\n【15】Much of the bonding network that is characteristic of crystalline ice also binds molecules of liquid water. The essential difference—and the one that is critical for life—is that the hydrogen bonds in liquid water redistribute rapidly and constantly. Liquid water is thus capable of adjusting its structure to accommodate the physical and chemical requirements of living things. Just as an air bubble can rise through water but not through solid ice, organic molecules must be able to travel between water molecules if they are going to recombine into more complex compounds.\n\n【16】Perhaps the most exciting property of interstellar amorphous ice is that when exposed to radiation such as that found in deep space, it too can flow—even though its temperature is a scant few degrees above absolute zero (which is equivalent to –273 degrees Celsius). Indeed, the similarity of this ice to liquid water allows it to participate in the creation of organic compounds. Researchers first began to suspect this similarity in the early 1970s, as they investigated the chemistry of ice in the heart of cold molecular clouds in interstellar space.\n\n【17】Early experiments of that era by the pioneering laboratory scientists J. Mayo Greenberg of Leiden University in the Netherlands and Louis J. Allamandola of the Ames research center demonstrated that as much as 10 percent of the volume of interstellar ice grains is composed of simple molecules such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methanol and ammonia.\n\n【18】Since then, specialized telescopes that observe infrared and submillimeter radiation—which can penetrate larger amounts Continued on page 47", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "when researchers warmed an icy film a few hundred molecules thick", "bbox": [46.0, 423.0, 362.0, 438.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [45.0, 422.0, 361.0, 437.0], "position": 1}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "to 183 kelvins inside a cryogenic microscope.", "bbox": [47.0, 440.0, 258.0, 454.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [46.0, 439.0, 257.0, 453.0], "position": 2}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "knew how they first formed in interstellar space.

Now bring the eyebrows downwards and frown.\n\n【4】 In the next exercise, do not move your eyebrow; instead open your eyes wide.\n\n【5】This will help you assess if any improper muscle movements are taking place. If you feel you’re not doing something right, seek help from a certified Bell’s palsy therapist.\n\n【6】## Other Exercises\n\n【7】## For Your Eyes\n\n【8】Close your eyes slowly and make sure your eyebrow does not move downward.\n\n【9】Place your fingers below and above your eye socket and stretch your eye slowly to a completely open position. Hold for a slow count of four. You may have to stretch a bit further and then pull your fingers back to close the eye.\n\n【10】 The functionality of your eye is affected the most due to Bell's palsy. So while keeping the rest of the face as calm as possible, close one eye. You may also wink lightly with one eye and do it again with the other. Bear in mind, you should perform this movement very gently and as best as you can. Do not exert extra pressure on your eyes.\n\n【11】 If you're not able to get it perfect the first time, there's no reason to worry. You can always seek help from a reputed Bell's palsy therapist to master the movement.

There, on shelves next to flasks in which swim strains of human gastrointestinal bacteria, sit five mason jars. Each jar is labeled \" SELF-ASSEMBLING CLOCK \" and holds the jumbled parts of a timepiece. I recognize this as an element of Davis's \"experiment\" to see whether, given the right conditions and enough time, the components of machines can self-assemble into working devices, just as life supposedly arose spontaneously from colliding precursory biochemicals billions of years ago. That theory suddenly seems less plausible and yet more profound.\n\n【9】Tick tick . I turn to see Davis walking down the hall, his self-made peg leg clacking, steel on tile. The testtube stopper plugging its end has worn down. Ask him how he lost the limb, as someone does at his 50th birthday party the next day, and he smiles, inhales deeply and recites one of his poems, a frightening, erotic poem of slithering asps, black waters and an embrace with the long, luscious lips of an alligator.\n\n【10】Ask his friends, and they say he lost the leg in a motorcycle crash some 20 years ago, when he was still a sculptor and bike mechanic in Mississippi. That is where he was reared until problems at school got him sent up to the grandparents and to a psychiatric evaluation at age 13. In his report, Dr. J. F.

The adult sternum should be depressed at least 2 inches (5 cm) (Class IIa, LOE B 70 – 73 ), with chest compression and chest recoil/relaxation times approximately equal (Class IIb, LOE C 74 .删除2:<u> 75 </u>). Allow the chest to completely recoil after each compression (Class IIa, LOE B 76 -80 ). In human studies of CPR in out-of-hospital 81 and in-hospital settings, 78–80 incomplete chest wall recoil was common, particularly when rescuers were fatigued.删除2:<u> 78,81</u> Incomplete recoil during BLS CPR is associated with higher intrathoracic pressures and significantly decreased hemodynamics, including decreased coronary perfusion, cardiac index, myocardial blood flow, and cerebral perfusion.删除2:<u> 76,82</u> Importantly, the incidence of incomplete chest wall recoil can be reduced during CPR by using electronic recording devices that provide real-time feedback.删除2:<u> 80 </u>Manikin studies suggest that lifting the heel of the hand slightly, but completely, off the chest can improve chest recoil.删除2:<u> 77 </u>, 81 The total number of chest compressions delivered to the victim is a function of the chest compression rate and the proportion of time that chest compressions are delivered without interruption. The compression rate refers to the speed of compressions, not the actual number of compressions delivered per minute. The actual number of chest compressions delivered per minute is determined by the rate of chest compressions and the number and duration of interruptions to open the airway, deliver rescue breaths, and allow AED analysis.删除2:<u> 83.84</u> The number of chest compressions delivered per minute is an important determinant of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and neurologically intact survival.删除2:<u> 6,85</u> One study of in-hospital cardiac arrest patients 85 showed that delivery of > 80 compressions/min was associated with ROSC. Extrapolation of data from an out-of-hospital observational study 6 showed improved survival to hospital discharge when at least 68 to 89 chest compressions per minute were delivered; the study also demonstrated that improved survival occurred with chest compression rates as high as 120/min. It is therefore reasonable for lay rescuers and healthcare providers to perform chest compressions for adults at a rate of at least 100 compressions per minute (Class IIa, LOE B).\n\n【2】The term \"duty cycle\" refers to the time spent compressing\n\n【3】 blood flow is determined partly by the duty cycle (reduced coronary perfusion is associated with a duty cycle of > 50%) and partly by how fully the chest is relaxed at the end of each compression.删除2:<u> 86 </u>Although duty cycles ranging between 20% and 50% can result in adequate coronary and cerebral perfusion,87–90 a duty cycle of 50% is recommended because it is easy to achieve with practice (Class IIb, LOE C 75 ).\n\n【4】In 2005 3 human observational studies 91 - 93 showed that interruptions of chest compressions were common, averaging 24% to 57% 85.91–93 of the total arrest time.\n\n【5】The preponderance of efficacy data 94 .删除2:<u> 95 </u>suggests that limiting the frequency and duration of interruptions in chest compressions may improve clinically meaningful outcomes in cardiac arrest patients. Data are now accumulating regarding the effectiveness of these interventions in \"the real world.\" 2.96 –102 Therefore, despite some data to the contrary, 103 it is reasonable for rescuers to minimize interruption of chest compressions for checking the pulse, analyzing rhythm, or performing other activities throughout the entire resuscitation, particularly in the period immediately before and after a shock is delivered (Class IIa, LOE B 94 -98 ).\n\n【6】Additional evidence of the importance of minimizing interruptions in chest compressions comes from nonrandomized studies suggesting that survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest may be improved by the initial EMS provider delivery of continuous chest compressions without initial assisted ventilations, 97.98 or by EMS providers using a higher compression-to-ventilation ratio (50:2).删除2:<u> 96 </u>Notably, in each of these studies, the airway was opened, oxygen insufflations were provided, and assisted ventilation was recommended at some point during the EMS resuscitation. Other EMS systems have noted significant improvement in survival from out-ofhospital arrest with use of compressions-plus-ventilations with emphases on improved quality of compressions and minimization of hands-off time.删除2:<u> 2.99</u> At this time there is insufficient evidence to support the removal of ventilations from CPR provided by EMS professionals.\n\n【7】Rescuer fatigue may lead to inadequate compression rates or depth.删除2:<u> 104–106</u> Significant fatigue and shallow compressions are common after 1 minute of CPR, although rescuers may not recognize that fatigue is present for ≥ 5 minutes.删除2:<u> 105 </u>When 2 or more rescuers are available it is reasonable to switch chest compressors approximately every 2 minutes (or after about 5 cycles of compressions and ventilations at a ratio of 30:2) to prevent decreases in the quality of compressions (Class IIa, LOE B). Consider switching compressors during any intervention associated with appropriate interruptions in chest compressions (eg, when an AED is delivering a shock).\n\n【8】Every effort should be made to accomplish this switch in < 5 seconds.

How Will Pregnancy Modify Or Affect My Asthma?\n\n【1】Pregnancy will not necessarily make your asthma worse or more symptomatic. Studies of asthma in pregnancy reveal that about one third of pregnant women with asthma will have no change in the degree of their asthma; one third will experience a lessening of their asthma symptoms and a decreased need for medication; and one third of will have worsening of the asthma in pregnancy. Approximately 1 of every 3 pregnant women with asthma will thus experience more asthma symptomatology and require an increase in asthma medication.\n\n【2】After the baby's delivery and the postpartum period, you can expect your asthma to gradually return to usual—whatever the usual was for you!\n\n【3】## 85. Do I Need To See My Asthma Specialist More Frequently Now That I’M Pregnant?\n\n【4】Yes, while you are pregnant, you should see your asthma specialist more frequently than before. In my practice, for example, I ask my pregnant patients with asthma to see me on a monthly basis, with about the same frequency that they visit the obstetrician. Some women may require more frequent appointments, and some less.\n\n【5】 Now that you are pregnant, you and your asthma doctor have an \"extra\" to think about and to take into consideration. The special \"extra\" is, of course, the developing fetus.

She was starting a new job and, understandably, felt somewhat tense and nervous, but her breathing problems seemed \"out-of-line\" to her, inconsistent with her usual sensible self. After months of worry and seeing several doctors, the diagnosis of asthma really came as a relief, and helped her dismiss her fear of a more amorphous, less explicable problem.\n\n【1】 Asthma is definitely not a psychological disease; it is a physical condition of the respiratory system. It is a myth and a great disservice to all persons diagnosed with asthma to view asthma as a disease of the mind, or of a somehow disturbed frame of mind. Asthma triggers are exposures that precipitate or worsen a person's asthma (discussed in Question 43). In some people with asthma, strong emotions can function as a trigger.\n\n【2】Conversely, flares of asthma symptomatology, especially if severe, can lead to strong emotional responses.\n\n【3】 During an exacerbation of asthma, breathing is compromised and extremely uncomfortable. It is very frightening not to be able to breathe normally and effortlessly, and instead experience a sensation of suffocation. Let's say that a young child, for example, develops an exacerbation and becomes increasingly symptomatic in the middle of the night.

The popular press sensationalized the findings by suggesting that synthetic bugs might soon be crawling out of test tubes. The scientific community was more restrained, but many workers sensed that the major obstacle to creating life in the laboratory had been solved.\n\n【1】It did not take long to disabuse researchers of that notion. Miller may have discovered a way to make many of life's\n\n【2】 building blocks out of the earth's early supply of water and gas, but he had not discovered how or where these simple units would have linked into the complex molecular structures—such as proteins and DNA—that are intrinsic to life.\n\n【3】To answer that riddle, Miller and other origins scientists began proposing rocks as props. They speculated that organic molecules, floating in seawater, might have splashed into tidal pools along rocky coastlines. These molecules would have become increasingly concentrated through repeated cycles of evaporation, like soup thickening in a heated pot.\n\n【4】In recent years, however, researchers have envisioned that life's ingredients might have accumulated in much smaller containers. Some rocks, like gray volcanic pumice, are laced with air pockets created when gases expanded inside the rock while it was still molten. Many common minerals, such as feldspar, develop microscopic pits during weathering. Each tiny chamber in each rock on the early earth could have housed a separate experiment in molecular self-organization.\n\n【5】Given enough time and enough chambers, serendipity might have produced a combination of molecules that would eventually deserve to be called \"living.\" Underlying much of this speculation was the sense that life was so fragile that it depended on rocks for survival. But in 1977 a startling discovery challenged conventional wisdom about life's fragility and, perhaps, its origins. Until then, most scientists had assumed that life spawned at or near the benign ocean surface as a result of chemistry powered by sunlight.\n\n【6】That view began to change when deepocean explorers first encountered diverse ecosystems thriving at the superheated mouths of volcanic vents on the seafloor.\n\n【7】These extreme environments manage to support elaborate communities of living creatures in isolation from the sun. In these dark realms, much of the energy that organisms need comes not from light but from the earth's internal heat. With this knowledge in mind, a few investigators began to wonder whether organic reactions relevant to the origins of life might occur in the intense heat and pressure of these so-called hydrothermal vents.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "tempted to mimic the earth's primitive", "bbox": [61.0, 86.0, 278.0, 101.0]}, {"text": "oceans and atmosphere in a bottle.

Although cardiac arrest caused by PE often presents as pulseless electric activity (PEA), not all cases of PEA are caused by PE.\n\n【7】## Acls Modifications\n\n【8】In patients with cardiac arrest and without known PE, routine fibrinolytic treatment given during CPR shows no benefit185,186 and is not recommended (Class III, LOE A).\n\n【9】In patients with cardiac arrest and presumed PE, however, the use of fibrinolytics during CPR may improve the patient's chance of survival.删除2:<u> 187–194</u> Despite the potential to increase the risk of severe bleeding, fibrinolytics may improve survival to discharge and long-term neurological function in patients with presumed PE-induced cardiac arrest.删除2:<u> 193–196</u> Emergency echocardiography may be helpful in determining the presence of thrombus or PE.\n\n【10】In a small number of patients, percutaneous mechanical thromboembolectomy during CPR has been performed successfully.删除2:<u> 189 </u>Surgical embolectomy has also been used successfully in some patients with PE-induced cardiac arrest.删除2:<u> 191,197,198</u> In patients with cardiac arrest due to presumed or known PE, it is reasonable to administer fibrinolytics (Class IIa, LOE B).\n\n【11】Survival has been described with percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy or surgical embolectomy with or without prior treatment with fibrinolysis.\n\n【12】## Part 12.6: Cardiac Arrest Associated With Life-Threatening Electrolyte Disturbances Electrolyte Abnormalities Can Be Associated With Cardiovascular\n\n【13】emergencies and may cause or contribute to cardiac arrest, hinder resuscitative efforts, and affect hemodynamic recovery after cardiac arrest. An evidence-based review in 2010 focused on electrolyte abnormalities most often associated with cardiac arrest.\n\n【14】 Early consideration may be given to using selective methods of therapeutic management in addition to standard ACLS protocols that can be provided rapidly and have been shown to be\n\n【15】 effective in patients with cardiovascular instability as outlined below. Current BLS and ACLS should be used to manage cardiac arrest associated with all electrolyte disturbances.\n\n【16】## Potassium (K+)\n\n【17】Potassium is maintained mainly in the intracellular compartment through the action of the Na+/K+ ATPase pump. The magnitude of the potassium gradient across cell membranes determines excitability of nerve and muscle cells, including the myocardium.\n\n【18】Potassium is tightly regulated. Under normal conditions potential differences across membranes, especially cardiac, are not affected by alterations in potassium level. Rapid or significant changes in serum concentrations of potassium result from the shifting of potassium from one space to another and may have life-threatening consequences.\n\n【19】## Hyperkalemia\n\n【20】Hyperkalemia is one of the few potentially lethal electrolyte disturbances. Severe hyperkalemia (defined as a serum potassium concentration > 6.5 mmol/L) occurs most commonly from renal failure or from release of potassium from cells and can cause cardiac arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. In 1 retrospective in-hospital study of 29 063 patients, hyperkalemia was found to be directly responsible for sudden cardiac arrest in 7 cases.删除2:<u> 199 </u>Acute kidney injury was present in all the arrest cases, accompanied by acute pancreatitis in 3 cases and acute hepatic failure in 2 cases. Overall renal failure and drug treatment were the most common causes of hyperkalemia, with the most severe cases occurring when excessive IV potassium was administered to a patient with renal insufficiency.\n\n【21】删除4:<u>Although severe hyperkalemia may cause flaccid paralysis, paresthesia, depressed deep tendon reflexes, or respiratory difficulties, 200–202 the first indicator of hyperkalemia may be the presence of peaked T waves (tenting) on the electrocardiogram (ECG). As serum potassium rises, the ECG may progressively develop flattened or absent P waves, a prolonged PR interval, widened QRS complex, deepened S waves, and merging of S and T waves 删除5:<u>(Figure 5)</u>. If hyperkalemia is left untreated, a sine-wave pattern, idioventricular rhythms, and asystolic cardiac arrest may develop.删除2:<u> 203,204</u></u>\n\n【22】## Acls Modifications In Management Of Severe Cardiotoxicity Or Cardiac Arrest Due To Hyperkalemia\n\n【23】Treatment of severe hyperkalemia aims at protecting the heart from the effects of hyperkalemia by antagonizing the effect of potassium on excitable cell membranes, forcing potassium into cells to remove it promptly from the circulation, and removing potassium from the body. Therapies that shift potassium will act rapidly but are temporary and thus may need to be repeated. In order of urgency, treatment includes the following:\n • Stabilize myocardial cell membrane: • Calcium chloride (10%): 5 to 10 mL (500 to 1000 mg) IV over 2 to 5 minutes or calcium gluconate (10%): 15 to 30 mL IV over 2 to 5 minutes • Shift potassium into cells: • Sodium bicarbonate: 50 mEq IV over 5 minutes", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"raw_context": [{"text": "bradycardia as a potential complication, and obstetric and", "bbox": [60.0, 84.0, 377.0, 99.0]}, {"text": "neonatal consultation should be sought (Class I, LOE C).", "bbox": [60.0, 100.0, 347.0, 113.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [59.0, 83.0, 376.0, 112.0], "position": 3}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Part 12.4: Cardiac Arrest in the", "bbox": [109.0, 129.0, 328.0, 145.0]}, {"text": "Morbidly Obese", "bbox": [161.0, 146.0, 274.0, 160.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [108.0, 128.0, 327.0, 159.0], "position": 4}, {"raw_context": [{"text": "Morbid obesity can provide challenges during the resuscitation", "bbox": [60.0, 162.0, 376.0, 176.0]}, {"text": "attempt.

Moreover, in recent months two major semiconductor equipment manufacturers—ASML and Applied Materials—dropped plans to develop electron projection lithography, which uses parallel beams of electrons to print circuit patterns, another contender for the nextgeneration lithography that had been under development for years inside AT&T Bell Laboratories.\n\n【2】Despite its role as lead sponsor for EUV, Intel cannot claim credit for inventing it. In the late 1980s AT&T Bell Laboratories (now part of Lucent Technologies) and NTT Communications published separate papers on soft x-ray projection lithography. Two national laboratories—Sandia and Lawrence Livermore—expanded on this work using technologies from the Strategic Defense Initiative. Sandia fashioned an early lithography prototype using radiation from a laser-generated plasma, which had been involved before in testing the response of different materials to the high-energy pulses that satellites might sustain in scenarios postulated by \"Star Wars\" planners.\n\n【3】It has been understood for decades that the billion-dollar expense and overwhelming difficulties of producing chips with nanoscale circuitry would require that chipmakers such as IBM, Intel or (at one time) AT&T fund the early research of their equipment manufacturers. Bell Labs, which oversaw parallel efforts in five separate lithography technologies during the early 1990s, was enticed by the idea of short-wavelength radiation that did not require a synchrotron, the giant x-ray generators found in high-energy physics laboratories. The technical difficulties that beset x-ray lithography at the time led the Bell Labs researchers to change the name from soft x-rays to extreme ultraviolet lithography. Intel had\n\n【4】 joined AT&T and others in a cooperative research program with the national laboratories. But the actual day-to-day research was concentrated at Lawrence Livermore, Sandia and Bell Laboratories.\n\n【5】When Congress eliminated the program in 1996, pegging it as a form of corporate welfare, AT&T decided to get out. Intel then stepped in to salvage and carry on the work. \"Intel came to the realization [that] if they didn't put money into a couple of key technologies that would come into play in the 2000s, they were going to be in big trouble,\" says Richard R. Freeman, a professor of applied science at the University of Califor-\n\n【6】 nia at Davis, who headed lithography development at AT&T Bell Labs and later the EUV program at the national laboratories during the mid-1990s.\n\n【7】On paper, EUV was attractive. With a wavelength of 13 nanometers—almost one twentieth the wavelength being readied for use in commercial chipmaking five years ago—EUV could be extended until the physical challenges of making atomicscale chips rendered existing semiconductor technologies unworkable. And the technology used a machine tool that bears some resemblance to those deployed in existing fabrication facilities.

The body's arteries carry (O 2 ) oxygen-rich and carbon dioxide (CO 2 )-poor blood to our organs and tissues. An ABG tests a sample of blood taken directly from an artery.\n\n【2】The measured values of O 2 and CO 2 in the ABG sample let a doctor know how well the lungs are functioning in getting the O 2 into the body, and the CO 2 out. The ABG assesses how much O 2 and CO 2 are in the arterial system, a reflection of the efficiency and function of the respiratory system.\n\n【3】Acute: Short-lived, brief, sudden, not drawn out. Chronic is the opposite of acute. A virus such as influenza will cause an acute illness that may last a few weeks. Asthma is an example of a non-acute or chronic condition. Although its symptoms may recede, asthma lasts indefinitely.\n\n【4】Agonist: A medicine or drug that exerts its actions by combining with specific sites (called receptors) in the\n\n【5】 body. Albuterol, for example, attaches to the lungs' β 2 receptors. By attaching to the β 2 receptors, albuterol exerts its bronchodilatory effects, and causes narrowed bronchial passages to dilate or \"open up.\" Stimulation of the lung β 2 receptors leads to rapid relief of wheezing, tightness, and bronchoconstriction. Medicines such as albuterol are called β (beta) agonists since they \"fit\" the β 2 receptor, and exert their effects through activation of the receptor sites.\n\n【6】 Allergen: An agent that is able to produce an abnormal (allergic) response in a susceptible individual when that person becomes exposed to the agent. An allergen is usually a protein, and can be of various origins.\n\n【7】Foods, drugs, and chemicals, for example, can act as allergens in certain persons. So can substances of plant or animal origin.

But as with any other medical complication, it is better if you stick to a balanced diet plan during facial paralysis. Bell's palsy without a doubt takes a toll on your immune system, so you need to fulfill your body's nutritional needs. Remember, even small dietary changes can be extremely useful in speeding up the nerve healing process.\n\n【2】 1. Foods rich in vitamins, minerals and fiber should be an essential part of your diet while recovering from this condition. If you are suffering from Bell's palsy, be sure to eat plenty of fresh fruits, whole grains and leafy, green vegetables such as kale and spinach.\n\n【3】 2. You can also choose low-fat dairy products and lean meat options such as chicken and turkey. Seafood, in fact, makes an excellent choice and definitely deserves a place in your diet plan. Fish are rich sources of vitamin B12 that is known to boost nerve growth and repair.\n\n【4】 3. Seafood such as oysters and shellfish contain copper that is vital to nerve health. Copper can also be found in cocoa and beans. It's also a good idea to include cod liver oil in your diet; studies show that cod liver oil is very helpful in repairing the damaged myelin sheath.\n\n【5】 4. Also, try your best to avoid processed foods and foods having high saturated fat or sugar content. While sugar and saturated fats might not cause your facial palsy symptoms to worsen, they do slow down the healing process. Medical research shows that foods high in saturated fats (bad fats) can disrupt the normal healing process and prevent your body from functioning at its optimal level.\n\n【6】 5. One of the most essential nutrients that need to be part of your diet plan are vitamin B12 and vitamin B6, which we covered previously. They are extremely beneficial in encouraging nerve repair and growth.

Did The Sauropod Dinosaurs Continue To Grow Throughout Their Lives, As Some Reptiles And Fish Do?\n\n【1】—A Lexandra C Hang , M Iami , F La .\n\n【2】删除8:<u>Gregory S. Paul, freelance scientist, artist, and editor of the Scientific American Book of Dinosaurs , offers this explanation: Gigantism has been a common feature of land animals since the beginning of the Jurassic period, more than 200 million years ago. The first true giants of the land were small-headed, long-necked, sauropod dinosaurs. Toward the end of the Jurassic many sauropods reached 10 to 20 metric tons, some weighed as much as 50 metric tons, and a few may have exceeded 100 metric tons and 150 feet in length, rivaling the largest modern whales.\n\n【3】Why do animals become gigantic? Some reasons are simple. The bigger an animal is, the safer it is from predators and the better it is able to kill prey. Antelope are easy prey for lions, hyenas and hunting dogs, but adult elephants and rhinos are nearly immune—and their young benefit from the protection of their huge parents. For herbivores, being gigantic means being taller and therefore able to access higher foliage.\n\n【4】Giraffes and elephants can reach over 18 feet high, and elephants can use their great bulk to push over even taller trees.\n\n【5】Other reasons for being gargantuan, though important, are less obvious. The cost of locomotion decreases with increasing size; thus, it is much cheaper for a five-metric-ton elephant to walk a mile than it is for a five-metric-ton herd of gazelle to move the same distance. Metabolic rate also de-\n\n【6】 creases with increasing size. A shrew must therefore frantically eat more than its own weight each day. The elephant, on the other hand, needs to take in only 5 percent of its own weight. Also, as size increases, great bulk acts as a form of mass insulation, and so large animals are less affected by Experiment is temperature extremes.\n\n【7】But there are disadvantages the sole interpreter to being big. Because big aniof the artifices mals eat more, there cannot be of Nature.\n\n【8】as many of them. Before hu- -LEONARDO DA VINCI man hunting, the population of elephants and rhinos in Africa was in the low millions. Rodents, in contrast, number in the countless billions. Nor can giants do a lot of things that smaller creatures can do, such as burrow into the ground, climb trees or fly.\n\n【9】On land only dinosaurs and mammals have become gigantic; reptiles have never done so (the biggest tortoises and lizards have only weighed one metric ton). One reason may be the rate of growth. Land reptiles cannot grow rapidly. It takes many years for an alligator to reach 100 pounds, whereas an ostrich does so in less than a year.\n\n【10】a\n\n【11】删除11:<u>删除10:<u> For the complete text of this answer, and answers to many other questions, visit Ask the Experts ( www.</u>sciam.</u>\n\n【12】com/askexpert).\n\n【13】 Scientific American (ISSN 0036-8733), published monthly by Scientific American, Inc., 415 Madison Avenue, New York, N.Y.删除2:<u> 10017-1111</u>.

Thrombus formation on catheter material in patients on fondaparinux, however, required the addition of UFH during PCI.删除2:<u> 324 </u>Two large randomized clinical trials resulted in less bleeding and a short- and long-term reduction in cardiac events and overall mortality with bivalirudin compared to UFH plus a glycoprotein inhibitor in patients with STEMI and PPCI.删除2:<u> 344 </u>, 345 For patients with STEMI undergoing contemporary PCI\n\n【3】 (ie, additional broad use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors and a thienopyridine) enoxaparin may be considered a safe and effective alternative to UFH (Class IIb, LOE B). Patients initially treated with enoxaparin should not be switched to UFH and vice versa to avoid increased risk of bleeding.\n\n【4】Fondaparinux may be considered as an alternative to UFH, however, there is an increased risk of catheter thrombi with fondaparinux alone. Additional UFH (50 to 100 U/kg bolus) may help to avoid this complication (Class IIb, LOE B), but using these two agents is not recommended over UFH alone.\n\n【5】For fondaparinux and enoxaparin it is necessary to adjust the dose in patients with renal impairment. Bivalirudin may be considered as an alternative to UFH and GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors (Class IIb, LOE A).\n\n【6】## Calcium Channel Blockers\n\n【7】There is little evidence that calcium channel blocking agents can be safely used as an alternative or additional therapy to b -blockers when the later are contraindicated or their maximum dose has been achieved.\n\n【8】Calcium channel blocking agents have not been shown to reduce mortality after acute MI, and in certain patients with cardiovascular disease there are data to suggest that they are harmful. β -blockers have been used much more broadly, have a much safer profile, and appear to be a more appropriate choice for patients presenting with myocardial infarction compared to calcium channel blockers.\n\n【9】## Ace Inhibitor Therapy\n\n【10】ACE Inhibitors and ARBs in the Hospital ACE inhibitor therapy has improved survival rates in patients with AMI, particularly when started early after the initial hospitalization.删除2:<u> 183 </u>, 346 – 349 Evidence from 7 large clinical trials, 183,346–351 2 meta-analyses, 352,353 and 10 minor trials 348 , 351 , 354 – 362 documents consistent improvement in mortality when oral ACE inhibitors are administered in the hospital setting to patients with AMI with or without early reperfusion therapy. In these studies ACE inhibitors were not administered in the presence of hypotension (SBP < 100 mm Hg or ≥ 30 mm Hg below baseline). The beneficial effects are most pronounced in patients with anterior infarction, pulmonary congestion, or LV ejection fraction <40%.\n\n【11】 Administration of an oral ACE inhibitor is recommended within the first 24 hours after onset of symptoms in STEMI patients with pulmonary congestion or LV ejection fraction < 40%, in the absence of hypotension (SBP < 100 mm Hg or ≥ 30 mm Hg below baseline) (Class I, LOE A). Oral ACE inhibitor therapy can also be useful for all other patients with AMI with or without early reperfusion therapy (Class IIa, LOE B). IV administration of ACE inhibitors is contraindicated in the first 24 hours because of risk of hypotension (Class III, LOE C).\n\n【12】 ACE Inhibitors in the Prehospital Setting Despite multiple studies that have shown a benefit of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in patients with a myocardial infarction when therapy is started during the first 24 hours of the index hospitalization, no trial specifically evaluates patients in the ED or prehospital settings. An older randomized trial showed a reduction in mortality with an increased risk of hypotension in patients treated soon after presentation in the inpatient setting.删除2:<u> 183 </u>Several trials showed a reduction in the rate of heart failure and mortality in patients treated soon after fibrinolysis, 363–365 and several others showed no benefit with the early or prehospital use of angiotensin converting enzyme.删除2:<u> 364,366,367</u> In conclusion, although ACE inhibitors and ARBs have been shown to reduce long-term risk of mortality in patients suffering an AMI, there is insufficient evidence to support the routine initiation of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in the prehospital or ED setting (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【13】## Hmg Coenzyme A Reductase Inhibitors (Statins)\n\n【14】A variety of studies documented consistent reduction in indicators of inflammation and complications such as reinfarction, recurrent angina, and arrhythmias when statin treatment is administered within a few days after onset of an ACS.删除2:<u> 368–371</u> There is little data to suggest that this therapy should be initiated within the ED; however, early initiation (within 24 hours of presentation) of statin therapy is recommended in patients with an ACS or AMI (Class I, LOE C). If patients are already on statin therapy, continue the therapy (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【15】An increase in short-term mortality and incidence of major\n\n【16】 adverse cardiac events have been reported with discontinuation of statin treatment in ACS patients at hospital admission.\n\n【17】Statins should not be discontinued during the index hospitalization unless contraindicated (Class III, LOE C).删除2:<u> 372 </u>– 381 Pretreatment with statins in patients undergoing elective percutaneous angioplasty for stable angina or hemodynamicaly stable ACS has been shown to significantly reduce biomarkers of myocardial necrosis or inflammation compared to placebo when given between 3 and 7 days prior to the procedure.删除2:<u> 382 </u>, 383 Furthermore, pretreatment with atorvastatin 80 mg 12\n\n【18】 hours before and an additional 40 mg immediately before PCI for NSTEMI or documented ischemia has been shown to significantly decrease the 30 day composite of death, MI, and unplanned revascularization compared to placebo in a prospective randomized trial.

Atypical symptoms of ACS may be more common in the elderly, women, and diabetic patients, but any patient may present with atypical signs and symptoms.删除2:<u> 212–214</u> Signs and symptoms cannot be used to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of ACS because reported sensitivity ranges from 35% to 92% and specificity ranges from 28% of 91%.\n\n【9】Numerous studies do not support the use of any clinical signs and symptoms independent of electrocardiograph (ECG) tracings, cardiac biomarkers, or other diagnostic tests to rule in or rule out ACS in prehospital or emergency department (ED) settings.删除2:<u> 215 </u>– 228 To improve ACS outcome, all dispatchers and EMS providers must be trained to recognize ACS symptoms, even if atypical. It is reasonable for dispatchers to advise patients with potential cardiac symptoms to chew an aspirin (160 to 325  mg), providing the patient has no history of aspirin allergy and no signs of active or recent gastrointestinal bleeding (Class IIa, LOE C).删除2:<u> 229 </u>– 233 EMS providers should obtain a 12-lead ECG, determine onset of ACS symptoms, and provide prearrival notification to the destination hospital.删除2:<u> 229,234</u> Clinical trials have shown improved outcomes in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients transported by EMS directly to a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)–capable hospital.删除2:<u> 235–237</u> If the patient has a STEMI on ECG and if PCI is the chosen method of reperfusion, it is reasonable to transport the patient directly to a PCI facility, bypassing closer emergency departments as necessary, in systems where time intervals between first medical contact and balloon times are less than 90 minutes, and transport times are relatively short (ie, less than 30 minutes), or based on regional EMS protocols (Class IIa, LOE B).\n\n【10】Common practice has been for basic EMT's to administer oxygen during the initial assessment of patients with suspected ACS.  However, there is insufficient evidence to\n\n【11】 delaying defibrillation to provide a period of CPR for patients in VF/pulseless VT out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. In settings with lay rescuer AED programs (AED onsite and available) and for in-hospital environments, or if the EMS rescuer witnesses the collapse, the rescuer should use the defibrillator as soon as it is available (Class IIa, LOE C). When more than one rescuer is available, one rescuer should provide chest compressions while another activates the emergency response system and retrieves the defibrillator. Defibrillation is discussed in further detail in Part 6: \"Electrical Therapies.\"\n\n【12】 The recovery position is used for unresponsive adult victims who clearly have normal breathing and effective circulation.\n\n【13】This position is designed to maintain a patent airway and reduce the risk of airway obstruction and aspiration.

No single position is perfect for all victims.删除2:<u> 204,205</u> The position should be stable, near a true lateral position, with the head dependent and with no pressure on the chest to impair breathing (Class IIa, LOE C).
