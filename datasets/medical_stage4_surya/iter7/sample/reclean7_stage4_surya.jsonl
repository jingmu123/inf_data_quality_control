In addition, it is unknown whether 100% inspired oxygen (F IO 2 = 1.0) is beneficial or whether titrated oxygen is better.\nAlthough prolonged exposure to 100% inspired oxygen (F io 2 = 1.0) has potential toxicity, there is insufficient evidence to indicate that this occurs during brief periods of adult\nCPR. 3 –5 Empirical use of 100% inspired oxygen during CPR optimizes arterial oxyhemoglobin content and in turn oxygen delivery; therefore, use of 100% inspired oxygen (F IO 2 = 1.0) as soon as it becomes available is reasonable during resuscitation from cardiac arrest (Class IIa, LOE C). Management of oxygen after ROSC is discussed in Part 9: \"Post-Cardiac\nArrest Care.''\n\n【4】##Passive Oxygen Delivery During Cpr\n\n【5】Positive-pressure ventilation has been a mainstay of CPR but recently has come under scrutiny because of the potential for increased intrathoracic pressure to interfere with circulation due to reduced venous return to the heart. In the out-ofhospital setting, passive oxygen delivery via mask with an opened airway during the first 6 minutes of CPR provided by emergency medical services (EMS) personnel was part of a protocol of bundled care interventions (including continuous chest compressions) that resulted in improved survival. 6–8\nWhen passive oxygen delivery using a fenestrated tracheal tube (Boussignac tube) during uninterrupted physicianmanaged CPR was compared with standard CPR, there was no difference in oxygenation, ROSC, or survival to hospital admission. 9. 10 Chest compressions cause air to be expelled from the chest and oxygen to be drawn into the chest passively due to the elastic recoil of the chest. In theory, because ventilation requirements are lower than normal during cardiac arrest, oxygen supplied by passive delivery is likely to be sufficient for several minutes after onset of cardiac arrest with a patent upper airway.At this time there is insufficient evidence to support the removal of ventila-\n##Tions From Cpr Performed By Acls Providers.\n\n【6】##Bag-Mask Ventilation\n\n【7】Bag-mask ventilation is an acceptable method of providing ventilation and oxygenation during CPR but is a challenging skill that requires practice for continuing competency. All healthcare providers should be familiar with the use of the bag-mask device.  Use of bag-mask ventilation is not recommended for a lone provider. When ventilations are performed by a lone provider, mouth-to-mouth or mouth-to-mask are more efficient. When a second provider is available, bag-mask ventilation may be used by a trained and experienced provider. But bag-mask ventilation is most effective when performed by 2 trained and experienced providers. One provider opens the airway and seals the mask to the face while the other squeezes placement of an advanced airway is delayed or unsuccessful.\nThe desirable components of a bag-mask device are listed in Part 5: ''Adult Basic Life Support.''\nThe provider should use an adult (1 to 2 L) bag and the provider should deliver approximately 600 mL of tidal volume sufficient to produce chest rise over 1 second.This volume of ventilation is adequate for oxygenation and minimizes the risk of gastric inflation. The provider should be sure to open the airway adequately with a head tilt–chin lift, lifting the jaw against the mask and holding the mask against the face, creating a tight seal.\n\n【8】During CPR give 2 breaths (each 1 second) during a brief (about 3 to 4 seconds) pause after every 30 chest compressions.\nBag-mask ventilation can produce gastric inflation with complications, including regurgitation, aspiration, and pneumonia. Gastric inflation can elevate the diaphragm, restrict lung movement, and decrease respiratory system compliance.\n\n【9】##Airway Adjuncts\n\n【10】##Cricoid Pressure\n\n【11】Cricoid pressure in nonarrest patients may offer some measure of protection to the airway from aspiration and gastric insufflation during bag-mask ventilation.  However, it also may impede ventilation and interfere with placement of a supraglottic airway or intubation.  The role of cricoid pressure during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and in-hospital cardiac arrest has not been studied. If cricoid pressure is used in special circumstances during cardiac arrest, the pressure should be adjusted, relaxed, or released if it impedes ventilation or advanced airway placement. The routine use of cricoid pressure in cardiac arrest is not recommended (Class III, LOE C).\n\n【12】##Oropharyngeal Airways\n\n【13】Although studies have not specifically considered the use of oropharyngeal airways in patients with cardiac arrest, airways may aid in the delivery of adequate ventilation with a bag-mask device by preventing the tongue from occluding the airway. Incorrect insertion of an oropharyngeal airway can displace the tongue into the hypopharynx, causing airway obstruction. To facilitate delivery of ventilations with a bag-mask device, oropharyngeal airways can be used in unconscious (unresponsive) patients with no cough or gag reflex and should be inserted only by persons trained in their use (Class IIa, LOE C).\n\n【14】##Nasopharyngeal Airways\n\n【15】Nasopharyngeal airways are useful in patients with airway obstruction or those at risk for developing airway obstruction, particularly when conditions such as a clenched jaw prevent placement of an oral airway. Nasopharyngeal airways are better tolerated than oral airways in patients who are not deeply unconscious. Airway bleeding can occur in up to 30% of patients following insertion of a nasopharyngeal airway.Two case reports of inadvertent intracranial placement of a nasopharyngeal airway in patients with basilar skull fractures29.30 suggest that nasopharyngeal airways should be used with caution in patients with severe craniofacial injury.\nAs with all adjunctive equipment, safe use of the nasopharyngeal airway requires adequate training, practice, and", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": " compressions for ventilation.

The dedicated rescuer who provides manual abdominal compressions will compress the abdomen midway between the xiphoid and the umbilicus during the relaxation phase of chest compression. Hand position, depth, rhythm, and rate of abdominal compressions are similar to those for chest compressions and the force required is similar to that used to palpate the abdominal aorta.\nIn most reports, an endotracheal tube is placed before or shortly after initiation of IAC-CPR. IAC-CPR increases diastolic aortic pressure and venous return, resulting in improved coronary perfusion pressure and blood flow to other vital organs.\nIn 2 randomized in-hospital trials, IAC-CPR performed by trained rescuers improved short-term survival 17 and survival to hospital discharge 18 compared with conventional CPR for adult cardiac arrest. The data from these studies were combined in 2 positive meta-analyses.However, 1 randomized controlled trial of adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest 21 did not show any survival advantage to IAC-CPR. Although there were no complications reported in adults,19 1 pediatric case report 22 documented traumatic pancreatitis following\nIAC-CPR.\nIAC-CPR may be considered during in-hospital resuscita- tion when sufficient personnel trained in its use are available (Class IIb, LOE B). There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of IAC-CPR in the out-of-hospital setting or in children.\n\n【2】##\"Cough\" Cpr\n\n【3】\"Cough\" CPR describes the use of forceful voluntary coughs every 1 to 3 seconds in conscious patients shortly after the onset of a witnessed nonperfusing cardiac rhythm in a controlled environment such as the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Coughing episodically increases the intrathoracic pressure and can generate systemic blood pressures higher than those usually generated by conventional chest compressions, 23.24 allowing patients to maintain consciousness 23–26 for a brief arrhythmic interval (up to 92 seconds documented in humans). 25 \"Cough\" CPR has been reported exclusively in awake, monitored patients (predominantly in the cardiac catheterization laboratory) when arrhythmic cardiac arrest can be anticipated, the patient remains conscious and can be instructed before and coached during the event, and cardiac activity can be promptly restored.  However, not all victims are able to produce hemodynamically effective coughs. 27 \"Cough\" CPR is not useful for unresponsive victims and should not be taught to lay rescuers. \"Cough\" CPR may be considered in settings such as the cardiac catheterization laboratory for conscious, supine, and monitored patients if the patient can be instructed and coached to cough forcefully every 1 to 3 seconds during the initial seconds of an arrhythmic cardiac arrest. It should not delay definitive\n##Prone Cpr\n\n【4】When the patient cannot be placed in the supine position, it may be reasonable for rescuers to provide CPR with the patient in the prone position, particularly in hospitalized patients with an advanced airway in place (Class IIb, LOE C).34–37\n\n【5】##Precordial Thump\n\n【6】This section is new to the 2010 Guidelines and is based on the conclusions reached by the 2010 ILCOR evidence evaluation process.A precordial thump has been reported to convert ventricular tachyarrhythmias in 1 study with concurrent controls, 39 single-patient case reports, and small case series.  However, 2 larger case series found that the precordial thump was ineffective in 79 (98.8%) of 80 cases 45 and in 153 (98.7%) of 155 cases of malignant ventricular arrhythmias.Case reports and case series 47 -49 have documented complications associated with precordial thump including sternal fracture, osteomyelitis, stroke, and triggering of malignant arrhythmias in adults and children.\nThe precordial thump should not be used for unwitnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (Class III, LOE C). The precordial thump may be considered for patients with witnessed, monitored, unstable ventricular tachycardia including pulseless VT if a defibrillator is not immediately ready for use (Class IIb, LOE C), but it should not delay CPR and shock delivery. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of the precordial thump for witnessed onset of asystole.\n\n【7】##Percussion Pacing\n\n【8】Percussion (eg, fist) pacing refers to the use of regular, rhythmic and forceful percussion of the chest with the rescuer's fist in an attempt to pace the myocardium. There is little evidence supporting fist or percussion pacing in cardiac arrest based on 6 single-patient case reports 50 -55 and a moderate-sized case series.There is insufficient evidence to recommend percussion pacing during typical attempted resuscitation from cardiac arrest.\n\n【9】##Devices To Assist Ventilation\n\n【10】##Automatic And Mechanical Transport Ventilators\n\n【11】Automatic Transport Ventilators\nThere are very few studies evaluating the use of automatic transport ventilators (ATVs) during attempted resuscitation in patients with endotracheal intubation.

These 2010 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC recommend compressions at a rate of at least 100/ min. There is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of high-frequency chest compressions for cardiac arrest. However, high-frequency chest compressions may be considered by adequately trained rescue personnel as an alternative (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【5】##Open-Chest Cpr\n\n【6】In open-chest CPR the heart is accessed through a thoracotomy (typically created through the 5 th left intercostal space) and compression is performed using the thumb and fingers, or with the palm and extended fingers against the sternum. Use of this technique generates forward blood flow and coronary perfusion pressure that typically exceed those generated by closed chest compressions.\nThere are few human studies comparing open-chest CPR to conventional CPR in cardiac arrest and no prospective randomized trials.

However, open-chest CPR can be useful if cardiac arrest develops during surgery when the chest or abdomen is already open, or in the early postoperative period after cardiothoracic surgery (Class IIa, LOE C). A resuscitative thoracotomy to facilitate open-chest CPR may be considered in very select circumstances of adults and children with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest from penetrating trauma with short transport times to a trauma facility (Class IIb, LOE C). 15.16", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": "# Part 7: Cpr Techniques And Devices 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines For Cardiopulmonary\nResuscitation And Emergency Cardiovascular Care\n", "block_text_old": "# Part 7: Cpr Techniques And Devices 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines For Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation And Emergency Cardiovascular Care\n", "raw_context": [{"text": "Part 7: CPR Techniques and Devices", "bbox": [187.0, 105.0, 594.0, 133.0]}, {"text": "2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary", "bbox": [96.0, 137.0, 685.0, 160.0]}, {"text": "Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care", "bbox": [167.0, 160.0, 616.0, 180.0]}], "block_type": "Title", "full_blocks": [95.0, 103.0, 684.0, 179.0], "position": 0, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n Diana M.

A RRS has several components, 231 including an \"afferent arm\" (ie, event detection and response triggering arm); an \"efferent arm\" (ie, a planned response arm, such as the RRT); a qualitymonitoring arm; and an administrative support arm.\nSome studies have demonstrated a reduction in cardiac arrest rates for adult patients after implementation of various components of a RRS, 232–247 while others have failed to show such a difference.In pediatric settings the implementation of RRSs has resulted in the prevention of respiratory arrest, 254 a decreased total number of arrests,better survival from cardiac arrest,and reduction in hospital-wide mortality.  Implementation of a pediatric MET/RRT may be beneficial in facilities where children with high-risk illnesses are present on general inpatient units (Class IIa, LOE B).\nAlthough conflicting evidence exists, expert consensus recommends the systematic identification of patients at risk of cardiac arrest, an organized response to such patients, and evaluation of outcomes to foster continuous quality improvement (Class I, LOE C). System components that are potentially important in reducing the incidence of, and improving survival from, in-hospital cardiac arrest are summarized in Table 2.\n\n【8】##Regional Systems Of (Emergency)\nCardiovascular Care\n\n【9】There is wide variability in survival to hospital discharge, one-month survival, and length of critical-care stay among hospitals caring for patients after resuscitation from cardiac arrest.  Hospitals with larger patient volumes (>50 ICU cardiac arrest admissions/year) had a better survival to hospital discharge than low-volume centers (<20 ICU– cardiac arrest admissions/yr) for patients treated for either inor out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.Implementation of comprehensive packages of post–carpercutaneous coronary interventionhas been shown to improve survival from cardiac arrest. Two small studies demonstrated trends toward improved survival that were not statistically significant when comprehensive packages of post–cardiac arrest care were introduced.Although there is no direct evidence that regional systems of care for cardiac resuscitation improve outcome, extrapolation from research in other time-sensitive conditions, such as acute coronary syndromes, 273 stroke,and trauma, 276 suggests there may be a benefit to such a system. In 2010 the AHA published a policy statement calling for the development of regional systems of care as a strategy to reduce the variability in survival for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.It is reasonable that regional systems of care be considered as part of an overall approach to improve survival from cardiac arrest (Class IIa, LOE C).\n\n【10】##Resuscitation Training In\nLimited-Resource Communities\n\n【11】Many AHA instructors are involved in training in limitedresource environments in the United States and throughout the world. The vast majority of participants enjoy training and feel more comfortable after educational programs regardless of the type of training provided.Improvements in provider performance and patient outcomes following training in resource-limited environments are inconsistent, and important characteristics of students and training environment, as well as outcomes (cognitive, psychomotor skills, operational performance, patient outcome, and cost-effectiveness), are inconsistently measured. Resuscitation training, when appropriately adapted to the local providers' clinical environment and resources, has significantly reduced mortality in developing countries.The evidence from the trauma education is most compelling, and less clear with neonatal 295,296 and adult cardiac resuscitation training programs.Patient outcome studies were often limited by study design, but 1 large, multicenter trial failed to show improvement in neonatal survival after newborn resuscitation training.There is no strong evidence to support any specific instruction method as preferable for all clinical environments and training subject experience. There is anecdotal evidence that successful resuscitation training in developing countries requires local adaptation to clinical environments, 280,299–301 utilizing existing and sustainable resources for both care and training,302 and a dedicated local infrastructure.Optimizing the links in the Chain of Survival improves outcomes and saves lives. The use of evidence-based education and implementation strategies will allow organizations and communities to strengthen these links in the most effective and efficient manner.\n\n【12】##Acknowledgments\n\n【13】The writing group would like to thank the members of the Education\nSubcommittee of American Heart Association Emergency Cardio\n##Summary", "tags": {}, "lang":

The recommended dose is 160 to 325 mg. Chewable or soluble aspirin is absorbed more quickly than swallowed tablets.Aspirin suppositories (300 mg) are safe and can be considered for patients with severe nausea, vomiting, or disorders of the upper gastrointestinal tract.\nOther nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDS) are contraindicated and should be discontinued in patients who are taking these medications. NSAIDs (except for aspirin), both nonselective as well as COX-2 selective agents, should not be administered during hospitalization for STEMI because of the increased risk of mortality, reinfarction, hypertension, heart failure, and myocardial rupture associated with their use (Class III, LOE C). 180–182\n\n【1】##Nitroglycerin (Or Glyceryl Trinitrate)\n\n【2】Nitroglycerin has beneficial hemodynamic effects, including dilation of the coronary arteries (particularly in the region of plaque disruption), the peripheral arterial bed, and venous capacitance vessels. The treatment benefits of nitroglycerin are limited, however, and no conclusive evidence has been shown to support the routine use of IV, oral, or topical nitrate therapy in patients with AMI.With this in mind, these agents should be carefully considered, especially in the patient with low blood pressure and when their use would preclude the use of other agents known to be beneficial, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.\nPatients with ischemic discomfort should receive up to 3 doses of sublingual or aerosol nitroglycerin at 3- to 5-minute intervals until pain is relieved or low blood pressure limits its use (Class I, LOE B). Topical nitrates are acceptable alternatives for patients who require anti-anginal therapy but who are hemodynamically stable and do not have ongoing refractory ischemic symptoms. Parenteral formulations, rather than long acting oral preparations, can be used acutely to enable titration in patients with obvious ACS, objective test abnormality, and ongoing discomfort. In patients with recurrent ischemia, nitrates are indicated in the first 24 to 48 hours.\nThe use of nitrates in patients with hypotension (SBP < 90 mm Hg or ≥ 30 mm Hg below baseline), extreme bradycardia (<50 bpm), or tachycardia in the absence of heart failure (> 100 bpm) and in patients with right ventricular infarction is contraindicated (Class III, LOE C). Caution is advised in patients with known inferior wall STEMI, and a right-sided ECG should be performed to evaluate RV infarction. Administer nitrates with extreme caution, if at all, to patients with inferior-wall MI and suspected right ventricular (RV) involvement because these patients require adequate\nRV preload. Nitroglycerin should not be administered to patients who had taken a phosphodiesterase inhibitor (eg, sildenafil) for erectile dysfunction within 24 hours (48 hours if tadalafil use).\nRelief of chest discomfort with nitroglycerin is neither sensitive nor specific for ACS; gastrointestinal etiologies as well as other causes of chest discomfort can \"respond\" to\n##Analgesia\n\n【3】Providers should administer analgesics, such as intravenous morphine, for chest discomfort unresponsive to nitrates.\nMorphine is the preferred analgesic for patients with STEMI (Class I, LOE C). However, analysis of retrospective registry data raised a question about the potentially adverse effects of morphine in patients with UA/NSTEMI.As a result, the ACC AHA UA/NSTEMI writing group reduced morphine use to a Class IIa recommendation for that patient population. 3\n\n【4】##Reperfusion Therapies \nAcute Reperfusion Therapy Using Ppci Or Fibrinolytic Therapy\n\n【5】in patients with STEMI restores flow in the infarct-related artery, limits infarct size, and translates into early mortality benefit that is sustained over the next decade.While optimal fibrinolysis restores normal coronary flow (TIMI 3) in 50% to 60% of subjects, PPCI is able to achieve restored flow in > 90% of subjects. The patency rates achieved with\nPPCI translates into reduced mortality and reinfarction rates as compared to fibrinolytic therapy.This benefit is even greater in patients presenting with cardiogenic shock. PPCI also results in a decreased risk of intracranial hemorrhage and stroke, making it the reperfusion strategy of choice in the elderly and those at risk for bleeding complications.\n\n【6】##Fibrinolytics\n\n【7】Early fibrinolytic therapy is a well-established treatment modality for patients with STEMI who present within 12 hours of the onset of symptoms and who lack contraindications to its use.  Early reperfusion results in reduced mortality, and the shorter the time to reperfusion, the greater the benefit. A 47% reduction in mortality was noted when fibrinolytic therapy was provided within the first hour after onset of symptoms.The major determinants of myocardial salvage and longterm prognosis are short time to reperfusion,complete and sustained patency of the infarct-related artery with normal (TIMI grade 3) flow, 194, 195 and normal microvascular perfusion. \nIn the absence of contraindications, fibrinolytic therapy is recommended for STEMI if symptom onset has been within 12 hours of presentation and PCI is not available within 90 minutes of first medical contact (Class I, LOE A). Patients are evaluated for risk and benefit; for absolute and relative contraindications to therapy .\nIf fibrinolysis is chosen for reperfusion, the ED physician should administer fibrinolytics to eligible patients as early as possible according to a predetermined process of care developed by the ED and cardiology staff (Class I, LOE A). The goal is a door-to-needle time of less than 30 minutes with effort focused on shortening the time to therapy. Patients treated within the first 70 minutes of onset of symptoms have > 50% reduction in infarct size and 75% reduction in mortality rates.For fibrinolytic therapy, it is estimated that 65 lives will be saved per 1000 patients treated if fibrinolytics are provided in the first hour, with a pooled total of 131 lives saved per 1000 patients treated if fibrinolytics are provided within the first 3 hours of onset of symptoms.Although", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": " all patients with AMI, and in high-risk patients it reduced nonfatal AMI and vascular death. 177 Aspirin is also effective in patients with NSTEMI.

Of those who developed shock, 244 patients with ST-segment elevation developed shock significantly earlier than patients without\nST-segment elevation. Cardiogenic shock and congestive heart failure are not contraindications to fibrinolysis, but PCI is preferred if the patient is at a facility with PCI capabilities.\nBased on the results of the SHOCK trial ACC/AHA guidelines note that PPCI is reasonable in those who develop shock within 36 hours of symptom onset and who are suitable candidates for revascularization that can be performed within 18 hours of the onset of shock.Although the benefits in the SHOCK trial were observed only in patients ≤ 75 years of age, selected elderly patients also appear to benefit from this strategy. The guidelines also support the use of hemodynamic support with intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation (IABP) in this setting as part of aggressive medical treatment. The IABP works synergistically with fibrinolytic agents in this setting, and the benefits observed with early revascularization strategy in the SHOCK trial were also obtained in the setting of IABP support. The use of PPCI for patients with cardiogenic shock has increased over time and contributes to the observed decrease in hospital mortality.  The majority of survivors following cardiogenic shock experience a good quality of life, and the early mortality benefit with revascularization is sustained over time.  In hospitals without PCI facilities, fibrinolytic administration needs to be considered with prompt transfer to a tertiary care facility where adjunct PCI can be performed if cardiogenic shock or ongoing ischemia ensues.The ACC/AHA STEMI guidelines recommend a door-to-departure time of 30 minutes for transfer to a PCI-capable center. 3\n\n【4】##Rv Infarction\n\n【5】RV infarction or ischemia may occur in up to 50% of patients with inferior wall MI.  The clinician should suspect RV infarction in patients with inferior wall infarction, hypotension, and clear lung fields. In patients with inferior wall infarction, obtain an ECG with right-sided leads. ST-segment elevation (> 1 mm) in lead V4R is sensitive (sensitivity, 88%; specificity, 78% ; diagnostic accuracy, 83%) for RV infarction and is a strong predictor of increased in-hospital complications and mortality.The in-hospital mortality rate of patients with RV dysfunction is 25% to 30%, and these patients should be routinely considered for reperfusion therapy. Fibrinolytic therapy reduces the incidence of RV dysfunction.Similarly PCI is an alternative for patients with RV infarction and is preferred for patients in shock. Patients with shock caused by RV failure have a mortality rate similar to that for patients with shock due to LV failure.\nPatients with RV dysfunction and acute infarction are end-diastolic pressure) to maintain cardiac output.Thus, nitrates, diuretics, and other vasodilators (ACE inhibitors) should be avoided because severe hypotension may result.\nHypotension is initially treated with an IV fluid bolus.\n\n【6】##Adjunctive Therapies For Acs And Ami\n\n【7】##Thienopyridines\n\n【8】Clopidogrel\nClopidogrel is an oral thienopyridine prodrug that irreversibly inhibits the adenosine diphosphate receptor on the platelet, resulting in a reduction in platelet aggregation through a different mechanism than aspirin. Since the publication of the 2005 AHA Guidelines, several important clopidogrel studies have been published that document its efficacy for patients with both NSTEMI and STEMI.\nThere is a reduction in combined event rate (cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal infarction, and nonfatal stroke) and/or mortality; with a resultant small increase in major bleeding when clopidogrel is administered by providers in the ED or in hospital to patients with NSTEMI ACS.Patients with\nACS and a rise in cardiac biomarkers or ECG changes consistent with ischemia had reduced stroke and major adverse cardiac events if clopidogrel was added to aspirin and heparin within 4 hours of hospital presentation.Clopidogrel given 6 hours or more before elective PCI for patients with ACS without ST elevation reduces adverse ischemic events at 28 days.The Clopidogrel in Unstable angina to prevent Recurrent ischemic Events (CURE) trial documented an increased rate of bleeding (but not intracranial hemorrhage) in the 2072 patients undergoing CABG within 5 to 7 days of administration.Although a posthoc analysis of this trial reported a trend toward life-threatening bleeding 257 and a prospective study failed to show increased bleeding in 1366 patients undergoing CABG, 260 a subsequent risk-to-benefit ratio analysis concluded that the bleeding risk with clopidogrel in patients undergoing CABG was modest. The use of clopidogrel in ACS patients with a high likelihood of needing\nCABG requires weighing the risk of bleeding if given against the potential for perioperative ACS events if withheld. The current ACC/AHA guidelines recommend withholding clopidogrel for 5 to 7 days in patients for whom CABG is anticipated.\nIn patients up to 75 years of age with STEMI managed by fibrinolysis, a consistent improvement in combined event rate (cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal infarction, and nonfatal stroke) and/or mortality, with a resultant small increase in major bleeding, is observed when clopidogrel, in a 300-mg loading dose, was administered in addition to aspirin and heparin (low-molecular-weight heparin [LMWH] or unfractionated heparin [UFH]), at the time of initial management (followed by a 75 mg daily dose for up to 8 days in hospital). \nIn patients with STEMI managed with PPCI, there is a reduction in combined event rate (cardiovascular mortality, nonfatal infarction, and nonfatal stroke) and/or mor", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": " ered in consultation with the cardiologist if there is a substantial delay to PCI.", "block_text_old": " ered in consultation with the cardiologist if there is a substantial delay to PCI.", "raw_context": [{"text": "ered in consultation with the cardiologist if there is a", "bbox": [60.0, 84.0, 377.0, 99.0]}, {"text": "substantial delay to PCI.", "bbox": [60.0, 100.0, 196.0, 113.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [59.0, 83.0, 376.0, 112.0], "position": 3, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n## Complicated Ami\n", "block_text_old": "\n## Complicated Ami\n", "raw_context": [{"text": "Complicated AMI", "bbox": [156.0, 128.0, 280.0, 146.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [155.0, 127.0, 279.0, 145.0], "position": 4, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n## Cardiogenic Shock, Lv Failure, And Congestive\nHeart Failure\n", "block_text_old": "\n## Cardiogenic Shock, Lv Failure, And Congestive Heart Failure\n", "raw_context": [{"text": "Cardiogenic Shock, LV Failure, and Congestive", "bbox": [60.0, 149.0, 355.0, 166.0]}, {"text": "Heart Failure", "bbox": [60.0, 167.0, 146.0, 180.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [59.0, 148.0, 354.0, 179.0], "position": 5, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n\nInfarction of ≥ 40% of the LV myocardium usually results in cardiogenic shock and carries a high mortality rate.

In children over 1 year of age, injury is the leading cause of death. Survival from traumatic cardiac arrest is rare, emphasizing the importance of injury prevention in reducing deaths.Motor vehicle crashes are the most common cause of fatal childhood injuries; targeted interventions, such as the use of child passenger safety seats, can reduce the risk of death. Resources for the prevention of motor vehicle-related injuries are detailed on the US\n\n【4】The recommended sequence of CPR has previously been known by the initials \"ABC\": Airway, Breathing/ventilation, and Chest compressions (or Circulation). The 2010\nAHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC recommend a CAB sequence (chest compressions, airway, breathing/ventilations). This section will review some of the rationale for making the change for children as well as for adults.\nDuring cardiac arrest high-quality CPR, particularly high-quality chest compressions are essential to generate\n\n【5】##Abc Or Cab?", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": "# Part 13: Pediatric Basic Life Support 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines For Cardiopulmonary\nResuscitation And Emergency Cardiovascular Care\n", "block_text_old": "# Part 13: Pediatric Basic Life Support 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines For Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation And Emergency Cardiovascular Care\n", "raw_context": [{"text": "Part 13: Pediatric Basic Life Support", "bbox": [187.0, 107.0, 596.0, 133.0]}, {"text": "2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary", "bbox": [96.0, 137.0, 685.0, 160.0]}, {"text": "Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care", "bbox": [167.0, 160.0, 616.0, 180.0]}], "block_type": "Title", "full_blocks": [95.0, 106.0, 684.0, 179.0], "position": 0, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n Marc D.

The body's arteries carry (O 2 ) oxygen-rich and carbon dioxide (CO 2 )-poor blood to our organs and tissues. An ABG tests a sample of blood taken directly from an artery.\nThe measured values of O 2 and CO 2 in the ABG sample let a doctor know how well the lungs are functioning in getting the O 2 into the body, and the CO 2 out. The ABG assesses how much O 2 and CO 2 are in the arterial system, a reflection of the efficiency and function of the respiratory system.\nAcute: Short-lived, brief, sudden, not drawn out. Chronic is the opposite of acute. A virus such as influenza will cause an acute illness that may last a few weeks. Asthma is an example of a non-acute or chronic condition. Although its symptoms may recede, asthma lasts indefinitely.\n\n【2】Agonist: A medicine or drug that exerts its actions by combining with specific sites (called receptors) in the body. Albuterol, for example, attaches to the lungs' β 2 receptors. By attaching to the β 2 receptors, albuterol exerts its bronchodilatory effects, and causes narrowed bronchial passages to dilate or \"open up.\" Stimulation of the lung β 2 receptors leads to rapid relief of wheezing, tightness, and bronchoconstriction. Medicines such as albuterol are called β (beta) agonists since they \"fit\" the β 2 receptor, and exert their effects through activation of the receptor sites.\n\n【3】Allergen: An agent that is able to produce an abnormal (allergic) response in a susceptible individual when that person becomes exposed to the agent. An allergen is usually a protein, and can be of various origins.\nFoods, drugs, and chemicals, for example, can act as allergens in certain persons. So can substances of plant or animal origin. Examples of allergens include peanut, penicillin, ragweed, and cat dander.

Then repeat the movement.\n\n【1】If you have trouble moving the eyebrow on the affected side of the face, you may use your fingertips for assistance in the movement. Keeping your fingertips just above the eyebrows will help you raise them without trouble. This action can be repeated five times.\n\n【2】Once you have become accustomed to this, you may stop using your fingertips to raise your brows. Instead, start involving the forehead muscles in this activity.\n\n【3】Using the same guidelines as above, you may also wrinkle your forehead. It is a great way to relearn symmetrical facial movements. Now bring the eyebrows downwards and frown.\n\n【4】In the next exercise, do not move your eyebrow; instead open your eyes wide.\nThis will help you assess if any improper muscle movements are taking place. If you feel you’re not doing something right, seek help from a certified Bell’s palsy therapist.\n\n【5】##Other Exercises\n\n【6】##For Your Eyes\n\n【7】Close your eyes slowly and make sure your eyebrow does not move downward.\nPlace your fingers below and above your eye socket and stretch your eye slowly to a completely open position. Hold for a slow count of four. You may have to stretch a bit further and then pull your fingers back to close the eye.\n\n【8】The functionality of your eye is affected the most due to Bell's palsy. So while keeping the rest of the face as calm as possible, close one eye. You may also wink lightly with one eye and do it again with the other. Bear in mind, you should perform this movement very gently and as best as you can. Do not exert extra pressure on your eyes.\n\n【9】If you're not able to get it perfect the first time, there's no reason to worry. You can always seek help from a reputed Bell's palsy therapist to master the movement.

Bronchoscopy is said to be \"diagnostic\" when it is carried out to assist physicians in investigating a lung abnormality.

Potential dangers of prolonged tourniquet application include temporary 62 or permanent 63 injury to the underlying nerves and muscles, 64 and systemic complications resulting from limb ischemia, 65 including acidemia, hyperkalemia, arrhythmias, shock, and death. Complications are related to tourniquet pressure 66 and duration of occlusion,67 but there is insufficient evidence to determine a minimal critical time beyond which irreversible complications may occur. Because of the potential adverse effects of tourniquets and difficulty in their proper application, use of a tourniquet to control bleeding of the extremities is indicated only if direct pressure is not effective or possible (Class IIb, LOE B). Specifically designed tourniquets appear to be better than ones that are improvised, 60but tourniquets should only be used with proper training (Class IIa, LOE B). If a tourniquet is used, make sure that you note the time it was applied and communicate that time to EMS personnel.\n\n【1】##Pressure Points And Elevation\n\n【2】Elevation and use of pressure points are not recommended to control bleeding (Class III, LOE C). This new recommendation is made because there is evidence that other ways of controlling bleeding are more effective. The hemostatic effect of elevation has not been studied. No effect on distal pulses was found in volunteers when pressure points were used.Most important, these unproven procedures may compromise the proven intervention of direct pressure, so they could be harmful.\n\n【3】##Hemostatic Agents\n\n【4】Among the large number of commercially available hemostatic agents, some have been shown to be effective. \nHowever, their routine use in first aid cannot be recommended at this time because of significant variation in effectiveness by different agents and their potential for adverse effects, including tissue destruction with induction of a proembolic state and potential thermal injury (Class IIb, LOE B).\n\n【5】##Wounds And Abrasions\n\n【6】Superficial wounds and abrasions should be thoroughly irrigated with a large volume of warm or room temperature potable water with or without soap 77 -82 until there is no foreign matter in the wound (Class I, LOE A). Cold water appears to be as effective as warm water, but it is not as comfortable. If running water is unavailable, use any source of clean water. Wounds heal better with less infection if they are covered with an antibiotic ointment or cream and a clean occlusive dressing (Class IIa, LOE A). Apply antibiotic ointment or cream only if the wound is an abrasion or a superficial injury and only if the victim has no known\n##Burns\n\n【7】Thermal Burns\nCool thermal burns with cold (15° to 25°C) tap water as soon as possible and continue cooling at least until pain is relieved (Class I, LOE B).  Cooling reduces pain, edema, and depth of injury. It speeds healing and may reduce the need for excision and grafting of deep burns. Don't apply ice directly to a burn; it can produce tissue ischemia (Class III, LOE B).\nProlonged cold exposure to small burns, and even brief exposure if the burn is large, can cause further local tissue injuryand hypothermia.\n\n【8】##Burn Blisters\n\n【9】Loosely cover burn blisters with a sterile dressing but leave blisters intact because this improves healing and reduces pain (Class IIa, LOE B).\n\n【10】##Electric Injuries\n\n【11】The severity of electric injuries can vary widely, from an unpleasant tingling sensation caused by low-intensity current to thermal burns, cardiopulmonary arrest, and death.\nThermal burns may result from burning clothing that is in contact with the skin or from electric current traversing a portion of the body. When current traverses the body, thermal burns may be present at the entry and exit points and along its internal pathway. Cardiopulmonary arrest is the primary cause of immediate death from electrocution.Cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation, ventricular asystole, and ventricular tachycardia that progresses to ventricular fibrillation, may result from exposure to low- or high-voltage current.Respiratory arrest may result from electric injury to the respiratory center in the brain or from tetanic contractions or paralysis of respiratory muscles.\nDo not place yourself in danger by touching an electro- cuted victim while the power is on (Class III, LOE C).\nTurn off the power at its source; at home the switch is usually near the fuse box. In case of high-voltage electrocutions caused by fallen power lines, immediately notify the appropriate authorities (eg, 911 or fire department). All materials conduct electricity if the voltage is high enough, so do not enter the area around the victim or try to remove wires or other materials with any object, including a wooden one, until the power has been turned off by knowledgeable personnel.\nOnce the power is off, assess the victim, who may need CPR, defibrillation, and treatment for shock and thermal burns. All victims of electric shock require medical assessment because the extent of injury may not be apparent.\n\n【12】##Spine Stabilization\n\n【13】There is approximately a 2% risk of injury to the cervical spine after blunt trauma that is serious enough to require spinal imaging in an emergency department,and this risk is tripled in patients with craniofacial injury.Most victims with spinal injuries are males between the ages of", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": "\nTourniquets\nAlthough tourniquets have been shown to control bleeding effectively on the battlefield 58– 60 and during surgery and have been used by paramedics in a civilian setting without complications, 61 there are no studies on controlling bleeding with first aid provider use of a tourniquet.

These ubiquitous minerals feel slick when wet because their atoms form flat, smooth layers. The surfaces of these layers frequently carry an electric charge, which might be able to attract organic molecules and hold them in place. Experiments later confirmed these speculations. In the late 1970s an Israeli research group demonstrated that amino acids can concentrate on clay surfaces and then link up into short chains that resemble biological proteins.

HAZEN has explored the behavior of minerals under high pressure at the Carnegie\nInstitution of Washington's Geophysical Laboratory since 1976. In the past five years he has designed many of his mineral experiments to mimic the high-pressure environments of deepsea hydrothermal vents. Rocks and minerals first piqued Hazen's curiosity as a child growing up in northern New Jersey, a region known for its unusual ore deposits. After receiving a doctorate in earth sciences at Harvard University in 1975 and spending a year at the University of Cambridge, he joined the staff at Carnegie. In 1990 Hazen took on a second position, as professor of earth science at George Mason University. He is also a part-time professional trumcules that would become biologically important. Recent experiments show, once again, that minerals may have played a central role in this task.\n\n【2】##Preferential Treatment\n\n【3】perhaps the most mysterious episode of selection left all living organisms with a strange predominance of one type of amino acid. Like many organic molecules, amino acids come in two forms.\nEach version comprises the same types of atoms, but the two molecules are constructed as mirror images of each other.\nThe phenomenon is called chirality, but for simplicity's sake scientists refer to the two versions as \"left-handed\" (or \"L\") and \"right-handed\" (or \"D\"). Organic synthesis experiments like Miller's invariably produce 50–50 mixtures of L and D molecules, but the excess of lefthanded amino acids in living organisms is nearly 100 percent.\nResearchers have proposed a dozen theories—from the mundane to the exotic—to account for this bizarre occurrence. Some astrophysicists have argued that the earth might have formed with an excess of L amino acids—a consequence of processes that took place in the cloud of dust and gas that became the solar system. The main problem with this theory is that in most situations such processes yield only the slightest excess—less than 1 percent—of L or D molecules.\nAlternatively, the world might have started with a 50–50 mixture of L and D amino acids, and then some important feature of the physical environment selected one version over the other. To me, the most obvious candidates for this specialized physical environment are crystal faces whose surface structures are mirror images of each other [ see box on page 80 ]. Last spring I narrowed in on calcite, the common mineral that forms limestone and marble, in part because it often displays magnificent pairs of mirror-image faces. The chemical structure of calcite in many mollusk shells bonds strongly to amino acids. Knowing this, I began to suspect that calcite surfaces may feature chemical bonding sites that are ideally suited to only one type of amino acid or the other. With the help of my Carnegie colleague Timothy Filley (now at Purdue University) and Glenn Goodfriend of George Washington University, I ran more than 100 tests of this hypothesis.\nOur experiments were simple in concept, although they required meticulous clean-room procedures to avoid contamination by the amino acids that exist everywhere in the environment. We immersed a well-formed, fist-size crystal of calcite into a 50–50 solution of aspartic acid, a common amino acid. After 24 hours we removed the crystal from this solution, washed it in water and carefully collected all the molecules that had ad- hered to specific crystal faces. In one experiment after another we observed that calcite's \"left-handed\" faces selected L- amino acids, and vice versa, with excesses approaching 40 percent in some cases.\nCuriously, calcite faces with finely terraced surfaces displayed the greatest selectivity. This outcome led us to speculate that these terraced edges might force the L and D amino acids to line up in neat rows on their respective faces. Under the right environmental conditions, these organized rows of amino acids might chemically join to form proteinlike", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": " page 80 ].

Some people without lung disease who have a type of heart dysfunction called \"congestive heart failure\" can wheeze if they take in too much fluid. Still others might wheeze after a severe allergy, such as to a bee sting, for example. Gastric reflux, called \"GERD\" (gastro-esophageal reflux disease), is a disease of the digestive system and is an example of a nonpulmonary condition that can mimic asthma. Similarly, vocal cord dysfunction syndrome, or \"VCD,\" affects the voice box (larynx) and is often confused with asthma.

Did The Sauropod Dinosaurs Continue To Grow Throughout Their Lives, As Some Reptiles And Fish Do?\n\n【1】—A Lexandra C Hang , M Iami , F La .\n\n【2】Gregory S. Paul, freelance scientist, artist, and editor of the Scientific American Book of Dinosaurs , offers this explanation:\nGigantism has been a common feature of land animals since the beginning of the Jurassic period, more than 200 million years ago. The first true giants of the land were small-headed, long-necked, sauropod dinosaurs. Toward the end of the Jurassic many sauropods reached 10 to 20 metric tons, some weighed as much as 50 metric tons, and a few may have exceeded 100 metric tons and 150 feet in length, rivaling the largest modern whales.\nWhy do animals become gigantic? Some reasons are simple. The bigger an animal is, the safer it is from predators and the better it is able to kill prey. Antelope are easy prey for lions, hyenas and hunting dogs, but adult elephants and rhinos are nearly immune—and their young benefit from the protection of their huge parents. For herbivores, being gigantic means being taller and therefore able to access higher foliage.\nGiraffes and elephants can reach over 18 feet high, and elephants can use their great bulk to push over even taller trees.\nOther reasons for being gargantuan, though important, are less obvious. The cost of locomotion decreases with increasing size; thus, it is much cheaper for a five-metric-ton elephant to walk a mile than it is for a five-metric-ton herd of gazelle to move the same distance. Metabolic rate also de- creases with increasing size. A shrew must therefore frantically eat more than its own weight each day. The elephant, on the other hand, needs to take in only 5 percent of its own weight. Also, as size increases, great bulk acts as a form of mass insulation, and so large animals are less affected by\nExperiment is temperature extremes.\nBut there are disadvantages the sole interpreter to being big. Because big aniof the artifices mals eat more, there cannot be of Nature. as many of them. Before hu- -LEONARDO DA VINCI man hunting, the population of elephants and rhinos in Africa was in the low millions. Rodents, in contrast, number in the countless billions. Nor can giants do a lot of things that smaller creatures can do, such as burrow into the ground, climb trees or fly.\nOn land only dinosaurs and mammals have become gigantic; reptiles have never done so (the biggest tortoises and lizards have only weighed one metric ton). One reason may be the rate of growth. Land reptiles cannot grow rapidly. It takes many years for an alligator to reach 100 pounds, whereas an ostrich does so in less than a year\n\n【3】Scientific American (ISSN 0036-8733), published monthly by Scientific American,\n\n【4】Scientific American, Inc.

Tooth inclination. The buccolingual inclinations of the posterior teeth involved in a cross bite provide valuable information. If an upper molar in cross bite has a palatal inclination, it will have an advantageous position due to the fact that the correction of the cross bite improves with the buccal inclination of the molar.\nOn the other hand, if the upper molar in cross bite has a buccal inclination, it is probable that the cause is a narrowing of the entire upper arch in relation to the width of the lower arch. In these cases, the widening of all the upper arch is convenient with rapid maxillary expansion (RME), instead of the further inclinement of the upper molars. \n 2. Lateral functional displacement during mandibular closure. The majority of patients with unilateral posterior cross bite displace their mandible to the side of the cross bite during closure in CO. The lateral displacement means that the cross bite is bilateral, and consequently, easy to treat with an appliance that can move both sides of the maxilla buccaly. In general, the lower dental midline is displaced to the side where the posterior cross bite is localized.\n\n【2】When the displacement is not easily detected, we must ask the patient to open wide; if the lower dental midline is displaced toward the facial midline of the patient, or if it aligns during complete aperture with the upper dental midline, there is a functional displacement present. A relaxing occlusal guard used during one or two weeks can verify the presence or absence of such displacement. Occlusal guards or deprogramming guards help to detect lateral displacements in patients with mastication muscles that are programmed to close the mandible in a deviated position.If a complete examination discards the existence of a displacement, the cross bite is caused by a skeletal asymmetry.\n\n【3】3. Estimation of the necessary expansion. If the necessary expansion of the upper arch is between 2 mm to 4 mm and the upper molars are inclined toward the palate, a variety of removable or fixed appliances can be used, like the Quad Helix, the thermal expander, Tandem Loop, transpalatine arches, overlay, etc. If the upper expansion needed oscillates between 4 mm to 6 mm the best appliance to use is the Hyrax. A patient that needs more than 12 mm of expansion may require the use of a combination of a Hyrax type screw with orthognatic surgery (surgical expansion). \n 4. Age of the patient. In children and young adolescents, posterior unilateral and bilateral cross bites are easily treated. Patients with a unilateral posterior cross bite present a mandible displacement that can predispose the patient to temporomandibular joint disorders. These unilateral posterior cross bites with lateral displacement can be corrected in the primary, mixed or permanent dentition, being detected and treated at an early age.  Posterior cross bites in adolescents can be successfully corrected; but the expansion with a Hyrax is not easy, because the middle palatal suture is ossified making separation difficult. For these patients we recommend the expansion with a Hyrax screw assisted by surgical expansion.  Adults with bilateral posterior cross bites (without displacement between CR and CO) are sometimes left with this functional bite. This is because, in adults, posterior cross bites are mainly corrected inclining the upper and lower molars; the results are usually unstable and tend to rebound.\n\n【4】5. Vertical changes. During the correction of a posterior cross bite, the anterior overbite generally diminishes (the anterior bite opens). This happens because the palatal cusps of the posteriosuperior teeth occlude on the occlusal surfaces of the posteroinferior teeth.\nThis opening of the bite is transitory; when the teeth establish their new occlusal relation, the anterior overbite returns to its original condition.\n\n【5】##Reasons And Periods For Treatment Of Posterior Cross Bite\n\n【6】These malocclusions must have early treatment for various reasons, among them:\n\n【7】Once the posterior cross bite is installed it will not o correct spontaneously.\nIt provokes wear of the crossed teeth. o\nIt provokes periodontal problems due to occlusal o trauma.\nIt provokes interferences in the growth and developo ment of the dental arches.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": "\n## Variables That Can Have Influence In The Correction Of Posterior Cross Bites\n", "block_text_old": "\n## Variables That Can Have Influence In The Correction Of Posterior Cross Bites\n", "raw_context": [{"text": "Variables that can have influence in the", "bbox": [72.0, 85.0, 369.0, 102.0]}, {"text": "correction of posterior cross bites", "bbox": [72.0, 102.0, 327.0, 119.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [71.0, 84.0, 368.0, 118.0], "position": 2, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n 1.

Yellow corresponds to peak-flow measurements in the range of 60% to 80% of the personal best value. The red zone includes all peak flow values below 60% of a child's personal best. Peak-flow measurements in the red zone indicate that the child's asthma is poorly controlled, and that you will need to either contact your physician, proceed to the emergency room, or both.

AND BYOND by Lawrence M. Krauss. Little, Brown, New York, 2001 ($26.95)\nStarting with one atom of oxygen that arises as an effect of the big bang, Krauss, chairman of physics at Case Western Reserve University, weaves a tale that reads as compellingly as a good novel. He traces the atom's travels from the early moments of the universe to its participation in life on arth and then considers what might become of it after life on arth ends. The result is nothing less than a history of the cosmos.\n\n【1】CRACKING THGNOM: INSIDTHRACTO UNLOCK HUMAN DNA by Kevin Davies. Free Press, New York, 2001 ($25)\nThe massive effort of recent years to decode the human genome, Davies writes, \"is, at the very least, an extraordinary technological achievement, and is at best perhaps the defining moment in the evolution of mankind.\" Davies, founding editor of Nature Genetics and now executive editor of Current Biology, gives a clear account of the \"epic battle\" between the public Human Genome Project and the private Celera Genomics to be the first to sequence the genome. He examines difficult issues that arise from the program, among them the legal issue of gene patenting and the moral issue of genetic engineering. And he foresees that \"the explosion in genomic information fueled by the sequence will revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of countless diseases.\"\n\n【2】##The Turk, Chess Automaton\n\n【3】by Gerald M. Levitt. McFarland & Company, Jefferson, N.C., 2000 ($50)\nIt was an impressive showpiece: a fierce-looking, turbaned puppet seated at a cabinet bearing a chessboard. Its successive owners from 1770 to 1854 would open the cabinet to display to an audience an array of gears and springs and then would invite a spectator to play a game of chess with the Turk, as the turbaned figure came to be known. The Turk usually won. Audiences and chess players were impressed. But it was a grand hoax.\nJammed uncomfortably into the cabinet, kept from the audience's view by legerdemain, was a \"director,\" a human chess player who observed by candlelight the moves made by the opponent and operated the pantograph that executed the Turk's responses.\n\n【4】De Waal takes a different tack: \"Instead of being tied to how we are unlike any animal, human identity should be built around how we are animals that have taken certain capacities a significant step farther. We and other animals are both similar and different, and the former is the only sensible framework within which to flesh out the latter.\"\nSensible, yes, but ideology dies hard.\nAs de Waal so convincingly explains, we\n##The ditors Recommend\n\n【5】on the way to enlightenment, and this might be too scary for those invested in the supremacy of humankind. But for those ready for some self-scrutiny, and a less biased view of culture and learning in our fellow creatures, this book will be a revelation.

On the side where distention of the periodontal ligament fibers is occurring, undifferentiated mesenchyma cells transform into osteoblasts and fibroblasts, which are responsible of forming bone tissue and collagen fibers respectively. When blood flow is limited, teeth do not move or they move slowly. Intense forces may limit the physiologic response and can affect the rate of dental movement.  Dental movement begins two days after the force is applied.\nThis movement stimulates osteoclasts and osteoblasts to begin the bone remodeling process with apposition on the periodontal fiber tension side and resorption on the compressed periodontal ligament side. Slowly the alveolus dislocates in the direction of the applied force, with orthodontic movement as a consequence.  Brian Lee, following the works by Storey and Smith, evaluated the optimal force for canine retraction. In his study he proposed that 200 g/cm 2 of exposed root surface to movement was the optimal pressure to apply In order to obtain an efficient dental movement.  Taking into consideration that force times surface unit is defined as pressure, the force applied must differ depending on the size of the root surface and the direction of the planned movement.\n\n【2】The mesiodistal size of the root surface is evaluated when the tooth is moving in an anteroposterior direction. The buccolingual size of the root surface is evaluated if the tooth is going to be moved in a transverse direction. When intrusion or extrusion of teeth is planned, the cross section of the root surface is evaluated.  According to Ricketts, the optimal force for dental movement is 100 g/cm 2 of root surface exposed to movement (please refer to Space Closure chapter. Table of Ricketts).\n\n【3】##Types Of Dental Movement\n\n【4】Dental movement can be classified in many ways: l:\n\n【5】Inclination: a. Uncontroled inclination. b. Controlled inclination.\n\n【6】2. Translation.\n\n【7】3. Root displacement.\n\n【8】4. Rotation. \n 1. Inclination: Is the movement in which the crown of the teeth suffers greater displacement than the root of the tooth. This can be classified according to the location of the center of resistance: a. Uncontrolled inclination: This type of inclination happens when the center of rotation is between the center of resistance and the apex of the tooth. This movement can be obtained by any orthodontist, but is usually not wanted.\nThis uncontrolled inclination happens when we have a round arch wire in the slot of the brace and force is applied to the tooth.

Video-mediated, practice-while-watching instruction is the preferred method for basic psychomotor skill training because it reduces instructor variability and potential distractions that deviate from the intended course agenda.\n•Objectives-Based - Cognitive, 87 psychomotor, 83 and affective objectives 89 should be included in all courses.\n\n【2】Hands-on Practice - Substantial hands-on practice is needed to meet 段内删除换行-5 psychomotor skill performance objectives. \n  Contextual - Adult learning principles 92 should be applied to all ECC courses with emphasis on creating relevant training scenarios that can be applied practically to the learners' real-world setting, such as having hospital-based learners practice CPR on a bed instead of the floor.\n\n【3】Competency-based - Successful course completion should be based on the ability of the learner to demonstrate achievement of course objectives rather than attendance in a course/program for a specific time period•Practice to Mastery - Key skills and course content should be repeated with deliberate practice 93 to build toward mastery.  Assessment - Evaluative strategies should assess competence and promote learning. Learning objectives 96 must be clear and measurable and serve as the basis of evaluation. whether that ultimately improves patient outcomes would constitute more robust forms of program evaluation.\n\n【4】##Strategies For Basic Life Support (Bls) Courses\n\n【5】Studies have demonstrated that lay rescuer CPR skills can be acquired and retained at least as well (sometimes better) through interactive computer- and video-based synchronous practice instruction when compared with instructor-led courses.  Short video instruction combined with synchronous hands-on practice is an effective alternative to instructor-led basic life support courses (Class I, LOE A).\n\n【6】##Aed Training Requirement\n\n【7】Manikin-based studies have demonstrated that AEDs can be correctly operated without prior training.  Allowing the use of AEDs by untrained bystanders can be beneficial and may be lifesaving (Class IIa, LOE B). Because even minimal training has been shown to improve performance in simulated cardiac arrests, 2698 training opportunities should be made available and promoted for the lay rescuer (Class I, LOE B).\n\n【8】##Strategies For Advanced Life Support (Als) Courses\n\n【9】Resuscitation and education literature have demonstrated that precourse preparatory strategies including computer-assisted learning tutorials, 99–104 written self-instructional materials, 105, 106 video reviews, 105 preparatory courses, 107, 108 textbook reading, 109 and pretestsenhance knowledge acquisition or reduce classroom time. It is reasonable to include precourse preparatory strategies in advanced life support courses (Class IIa, LOE B).\nTeamwork has been reported to impact patient outcomes in ship training have been shown to improve subsequent resuscitation performance in simulation studiesand actual clinical performance.As a result teamwork and leadership skills training should be included in advanced life support courses (Class I, LOE B).\n\n【10】##Realistic Manikins\n\n【11】Some manikins utilized in resuscitation training have realistic features such as the ability to replicate chest expansion and breath sounds, to provide exhaled carbon dioxide, to generate a pulse and blood pressure, and to speak or make sounds. Two studies reported that training with such manikins improved clinical performance.  Thirteen studies showed an improvement in end-of-course skills when realistic manikins were used,while six studies showed equal performance with lower technology manikins.  Use of more realistic manikins in training may incur substantially higher financial costs.Eight studies showed equal knowledge acquisition with realistic manikins when compared with lower-technology manikins.  Three studies indicated that learner satisfaction was greater with realistic manikins. \nThere is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the routine use of more realistic manikins to improve skills performance in actual resuscitations. Realistic manikins may be useful for integrating the knowledge, skills, and behaviors in ALS training (Class IIa, LOE B). Further research is needed to confirm if such technology improves resuscitation performance in the clinical setting and to determine if it can improve survival from cardiac arrest.\n\n【12】##Course Delivery Formats\n\n【13】Course delivery formats other than the standard 2-day ACLS or PALS provider course may achieve equivalent or better knowledge or skills acquisition. These formats include interactive multimedia courses; case-based presentations149 ; integration of ACLS or PALS content into a larger curriculum such as medical student or resident training 137,130,131 ; noncomputer-based, self-directed learning 132 ; problem-based learning 153.154 ; or combination of resuscitation courses with other programs such as Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS).It is reasonable to consider alternative course scheduling formats for advanced life support courses (eg, ACLS or PALS), provided acceptable programmatic evaluation is conducted and learners meet course objectives (Class IIa, LOE B).\n\n【14】##Post-Course Assessment\n\n【15】Studies have shown poor correlation between written tests used in resuscitation courses and clinical skills evaluations.  A written test should not be used exclusively to assess learner competence following an advanced life support course (Class I, LOE B).\nAssessment used as an instructional tool at the end of resuscitation training has been shown to improve retention of skills at 2 weeks 160 and showed a trend toward improvement at six months.End-of-course assessment may be useful in", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": "\n## Core Aha Ecc Educational Concepts\nTable 1.\n", "block_text_old": "\n## Core Aha Ecc Educational Concepts Table 1.\n", "raw_context": [{"text": "Core AHA ECC Educational Concepts", "bbox": [114.0, 82.0, 295.0, 97.0]}, {"text": "Table 1.", "bbox": [61.0, 84.0, 104.0, 97.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [60.0, 81.0, 294.0, 96.0], "position": 3, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n ● Simplification - Course content should be simplified in both the presentation of the content and the breadth of content in a single course in order to facilitate accomplishment of course objectives. 22 , 24 , 25 • Consistency - Course content and skill demonstrations should be presented in a consistent manner.

These tools are used to control the parts of the tongue and mouth affected by the condition. Patients may find it difficult to keep the mouth open for very long. Also, they may have issues swallowing and controlling their tongue, which is why this equipment is used.\n\n【2】Here are some tips to prevent dental issues if you wear dentures:\n\n【3】1. The use of a mouthwash should be a vital part of your daily routine.\n\n【4】2. In order to avoid any sores, it is always a good idea to rinse your mouth with warm water once you have finished your meal.\n\n【5】3. Always take small bites of food and try to involve both sides of the mouth while chewing.\n\n【6】4. If you are experiencing major difficulty while swallowing food, you should have semi solid food such as pudding, yogurt, or jelly.

Collins\n\n【5】参考删除-2:<u>arge quantum computers could in principle handle some of the toughest computing problems, such as factoring numbers to break encrypted messages—answering those questions in seconds instead of the centuries that today's computers would require. But quantum computers are extraordinarily difficult to build; they rely on exquisitely controlled interactions among fragile quantum states. Do they have to? Recently Ian A. Walmsley and his co-workers at the University of Rochester demonstrated that ordinary, classical light waves can perform as efficiently as one class of quantum computer.\nThe Rochester experiment searched a sorted 50-element database. An ordinary computer doing a binary search of such a database would need to query the database six times (enough to search 64 elements: 2 6 = 64). In 1997 Lov K. Grover of Bell Laboratories proved that a quantum computer only has to query once, no matter how large the database.\nWalmsley's group used a light pulse in an interferometer, a device that gives light waves a choice of two paths to follow. Along one path, a diffraction grating splits the pulse apart into its broad range of frequencies, like white light through a prism. The 50 elements of the database correspond to 50 bands of that spectrum. The database itself is represented by an acousto-optic modulator through which the light passes. The modulator imprints a phase shift (that is, it moves the positions of the peaks and troughs of the light wave) on just one of the 50 bands. In essence, each band of the light \"looks at\" a different database entry (a different part of the modulator), and only one \"finds\" the target. When the pulse is recombined with light from the other arm of the in- terferometer, the phase-shifted band alone shines brightly into a spectrometer, which reads off the result. Only the wave nature of light, not its quantum features, is used.\nThe experiment is similar to established methods of optical signal processing that, for example, pass beams through holograms.\nWhat's new is that it directly exemplifies a general result that Walmsley and his colleagues demonstrated theoretically late last year. \"For every machine that uses [only] quantum interference,\" Walmsley explains, \"there is an equivalent, equally efficient one that uses classical optical interference.\" Reading out a result on a quantum computer necessarily involves detection of particles, and the extra device components and computational steps for that process eliminate the quantum computer's advantage. According to Emanuel H. Knill of Los Alamos National Laboratory, that insight provides a new perspective \"on the relationship between computing with waves and quantum computing.\"\nThe most powerful quantum algorithms, such as fast factoring, however, require an additional quantum feature: so-called entanglement of the states of many particles. Classical waves cannot emulate those algorithms efficiently, but light turns out to be well suited to such true quantum computation in another way. In theory, a full-power quantum computer can be built by sending individual photons through simple linear optical elements, such as beam splitters and phase shifters. Such an approach was proposed in 1997, but those early designs needed exponentially more optical elements as the number of qubits increased—utterly impractical for any but the smallest devices.\nIn January, Knill, his colleague Raymond\nLaflamme and Gerard J. Milburn of the University of Queensland in Australia exhibited a design whose circuit complexity would increase in linear proportion, not exponentially.\nUnlike the Rochester experiment, this scheme relies on quantum effects of individual photons navigating paths through the device but avoids the need for nonlinear interactions between photons, something only readily achieved at very high intensities or with extraordinary equipment such as resonant cavities\n</u>", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": "\nThree levels of computational ability are, from weakest

One group followed the traditional food pyramid with 60% of the calories from carbohydrates while the second group followed the Atkins diet.\n\n【6】After one year, Atkins participants had a greater increase in the good HDL cholesterol and a larger drop in triglyceride than the high carb group.\nThe leader of the study, Gary Foster said, \"Our initial findings suggest that low carb diets may not have the adverse effects we anticipated.\"\n\n【7】Conventional wisdom has dictated for years that saturated fat and cholesterol were dangerous and unhealthy, contributing to coronary heart disease. This led most health professionals to condemn low carb diets that allowed large amounts of saturated fat.\n\n【8】This belief is now being questioned. Many authors such as Mary Enig and Uffe\nRashnkov have presented compelling cases that dietary cholesterol and saturated fat do not cause heart disease. The latest research seems to confirm this. However, many factors affected the results of these new studies.\n\n【9】In some studies, the subjects did not follow the Atkins Diet to exact specifications and never entered ketosis, so conclusions about saturated fat, dietary cholesterol, ketosis and coronary health cannot be drawn yet. In other studies, cholesterollowering drugs were used. And in still others, some subjects actually showed increases in total cholesterol. Those who did show improvements may have previously been on a high refined sugar, high saturated fat diet and dropping the sugar was one step in the right direction. Furthermore, some of the drop in blood cholesterol could be attributed to the decrease in body weight.\n\n【10】Clearly, you can't lump all dietary fats into the same category. Processed and chemically altered trans fats have been condemned by virtually every health and nutrition expert on the planet. Other fats, like salmon and fatty fish, are among the healthiest and cardio-protective foods you can eat.

Therefore, chest compressions should be the highest priority and the initial action when starting CPR in the adult victim of sudden cardiac arrest. The phrase \"push hard and push fast\" emphasizes some of these critical components of chest compression. High-quality CPR is important not only at the onset but throughout the course of resuscitation. Defibrillation and advanced care should be interfaced in a way that minimizes any interruption in CPR.Rapid defibrillation is a powerful predictor of successful resuscitation following VF SCA. 7.8 Efforts to reduce the interval from collapse to defibrillation can potentially improve survival in both out-of-hospital and in-hospital settings.8Depending on the setting and circumstances, earlier defibrillation may be achieved by a variety of strategies that include rescuers who are laypersons, nontraditional first responders, police, emergency medical services (EMS) professionals, and hospital professionals. 9–12 One of these strategies is the use of an AED. The AED correctly assesses heart rhythm, enabling a rescuer who is not trained in heart rhythm interpretation to accurately provide a potentially lifesaving shock to a victim of SCA.Immediate recognition and activation , early CPR , and rapid defibrillation (when appropriate) are the first three\nBLS links in the adult Chain of Survival. BLS care in the out-of-hospital setting is often provided by laypersons who may be involved in a resuscitation attempt only once in their lives. Thus, creating an effective strategy to translate BLS skills to real-world circumstances presents a challenge. This section updates the adult BLS guidelines with the goal of incorporating new scientific information while acknowledging the challenges of real-world application. Everyone, regardless of training or experience, can potentially be a lifesaving rescuer.\nThe rest of this chapter is organized in sections that address the emergency response system, adult BLS sequence, adult\nBLS skills, use of an AED, special resuscitation situations, and the quality of BLS. The \"Adult BLS Sequence\" section provides an overview and an abridged version of the BLS sequence. The \"Adult BLS Skills\" section provides greater detail regarding individual CPR skills and more information about Hands-Only (compression-only) CPR. The \"Special\nResuscitation Situations\" section addresses acute coronary syndromes, stroke, hypothermia, and foreign body airway obstruction. Because of increasing interest in monitoring and ensuring the quality of CPR, the last section focuses on the quality of BLS.\n\n【1】##Activating The Emergency Response System\n\n【2】Emergency medical dispatch is an integral component of the EMS response.Bystanders (lay responders) should immediately call their local emergency number to initiate a response anytime they find an unresponsive victim. Because dispatcher\nCPR instructions substantially increase the likelihood of bystander CPR performance and improve survival from cardiac arrest, all dispatchers should be appropriately trained to provide telephone CPR instructions (Class I, LOE B). \nWhen dispatchers ask bystanders to determine if breathing is present, bystanders often misinterpret agonal gasps or information can result in failure by 911 dispatchers to instruct bystanders to initiate CPR for a victim of cardiac arrest. \nTo help bystanders recognize cardiac arrest, dispatchers should inquire about a victim's absence of consciousness and quality of breathing (normal versus not normal). Dispatchers should be specifically educated in recognition of abnormal breathing in order to improve recognition of gasping and cardiac arrest (Class I, LOE B). Notably, dispatchers should be aware that brief generalized seizures may be the first manifestation of cardiac arrest.Dispatchers should recommend CPR for unresponsive victims who are not breathing normally because most are in cardiac arrest and the frequency of serious injury from chest compressions in the nonarrest group is very low (Class I, LOE B).In summary, in addition to activating professional emergency responders, the dispatcher should ask straightforward questions about whether the patient is conscious and breathing normally in order to identify patients with possible cardiac arrest. The dispatcher should also provide CPR instructions to help bystanders initiate CPR when cardiac arrest is suspected.\nBecause it is easier for rescuers receiving telephone CPR instructions to perform Hands-Only (compression-only) CPR than conventional CPR (compressions plus rescue breathing), dispatchers should instruct untrained lay rescuers to provide Hands-Only CPR for adults with SCA (Class I, LOE B).While Hands-Only CPR instructions have broad applicability, instances remain when rescue breaths are critically important.\nDispatchers should include rescue breathing in their telephone CPR instructions to bystanders treating adult and pediatric victims with a high likelihood of an asphyxial cause of arrest (eg, drowning).The EMS system quality improvement process, including review of the quality of dispatcher CPR instructions provided to specific callers, is considered an important component of a high-quality lifesaving program (Class IIa, LOE B).\n\n【3】##Adult Bls Sequence\n\n【4】The steps of BLS consist of a series of sequential assessments and actions, which are illustrated in the new simplified BLS algorithm . The intent of the algorithm is to present the steps of BLS in a logical and concise manner that is easy for all types of rescuers to learn, remember and perform.\nThese actions have traditionally been presented as a sequence of distinct steps to help a single rescuer prioritize actions.\nHowever, many workplaces and most EMS and in-hospital resuscitations involve teams of providers who should perform several actions simultaneously (eg, one rescuer activates the emergency response system while another begins chest compressions, and a third either provides ventilations or retrieves the bag-mask for rescue breathing, and a fourth retrieves and sets up a defibrillator).\n\n【5】##Immediate Recognition And Activation Of The Emergency Response System\n\n【6】If a lone rescuer finds an unresponsive adult (ie, no movement or response to stimulation) or witnesses an adult who suddenly collapses, after ensuring that the scene is safe, the rescuer should check for a response by tapping the victim on", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": " depends on these compressions.

What Is Asthma?\n\n【5】Asthma is a chronic lung (respiratory) condition. From a patient's perspective, it is characterized by symptoms of varying intensity and frequency. Asthma symptoms are related to the lungs and to breathing. Some people with asthma have very mild disease and have no symptoms for much of the year. Individuals whose asthma is at the other end of the asthma spectrum may require several daily lung medications taken on a regular basis in order to normalize lung function and attain a symptom-free state. In its most severe \"life-threatening\" manifestation, asthma can be responsible for recurrent hospitalizations, severely compromised quality of life, and even death. Physicians who specialize in asthma care firmly believe that even the most severely affected asthma sufferers can be successfully treated. With proper medical care and cooperation between patient and physician, asthmatics should lead a full and satisfying life.\n\n【6】##2. How Many Americans Have Asthma?\n\n【7】Asthma is a very common lung disease.

The following have been considered in recommending a compression-to-ventilation ratio of 30:2 for single rescuers:\n•Evidence from manikin studies shows that lone rescuers cannot deliver the desired number of compressions per minute with the compression-to-ventilation ratio of 5:1 that was previously recommended (2000 and earlier).  For the lone rescuer, manikin studies show that a ratio of 30:2 yields more chest compressions than a 15:2 ratio with no, or minimal, increase in rescuer fatigue. \n•Volunteers recruited at an airport to perform single-rescuer layperson CPR on an adult manikin had less \"no flow time\"\n (ie, arrest time without chest compressions, when no blood flow is generated) with 30:2 compared with a 15:2 ratio•An observational human study 70 comparing resuscitations by firefighters prior to and following the change from 15:2 to 30:2 compression-to-ventilation ratio reported more chest compressions per minute with a 30:2 ratio; ROSC was unchanged.\n•Animal studies 71–73 show that coronary perfusion pressure, a major determinant of success in resuscitation, rapidly declines when chest compressions are interrupted; once compressions are resumed, several chest compressions are needed to restore coronary perfusion pressure. Thus, frequent interruptions of chest compressions prolong the duration of low coronary perfusion pressure and flow.\nManikin studies, 25as well as in- and out-of-hospital adult human studies, 33,34,75 have documented long interruptions in chest compressions. Adult studieshave also demonstrated that these interruptions reduce the likelihood of ROSC.\n\n【3】##Activate Emergency Response System\nIf There Are 2 Rescuers, One Should Start Cpr Immediately\n\n【4】and the other should activate the emergency response system (in most locales by phoning 911) and obtain an\nAED, if one is available. Most infants and children with cardiac arrest have an asphyxial rather than a VF arrest 3 . 9 . 12 ; therefore 2 minutes of CPR are recommended before the lone rescuer activates the emergency response system and gets an AED if one is nearby. The lone rescuer should then return to the victim as soon as possible and use the AED (if available) or resume CPR, starting with chest compressions. Continue with cycles of 30 compressions to 2 ventilations until emergency response rescuers arrive or\n##Bls Sequence For Healthcare Providers And\nOthers Trained In 2-Rescuer Cpr\n\n【5】For the most part the sequence of BLS for healthcare providers is similar to that for laypeople with some variation as indicated below . Healthcare providers are more likely to work in teams and less likely to be lone rescuers. Activities described as a series of individual sequences are often performed simultaneously (eg, chest compressions and preparing for rescue breathing) so there is less significance regarding which is performed first.\nIt is reasonable for healthcare providers to tailor the sequence of rescue actions to the most likely cause of arrest.\nFor example, if the arrest is witnessed and sudden (eg, sudden collapse in an adolescent or a child identified at high risk for arrhythmia or during an athletic event), the healthcare provider may assume that the victim has suffered a sudden\nVF–cardiac arrest and as soon as the rescuer verifies that the child is unresponsive and not breathing (or only gasping) the rescuer should immediately phone the emergency response system, get the AED and then begin CPR and use the AED. (Class IIa LOE C). 2 , 7 , 79\n\n【6】##Assess The Need For Cpr\n\n【7】If the victim is unresponsive and is not breathing (or only gasping), send someone to activate the emergency response system.\n\n【8】##Pulse Check\n\n【9】If the infant or child is unresponsive and not breathing (gasps do not count as breathing), healthcare providers may take up to 10 seconds to attempt to feel for a pulse (brachial in an infant and carotid or femoral in a child). If, within 10 seconds, you don't feel a pulse or are not sure if you feel a pulse, begin chest compressions (Class IIa, LOE C). It can be difficult to feel a pulse, especially in the heat of an emergency, and studies show that healthcare providers, 80 as well as lay rescuers, are unable to reliably detect a pulse. 81–95\n\n【10】##Inadequate Breathing With Pulse\n\n【11】If there is a palpable pulse ≥ 60 per minute but there is inadequate breathing, give rescue breaths at a rate of about 12 to 20 breaths per minute (1 breath every 3 to 5 seconds) until spontaneous breathing resumes . Reassess the pulse about every 2 minutes (Class IIa, LOE B) but spend no more than 10 seconds doing so.\n\n【12】##Bradycardia With Poor Perfusion\nIf The Pulse Is < 60 Per Minute And There Are Signs Of Poor\n\n【13】perfusion (ie, pallor, mottling, cyanosis) despite support of oxygenation and ventilation, begin chest compressions.\nBecause cardiac output in infancy and childhood largely depends on heart rate, profound bradycardia with poor perfusion is an indication for chest compressions because cardiac arrest is imminent and beginning CPR prior to full cardiac arrest results in improved survival.The absolute heart rate at which chest compressions should be initiated is unknown; the recommendation to provide chest com", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": " short a pause in chest compressions as possible after each set of 30 compressions (Class IIa, LOE C).", "block_text_old": " short a pause in chest compressions as possible after each set of 30 compressions (Class IIa, LOE C).", "raw_context": [{"text": "short a pause in chest compressions as possible after each set", "bbox": [60.0, 84.0, 377.0, 99.0]}, {"text": "of 30 compressions (Class IIa, LOE C).", "bbox": [60.0, 100.0, 271.0, 113.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [59.0, 83.0, 376.0, 112.0], "position": 3, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n## Coordinate Chest Compressions And Breathing\n", "block_text_old": "\n## Coordinate Chest Compressions And Breathing\n", "raw_context": [{"text": "Coordinate Chest Compressions and Breathing", "bbox": [60.0, 136.0, 352.0, 151.0]}], "block_type": "Section-header", "full_blocks": [59.0, 135.0, 351.0, 150.0], "position": 4, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n\nAfter giving 2 breaths, immediately give 30 compressions.\nThe lone rescuer should continue this cycle of 30 compressions and 2 breaths for approximately 2 minutes (about 5 cycles) before leaving the victim to activate the emergency response system and obtain an automated external defibrillator (AED) if one is nearby.\nThe ideal compression-to-ventilation ratio in infants and children is unknown.

It may be beneficial to attempt to correct hypercarbia. Administration of a bolus of isotonic fluid may be useful to maintain preload to the systemic ventricle. If intravenous or inhaled therapy to decrease pulmonary hypertension has been interrupted, reinstitute it (Class IIa, LOE C).

If, after suctioning, the chest does not expand with ventilation, remove the tracheostomy tube and replace it or insert a same-sized endotracheal tube, if available, into the tracheal stoma. If a clean tube is unavailable, perform mouth-to-stoma or mask-to-stoma ventilations. If the upper airway is patent, bag-mask ventilation via the nose and mouth may be effective if the tracheal stoma is manually occluded.\n\n【6】##Toxicological Emergencies\n\n【7】Overdose with local anesthetics, cocaine, narcotics, tricyclic antidepressants, calcium channel blockers, and β -adrenergic blockers may require specific treatment modalities in addition to the usual resuscitative measures.\n\n【8】##Local Anesthetic\n\n【9】Local anesthetics are used topically, intravenously, subcutaneously, and in epidural or other catheters for delivery of regional analgesia. The toxicity of local anesthetics is well recognized in children; they may cause changes in mental status, seizures, arrhythmias, or even cardiac arrest in settings of overdose or inadvertent vascular administration.

In cases of severe intoxication increase the pH to 7.50 to 7.55. 375.384 Do not administer Class IA (quinidine, procainamide), Class IC (flecainide, propafenone), or Class\nIII (amiodarone and sotalol) antiarrhythmics, which may exacerbate cardiac toxicity (Class III, LOE C)•For hypotension, give boluses (10 mL/kg each) of normal saline.

Also refers to the process whereby the lungs exchange gases, more specifically, oxygen (O 2 ) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) at the level of the alveolus and the alveolar-capillary membrane.\n\n【2】Respiratory failure: A state or illness in which the lungs become incapable of respiration. They become unable to provide the body with needed oxygen  , and cannot rid the body of accumulated carbon dioxide and metabolic waste products. Respiratory failure can be acute, as after a car accident, for example, or chronic, as in the case of emphysema. Uncontrolled asthma can result in progressive respiratory failure, a true medical emergency. Left untreated, respiratory failure is fatal.\n\n【3】Rhinitis: Refers to an inflammation of the nasal lining. Symptoms include: an irritated, \"runny\" nose and itching.\nRhinitis can be due to different causes including allergy. Allergic rhinitis is seen in \"hay fever,\" pet allergies, and ragweed allergy, for example.\n\n【4】Rigid bronchoscopy: A type of bronchoscopy  performed with a specialized surgical instrument called a rigid bronchoscope. Rigid bronchoscopy requires general anesthesia and is indicated under different circumstances than flexible bronchoscopy.\n\n【5】Sinus: The sinuses are air-filled cavities within the human skull. Adults have several sinuses, named by location: the frontal, ethmoid, sphenoid, and maxillary sinuses. The sinuses continue to form after birth; consequently, the frontal and sphenoid sinuses are not well developed in children.\n\n【6】Sinusitis: An inflammation of the lining of sinuses, due most commonly to either infection (viral or bacterial sinusitis), or allergy (allergic sinusitis).\nSpacer: The name for a device that facilitates the inhalation of medicine from a metered dose inhaler (MDI).\nThere are different brands and designs of spacers on the market. Spacers allow you to \"space\" the two required steps for correct MDI use over time.\n\n【7】Correct MDI technique requires simultaneously activating the MDI canister, releasing medicine, and inhaling as deeply as you can. Adding a spacer permits you to first activate the medicine, and then inhale deeply.\nSpacer use makes it easier to use the MDI medicine, enhances medication delivery to the lungs, and reduces deposition of medicine on the voice box.\nThe last fact is important as deposition of inhaler medicine in the throat and on the vocal cords not only wastes medicine, but can also lead to throat irritation and hoarseness. Holding chambers are similar to spacer devices.\nSome use the terms interchangeably.\nSpirometry: Spirometry is one of the PFTs, and is the most important\nPFT in the setting of asthma diagnosis and treatment. Spirometry measures the flow of air from the lungs as a person forcefully and fully exhales from a deep inspiration.

Space Closure Loops\n\n【9】This orthodontic space closure technique has been used since 1940. A loop is a spring or spiral made on an arch wire and its objective is to move teeth in an individual or collective manner. Loops must exert continuous but controlled force, with a safety margin that auto limits its function after some time and should not permanently damage teeth or supporting tissues.  A base and two vertical or longitudinal arms constitute loops. a) b) The base can have a straight or curved form.\nThe arms. The arm extension determines the magnitude of the force that is exerted by the loop; the larger the loop, the less force is exerted. The height oscillates between five and seven millimeters. A two millimeter increase in height diminishes the force 50%. A limitation of the height of the loop is the depth of the buccal fold, because we can lesion the fold if the loop is too high.  The criteria used for loop fabrication is based upon two vectors: a horizontal and a vertical one, and from these vectors the different designs are made.\n\n【10】Loops are divided in horizontal, vertical or mixed loops, and may be open or closed.\n\n【11】Horizontal loops have a mechanical action expressed in a vertical plane, they are ideal for mesiodistal movement (space closure).  Vertical loops have a mechanical action expressed in the horizontal plane, they are ideal for intrusive and extrusive movements.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": " coil.

If the rhythm is sinus tachycardia, search for and treat reversible causes.\n\n【5】##Supraventricular Tachycardia\n\n【6】•Monitor rhythm during therapy to evaluate the effect of interventions. The choice of therapy is determined by the patient's degree of hemodynamic instability.\n\n【7】•Attempt vagal stimulation  first, unless the patient is hemodynamically unstable or the procedure will unduly delay chemical or electric cardioversion (Class IIa, LOE C).\nIn infants and young children, apply ice to the face without occluding the airway. \nIn older children, carotid sinus massage or Valsalva maneuvers are safe.•One method for performing a Valsalva maneuver is to have the child blow through a narrow straw.Do not apply pressure to the eye because this can damage the retina.\n\n【8】•Pharmacologic cardioversion with adenosine  is very effective with minimal and transient side effects.  If\nIV/IO access is readily available, adenosine is the drug of choice (Class I, LOE C). Side effects are usually transient.  Administer IV/ IO adenosine 0.1 mg/ kg using 2 syringes connected to a T-connector or stopcock; give adenosine rapidly with 1 syringe and immediately flush with ≥ 5 mL of normal saline with the other. An IV/IO dose of Verapamil, 0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg is also effective in terminating SVT in older children, 305,306 but it should not be used in infants without expert consultation (Class III, LOE C) because it may cause potential myocardial depression, hypotension, and cardiac arrest.•If the patient is hemodynamically unstable or if adenosine is ineffective, perform electric synchronized cardioversion . Use sedation, if possible. Start with a dose of 0.5 to 1 J/kg. If unsuccessful, increase the dose to 2 J/kg (Class IIb, LOE C). If a second shock is unsuccessful or the tachycardia recurs quickly, consider amiodarone or procainamide before a third shock.\n\n【9】•Consider amiodarone 5 mg/kg IO/IVor procainamide 15 mg/kg IO/IV 236 for a patient with SVT unresponsive to vagal maneuvers and adenosine and/or electric cardioversion; for hemodynamically stable patients, expert consultation is strongly recommended prior to administration (Class IIb, LOE C). Both amiodarone and procainamide must be infused slowly (amiodarone over 20 to 60 minutes and procainamide over 30 to 60 minutes), depending on the urgency, while the ECG and blood pressure are monitored.\nadditional doses . Avoid the simultaneous use of amiodarone and procainamide without expert consultation.\n\n【10】Wide-Complex (>0.09 Second) Tachycardia \nWide-complex tachycardia often originates in the ventricles (ventricular tachycardia) but may be supraventricular in origin.Because all arrhythmia therapies have a potential for serious adverse effects, consultation with an expert in pediatric arrhythmias is strongly recommended before treating children who are hemodynamically stable.\nThe following are important considerations in treating widecomplex tachycardia in hemodynamically stable patients:\n•Adenosine may be useful in differentiating SVT from VT and converting wide-complex tachycardia of supraventricular origin . Adenosine should be considered only if the rhythm is regular and the QRS is monomorphic. Do not use adenosine in patients with known Wolff-Parkinson- White syndrome and wide-complex tachycardia.\n\n【11】•Consider electric cardioversion after sedation using a starting energy dose of 0.5 to 1 J/kg. If that fails, increase the dose to 2 J/kg (Class IIb, LOE C) .\nConsider pharmacologic conversion with either intravenous amiodarone (5 mg/kg over 20 to 60 minutes) or procainamide (15 mg/kg given over 30 to 60 minutes) while monitoring ECG and blood pressure. Stop or slow the infusion if there is a decline in blood pressure or the QRS widens . Expert consultation is strongly recommended prior to administration.\n\n【12】In hemodynamically unstable patients:\n\n【13】•Electric cardioversion is recommended using a starting energy dose of 0.5 to 1 J/kg. If that fails, increase the dose to 2 J/kg (Class 1, LOE C).\n\n【14】##Special Resuscitation Situations\n\n【15】##Septic Shock\n\n【16】•There appears to be no clinically important difference in survival of children who are treated for septic shock with colloid compared with those who are treated with isotonic crystalloid solutions.  Although colloid may be beneficial as part of a protocol-driven strategy, 315 it is reasonable to use isotonic crystalloid solution as the initial fluid for the treatment of septic shock (Class IIa, LOE C).\nMonitoring the central venous (superior vena cava) oxygen saturation (ScvO2) may be useful to titrate therapy in infants and children with septic shock. Protocol-driven or \"goal-directed\" therapy, with a target ScvO2 ≥ 70% appears to improve patient survival in severe sepsis (Class IIb, LOE B). \nEarly assisted ventilation may be considered as part of a protocol-driven strategy for septic shock (Class IIb, LOE C). \n•Etomidate has been shown to facilitate endotracheal intu- bation in infants and children with minimal hemodynamic effect, 320–322 but do not use it routinely in pediatric patients", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": " –Assess and support airway, breathing, and circulation –Provide oxygen.\n\n–Attach monitor/defibrillator.\n\n–Obtain vascular access.\n\n–Evaluate 12-lead ECG and assess QRS duration (Box 2).", "block_text_old": " –Assess and support airway, breathing, and circulation –Provide oxygen.\n\n–Attach monitor/defibrillator.\n\n–Obtain vascular access.\n\n–Evaluate 12-lead ECG and assess QRS duration (Box 2).", "raw_context": [{"text": "–Assess and support airway, breathing, and circulation", "bbox": [74.0, 84.0, 361.0, 99.0]}, {"text": "–Provide oxygen.", "bbox": [73.0, 100.0, 166.0, 114.0]}, {"text": "–Attach monitor/defibrillator.", "bbox": [73.0, 116.0, 226.0, 130.0]}, {"text": "–Obtain vascular access.", "bbox": [74.0, 132.0, 203.0, 146.0]}, {"text": "–Evaluate 12-lead ECG and assess QRS duration (Box 2).", "bbox": [74.0, 147.0, 376.0, 162.0]}], "block_type": "Text", "full_blocks": [72.0, 83.0, 375.0, 161.0], "position": 2, "table_info": {}}, {"block_text": "\n\n\nNarrow-Complex (≤0.09 Second) Tachycardia\nEvaluation of a 12-lead ECG (Box 3) and the patient's clinical presentation and history (Boxes 4 and 5) should help differentiate sinus tachycardia from supraventricular tachycardia (SVT).

In the late 1960s, Dr. Max Samter published a series of articles characterizing the triad and further elucidated the nature of the aspirin intolerance. Dr. Samter greatly advanced knowledge in the area, and perhaps in recognition of the fact, the asthmatic triad is also known as \"Samter's Syndrome.\"\n\n【1】Aspirin, or acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is a widely prescribed and consumed drug with beneficial anti-inflammatory, anti-fever, and pain-relieving properties . It is very useful, as well, as a mild \"blood thinner\" in the treatment of heart diseases and in certain types of stroke prevention. The consumption of aspirin in the United States has been estimated at approximately 80 billion tablets per year. In many ways, aspirin is an ideal medication: inexpensive, safe, and highly effective . In some people with asthma, however, aspirin is a dangerous medication. The term \"aspirininduced asthma,\" or AIA, refers to the development of wheezing and bronchoconstriction after the ingestion of aspirin, or aspirin-like products called NSAIDs—nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. AIA usually occurs in the setting of severe, chronic asthma and is more common among females. Approximately 10% to 20% of people with asthma also have AIA.

Many studies done in children with posterior cross bite have encountered a very high prevalence of finger sucking habits in these patients. The proportion of girls with posterior cross bite is slightly higher than boys with the same problem. This difference is attributed to the fact that girls have a higher frequency of finger sucking habit.\n\n【1】Another suction habit is pacifier habit. The prevalence of posterior cross bite in patients in the mixed dentition that have a suction habit is greater, and this habit has been catalogued as an important etiological factor in the development of this malocclusion.\n\n【2】According to Larsson, posterior cross bite usually disappears spontaneously in the permanent dentition, due to the fact that the habit is interrupted before the eruption of the premolars and permanent canines.  Infantile deglutition: the typical deglutition pattern of a child before teeth erupt is characterized by the fact that the tongue is placed between the gingival pads and is projected forward. Deglutition is controlled by the contact of the lips, the tongue and the perioral muscles.The persistence of infantile deglutition can be provoked by hypertrophic tonsils, mouth breathing or psychological sucking habit.\nThe tongue is interposed between the teeth to stabilize the mandible and to seal the oral cavity. The lack of tongue pressure and strong pressure of the buccinator muscles provoke a deficient transversal development of the maxilla, which is usually associated with an anterior open bite because the anterior teeth have not erupted yet.  Lingual interposition: the persistence of this habit  is similar to the one just described, but the action of the tongue is prolonged through time. The role of the tongue in the etiology of malocclusions is related with a series of variables, like position, pressure, volume and time.\n\n【3】##3. Interferences And Occlusal Factors\n\n【4】The anatomic characteristics of teeth serve as a guide to establish a correct occlusion, so any type of alteration in teeth anatomy or in the eruption sequence can provoke the development of posterior cross bites. The most common cause of unilateral posterior cross bites is a functional deviation of the mandible, generally produced by occlusal interferences or premature contacts. The presence of occlusal interferences in the deciduous canines that are too long may be the cause of cross bites, because these teeth provoke a lateral deviation of the mandible during closure.\n\n【5】##4. Trauma\n\n【6】Dental trauma in the deciduous dentition can displace the primary teeth or the buds of the permanent teeth, provoking an anomalous inclination of the upper teeth toward the palate and the apparition of a dental posterior cross bite. The same can occur if the trauma provokes the displacement of the permanent teeth.\n\n【7】Other types of trauma can provoke mandibular or condyle fractures, that cause grave facial asymmetries in patients that are growing and the apparition of skeletal cross bites•16\n•A third group of trauma are the ones caused during birth with the manipulation of instruments.\n\n【8】##5. Other Causes\n\n【9】Some other factors exist that in an indirect way can favor the presence of posterior cross bites. One of them is ankyloglossia. A short lingual frenum maintains the tongue in a low position, favoring the apparition of maxillary compression.\n\n【10】##Types Of Posterior Cross Bites\n\n【11】Posterior cross bites can be: o Bilateral, which affects both maxillary hemiarches.\nUnilateral, affecting the right or the left hemiarch.\nOf an isolated tooth.  o o The following classification was proposed by Moyers , still being applied today.\n\n【12】##1. Functional Cross Bite\n\n【13】These are produced when there is an occlusal interference that displaces the mandible to the left or the right during the last phase of closure.\nThey are unilateral cross bites.\nII \nThere may be a chin deviation. \nLower dental midline deviation as a consequence of  the mandibular deviation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"raw_info": [{"block_text": " greater force, can affect the alveolar process.
