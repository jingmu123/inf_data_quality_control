##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Faster Than A Snail’S Pace

Animals are often driven from their native territories by habitat destruction or severe climate change. Acanthinucella spirata, a ma-删除换行1:<u>| |</u>QUICK, from evolution's point of view. rine snail common along the California coast, was one of many species that survived the last ice age in the relatively warm, southernmost part of their ranges. The snail recolonized northern coastlines about 12,000 years ago as the ice released its grip on North America. But in a relatively short time, the snails' shells evolved into shapes that had never before existed, most likely in response to their new environments.
The study's authors, writing in the June 1 Science , offer a caution to conservationists who relocate endangered species in efforts to save them: when you move a species around, you may quickly end up with a whole different beast.

【7】Turning a liquid into a solid usually means tossing it into the freezer for a while. Researchers at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris, though, have effected that phase change with acoustic waves. They blasted liquid helium with a burst of one-megahertz ultrasound, producing intense pressure levels (about 200 decibels) in the liquid helium. Acoustic waves consist of alternating regions of high and low pressure—compression followed by rarefaction.

During rarefaction, the solid melted even more quickly. The work, appearing in the June 11 Physical Review Letters , helps physicists understand the stability of supercooled or overpressurized liquids.
