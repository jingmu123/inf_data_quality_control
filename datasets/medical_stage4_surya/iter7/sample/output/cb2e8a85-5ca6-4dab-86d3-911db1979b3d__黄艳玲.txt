【7】7. The Tandem is an effective tool for the correction of mild to moderate skeletal Class III malocclu删除16:<u>¬ </u>sions, with a retrusive maxilla and a hypodivergent growth pattern. 删除1:<u>(5)</u> 8. The use of the Tandem produces an increase of the lower third of the face; this is due to the downward movement of the maxilla and the downward and backward movement of the mandible.

【8】9. It reduces the risk of a surgical procedure in the future.

【9】10. In general, skeletal Class III patients have a concave profile, a depressed nasomaxillary region, lower lip protrusion and a prominent mandible.

Clinically the anterior cross bites can correct in 3 to 4 months depending upon the severity of the malocclusion. 删除1:<u>(5)</u> 12. The maxilla can be placed forward between 2 mm to 4 mm in about 8 to 10 months of protraction, but the majority of orthopedic changes can be observed in the first 3 to 6 months of continuous treatment. 删除1:<u>(5)</u> 13. It is a very versatile appliance because it can be combined with fixed appliances during the maxillar protraction.
