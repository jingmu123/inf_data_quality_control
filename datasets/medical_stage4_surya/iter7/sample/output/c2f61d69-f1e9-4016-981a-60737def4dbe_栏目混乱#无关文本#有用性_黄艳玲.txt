##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Disposing Of删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Misfolded Proteins

【9】Abasic task of cells is to make proteins, which must fold properly in order to function. But sometimes cells botch the job, leading to misfolded proteins that are useless or even dangerous. How exactly most cells repair or destroy flawed proteins has remained somewhat elusive—until now. As reported in the January Nature Cell Biology , experiments revealed a component of the repair process that may participate in a cell's decision to fix or destroy a particular protein. Researchers found that a molecule called CHIP first prevented chaperones, which repair proteins, from trying to refold an unsalvageable protein, then subsequently transferred the hopeless case to a proteasome, which destroyed it.
These findings may help researchers develop new treatments for Alzheimer's disease and other kinds of neurogenerative disorders associated with an accumulation of misfolded proteins in cells.

Whether organic sediment from rivers makes it to the ocean had been unclear.

【16】Rivers should dump plenty of organic matter into the sea, replacing all the ocean's carbon in 4,000 to 6,000 years. But geochemical studies have suggested that little of the riverine carbon, derived from plants, actually makes it out. In the January 25 Nature , researchers report a possible solution. Using radiocarbon techniques on sediments collected from four rivers, they determined that bacteria may alter riverine carbon, making it indistinguishable from ocean carbon. Although it fills in details about the carbon cycle, the study deals with timescales too long to affect carbon dioxide– influenced global warming by humans. In fact, in February the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change raised the estimate of the world's temperature rise between 1990 and 2100 from 1.0 to 3.5 degrees Celsius to 1.4 to 5.8 degrees C.

【17】-Philip Yam

Your sense of self may lie in the right side of your brain. In the January 18 Nature , Julian删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Keenan and his Harvard Medical School colleagues numbed the right or left hemispheres of five epilepsy patients and then showed each a computer image of his or her own face blended with the face of Bill Clinton or Albert删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Einstein (for men) and Marilyn Monroe or Princess Diana (for women). Once the anesthesia wore off  patients had to choose which face they had seen. All five selected their own face when only their right hemispheres were active, but four out of the five said they had seen the famous face when only their left hemispheres were awake. —Alison McCook
