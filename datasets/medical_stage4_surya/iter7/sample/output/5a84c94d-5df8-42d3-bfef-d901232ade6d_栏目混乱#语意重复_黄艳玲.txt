ed asking, 'Can it do this, can it do that?,' and it was Gordon Moore who said we really don't have an alternative," recalls删除换行1:<u>| |</u>John Carruthers, who headed advanced technology research at Intel at the time.
Intel entered into a three-year contract (later extended to five) with an entity called the Virtual National Laboratory (VNL), which combined researchers and facilities from Lawrence Livermore,删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Sandia and Lawrence Berkeley national laboratories. Having one contract with three labs cut some of the red tape that usually discourages companies from seeking such collaborations. Later Intel brought in other chip manufacturers, including competitors AMD, Motorola,删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Micron and Infineon—and lithography equipment suppliers ASML and SVG.
In 1997, at the beginning of Intel's stepped-up involvement, looming technical difficulties caused EUV to be rated last out of four lithography technologies in a straw vote taken at an industry conference.
Although it bears some similarities to existing methods, EUV is different enough to make the average fabrication-line manag-

Conventional photolithography equipment projects ultraviolet light (usually at 248 or 193 nanometers) through a mask—a sheet of glass on which are traced a chip's circuit patterns. A series of lenses reduces the image to a quarter of its size. The image projected through the lenses is exposed in a chemical on the wafer. Another chemical treatment then etches away either the exposed or unexposed areas of the image, carving the circuit elements into the chip surface.
Things change at 13 nanometers, where extreme ultraviolet lithography earns its name. The mask and lenses, transparent at longer wavelengths, would absorb this radiation. So EUV uses mirrors for both the mask and the lenses. A laser trained on a jet of xenon gas creates a plasma that emits 13-nanometer radia- tion, which is focused onto a mask. The mask reflects the circuit pattern onto a series of curved mirrors that reduce the size of the image and focus it onto the wafer.
The 80 alternating layers of silicon and molybdenum that make up the mirrors and the mask have to be smoothed to single-atom tolerances. The entire circuitprinting process, moreover, has to be done in a vacuum because air itself absorbs radiation at this wavelength. And the mask will distort the image if it contains more than a handful of defects measuring even 50 nanometers, about 2,000 times narrower than the width of a human hair. The development team sometimes muses on ways to describe to the outside world the relative size of a 50- nanometer defect, comparing it to a search for a golf ball in a state the size of Maryland, a basketball in the state of Texas or a hair on a football field.
Physicists and engineers who designed and engineered nuclear weapons technology had to solve these challenges. Unlike删除换行1:<u>| |</u>AT&T, which conducted early development work on EUV at Bell Labs with about 30 employees, Intel has only five full-time employees at VNL's main facility at the Sandia laboratory in Livermore (although more than 10 others labor on developing proprietary mask designs and other EUV-related technology at several删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Intel facilities). "They're using us as an advanced development and research lab," says Richard H. Stulen, the virtual laboratory's chief operating officer.
The company kept a close eye on how decisions were made at the labs. If alternative methods were proposed for making lenses, Intel would press the research team to pick one, instead of testing the merits of both. "Nothing got spent that they didn't think would work," Freeman says. "They didn't do it Bell Labs style."
Intel also implemented the same detailed risk-management system that the compa- ny uses internally—essentially a rating system of things that could go wrong.
This flagged a list of about 200 problems, some of which the 150 national laboratories researchers who worked in the VNL might otherwise have downplayed.
At one meeting, the VNL staff mentioned that it would need to increase the power of the laser by a factor of 40, which raised a red flag for suppliers. "The chip equipment manufacturers rated this at a much higher risk than we had," Stulen says.
VNL researchers identified what they called "seven deadly showstoppers," but by late 1998, at another industry session, solutions to many of these problems— such as how to make supersmooth mirrors—had been found, propelling EUV into first place when it came time to vote.

【2】"The group went from having an attitude of 'Sure, sure, tell us you can do that' to placing us up front," Freeman says.
Intel has also brought a get-the-jobdone kind of urgency to laboratory employees unaccustomed to commercial deadlines. Peter J. Silverman, Intel's director of lithography capital equipment development, pushed forward by six to nine months the current circuit-printing demonstration and specified that the number of wafers produced by an EUV黄艳玲
