2. Skeletal Class III patients due to maxillary hypopla删除16:<u>¬ </u>sia.

【1】3. The patients must be preferably in the early mixed dentition.
The use of this appliance is indicated in cleft lip and palate patients.

##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Effects Produced By Face Mask Therapy l. Correction of discrepancies between centric occlu删除16:<u>¬ </u>sion and centric relation, most of all in pseudo Class删除换行1:<u>| |</u>III patients.
Skeletal protraction of the maxilla producing 1 mm to 3 mm of advancement.
Anterior movement of the maxillary teeth.
Lingual inclination of the lower incisors.
It redirects mandibular growth due to the downward and backward rotation of the mandible.
The lower facial height is increased.

【3】Point "A" is moved forward and the maxilla moves forward and downward.
The cheekbones increase their volume.

##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Advantages

1. The face mask is an effective tool for the treatment of skeletal Class III malocclusions that range from mild to moderate, with a retrusive maxilla and a hypodi删除16:<u>¬ </u>vergent growth pattern. 删除1:<u>(5)</u>删除换行1:<u>| |</u>It reduces the possibility of a future surgical intervention.
The acrylic skidding surfaces of the adhesion palatal expander help in the control of the vertical eruption of the molars. The main function of these surfaces is to produce a bite jump to uncross the bite and to facilitate maxillary protraction. 删除1:<u>(5)</u>删除换行1:<u>| |</u>The use of the face mask produces an increase of the lower third of the face, this is due to the downward movement of the maxilla and the downward and backward rotation of the mandible.
In general, patients with skeletal Class III present a concave profile, depressed nasomaxillar region, protrusion of the lower lip and a prominent man删除16:<u>¬ </u>dible. With the protraction of the maxilla with the face mask, the facial profile and the position of the lower lip are rectified. 删除1:<u>(5)</u>删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Clinically, the anterior cross bite can be corrected in 3 to 4 months depending upon the severity of the malocclusion. 删除1:<u>(5)</u>

【6】7. The maxilla can be forwarded between 2 mm to 4 mm in 8 to 12 months of protraction, but most of the orthopedic changes can be observed in the first 3 to 6 months of continuous treatment. 删除1:<u>(5)</u>

##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Disadvantages

【8】1. A faulty design of the chin support can cause lacera删除16:<u>¬ </u>tions or can irritate the skin of the chin furrow, and provoke root resorption of the lower incisors.

【9】2. For this appliance to be effective we need 100% patient cooperation.

【10】3. This appliance is not accepted by all patients.

4. The elastics can cause lip corner irritation.
The patient can refer sharp pain in the retromolar zone, because the pterygo-maxillar suture opens. 删除1:<u>(32)</u>删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Prolonged treatment time can undermine the degree of oral hygiene and cooperation of the patient. 删除1:<u>(5)</u>

【12】删除图片4:<u>Fig.删除26_2:<u></u> A very prolonged treatment time can make hygiene a bit more difficult favoring the accumulation of food particles.</u>

##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Recommendations

【14】1. For face mask therapy, we must first begin with the rapid expansion of the maxilla to disarticulate the suture system; within a week or 10 days after the expansion has begun we can place the face mask. This is to facilitate the protraction of the maxilla.

【15】2. The face mask is used generally until we have an overjet of 3 mm to 5 mm.
The skidding surfaces of the expander must cover the first and second deciduous molars and the first upper permanent molar.

【16】4. If the second permanent molars are present, we must extend the skidding surfaces to this tooth to prevent molar extrusion.王磊
