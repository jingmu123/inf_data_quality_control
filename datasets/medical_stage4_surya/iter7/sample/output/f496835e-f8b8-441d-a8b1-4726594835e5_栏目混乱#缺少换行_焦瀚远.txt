It is made with 0.036" round stainless steel wire in an "X" manner and it is cemented to all four superior molars.

【5】We need 0.036" round stainless steel wire, about 5 cm of it. This wire is bent with hollow chop pliers and adapted to the palatine vault.

【7】删除图片4:<u>Fig.删除26_2:<u></u> After the bend is done, the wire is adapted to the palatine vault.</u>

【8】Then this wire is adapted to fit around the second molars, and the distal bends are done. These bends are made as close as possible to the center of resistance of the molars.
This is the posterior part of the chromosome arch.
