He found open-reel tapes, some of them disintegrating, as well as correspondence confirming that many of the databases he sought had been erased during and after the war, as officials saw no reason to keep them. Thomas E. Brown, manager of archival services at the Electronic and Special Media Records Services Division of the National Archives, says some Vietnam air combat databases were never transferred to the National Archives from the Department of Defense. "I am certain that some databases related to air missions were destroyed," Brown adds. Although the National Archives had informal policies aimed at preserving electronic records as early as 1968, they were not officially enforced until years later.
Despite these setbacks, Stanley did find two useful tape databases at the National删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Archives that had been listed in the Rand index: the Combat Activities File had details about missions flown in Southeast删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Asia from October 1965 through December 1970, and the Southeast Asia Data- base documented missions flown between删除换行1:<u>| |</u>January 1970 and August 1975. These intact databases were created on IBM System 360 and System 370 mainframe computers using software called the National删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Military Command System Information删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Processing System 360 Formatted File System, or NIPS. Developed for the government by IBM in the 1960s, NIPS did what database software does: it created, structured, maintained and revised data files.
But the details of missions over Laos—on average, a planeload of bombs every eight minutes for nine years—were coded to save space because of the limited storage capacity of mainframes at the time. "What you have is nested data," Brown explains.

"You would have a fixed field with information about sorties and additional fields identifying each leg of the mission."
Further hindering Stanley's attempt to understand the databases was the scant documentation of changes in database codes. "Sometimes codes were reused and the data processors just assigned new val- ues to the codes," Brown says. "These changes were not always incorporated into the systems manuals, and early versions of the manuals were not always saved." In the Southeast Asia Database, for example, the National Archives has a manual dated 1975, but it is uncertain whether the information applies to earlier years. So simple coded data included nested information, and the codes themselves may have variable meanings.
In 1994 Stanley landed a $10,000 grant from the Department of Defense to complete a feasibility study of the data, still unaware that it would eventually help删除换行1:<u>| |</u>UXO Lao save lives. He enlisted the aid of Management Support Technology, the government contractor that eventually employed Sheinkman in Laos, to decipher the databases. The contractor then sought the help of a former IBM programmer who worked on the original database. The programmer created software to convert the NIPS data to a plain-text file readable by a modern personal computer. These ef-焦瀚远
