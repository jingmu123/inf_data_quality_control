Not all children with respiratory problems develop the same type of anomalies and patients with normal breathing patterns can show similar deformities that have been linked to mouth breathing. The fact that inadequate breathing can have more or less influence in the orofacial morphologic删除16:<u>¬ </u>functional pattern does not mean necessarily that the resulting alterations must be always the same.

【2】After a complete case evaluation we must refer the patient to an ear, nose and larynx specialist to resolve the nasal obstruction in case it exists. But sometimes, once the cause of mouth breathing is eliminated, the perioral muscles must be rehabilitated with functional exercises to promote adequate lip seal, so the way the patient breathes must be reeducated with respiratory exercises because the patient breathes through the mouth by habit. The muscle exercises must be done with a buccal shield or a Trainer. Both are going to obstruct the flow of air through the mouth, and, as a result, breathing must forcefully be done through the upper air ways. 删除1:<u>(23)</u> The stimulation of the upper air ways through respiratory exercises can have a positive influence upon the growth of contiguous bone structures. Due to the fact that nasal breathing is more difficult than mouth breathing, the buccal shield or the Trainer, provide a much more intense exercise to the breathing muscles.

【4】This habit is usually secondary to a finger or thumb habit or to an atypical deglutition pattern, because this type of patient has a great overjet, and consequently, the lower lip is placed behind the upper incisors maintaining or ag删除16:<u>¬ </u>gravating the condition. 删除1:<u>(10)</u>

【10】The best treatment option to eliminate lip interposition is the lip bumper; it is a fixed and passive appliance that has one or two acrylic shields on the anterior sector that sepa删除16:<u>¬ </u>rate the lower lip from the anterior teeth, not allowing the lip between the buccal aspects of the lower incisors and the palatine aspects of the upper incisors. This appliance will have a favorable influence in the development of the lower dental arch, because it will separate the lip from the anteroinferior teeth, producing spontaneous lower arch expansion. 删除1:<u>(9,10)</u>

【11】In the mixed dentition, aside the lip bumper, the 2 x 4 technique is used, by placing braces on the anterior sector and with the action of upper retrusion arches or lower protrusion arches; according to the cepha删除16:<u>¬ </u>lometric requirements of the case, we can correct the overjet by reducing the space needed for the interposi删除16:<u>¬ </u>tion of the lower lip. 删除1:<u>(10)</u>王磊
