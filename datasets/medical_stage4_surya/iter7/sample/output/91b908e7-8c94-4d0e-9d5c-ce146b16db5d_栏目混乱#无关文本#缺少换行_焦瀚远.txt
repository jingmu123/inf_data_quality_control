##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Interposed Abdominal Compression-Cpr

The interposed abdominal compression (IAC)-CPR is a 3-rescuer technique (an abdominal compressor plus the chest compressor and the rescuer providing ventilations) that includes conventional chest compressions combined with alternating abdominal compressions. The dedicated rescuer who provides manual abdominal compressions will compress the abdomen midway between the xiphoid and the umbilicus during the relaxation phase of chest compression. Hand position, depth, rhythm, and rate of abdominal compressions are similar to those for chest compressions and the force required is similar to that used to palpate the abdominal aorta.
In most reports, an endotracheal tube is placed before or shortly after initiation of IAC-CPR. IAC-CPR increases diastolic aortic pressure and venous return, resulting in improved coronary perfusion pressure and blood flow to other vital organs.
In 2 randomized in-hospital trials, IAC-CPR performed by trained rescuers improved short-term survival 17 and survival to hospital discharge 18 compared with conventional CPR for adult cardiac arrest. The data from these studies were combined in 2 positive meta-analyses.删除26_2:<u></u> .删除26_2:<u></u> However, 1 randomized controlled trial of adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest 21 did not show any survival advantage to IAC-CPR. Although there were no complications reported in adults,19 1 pediatric case report 22 documented traumatic pancreatitis following删除换行1:<u>| |</u>IAC-CPR.
IAC-CPR may be considered during in-hospital resuscita- tion when sufficient personnel trained in its use are available (Class IIb, LOE B). There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of IAC-CPR in the out-of-hospital setting or in children.

"Cough" Cpr

【3】"Cough" CPR describes the use of forceful voluntary coughs every 1 to 3 seconds in conscious patients shortly after the onset of a witnessed nonperfusing cardiac rhythm in a controlled environment such as the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Coughing episodically increases the intrathoracic pressure and can generate systemic blood pressures higher than those usually generated by conventional chest compressions, 23.24 allowing patients to maintain consciousness 删除2:<u>23–26</u>for a brief arrhythmic interval (up to 92 seconds documented in humans).删除26_2:<u></u> "Cough" CPR has been reported exclusively in awake, monitored patients (predominantly in the cardiac catheterization laboratory) when arrhythmic cardiac arrest can be anticipated, the patient remains conscious and can be instructed before and coached during the event, and cardiac activity can be promptly restored. 删除2:<u>23–33</u>However, not all victims are able to produce hemodynamically effective coughs.删除26_2:<u></u> "Cough" CPR is not useful for unresponsive victims and should not be taught to lay rescuers. "Cough" CPR may be considered in settings such as the cardiac catheterization laboratory for conscious, supine, and monitored patients if the patient can be instructed and coached to cough forcefully every 1 to 3 seconds during the initial seconds of an arrhythmic cardiac arrest. It should not delay definitive treatment (Class IIb, LOE C).

##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Prone Cpr

When the patient cannot be placed in the supine position, it may be reasonable for rescuers to provide CPR with the patient in the prone position, particularly in hospitalized patients with an advanced airway in place (Class IIb, LOE删除换行1:<u>| |</u>C).34–37

##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Precordial Thump

【8】This section is new to the 2010 Guidelines and is based on the conclusions reached by the 2010 ILCOR evidence evaluation process.删除26_2:<u></u>

【9】A precordial thump has been reported to convert ventricular tachyarrhythmias in 1 study with concurrent controls, 39 single-patient case reports, and small case series. 删除2:<u>40–44</u>However, 2 larger case series found that the precordial thump was ineffective in 79 (98.8%) of 80 cases 45 and in 153 (98.7%) of 155 cases of malignant ventricular arrhythmias.删除26_2:<u></u> Case reports and case series 47 -49 have documented complications associated with precordial thump including sternal fracture, osteomyelitis, stroke, and triggering of malignant arrhythmias in adults and children.
The precordial thump should not be used for unwitnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (Class III, LOE C). The precordial thump may be considered for patients with witnessed, monitored, unstable ventricular tachycardia including pulseless VT if a defibrillator is not immediately ready for use (Class IIb, LOE C), but it should not delay CPR and shock delivery. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of the precordial thump for witnessed onset of asystole.

##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Percussion Pacing

【11】Percussion (eg, fist) pacing refers to the use of regular, rhythmic and forceful percussion of the chest with the rescuer's fist in an attempt to pace the myocardium. There is little evidence supporting fist or percussion pacing in cardiac arrest based on 6 single-patient case reports 50 -55 and a moderate-sized case series.删除26_2:<u></u> There is insufficient evidence to recommend percussion pacing during typical attempted resuscitation from cardiac arrest.

##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Automatic And Mechanical Transport Ventilators

Automatic Transport Ventilators删除换行1:<u>| |</u>There are very few studies evaluating the use of automatic transport ventilators (ATVs) during attempted resuscitation in patients with endotracheal intubation. During prolonged resuscitation efforts, the use of an ATV (pneumatically powered and time- or pressure-cycled) may provide ventilation and oxygenation similar to that possible with the use of a manual resuscitation bag, while allowing the Emergency删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Medical Services (EMS) team to perform other tasks (Class IIb, LOE C 57 .58 ). Disadvantages of ATVs include the need for an oxygen source and a power source. Thus, providers should always have a bag-mask device available for manual backup.
