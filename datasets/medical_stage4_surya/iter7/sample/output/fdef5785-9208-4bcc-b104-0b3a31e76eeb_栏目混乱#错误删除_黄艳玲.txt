By general rule, developing Class III malocclusions express themselves as an anterior cross bite in the mixed denti删除16:<u>¬ </u>tion. They can be dental, functional or skeletal. To make a diagnosis, the doctor must evaluate the following: o

The profile of the patient.
Inclination of the maxilla.
Inclination of the upper and lower incisors.
The presence of a functional displacement between centric relation and centric occlusion. 删除1:<u>(5)</u>删除15:<u>删除换行1:<u>| |</u> o

##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>How To Differentiate Between A Dental And A Skeletal Cross Bite

Dental evaluation: We must observe if the Class 删除0:<u>■</u>删除换行1:<u>| |</u>III molar relation is accompanied by an underjet. If the incisors are in edge to edge relation and the lower incisors are retroclined, we must suspect a compensated Class III malocclusion, meaning that the upper incisors are proclined and the lower incisors are retroclined to compensate the skeletal discrepancy. In case there is an underjet, this must be confirmed with a functional evaluation. 删除1:<u>(5)</u>

【4】Functional evaluation: We must evaluate the rela删除16:<u>¬ </u>删除0:<u>■</u> tion between the mandible and the maxilla to determine

The forward positioning of the mandible can produce an abnormal dental contact that can generate a forward mandibular displacement. Patients with a forward mandibular displacement during closure or maximum intercuspidation may have a Class I skeletal pattern, a normal facial profile and a Class I molar relation in CR, but with a dental and skeletal Class III pattern in CO, a situation known as pseudo Class III malocclusion takes place. The elimination of the CO-CR displacement must reveal if it is only a simple Class I malocclusion or a compensated Class III malocclusion. On the other hand, a patient without deviation during closure most probably has a true Class III malocclusion. 删除1:<u>(5)</u></u>
