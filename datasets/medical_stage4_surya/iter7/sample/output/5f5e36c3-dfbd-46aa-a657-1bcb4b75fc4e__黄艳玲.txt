woman. Therefore, the PEF value, or FEV 1 , that is considered normal for a short, older female with asthma would be abnormally low if obtained by a tall, adolescent male with asthma.

【1】Because asthma is characterized as a disease of lung emptying, exhalation time is abnormally prolonged in asthma. Anyone with active asthma who attempts to blow out all the candles on a birthday cake with one single mighty blow of air knows about impaired "lung emptying" firsthand! Depending on the degree of asthma and other factors, such as how much airway narrowing, or bronchospasm, is present, full exhalation during spirometry might last as long as 12 to 14 seconds rather than the normal 5 to 6 seconds. The FEV 1 and PEF values reflect the efficiency and status of lung emptying, and thus provide information about how an asthmatic's lung function is affected by his or her condition.

【2】The FEV 1 is defined as the volume of air that is exhaled in the first second of forceful exhalation as measured by spirometry. If asthma is poorly controlled, it will take longer than predicted for the lungs to fully empty. Since total exhalation time is prolonged in asthma, then it follows that the amount or volume of air exhaled in the first second of exhalation is reduced as compared to a predicted normal. The FEV 1 will be decreased in symptomatic or poorly controlled asthma.
With treatment, the lungs should empty more efficiently, and the FEV 1 value should return to normal.

【3】Just as active or exacerbated asthma prolongs exhalation, flow of air through narrowed air passages is reduced. Spirometry in active asthma also reveals reduced flow rates. The peak flow is the single greatest value of flow measurement that occurs as the lungs黄艳玲
