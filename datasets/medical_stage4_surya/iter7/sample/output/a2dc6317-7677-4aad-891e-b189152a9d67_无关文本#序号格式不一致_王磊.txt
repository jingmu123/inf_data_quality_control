【1】删除图片4:<u>Fig.删除26_2:<u></u> Retroligatures are effective not only as anchorage but also for canine retraction.</u>

【2】Retroligaturures are made with metal wire 0.010"-0.012" diameter, laced between braces (ligature in 8) or both between and inside the brace (double 8 ligatures); they can be placed over or under the arch wire, with a Matthew needle holder or a ligature pencil. 删除1:<u>(16)</u>

##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Advantages

1.1. It is the main method to maintain anterior anchorage during the alignment and leveling phase of treat删除16:<u>¬ </u>ment.
Economic and easy to do.
It minimizes canine anterior inclination during their retraction phase.
Not only does it serve as minimal anchorage, but it can also be used for canine retraction.
When retroligatures are used, there is posterior anchorage loss, but there is substantial anchorage gain in the anterior segment (2.5 mm per quadrant删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Approx.)

##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Disadvantages

【6】1. It is not always accepted by the patient because of the "metal smile effect".删除26_2:<u></u> It favors food retention so it may cause gingivitis.

##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Recommendations

【8】1. Indicated in premolar extraction cases but also in non-extraction cases where there is a local menace to anchorage control.删除26_2:<u></u> They are passive elements and they must not be laced to the point of producing tissue ischemia.删除26_2:<u></u> The initial purpose of retroligatures was to prevent anterior canine inclination, but it has been observed that they are an effective method of canine distaliza删除16:<u>¬ </u>tion with no undesired inclinations.删除26_2:<u></u> Retroligatures in combination with distal bends (Tip删除16:<u>¬ </u>back, Toe-in, etc.) are a effective support to anterior anchorage during the leveling and alignment phase and in space closure. 删除1:<u>(16)</u> 5. With retroligatures the main point is that the greater the number of teeth bound as an anchorage unit, the more resistant to retraction movement they be删除16:<u>¬ </u>come.

##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Intermaxillary Elastics F)

【10】Class II, III and delta elastics represent minimal anchor删除16:<u>¬ </u>age that limit the protrusion of the anterosuperior or anteroinferior segments. They can get upper and lower teeth closer together and are a frequent way to obtain differential dental movement. The direction of the elastic defines their force vector and the terminology to describe it.

【11】Class II elastics connect maxillary anterior teeth with posterior mandible teeth. 删除1:<u>(24)</u>

【12】Class II elastics are placed from anterosuperior to pos删除16:<u>¬ </u>teroinferior teeth.

【13】Delta or "Delta locks" are usually used to interdigit the occlusion, but they are also used as anchorage in order to maintain Class I canine relation in cases where spaces to close still exist.

【14】Different elastic diameters (1/8", 3/16", 1/4" or 5/16") may be used and the force can vary from 2 Oz, 4 Oz to 6 Oz.王磊
