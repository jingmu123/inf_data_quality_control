【4】The CEOB-1 is an appliance structurally similar to the Jones Jig. Considering the economic status of the patients that come to the clinic, the appliance is made with materials at hand, making an appliance similar to the one designed by Drs Jones and White; but at a fraction of the cost of the original appliance. The CEOB-1 provides 75 g to 150 g of force, 7.5° of mesial tipping of the upper first molar and 4.5° of mesial tipping of the second upper premolar.
The molar will distalize 2.5 mm per month and the second premolar will mesialize 2 mm. 删除1:<u>(删除2:<u>16, 17,18,21,23</u>28)</u>
