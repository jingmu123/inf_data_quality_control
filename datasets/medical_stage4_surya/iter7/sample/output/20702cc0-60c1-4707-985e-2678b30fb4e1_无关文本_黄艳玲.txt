adding any required medicines that may fall into the C category (or even D), if needed to achieve good asthma control. If you are pregnant and have any questions or any concerns about the safety of the medicines you have been prescribed, you should consult with your treating physicians.

88. Will I Be Able To Breast-Feed My Baby If I’M Taking Medicine For My Asthma?
Yes, You Will Certainly Be Able To Breast-Feed If You So wish. Asthma medicine, especially that administered in inhaled form, is not a contraindication to nursing your infant. Breast-feeding has many widely known advantages for both mother and child, and may even have beneficial effects in delaying or altogether avoiding the development of asthma in young children. In fact, a recent study in Australia involving over 2,000 children found that infants who were "exclusively breast-fed," that is, who received only mother's milk for at least the first 4 months of life, had a significantly reduced risk of developing asthma by the age of 6. Breast-feeding also appears to delay the development of allergy in children. Studies indicate that breast-fed children known to be at increased risk for the development of allergy (because of a family history) develop allergies at an older age as compared to children with similar risk factors who are not exclusively breast-fed. Of course, you should seek guidance from your baby's pediatrician if you are taking any over-the-counter or prescription medicines while you are breast-feeding.
