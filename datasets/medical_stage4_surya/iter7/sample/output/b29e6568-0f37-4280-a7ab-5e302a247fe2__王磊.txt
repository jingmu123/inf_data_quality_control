【1】Whenever we have any doubt about the cooperation of the patient in the use of the removable bite block, we can apply resin on the occlusal aspects of the posterior teeth in order to open the anterior sector and correct the crossed bite. For this purpose we use Block Out resin, which has a blue color and is marketed by Ultradent.

##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Advantages

【4】1. Economic.

【5】2. Easy to fabricate and to place.

【6】3. In case it is fixed we do not depend upon patient compliance.

【7】4. In case it is removable, the patient can maintain better hygiene.

##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Disadvantages

【9】1. We must invest laboratory time to fabricate the appliance.

【10】2. In case it is removable, we depend upon patient co删除16:<u>¬ </u>operation.

【11】3. The patient can misplace the appliance.

【12】4. The prolonged use of this appliance can fatigue the masseter muscles and on the long run provoke TMJ pain.

【13】5. If we are not careful enough during fabrication, this appliance can block the eruption of the second molar.

##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Recommendations

【15】1. All the antagonist teeth must occlude on the occlusal surface of the bite block.

【16】2. In case the patient refers any abnormality in the TMJ we must retire the bite block immediately.

【17】3. The recommended thickness of the posterior bite block is 1 mm to 2 mm because we must not forget that we will provoke an anterior open bite of +3 mm due to the scissor effect.

【18】4. Place the bite block as soon as the necessary space to uncross the anterior teeth has been obtained.

【19】5. The bite block can be cemented if the patient does not use it as prescribed.

【20】6. Whenever the occlusal resin dots are used, as soon as the crossed bite has been corrected, we must eliminate the resin immediately or we can provoke intrusion in the posterior sector.

【21】7. After uncrossing any upper anterior teeth we must place negative torque to the root of that tooth.

##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Lingual Placed Brace

【23】The placement of a brace on the lingual aspect of a tooth is a very simple way to take a tooth that is in a cross bite to its correct position in the dental arch. This is carried out by the physical properties of the wire that is used for this purpose, in this case thermal NiTi wire, which has six times the flexibility to that of normal steel wire.王磊
