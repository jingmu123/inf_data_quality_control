#U.S. Workers And The Law

##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Labor Rights Of Americans Lag Behind Those Of Other Nations   By Rodger Doyle n the U.S., unions have the best songs, but for decades management has held the best cards. Even in the public sector, where unions have maintained their membership in recent times, they have relatively little power.
Teachers, for example, are perhaps the bestorganized government employees. Only 11 states grant them the right to strike; in 15 states they have no legal means to compel school boards to bargain. The other 24 states consider teacher strikes illegal but permit local governments to bargain with the boards.
In terms of labor rights, teachers fall midway between powerful industrial unions such as the United Auto Workers and certain groups not protected by federal labor regulations at all. Federal law, particularly the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947 (also known as the Taft-Hartley Act), compels employers to bargain with unions in good faith and protects workers from arbitrary firing for union activity. The situation of unprotected groups—which include farm laborers, domestics, supervisors, managers and independent contractors—is documented in detail by删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Human Rights Watch in its recent report Unfair Advantage. These employees, who may number up to 20 million, have minimal protection when trying to form a union. Although they may have some legal safeguards against arbitrary discharge under common law and antidiscrimination statutes, Human Rights Watch finds that an employer bent on discharging a worker for trying to form a union generally has the upper hand.
That also applies to jobs covered by labor laws. According to Human Rights删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Watch, the financial penalty for firing a worker for organizing is small and often is not paid until years of litigation go by. Another problem for workers, even those protected.

The graph lines are not strictly comparable but are believed to measure averall trends by labor laws, is the employer's right under court decisions to replace them permanently if they strike for higher wages. Sympathy strikes are illegal. Employers have a virtually unlimited right to present their point of view in the workplace but can prevent union organizers from doing the same.

The U.S. has long been out of step with standards established by the International Labor Organization, an arm of the United Nations. The standards affirm workers' right to organize, to bargain collectively, to have a speedy resolution of grievances and, with certain limitations, to strike and conduct sympathy strikes. It disallows practices that would undermine the right to strike, such as the hiring of permanent replacement workers. Lance删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Compa, the author of Unfair Advantage and an expert on international labor law at Cornell University, notes that most other industrial countries follow the U.N. rules, which, among other things, allow teachers to strike.
Would granting American workers U.N. standard rights harm the U.S. economy? Compa thinks the economy would be enhanced, because workers would feel more respected and worry less about employer reprisal. Thomas I.
Palley, an economist with the AFL-CIO, argues that the chief effect would be a lessening of income disparities in the U.S. and that there is no evidence it would diminish America's competitive edge abroad. Marvin H. Kosters, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, says any effect would be minor.
On the other hand, Randall Johnson, vice president for labor and employee benefits at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, believes that the damage to the U.S. position would be substantial. Mark Wilson, an economist at the Heritage Foundation, says beefing up workers' rights would reduce the nation's competitive advantage with European trading partners and developing countries such as China and Mexico.
