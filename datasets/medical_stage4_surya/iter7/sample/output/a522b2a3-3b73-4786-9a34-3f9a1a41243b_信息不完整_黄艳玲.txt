5. Become Withdrawn And Exceedingly Cautious To Express Their删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Feelings

【1】Finding it difficult to express feelings of joy freely can be devastating for a teenager. They try to hide their face while smiling or talking. They become socially introverted and less outgoing. The only reason being – they don't want others to notice their collapsed face.

##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>How To Help People With Bell’S Palsy

Since I had facial paralysis at a young age, people around me were used to what删除换行1:<u>| |</u>I looked like. Not everyone had harsh things to say about my appearance, but clearly, even the 'most concerned friends' were unaware of the full psychological impact Bell’s palsy had on me.

【5】Others may not necessarily know how to act or react around people with Bell's palsy.

Raising awareness about the condition is vital. Before helping a loved one with删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Bell's palsy, it is important to understand what the condition is, how it is caused, and how it psychologically affects an individual. That's why I have written this book!

【7】Imagine you wake up one morning to find that you've developed facial paralysis. For a teenager or young adult who is taking their first step into a new career, college, or entering a new group of friends, this experience is devastating.
