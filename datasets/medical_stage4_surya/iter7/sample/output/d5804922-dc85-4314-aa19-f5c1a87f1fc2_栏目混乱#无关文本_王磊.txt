【1】Must not require patient cooperation.
High degree of biomechanical control.
Compact design.
Minimal interference when the patient eats or speaks.
Absence of pain during the distalizing process.

【2】0. Easy activation.
Compatibility with other orthodontic techniques.
Automatic cessation of the distalizing movement.
Must be easy to clean. (1,5-7,9,删除2:<u>15,17,18,22</u>24,删除2:<u>26,33,35,36,38</u> o o o o o o o

##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Distalizing Indications o

【4】Unilateral or bilateral dental Class II relation.
Increased overjet (up to 5 mm).
Increased overbite (deep bite).
Midline discrepancy.
Minimal or non-existing dental overcrowding.
Patients with early mixed or permanent dentition.
Patients with upper dentoalveolar protrusion.
Patients with minimal skeletal problems.
Normo or hypodivergent patients.
Patients that do not accept extractions.
Another indication for upper molar distalization is when we decide to extract a permanent second molar (due to caries or other causes) complicated with anterior overcrowding or an ectopic canine.
In these cases the third molar will occupy the space of the extracted second molar. (1.5-7.9.15.17.18.22- 删除2:<u>24,26,33,35,36</u>38) o o o o o o o o o o

【6】Patients that grow vertically.
Dolichocephalic patients.
Patients with open bite tendency.
Overjet greater than 5 mm.
In some cases with tongue protraction.
In adult patients we must employ another type of treatment. (1,5-7,9,删除2:<u>15,17,18,22</u>24,删除2:<u>26,33,35,36,38</u> . . . . .

##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Recommendations .

【8】In young patients, the best moment to distalize is before the second molars are totally erupted. The upper second molars erupt normally without im删除16:<u>¬ </u>paction; meanwhile the second premolar follows the first molar distally. .

Distalize in the mixed or permanent dentition.
In order to obtain a faster distalization, we recom删除16:<u>¬ </u>mend the extraction of the third molars.
Distalizers can provoke an undesired upper first molar rotation.
Use Class II elastics in order to reduce anterior pro删除16:<u>¬ </u>clination.
Lace the anterior teeth with steel ligature or with an acetate in order to minimize anterior proclination.
After the distalization is completed, place a moder删除16:<u>¬ </u>ate or maximum anchorage to the distalized molars (Chromosome arch, Transpalanance, Viaro Nance,删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Nance button, Transpalatine arch).
The patient must have excellent oral hygiene because the distalizing appliances retain food particles删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Have a strict appointment control. (1,5-7,9,删除2:<u>15,17,18,22</u>24- .删除2:<u>26,33,35,36,38</u> . . . . . . .

##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Collateral Effects Of Distalizers: .

They procline the anterior segment.
In- body distal movement is difficult,删除换行1:<u>| |</u>They produce condyle deflection.
Premature points in the palatine cusps.
Due to the hinge effect, these appliances produce a mandibular posterior rotation that will result in an anterior open bite. (1.5,6,7,9,删除2:<u>15,17,18,22,23</u>24,删除2:<u>26,33,35,36,38</u> . . . .

【12】Distalizers are divided in two big groups: .

##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Intraoral. .

【14】Extraoral.

【15】In this chapter we will analyze the intraoral distalizers, and we will divide them in:

【16】1. Fixed.

【17】2. Removable.

##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Super Elastic Niti Coil Distalization (Open Coils)

【19】Open coils are the most simple and cheap appliance used successfully in maxillary molar distalization since the begin删除16:<u>¬ </u>ning of the twentieth century.

【20】These coils apply approximately 100 g of force and are placed between the first or second premolar and the upper first molar on a 0.016" x 0.022" arch wire.删除1:<u>(2.15.删除2:<u>16,26,40</u></u>王磊
