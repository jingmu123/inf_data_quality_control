are essential for asthma treatment, the EPA and the FDA have allowed an extension to the timeline banning CFC manufacture, and have proposed and overseen the gradual phase out of all MDIs containing CFCs (MDI-CFC). No CFC-containing MDI is removed from the market until a safe and effective equivalent medicine is available. The goal is to develop删除换行1:<u>| |</u>CFC-free alternative MDIs and cease the manufacture of CFCs altogether.

Pharmaceutical manufacturers are either 删除1:<u>(1)</u> reformulating their MDIs to be CFC free, or 删除1:<u>(2)</u> developing inhaled drug-delivery systems that do not require any propellant at all. Reformulated MDIs substitute a different, non-CFC type of propellant called hydrofluo删除16:<u>¬ </u>roalkane (HFA). The FDA has thus far approved two different CFC-free brands of albuterol sulfate bronchodilator MDIs, and one brand of MDI beclomethasone inhaled corticosteroid that is also删除换行1:<u>| |</u>CFC-free. The products are Proventil HFA删除0:<u>®</u>, Ven删除16:<u>¬ </u>tolin HFA删除0:<u>®</u>, and Qvar删除0:<u>®</u>. Other CFC-free products are available in Europe, but are not currently FDA approved for use in the United States. In addition to producing HFA-propelled MDIs, pharmaceutical manufacturers have devised inhalers that do not rely on any propellants. Several different asthma medicines are now available as "dry powder inhalers" (DPI) in the United States, and more are sure to follow.
