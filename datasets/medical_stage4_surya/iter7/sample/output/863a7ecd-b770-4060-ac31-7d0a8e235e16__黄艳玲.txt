7. Apply mesial root inclination to posterior-superior teeth. With this inclination bodily movement of the molar lessens during anterior segment retraction. 删除1:<u>(3)</u>

【2】8. Distally incline the crowns of the upper canines at the moment of retraction. This is done in order to lessen the loss of anchorage of the posterior segment. Later on, the canine roots must be uprighted.

【6】11. Another reinforcement option in posterior anchor删除16:<u>¬ </u>age control during space closure consists in "separate canine retraction" (in extraction cases). Some ortho删除16:<u>¬ </u>dontists prefer this technique because they consider it preserves the posterior teeth position. It is considered that "separate canine retraction" lessens the load upon the posterior anchorage. 删除1:<u>(3)</u>

【8】1. The use of extra oral forces directed forward. Elastics that stretch from posterior teeth to a face bar of a facemask exert these forces. The anchorage points would be in this case the forehead and the chin. This type of anchorage is indicated in maxillary traction cases and it is also called Geniomolar Anchorage.
