Parents and other family members seldom ask if they can be present unless they are encouraged to do so by healthcare providers. Resuscitation team members should be sensitive to the presence of family members during resuscitative efforts, assigning a team member to remain with the family to answer questions, clarify information, and otherwise offer comfort.删除26_2:<u></u>

【2】Notifying family members of the death of a loved one is an important aspect of a resuscitation that should be performed compassionately, with care taken to consider the family's culture, religious beliefs and preconceptions surrounding death, and any guilt they may feel associated with the event or circumstances preceding the event.删除26_2:<u></u>

##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Limitation Of Care And Withdrawal Of删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Life-Sustaining Therapies

【4】Limitation of care or withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies is an emotionally complex decision for family and staff. Withholding and withdrawing life support are ethically similar. A decision to limit care or withdraw life support is justifiable if the patient is determined to be brain dead, if the physician and patient or surrogate agree that treatment goals cannot be met, or if the burden to the patient of continued treatment is believed to exceed any benefits.
Patients in the end stage of an incurable disease should receive care that ensures their autonomy, comfort, and dignity. Interventions that minimize suffering and pain, dyspnea, delirium, convulsions, and other terminal complications should always be provided. For such patients it is ethically acceptable to gradually increase the doses of narcotics and sedatives to relieve pain and other suffering, even to levels that might concomitantly shorten the patient's life. The care team should initiate plans for future care by collaborative discussions and the resolution of any conflicts with nurses, consultants, residents, fellows, the patient (when capable of participating), surrogate decision makers, and the family. Nursing and comfort care (eg, oral hygiene, skin care, patient positioning, and measures to relieve pain and suffering) must always be continued.
In the absence of evidence of an incurable disease in the end stage, decisions to withdraw or limit care in the post-arrest patient are often challenging, given the difficulties of accurate prognostication, especially in the era of treatment advances such as therapeutic hypothermia.

【6】There is insufficient evidence about clinical neurologic signs, electrophysiologic studies, biomarkers, or imaging modalities to describe an approach to prognostication in the neonatal or pediatric patient after cardiac arrest. In the absence of prognostication guidelines, the decision to withdraw life-sustaining therapies rests with the treating physician and may vary considerably across physicians and institutions. Further research in this area is needed.

There are no clinical neurologic signs, electrophysiologic studies, biomarkers, or imaging modalities that can reliably predict death or poor neurologic outcome (eg, Cerebral Performance删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Category of 3, 4, or 5) within the first 24 hours after cardiac arrest in patients treated with or without therapeutic hypothermia (see Part 9: "Post–Cardiac Arrest Care"). There is a tendency to withdraw care prematurely in the post-arrest patient, and this has contributed to a selection bias in the current literature on prognostic testing.

##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Prognostic Testing In The Adult Post-Arrest Patient Not删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Treated With Therapeutic Hypothermia

In adult post–cardiac arrest patients who are not treated with therapeutic hypothermia, it is recommended in comatose patients that pupillary light and corneal reflexes as well as vestibular-ocular reflexes and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Motor Score be documented at 72 hours after sustained ROSC and thereafter at least daily (Class I, LOE B). When available, recording the unprocessed electroencephalography interpretation between 24 and 72 hours after sustained ROSC may be helpful to assist in the prediction of a poor outcome in the absence of sedatives, hypotension, accidental hypothermia, or hypoxemia; specifically the finding of generalized suppression to < 20 µ V, burst suppression pattern with generalized epileptic activity, or diffuse periodic complexes on a flat background (Class IIb, LOE B 81 ).

【12】Based on limited available evidence, potentially reliable prognosticators of poor outcome in patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest include bilateral absence of N20 peak on median nerve somatosensory evoked potential ≥ 24 hours after cardiac arrest 82.83 and the absence of both corneal and pupillary reflexes ≥ 3 days after cardiac arrest. Limited available evidence also suggests that 删除1:<u>(1)</u> GCS Motor Score of 2 or less at day 3 after sustained ROSC, 82 and 删除1:<u>(2)</u> presence of status epilepticus 删除2:<u>84 – 86</u>are potentially unreliable prognosticators of poor outcome in post–cardiac arrest patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia. Similarly, recovery of consciousness and cognitive functions is possible in a few post–cardiac arrest patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia despite bilateral absent or minimally present N20 responses of median nerve somatosensoryevoked potentials, suggesting that they may be unreliable as王磊
