##删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Nutritional Requirements For Children

【3】Since children suffering from Bell's palsy often have a compromised immune system, it is important that you pay attention to what they eat.

【4】Good nutrition, as suggested by the American Dietetic Association, can rebuild and strengthen a child's immune system.

【5】Kids often prefer to eat semi-solid foods such as pudding, jelly and yogurt and you may add a multivitamin liquid preparation to them after consulting a certified pediatrician. It is better to stick to semi-solid and liquid foods if the child is having problems swallowing.

【6】Make sure you include the following food groups in the kid's diet plan.

【7】1. Fruits: Try to include at least two servings of fruit per day. One serving here refers to one piece of fruit or ½ cup canned fruit or ¾ cup fruit juice or ¼ cup dried fruit. It's always best to include fresh produce in your child's diet plan.

【8】2. Milk and Dairy: Kids might not be fond of dairy products but be sure to include two servings of dairy per day. One serving includes 2 oz. cheese or 1 cup of milk/yogurt. Please check with a doctor if your child is lactose intolerant.

【9】3. Protein: Cooked lean meat, poultry or fish, beans, eggs and peanut butter can be used as ideal protein sources. Kids require two servings (85g each) of the protein group.

【10】4. Whole grains and vegetables are also valuable options that cannot be ignored. You can include six servings of the grain group and three servings of veggies throughout the day. ½ cup of chopped raw or cooked vegetables or one cup of raw, leafy vegetables is counted as one serving. One slice of bread or ½ cup cooked rice/pasta, or ½ cup ready-to-eat cereal is one serving of the grains group.焦瀚远
