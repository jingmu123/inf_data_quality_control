spectacular as disjunction, but it separates the suture as it allows suture ossification. Slow expansion promotes more post expansion stability, given an adequate retention period.
A slow expansion appliance requires minimal adjustments, but allows easy adjustments when required. The Quad Helix transmits constant and physiologic forces while the expansion is taking place. 删除1:<u>( 删除2:<u>13 , 17 , 27 , 36</u>)</u>

【1】The Quad Helix can be fixed (soldered to the molar bands) or removable (inserted in the palatal sheaths of the band molars). These two models can be bought in many sizes or made in the laboratory over study models of the patient.

【2】The Quad Helix has 4 spiral helicoidal bends, two on the anterior zone, which must descend from the bridge to the palate, and the other two are located slightly behind the molar band, to allow rotation and molar expansion. 删除1:<u>(删除2:<u>12,13</u></u>

【4】1. In those cases that have transversal problems of dentoalveolar origin that must be resolved in the upper arch. 删除1:<u>(13)</u> 2. In cases that require a slight expansion in the mixed dentition to create space for the upper laterals. 删除1:<u>(27)</u>

【5】1.1.3. It is ideal for cleft lip and palate patients, because it produces more force in the anterior sector than in the posterior sector.

【8】The activation of the Quad Helix is done in three steps:

【9】1. The first activation is done out of the mouth before we cement the appliance. We must expand the appliance about 8 mm maintaining the lateral arms parallel, 删除1:<u>(13)</u> in order to have the same magnitude expansion on both sides. This first activation will generate 400 g of force approximately. We cement the appliance and schedule the patient again in 6 more weeks.
