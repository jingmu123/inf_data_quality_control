tems in the 1990s. Louis Rosenberg, the company's chairman, says the key hardware component is a 25-gram motor that can move up and down, imparting about 150 grams of force against the user's hand.
The mouse can also vibrate up to 300 times a second, enabling the device to reproduce a wide range of sensations. For example, Immersion's special-effects software library allows Web site developers to enhance pages with simulated textures such as corduroy or sandpaper. When the iFeel user drags the cursor across such a page, the mouse rapidly jiggles up and down, as if it were traveling over a rough surface.
Trying out the iFeel mouse for the first time can be disconcerting. The installation is straightforward: just plug this USB device into an appropriate computer port and load the driver software from a CD-删除换行1:<u>| |</u>ROM. (Mac users are out of luck; so far the mouse works only with Windows.)删除换行1:<u>| |</u>Once connected, the iFeel fundamentally alters one's perception of Windows' familiar screens. If you slide the cursor across one of the desktop program icons, the mouse shakes like dice in a cup. If you glide the mouse over the selections in a menu bar, it feels like a set of chattering false teeth. Push the iFeel back and forth over the options in a pull-down menu, and it hums like an electric shaver. The mouse also shakes up Web pages (iFeel works with either Explorer or Netscape, but Explorer must be installed on the computer even if you use only Netscape).
The most noticeable sensation is the bump that occurs when the cursor crosses a hot link or menu choice.
For anyone accustomed to an inert mouse, such physical cues may be distracting. Because people have different thresholds for sensing force, Immersion's software developers have provided access to an onscreen control for adjusting the strength of the feedback. Another control allows you to choose a different set of sensations. In addition to the default setting (which simulates the feeling of tapping a wooden surface), the iFeel offers six oth- er options: crisp, metallic, spongy, rubbery, steel drum and sonic vibe.
With continued use, something unexpected happens: the iFeel's twitching becomes an organic part of the computing experience. The mouse's motions provide technology is recognized by NASA, raved about by xtolled worldwide by over 25,000 sleep clinics and essionals. Yet this miracle must be felt to be believed.
