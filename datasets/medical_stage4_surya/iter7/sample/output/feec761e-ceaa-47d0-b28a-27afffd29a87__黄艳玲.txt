【3】The success of an orthodontic treatment depends upon many factors, but without any doubt one of them is anchorage con删除16:<u>¬ </u>trol. If we do not have the anchorage that we need, this will lead us to certain failure, so it is very important to apply all our knowledge in this subject during orthodontic treatment.

【4】Anchorage can be defined as the resistance to movement that teeth show upon the application of a force. Another way to define anchorage would be the distance in mil删除16:<u>¬ </u>limeters teeth have to be displaced in order to close an extraction site. 删除1:<u>(4,删除2:<u>19,28</u></u>

【5】In order to understand the importance of anchorage use, first we must review the mechanics of dental movement. The third law of Newton states: "To every action there is always opposing and equal reaction." In orthodontics this means that when a force is used to move a group of teeth in a certain direction, there will always be an equal force in an opposing direction, this is why anchorage selection is so important; also important is the selection of the teeth in which we want to limit its movement, because this reciprocal force may induce the displacement of the anchored teeth. 删除1:<u>(3,19)</u>

【7】Orthodontic anchorage diminishes or limits the movement of the anchored teeth, but does not immobilize them. The concept that a group of teeth can maintain themselves im删除16:<u>¬ </u>mobile while another group can be displaced during the application of a force is controversial, therefore anchored teeth must not be considered static. In fact, one of the main advantages in the use of the appliances is the displacement control of anchored teeth.

【8】Within the various anatomical structures we can rely on in order to improve anchorage control we find teeth, the hard palate, alveolar bone, the occipital bone and the nape of the neck. 删除1:<u>(28)</u>

If anchorage was not well designed or if we did not choose the right type for the case, a mesial displacement of the anchored teeth will occur and the overjet will increase. 删除1:<u>(19)</u>删除换行1:<u>| |</u>This is known as loss of anchorage; if it is excessive, canines will not retract enough and there will not be enough space to obtain good incisor alignment.
