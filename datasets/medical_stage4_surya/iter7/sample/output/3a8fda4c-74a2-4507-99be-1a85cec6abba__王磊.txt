【2】Three popular methods namely physical therapy, Botox injections (botulinum toxin) and surgery are employed by doctors to treat synkinesis.

Interestingly, successful treatment of synkinesis is possible even if therapy is started years after the patient has suffered Bell’s or facial palsy.

【4】Physical therapy for the treatment of synkinesis is very different from the therapy utilized for other medical complications such as lower back pain and arthritis. Facial physical therapy or neuromuscular retraining during synkinesis is very similar to learning to sing with a hoarse voice.

【5】Any singer with a hoarse voice will learn to adjust their vocal cords to overcome poor sound. Similarly, patients with Bell's palsy or facial palsy focus on coordinating different muscles to achieve controlled, synchronized and natural looking facial muscle movements. This physical therapy is extremely useful in overcoming the activity of unwanted muscles.

【6】More information on physical therapy can be found under the treatment section, but here's a quick overview to help you understand synkinesis better.

【7】Your healthcare provider will refer you to a qualified therapist who will then identify the muscles that show linked movements or are contracting abnormally.
Facial muscles that fail to follow the 'natural sequence' of activity are also identified.

【8】Small and simple exercises, usually, are then suggested in order to retrain your muscles at the neurologic level. Facial and neck muscles on the affected side are massaged and stretched, however patients are advised not apply excessive force.
Remember, you have to re-train overactive, stiff muscles so that your facial muscles become coordinated, and this might take some time. Almost 90% of the physical therapy involves personalized exercises that can be done at home. You can always refer to your healthcare provider if you have specific questions related to physical therapy.王磊
