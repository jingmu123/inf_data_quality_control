These properties are beneficial for children who might be afraid of IV administration or unpleasant smells. Additionally, because of the low blood/gas partition coefficient of sevoflurane, induction and recovery times are quick.\n\n【2】Desflurane, methoxyflurane and isoflurane can all be used for maintenance of anesthesia, but their pungent smell and airway irritant properties make them less suitable for induction, especially in a child who has refused IV access as this might cause further distress.\n\n【3】Sevoflurane has also been linked with less respiratory side effects compared to the other agents, further making it the inhalational agent of choice for induction.\n\n【4】Therefore, the answer is Sevoflurane (A).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medmcqa", "batch_name": "20240423", "version": "version8"}

The syndrome is characterized by a number of unusual behaviors, including hyperorality (the urge to put things in the mouth), hypersexuality, hypermetamorphosis (having extreme curiosity and the tendency to interact with every new object), visual agnosia (difficulty recognizing familiar objects), and docility (a decrease in emotional reactions or decreased agitation).\n\n【1】Seizures are not a typical symptom or feature associated with Kluver-Bucy syndrome.

All the listed components (Leader sequence, Enhancer, tRNA, ncRNA) are involved in different steps of gene expression. However, the actual synthesis of polypeptides, also known as translation, is more directly linked with tRNA (transfer RNA).\n\n【1】Leader sequences are important in transcriptional regulation and ribosome binding for translation, enhancers enhance the rate of transcription, and ncRNAs (non-coding RNAs) have a wide variety of functions in gene regulation, but tRNAs are essentially the molecules that carry amino acids to the ribosome for use in building the polypeptide chain.\n\n【2】So in the context of polypeptide synthesis (translation), C. tRNA is the most correct answer if we have to choose only one. \n\n【3】However, if the question is referring to the overall process of gene expression, leading to the synthesis of a polypeptide, then all options contribute.

Which of the following cells are most impoantly involved in the pathogenesis of the above disease: -\nA.CD4 T cells\nB.CD8 T cells\nC.B cells\nD.Dendritic cells\nAnswer:A\nExplanation:This patient's symptoms and lab findings are suggestive of giant cell arteritis (GCA), a condition that typically affects older adults and can lead to severe complications like blindness if not promptly treated. GCA is characterized by inflammation of the temporal arteries, often presenting with severe headache, jaw pain, and visual disturbances. The inflammation is caused by an immune response within the walls of the affected arteries.\n\n【1】The pathogenesis of GCA is thought to start with the activation of CD4+ T cells, a type of white blood cell that plays a key role in the immune response. CD4+ T cells enter the arterial wall via the vasa vasorum (small vessels supplying blood to the outer parts of larger blood vessels). Once in the wall, these T cells become activated and stimulate macrophages to differentiate into giant cells. These giant cells contribute to the granulomatous inflammation that typifies GCA.\n\n【2】Other markers of inflammation, such as B cells (which produce antibodies as part of the immune response), may also be present, but they're not thought to directly initiate the disease process - hence why the answer to this question is CD4+ T cells and not B cells, CD8+ T cells, or dendritic cells. This is supported by research showing that severe forms of GCA are associated with higher total numbers of CD4+ T cells and that these cells are a critical driver of the inflammatory process.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medmcqa", "batch_name": "20240423", "version": "version8"}

Oxidative phosphorylation is the process in which ATP (the main source of energy for cellular reactions) is formed as a result of the transfer of electrons from NADH or FADH2 to O2 by a series of electron carriers.\n\n【1】DNP disrupts this process by carrying protons across the mitochondrial membrane, leading to the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. In other words, it makes the cell's mitochondria leak, so that they are less efficient at making ATP.\n\n【2】As a result, the energy from the electron transport chain is dissipated as heat rather than being used to make ATP. The body must burn more fat and carbohydrate to make up for the lost ATP, which can lead to weight loss.\n\n【3】Thus, DNP does not inhibit electron transfer or ATP synthase, nor does it inhibit the exchange of ATP and ADP. Instead, it uncouples the process of Phosphorylation from electron transfer, dissolving the proton gradient and releasing energy as heat. This is why choice C, \"Uncoupling of phosphorylation from electron transfer,\" is the correct answer.\n\n【4】Please note that while DNP can lead to weight loss, it is also extremely dangerous and can lead to severe overheating, hyperthermia, and death.

The most common causes are vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies.

Neuroblastoma most often begins in the adrenal glands but can also develop in nerve tissue running along the spine, chest, abdomen, or pelvis. It is the most common cancer diagnosed in the first year of life.\n\n【1】This cancer has a high propensity to spread (metastasize), often before the disease is even diagnosed. As stated in the reference, metastases are present in 60-70% of children at the time of diagnosis. The most common body parts to which neuroblastoma spreads are the bones, including the facial bones and skull, and, less commonly, the bone marrow and lymph nodes.\n\n【2】Wilm's tumor is a kidney cancer that primarily affects children. Adrenal gland tumors can be either benign or malignant and may produce excess hormones.

This pressure then leads to fluid buildup or congestion in various areas of the body, including the liver. Hence, the liver is seen as being congested. \n\n【1】A congested liver due to Chronic Right Heart Failure often results in the formation of a \"nutmeg liver\", a condition characterized by patchy areas of congestion and ischemia, giving the liver a mottled, nutmeg-like appearance.\n\n【2】This does not typically cause the liver to shrink (B) as cirrhosis or advanced liver disease does. It also does not primarily result in a fatty liver (C), although individuals with chronic heart failure may also have a fatty liver due to other underlying conditions.

These conditions occur due to the limitations these babies had in the womb, where they were unable to grow to their genetically expected size.\n\n【1】Intracranial bleed, however, is not a common condition seen in small for date babies, making option C the correct answer. Intracranial bleed, or hemorrhage, happens when there is bleeding inside the skull. This condition is usually associated with premature babies, especially those with very low birth weight, and it often occurs due to injury during delivery or due to an undeveloped or fragile blood vessels in the baby's brain which may rupture easily.\n\n【2】On the contrary, SGA babies have been restricted in growth during gestation, but not necessarily premature, so they do not have the same risk factors for intracranial bleed as do premature babies. Notwithstanding, each baby is individual and may face different medical challenges, therefore this does not mean that SGA babies cannot have an intracranial bleed, rather it is not commonly seen in these babies. \n\n【3】In summary, the conditions commonly associated with SGA babies are hypoglycemia, hypothermia and polycythemia, but not typically intracranial bleed.\nAnswer:C", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medmcqa", "batch_name": "20240423", "version": "version8"}

This condition is most commonly caused by a prolonged deficiency of vitamin D, which is vital for the absorption of calcium and phosphate in the gut. These minerals are crucial for the hardness and strength of bones.\n\n【1】As a result of this deficiency, the body fails to mineralize the growing bones properly, causing softening and deformation of the bones. This can lead to various skeletal abnormalities, including widening of the epiphysis. \n\n【2】Epiphysis refers to the end part of a long bone, which develops separately from the shaft of the bone in childhood and adolescence. In rickets, the deficiency of minerals causes inadequate deposition of calcium and phosphate in the epiphyseal plates, which are responsible for the growth of long bones. This leads to the widening, and other changes like splaying (spreading apart), and cupping (forming of a hollow or depression) of the epiphyses.\n\n【3】In contrast, the other conditions listed do not typically cause a widening of the epiphysis. Scurvy, caused by a deficiency of vitamin C, can lead to other bone changes, but not typically widening of the epiphysis. Achondroplasia, a type of dwarfism, leads to stunted bone growth, particularly in the long bones, but does not cause widening of the epiphysis. Osteopetrosis, also known as marble bone disease, is a rare genetic disorder that causes bones to harden, becoming denser, but does not typically result in widening of the epiphysis.\n\n【4】References:\n1.

It is a potential sign of an anterior cranial fossa fracture.\n\n【1】The anterior cranial fossa houses the eyes and anterior parts of the brain. When this fossa is fractured, blood can leak from the fractured area and pool around the eyes, causing the characteristic panda/raccoon's eyes appearance. This is usually bilateral (meaning it happens on both sides) because the anterior cranial fossa is in the middle of the skull, and a fracture there can easily affect both eyes.\n\n【2】In contrast, a unilateral sign (happening on one side only) would be less likely in an anterior cranial fossa fracture, but could potentially occur in other types of bone fractures which affect only one side (not relating to panda sign). \n\n【3】Therefore, the panda sign is usually bilateral and indicative of an anterior cranial fossa fracture, hence why B: \"Bilateral & sign of anterior cranial fossa fracture\" is the correct answer. The absence of conjunctival injection (redness or swelling of the eyes) serves to differentiate a fracture from direct eye trauma.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medmcqa", "batch_name": "20240423", "version": "version8"}

This causes a change in the overall structure of the hemoglobin molecule. As a result, under conditions of low oxygen tension, these altered hemoglobin molecules (HbS) tend to stick together or 'polymerize', forming long, rigid rods within the red blood cells. These rods alter the normal round shape of the red cells, causing them to become rigid and sickle-shaped. \n\n【1】This polymerization process also drastically reduces the solubility of the hemoglobin within the cell, making it much less capable of carrying and delivering oxygen - a primary function of red blood cells. Furthermore, the sickle-shaped cells can block blood vessels, leading to various complications associated with the disease.\n\n【2】Therefore, the proper property of hemoglobin affected in sickle cell anemia is solubility (choice D).

Lysosomes are specialized organelles filled with enzymes capable of breaking down biomolecules. When the lysosome fuses with the autophagic vacuole, its enzymes are released into the vacuole, allowing these substances to be broken down into recyclable materials such as amino acids, fatty acids, and sugars.

Cervical incompetence refers to painless cervical dilation in the second trimester leading to preterm births and/or late miscarriages. \n\n【1】The risk increases if the woman has undergone certain procedures involving the cervix, like a conization, and also with the history of preterm births. Cervical conization is a procedure done to remove precancerous cells from the cervix and can weaken the cervical tissue.\n\n【2】Cervical cerclage is a surgical procedure done to prevent preterm labor in cases of cervical incompetence. It involves placement of a stitch in the cervix to keep it closed, which is usually done between 12 to 14 weeks of gestation.\n\n【3】Measuring cervical length by ultrasound (option A) can help assess the risk of preterm labor, but in someone with this patient's history, cerclage would be indicated regardless of the cervical length.\n\n【4】Bed rest (option C) and tocolysis (option D) would not adequately address the risk of preterm labor in her case, since the primary issue is likely physical weakness of the cervix, not just premature contractions. \n\n【5】So, the best step in the management of this patient would be to apply Cervical Cerclage by 12 weeks (option B).\nAnswer:B", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medmcqa", "batch_name": "20240423", "version": "version8"}

This means that a methyl group (a carbon atom bonded to three hydrogen atoms, -CH3) is added to norepinephrine to turn it into epinephrine. \n\n【1】This methylation process is carried out by an enzyme called phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT). PNMT uses the molecule S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) as a methyl donor, transferring the methyl group from SAM to the norepinephrine molecule. This transforms norepinephrine (which primarily functions as a neurotransmitter) into epinephrine, which has a broader role as both a hormone and a neurotransmitter.\n\n【2】The process is as follows:\nNorepinephrine + S-adenosylmethionine → Epinephrine + S-adenosylhomocysteine\n\n【3】In terms of the other options listed, decarboxylation, oxidation, and sulphation are all different types of chemical reactions that can occur in the body.

It uses X-rays and a special dye (i.e., contrast material) to produce detailed images of the liver.\n\n【1】With regard to the detection size, it is generally agreed in medical imaging community that CECT can reliably detect liver lesions that are at least 5mm in diameter (Ans.B). \n\n【2】The reason for this is due to the image resolution of the CT scanner. A lesion of less than 5mm diameter may not be picked up or could easily be confused with normal anatomical structures or imaging artifacts, thus leading to false negatives or false positives.\n\n【3】However, it must be emphasized that the ability of CECT to detect smaller lesions also depends on other factors like the type of CT scanner used, the imaging protocol (e.g., slice thickness), the nature of the lesion (e.g., its density, morphology, and location), and the level of radiologist's expertise and experience.\n\n【4】As for the differentiation between benign and malignant, CECT can often provide useful clues but the diagnosis usually needs to be confirmed with biopsy or other diagnostic tests (e.g., magnetic resonance imaging or positron emission tomography). \n\n【5】Therefore, in case of a suspicious liver lesion smaller than 5mm detected by other initial imaging tests, more sensitive imaging modalities or follow-up imaging studies might be required.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medmcqa", "batch_name": "20240423", "version": "version8"}

It often starts as a fever and flu-like symptoms, followed by a painful red or purplish rash that spreads, causing the top layer of the skin to die, blister and shed off.\n\n【1】The underlying mechanism for SJS is classified as a Type III Hypersensitivity reaction. This category of reaction is an immune complex-mediated hypersensitivity. Unlike Type I, II, and IV hypersensitivity reactions, which involve individual antibody or T cell responses, Type III reactions involve the formation of immune complexes.\n\n【2】Immune complexes are clusters of interlocking antigens and antibodies.

This medication can be used to relieve pain associated with iridocyclitis, an inflammation of the iris and ciliary body. \n\n【1】A. Atropine does induce dilation of the pupil, which helps to prevent and may break synechiae (adhesions between the iris and lens or cornea), which can occur in cases of prolonged, severe inflammation.\n\n【2】B.

The decreased hyperaemia (excess blood flow) and the subsequent reduction in inflammatory exudation (fluid leakage from blood vessels) is another effect of Atropine.\n\n【4】D. However, atropine does not generally decrease intraocular pressure by increasing aqueous outflow. It can actually increase intraocular pressure in certain patients, particularly in those with narrow-angle glaucoma.

It is common in older men. The prostate gland surrounds the urethra, so as it enlarges, it can cause problems with urination.\n\n【1】Urinary frequency, or the need to urinate more often, is often the earliest symptom of BPH. This is because as the prostate enlarges, it presses against the urethra, which can cause an increased need to urinate, often with urgency and discomfort. This can occur during both day and night. Urinary frequency is often the first sign that alerts a person to visit their healthcare provider.\n\n【2】The other symptoms mentioned can occur as BPH progresses and worsens. Incontinence refers to the inability to control urination, which would indicate a more advanced case of BPH. Hematuria refers to blood in the urine, which is not a usual symptom of BPH and can suggest other issues, such as urinary tract infections, bladder stones, or bladder cancer.

As spontaneous breathing has commenced, it means the airway is no longer compromised and hence the ventilation can be discontinued. Moreover, since the heart rate is within the normal range, it implies adequate oxygenation and cardiac output, therefore chest compression or ET intubation is not required.\n\n【1】Hence, the next step in managing this neonate should be discontinuation of the ventilation (Option A). It is important to continue monitoring the neonate very closely for any signs of respiratory distress or change in heart rate. Regular follow-up is necessary to ensure adequate lung function and cardiac output.\n\n【2】This approach aligns with the American Heart Association's guidelines for neonatal resuscitation. Regular reassessment is required after each step and intervention can be adjusted based on the ongoing clinical assessment of the neonate.\n\n【3】Please note that this information is intended for a general understanding and may not apply to any and all specific patient related scenarios.

This condition is characterized by an abnormal development of the posterior urethra, which can cause blockage of urine flow. As a result, the affected infant may present with hydronephrosis, renal damage, or reflux nephropathy.\n\n【1】PUV can occur in different areas of the urethra, but they are most commonly found in the prostatic urethra. These valves are abnormal flaps or folds of tissue that obstruct the urethra, the tube that drains urine from the bladder to the outside of the body. When these valves are present, they can block the outflow of urine, causing it to back up into the kidney, causing damage.\n\n【2】Prune-Belly syndrome and Bladder neck obstruction are less common causes of severe obstructive uropathy in neonates compared to PUV. Prune-Belly syndrome is a condition characterized by a lack of abdominal muscles, causing the skin of the belly area to wrinkle like a prune. It is often associated with urinary tract problems. Bladder neck obstruction involves the narrowing or blockage of the area where the bladder and urethra meet, which can lead to difficulties in urination.\n\n【3】Hence, although all option A, B, and C can cause obstructive uropathy, the most common cause in neonates is posterior urethral valves (Option C).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medmcqa", "batch_name": "20240423", "version": "version8"}

On examination, the infant has cyanosis and bilateral crepitations. Heart rate is 180/min, respiratory rate 56/min and the liver span 7.5 cm. The child has had repeated episodes of fever, cough and respiratory distress since the time of birth. Cardiovascular examination reveals a grade III ejection systolic murmur in left parasternal area and the chest X-ray reveals cardiomegaly with a narrow base and plethoric lung fields. What is the most likely diagnosis ?\nA.Congenital methemoglobinemia\nB.Transposition of great arteries\nC.Cystic fibrosis\nD.Tetralogy of Fallot\nExplanation:The patient's history of repeated episodes of fever, cough, and respiratory distress since birth and presence of cyanosis (blue discoloration indicating lack of oxygen), high heart rate, high respiratory rate, and abnormal liver span hint towards a serious systemic or congenital condition. The grade III ejection systolic murmur in the left parasternal area and the finding of cardiomegaly (enlarged heart) with a narrow base and plethoric lung fields (increased blood flow to the lungs) on chest X-ray further suggests a cardiac issue.\n\n【1】The diagnosis of Transposition of the Great Arteries (TGA) is most likely due to the cyanosis, the ejection systolic murmur, and cardiomegaly with plethoric lung fields on the chest X-ray. TGA is a serious congenital heart defect where the two main arteries leaving the heart are reversed. This leads to poor oxygenation of blood, which in turn causes cyanosis. Infants with TGA generally present within the first hours or days after birth with cyanosis and respiratory distress unless there is a large septal defect (hole in the heart) allowing mixing of blood. Hence, repeated episodes of symptoms since birth further supports this diagnosis.\n\n【2】Congenital methemoglobinemia is a condition that affects the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, leading to cyanosis, but it does not cause the other symptoms seen in this case or the specific findings on physical examination and chest X-ray. You would also expect the blood to be a chocolate brown color.\n\n【3】Cystic fibrosis can cause respiratory distress and repeated episodes of lung infections but it does not cause heart murmurs or the other cardiac findings. Children with cystic fibrosis also often have issues with weight gain and digestive problems, which are not mentioned in this case.\n\n【4】Tetralogy of Fallot is another congenital heart condition that could explain some of the symptoms, especially cyanosis, but it typically presents with a boot-shaped heart on X-ray rather than the findings in this case. Also, the murmur in Tetralogy of Fallot is usually along the left upper sternal border, not the left parasternal area.\nAnswer:B", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medmcqa", "batch_name": "20240423", "version": "version8"}

Chlorination, which is the process of adding chlorine or hypochlorite to achieve disinfection, is common for pool disinfection. This is because it is relatively inexpensive, highly effective against bacteria and viruses, and the residual effect of chlorine can protect against recontamination. \n\n【1】Residual free chlorine refers to the amount of chlorine that stays in the water after all the organic matter, bacteria, and viruses have been killed. It is recommended to maintain this at 1 mg/litre as it ensures that there is always chlorine available to kill any new bacteria or viruses that enter the pool. This keeps the pool safe for those swimming.\n\n【2】However, it should also be noted that while a lower level of residual chlorine might still kill bacteria and viruses, it will do so at a slower rate. On the other hand, a much higher level than the recommended 1mg/litre can result in skin, eye and respiratory irritation to swimmers. \n\n【3】Thus, the statement refers to the balance between ensuring effective disinfection and maintaining safety and comfort for swimmers.

It can also cause flu-like symptoms, like fever and chills.\n\n【1】The first line of treatment for mastitis is antibiotics, to clear up the infection, and pain relief medication. However, it is also highly recommended that women continue breastfeeding during this time. Mastitis is usually caused by trapped milk in the breast, and breastfeeding can help to ease the symptoms by helping to clear the milk ducts. The infection will not harm the baby, as any bacteria in the milk will be killed off in the baby's stomach.\n\n【2】Option B (Breastfeed from unaffected breast only) is not advisable, because it will increase the risk of the milk in the infected breast becoming stagnant, which can worsen the mastitis. \n\n【3】Option C (Immediately start antibiotics and breastfeed only when antibiotics are discontinued) is also incorrect. It's true that antibiotics are necessary, but breastfeeding should be continued while taking the antibiotics. \n\n【4】Option D (Pump and discard breastmilk till infection is over and then continue breastfeeding) is not recommended because, as mentioned earlier, breastfeeding can actually help to alleviate the symptoms of mastitis. Furthermore, the milk does not need to be discarded because the infection does not harm the baby. \n\n【5】Therefore, the correct answer is A (Continue feeding from both the breasts).

There are two major ways influenza viruses can change: Antigenic shift and antigenic drift.\n\n【1】Antigenic drift refers to small, gradual changes that happen over time as the virus replicates. These small genetic changes can accumulate over time and result in viruses that are related, but not identical, to their predecessor. This is the reason why the flu vaccine must be updated annually. \n\n【2】Antigenic shift, on the other hand, refers to an abrupt, major change to the influenza virus resulting in a new subtype of virus. This can lead to a pandemic, as the human immune system has little to no pre-existing immunity to the new subtype. \n\n【3】Antigenic shift occurs when two or more different strains of a virus, or strains from different species, simultaneously infect the same cell and swap genome segments. This \"reassortment\" results in a novel subtype different from both parent strains. As reassortment creates dramatically different strains, the disease produced can be much more severe.\n\n【4】So, when we're talking about abrupt and drastic changes in influenza, we're usually referring to antigenic shift, rather than antigenic drift.

An agonist is a substance which initiates a physiological response when combined with a receptor. \n\n【1】In this case, buspirone's action on the serotonin system helps to reduce feelings of fear, tension and nervousness.

One of these conditions is atelectasis, a complete or partial collapse of a lung or lobe of a lung. If a lung is affected by atelectasis, even if a breath was taken, it may not inflate properly and could potentially sink in a hydrostatic test, providing a false indication that the baby did not take a breath.\n\n【2】Other conditions that can cause a false negative result on a hydrostatic test by preventing proper lung inflation include acute pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs), pneumonia (lung inflammation), and congenital syphilis, which can cause a range of abnormalities including respiratory distress. \n\n【3】However, conditions like meconium aspiration, emphysema, or putrefaction do not typically cause a false negative result in the hydrostatic test.\n\n【4】Reference:\n- Modi N, Uthaya S, Fallows A, Battersby C.

The plan focused on significant reductions in prevalent health issues, aiming for a comprehensive development of the nation's health standards. The goal included reducing the IMR to 25 deaths per 1000 live births, MMR to 100 deaths per 100,000 live births, and TFR to 2.1.\n\n【2】It also included reducing the prevalence of leprosy to less than 1 per 10,000 population, preventing and reducing under-nutrition in children under 3 years, decreasing the incidence of anaemia among women, and managing the out-of-pocket expenditure for poor households. Thus, all the options except 'Reduce IMR to 20' were a part of the 12th Five Year Plan's target health indicators.\nAnswer:C", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medmcqa", "batch_name": "20240423", "version": "version8"}

This compression hampers the heart's ability to pump blood, leading to symptoms like breathlessness, weakness, lightheadedness, and cough.\n\n【1】Several physical manifestations associated with cardiac tamponade include elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), muffled heart sounds, and pulses paradoxus, where the pulse is stronger on inhalation and weaker on exhalation. \n\n【2】However, a rapid x descent, which implies a steep reduction in central venous pressure following systolic contraction, is typically not observed in cardiac tamponade. Instead, in cardiac tamponade, a rapid y descent may be noted, representing the rapid early filling of the ventricle in early diastole before the pressure rises due to increasing volume. This is due to the fact that the pericardial effusion (fluid in the pericardial sac) restricts ventricular filling, causing blood to rush in rapidly initially when the ventricular pressure is low but then slowing as pressure rapidly increases. \n\n【3】Therefore, the correct answer is C - Rapid x descent.\nAnswer:C", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medmcqa", "batch_name": "20240423", "version": "version8"}

All of the following are taken into account in terming a baby 'vigorous' EXCEPT:\nA.Tone\nB.Colour\nC.Hea Rate\nD.Respiration\nAnswer:B\nExplanation:In the context of neonatology, a \"vigorous\" baby typically refers to a newborn who shows strong signs of life, such as a heart rate above 100 bpm, good muscle tone, and strong respiratory efforts. However, the term does not take into account color of the baby.\n\n【1】The color of a newborn can vary, often starting off purple or blueish and then changing to a pinkish color over the first few minutes after birth as the baby starts to breathe and oxygenate its blood. While color can be an indicator of certain health issues, it is not typically considered in the assessment of a baby's vigour.\n\n【2】The color of a newborn can be influenced by many factors, including the amount of oxygen it is receiving, its skin pigmentation, its blood pressure, and the amount of blood in its vessels close to the skin. Because of this, even a baby that is relatively healthy and vigorous might not have the \"ideal\" pink color immediately after birth.\n\n【3】Also, in the context of the question, we're talking about a baby born with meconium stained liquor (amniotic fluid stained with the baby's first stool). This can potentially cause meconium aspiration syndrome. But, even in this case, a baby can be vigorous and not require suctioning just because there's meconium in the amniotic fluid. The decision to intubate for suctioning is based on the same 3 factors: heart rate, respirations, and muscle tone. So, color is not a factor in deciding whether a baby is vigorous or not.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "medmcqa", "batch_name": "20240423", "version": "version8"}
