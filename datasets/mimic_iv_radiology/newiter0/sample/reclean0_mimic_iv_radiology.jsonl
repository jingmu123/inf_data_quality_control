Further evaluation with dedicated imaging\ncan be performed as clinically indicated.\n\n【21】Also seen is a 2.4 cm simple cyst in the interpolar region of right kidney\nposteriorly.  There is another sub cm cyst in the right kidney.  There are\nmultiple septated perinephric cysts in the left kidney.\n\n【22】There is mild congenital spinal stenosis.\n\n【23】At T12-L1, there is mild disc bulge with bilateral facet arthropathy without\nneural foramina or spinal canal stenosis.\n\n【24】At L1-L2, there is broad-based disc bulge with bilateral facet arthropathy\ncausing mild bilateral neural foramen narrowing.  The spinal canal is patent.\n\n【25】At L2-L3, there is broad-based disc bulge with bilateral facet arthropathy\ncausing mild right neural foramen narrowing.  The left neural foramen is\npatent.  The disc bulge with epidural fat and ligamentum flavum thickening\ncontribute to moderate spinal canal stenosis.\n\n【26】At L3-L4, there is broad-based disc bulge with bilateral facet arthropathy,\nligamentum flavum thickening and prominent epidural fat causing severe spinal\ncanal stenosis and moderate to severe bilateral neural foramen narrowing with\nnarrowing of bilateral lateral recesses impinging the traversing L4 nerve\nroots.\n\n【27】At L4-L5, there is broad-based disc bulge with bilateral facet arthropathy\ncausing indentation of ventral thecal sac without spinal canal stenosis.  Also\nseen is moderate left and mild right neural foramen narrowing.\n\n【28】At L5-S1, there is broad-based disc bulge with bilateral facet arthropathy\ncausing mild bilateral neural foraminal narrowing.  The spinal canal is\npatent.\n\n【29】IMPRESSION:\n\n【30】1. Extensive osseous metastasis involving all the cervical, thoracic and\nlumbar vertebral bodies with compression fracture along the superior endplate\nof T1 with minimal retropulsion at that level causing mild spinal canal\nstenosis.  There is enhancing cortical expansion of the posterior T1 vertebral\nbody compatible with pathologic fracture and underlying tumor.\n2. There is a poorly defined 2 mm thick T2 hyperintense, potentially enhancing\nright anterior epidural focus spanning the T4-T7 levels, which may represent\ntumor versus prominent venous plexus.  Dedicated thoracic spine imaging could\nbe performed for high-resolution detail.\n3. Multilevel multifactorial degenerative disease of the cervical spine, worst\nat C6-C7 with moderate to severe bilateral neural foramen narrowing and mild\nspinal canal stenosis as described above.\n4. Mild degenerative disease involving the lower thoracic spine without neural\nforamina or spinal canal stenosis at any level.\n5. Multilevel multifactorial degenerative disease of the lumbar spine is most\nprominent at L3-L4.  New there is severe spinal canal narrowing and severe\nbilateral neural foraminal narrowing.  Additional changes as described above.\n6. Large left and moderate right pleural effusion.  The right-sided pleural\neffusion appears to have increased compared to the prior CT of the chest.\n7.

He was transferred to the fluoroscopic table supine.  After smooth\ninduction general endotracheal anesthesia and placement of a Foley catheter,\nbilateral groins were prepped and draped in standard sterile fashion.  A\ntime-out was performed.  The right common femoral artery was identified using\nanatomic and radiographic landmarks.  The right common femoral artery was\naccessed using standard micropuncture technique after infiltration of local\nanesthetic.  A long 8 ___ sheath was introduced, connected to continuous\nheparinized saline flush, and secured.\n\n【18】Next a 125 cm Berenstein catheter was loaded inside a Cook shuttle guide\ncatheter.  There advanced over exchange length Glidewire through the aorta\ninto the aortic arch.  The wire was used to select the left internal carotid\nartery.  The Berenstein catheter was positioned over the wire into the left\ninternal carotid artery.  The Cook shuttle guide catheter was positioned\nwithin the left common carotid artery.  The exchange length Glidewire and the\nBerenstein catheter were removed.  The guide catheter was double flushed and\nconnected to continuous heparinized saline flush as well as power injector. \nVessel patency was confirmed via hand injection.

This branch did not seem appropriate for embolization as there was\nminimal gain in reduction of AVM nidus with significant risk of shunting to\nthe venous side.\n\n【22】The micro wire was introduced.  It was then navigated into the next most\nsuperior ACA feeders that was supplying the AVM.  The micro wire was removed. \nMicro injection revealed a more significant portion of the AVM filling.  The\nmicrocatheter was flushed with 6 x 1 cc syringes of heparinized saline and\nthen prepared with DMSO.  Onyx embolization material was injected using\nfluoroscopic guidance. Once there was evidence of a flash of embolic material\ninto the vein, embolization from this feeder was concluded. The microcatheter\nwas removed under fluoroscopic guidance after aspiration was applied to the on\nOnyx syringe.  The 3 cm tip detached.

The intermediate catheter was allowed to back bleed to clear\nthe catheter of any embolic material that remained.\n\n【23】Fresh roadmap was performed.  Fresh ___  catheter was re-loaded with a\nmirage wire and advanced into the middle feeder from the ACA to the AVM that\nalso supplied the anterior portion.  The micro wire was removed.  Micro\ninjection revealed contrast opacification of the AVM nidus.\nThe microcatheter was flushed with 6 x 1 cc syringes of heparinized saline and\nthen prepared with DMSO.  Onyx embolization material was injected using\nfluoroscopic guidance. Once there was evidence of a flash of embolic material\ninto the vein that joined the previous material already in the vein,\nembolization from this feeder was concluded. The microcatheter was removed\nunder fluoroscopic guidance after aspiration was applied to the on Onyx\nsyringe. The 3 cm tip detached.

Micro\ninjection revealed contrast opacification of the AVM nidus. The microcatheter\nwas flushed with 6 x 1 cc syringes of heparinized saline and then prepared\nwith DMSO.  Onyx embolization material was injected using fluoroscopic\nguidance. Once there was evidence of reflux of embolic material, embolization\nfrom this feeder was concluded. The microcatheter was removed under\nfluoroscopic guidance after aspiration was applied to the on Onyx syringe. The\n3 cm tip remained fixed to the catheter and was removed from the body\ncompletely.  Follow-up angiogram was performed via the guide catheter that\nshowed decrease in flow to the AVM based on the embolization.  The\nintermediate catheter was allowed to back bleed to clear the catheter of any\nembolic material that remained.  Majority of the ACA contribution to AVM was\nsuccessfully embolized.
