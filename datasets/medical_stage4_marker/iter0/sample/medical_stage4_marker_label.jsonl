What Is The Correct Way To Use My Metered-Dose Inhaler (Mdi)?\n\n【2】Metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) are convenient, highly portable, and very reliable devices designed to deliver active medicine by inhalation. MDIs are conceptually similar to dry powder inhalers (DPIs) (discussed in Question 62). Both MDIs and DPIs allow for the delivery of accurate, predetermined doses of medicine directly to the respiratory passages. MDIs and DPIs also have some basic, fundamental differences. All MDIs use a propellant to \"push\" the medicine out of its dosing canister. All MDIs on the market in the United States are manually activated rather than breath activated (with one exception: the Maxair® Autohaler®). Manually activated means that the medicine is released from the MDI canister when you press down on the MDI. Breath activated means that the medicine is automatically released when you inhale deeply. Because MDIs are patient activated\n(except for the Maxair® Autohaler®, which is the only breath-activated MDI), their proper use is technically more demanding and requires more \"coaching\" as compared with DPIs. The correct way to use your MDI is best demonstrated by your physician. There are two techniques for \"best\" use: the open-mouth and the closed-mouth technique. All MDIs come with directions. The directions, or what your pharmacist calls the manufacturer's \"package insert,\" describe the closed-mouth technique. Pulmonary specialists (such as myself) generally prefer to teach their patients the open-mouth method of using the MDI. Many pulmonary specialists believe that using the MDI with an open mouth enhances the delivery of medicine and favors the inhalation of the more desirable, smaller particles released by the MDI. MDIs should be kept at room temperature and should not be subjected to sustained temperatures below 59F or above 77F. MDIs should be stored in a vertical position with the mouthpiece down when not in use. If you notice that the plastic mouthpiece becomes coated with a whitish powder, pull the metal MDI canister out from the plastic mouthpiece and rinse the mouthpiece under warm tap water until it looks clean. Make sure the mouthpiece is completely dry before reinserting the metal canister. It is fine to let the plastic part air-dry. All MDIs should ideally be allowed to reach room temperature before use. If you carry your \"rescue\" MDI with you, and you are outdoors on an especially cold day, place it in an inner pocket close to your body rather than in a handbag or backpack. Never leave an MDI in the glove compartment or trunk of your car on a hot summer day; its contents are under pressure and can explode in very hot environments (120F or above). Several years ago, one of my patients didn't seem to be faring as well as I had expected. She was an elderly widow and lived alone in the same big house where she had raised her children. She and I spent an entire office visit carefully going over \"what had changed\" to explain her loss of asthma control. Imagine my consternation when she confided that she had hit on a \"great way\" to remember where she had put her MDIs: She stored them in her refrigerator's vegetable drawer! Her medicines were stored in her fridge, at about 40 to 45F. She would take them from the vegetable bin, and go through the process of using the MDI, not realizing that they needed to be stored in a warmer environment, and certainly warmed to room temperature before use! After we decided that she should keep her medicines on the top of the chest of drawers in the bedroom, her asthma once again became controlled, much to our mutual satisfaction.\n\n【3】The general concept in using an MDI is that you trigger the release of medicine from the MDI while simultaneously inhaling the medication into \"empty\" lungs. The basic technique consists of: (1) an initial exhalation to empty your lungs, (2) release of a \"puff\" of medication to coincide with a full, steady, deep inhalation, followed by (3) breath holding. To use your MDI, first remove the cap from the mouthpiece. You should ideally stand upright to use your inhaler. If you prefer to be seated, make sure that you sit upright. Hold the inhaler upright, with the mouthpiece at the bottom. Many people find it most comfortable to hold the MDI with their thumb at the lowermost portion and their third finger on the topmost metal portion of the MDI canister. Next, shake the MDI canister to mix the medicine. After shaking the MDI, position the mouthpiece 2 to 3 finger widths (1 to 2 in.) in front of your open mouth. Tilt your head back slightly, and gently breathe out. When you have emptied your lungs, press on the MDI, and as simultaneously as you can, take a slow, deep breath. Keep breathing inwards, for at least 5 seconds. Once you have inhaled fully, hold your breath to allow the medicine to fully penetrate in your lungs and deposit there. Try to hold your breath for 10 seconds. Exhale and resume normal breathing. If your doctor has prescribed a second puff of medication, you may be instructed to wait a minute or more between doses. The MDI-delivered medicine should be going straight into your lungs; consequently, it not should irritate your throat or cause you to cough, nor should it land on your tongue and cause a \"weird\" taste. It is important that you learn to use your prescribed MDI correctly (Table 27).

Other characteristics that are present are a brachicephalic facial type, increased muscle tone, a square face and perfect lip closure. The diagnosis of this alteration with x-rays and cephalometric radiographs will determine if the discrepancy or alterations are at bone or teeth levels and if the problem lies in the maxilla, in the mandible or both.(ll.l5.l6) \n\n【1】2. \nDentoalveolar deep **bite** is characterized by molar \ninfraclusion and/or incisor overeruption. \nDeep bite produced by molar infraclusion presents the following characteristics: \n\n【2】a) \nThe molars have erupted partially. \nb) \nThe inter occlusal space is ample. \nc) \nThe tongue occupies a lateral position. \nd) \nThe distances between the basal planes of \nboth maxillas and the occlusal plane are short.(16) \nThe deep bite produced by the over eruption of the incisors presents the following characteristics: \n\n【3】a) \nThe incisor edges of the incisors exceed the occlusal \nplane. \nb) \nThe molars have erupted completely. \nc) \nThe Spee curve is excessive. \nd) \nThe inter occlusal space is reduced.(1\n6) \nDue to the hypo divergent growth, the incisors are compressed by the muscles of the lips and their hyper tonicity is going to provoke retroclination of the crowns of the incisors producing a deep bite. Of this functional influence and the consequential deviation of the dental eruptive pattern, the rest of the occlusal anomalies will develop, like retroclination, deep bite, mesialization of the buccal segments and overcrowding. \n\n【4】While the molars erupt, the anterior deep bite does not allow lateral movements of the mandible and the child becomes a vertical chewer. Aperture and · \nclosure movements that act like functional stimuli for the growth of the anterior maxillary alveolar apophysis are limited and inhibit mandible development. Anterior deep bites in the primary dentition are very frequent, but they are rarely treated. They can be associated with the presence of Class II malocclusions in development. The decisions of treatment are generally postponed until the mixed dentition. \n\n【5】The indications for such treatment in the primary dentition include: lower incisor impact on the palatal mucosa, excessive wear and headachesYl.l5.l6) \nStrong posterior mastication worsens the bite because it puts posterior teeth in infraclusion. Normally the inferior incisors present a marked retroclination due to blockage by the upper incisors and extrude until they touch the palatal mucosa. In occasions the overbite is so severe that the lower incisors are totally covered by the upper teeth. \n\n【6】This excessive overbite may produce trauma in the lower buccal mucosa and in the palatine mucosa of the upper maxilla. Deep bite is a typical clinical sign of Class II division 2 malocclusions.(ll.l5) \nAcquired deep bite can be caused by the following factors: \n\n【7】1. \nThe lateral posture of the tongue. \n2. \nThe premature loss of \ndeciduous molars or permanent \nposterior molars. \n3. \nWear of the occlusal surface or dental abrasion. \n\n【8】## Possible Treatment Options To Open Deep Bites\n\n【9】Deep bite can be localized in the dentoalveolar or skeletal zone, and treatment will always depend on the affected zone. \n\n【10】The correction of dentoalveolar deep bite can be obtained by intrusion of the anterior teeth, extrusion of posterior teeth, a combination of both, posterior teeth up righting and increasing the inclination of the anterior teeth.(1l,15.l6) \nAnterior teeth intrusion may be indicated in patients that show too much upper gum (gummy smile), or if they have too much dental mass in the four anterosuperior teeth, a great interlip gap or a steep mandibular plane. \n\n【11】Intrusive movements are very violent and may cause root resorption. But Gottlieb showed that using 15-20 g of force per incisor there is no measurable root shortening or visible apical resorption.(lU5) \nExtrusion of the posterior teeth may be the treatment of choice in patients in which we want to increase inferior facial height, improve facial convexity orif we want to open the mandibular plane.(23) \nbite plane induces molar extrusion but does not have an There is great controversy surrounding the effects of premolar extraction in vertical dimension. Viazis considers extractions of premolar counterproductive in patients intrusive effect on the anterior segment. Sleichter studied the vertical changes of molars and incisors, and found that the height of the molar region increased while the anterior region had a minimal change. (16.20) \nwith deep bite because the rest of the teeth would move lingually and the bite would deepen more.(22) \nDeep bite, apart from producing occlusal irregularities, may intervene in the seating and/or increase of problems in the TMJ. For this, orthodontists have tried for some years to reduce the depth of deep bites using different mechanisms from the use of extra oral appliances \n(feared by the patients because of its anti esthetic effects), till the most recent elements described in the literature product of clinical investigation with basis in bioengineering applied to the design of elements for dental movement control. Studies in Physics and Biomechanics have given us designs of arches and passive and active elements that are more efficient and plural.(1\n2) \nThe options that we will review in this chapter for the opening of the anterior bite are as follows: \nAnterior bite plane. \n\n【12】Anterior bite plane with intermaxillary elastics. \n\n【13】Bite ramps. \n\n【14】Bypass. \n\n【15】Incisal brace placement.

What Is The Contemporary View Of Asthma, And How Does It Differ From Traditional Views?\n\n【2】For many years, asthma was viewed as a disease of airway narrowing, or bronchoconstriction. In the traditional view, the bronchial passages, especially those encircled by specialized muscle fibers, became narrowed or constricted, and an inevitable \"attack\" would follow.The traditional explanation emphasized that constriction of the bronchial tubes was the primary event in asthmatics. The focus of asthma treatment centered on attempts at reversing constricted breathing passages. Consequently, treatment consisted mostly of relief of airway narrowing once symptoms developed and became established. Emphasis was placed on treatment of \"attack\" symptoms, rather than on preventive measures.\n\n【3】The principal \"player\" or\n\"culprit\" in asthma is inflammation.\n\n【4】The contemporary perspective on asthma recognizes the importance of bronchoconstriction, but assigns it a secondary role. The principal \"player\" or \"culprit\" in asthma is inflammation. In the contemporary model of asthma, asthmatics experience periods of active disease or exacerbation, along with quiescent periods of remission (Table 2). During an exacerbation, there is increased inflammatory activity in the asthmatic lung. The inflammation, if unchecked, leads to mucus gland stimulation with excess secretions, and to eventual bronchoconstriction, or airway narrowing. The increased mucus leads to cough. The bronchoconstriction is responsible for symptoms of breathlessness, wheezing, and chest tightness. Individuals with asthma have a propensity to develop an enhanced inflammatory response in their lungs. They are said to have an innate state of lung \"baseline hyperreactivity.\" A specialized lung test, called the methacholine challenge\n(bronchoprovocation)\ntest\n(discussed in Question 29), is helpful to clinicians when evaluating individuals suspected of having asthma and a state of lung hyperreactivity.

Humans' lungs continue to grow and develop after birth. The specialized gas-exchanging lung units called alveoli, where oxygen is exchanged for carbon dioxide, develop postnatally. In fact, the majority of the lung alveoli—nearly 85%—are formed after birth, during the first three years of life. The blood supply within the capillary network matures in parallel with alveolar development from birth to 3 years of age. Mucus cells also develop after birth. Because the majority of alveoli develop postnatally, the first three years of life can be viewed as a potentially vulnerable period. Young children afflicted with severe pneumonia or tuberculosis during alveolar development, especially in the pre-antibiotic era, for example, were left with some degree of pulmonary impairment. Similarly, it is crucial that babies and young children be raised in cigarette and smoke-free homes to maximize normal lung maturation. After the age of three, the lungs are basically formed, but not fully grown. As our bodies grow through adolescence to adulthood, so too do our lungs. Adolescence represents a second \"vulnerable\" window.\n\n【3】Recent scientific studies indicate that teenagers who smoke are left with lung function that is less than predicted when compared to healthy nonsmoking teens.

All task force members and co-chairs completed rigorous COI disclosures, and potential conflicts were managed as noted below.\n\n【4】To begin the process, the evidence evaluation expert updated the 2005 evidence review worksheet for use in the 2010 process. The template was designed to facilitate the structured evidence reviews for the production of the final consensus on science and treatment recommendation documents. Successful completion of the evidence evaluation worksheet was required to ensure consistent application of the process by many different worksheet authors from around the world.\n\n【5】Use of PICO Format Shortly after the 2005 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC\nwere published, the task forces generated a comprehensive list of questions for evidence evaluation. Questions were selected based on controversy, new information, and previously identified knowledge gaps.5 The clinical questions posed during the 2005 guidelines process and the knowledge gaps identified during the 2005 Consensus on Science process provided the initial basis for this list, which was supplemented during in-person meetings and conference calls among the task forces. Questions were then refined to fit the Population Intervention Comparator Outcome (PICO) format (see Table 1 for examples).6\nThe task forces selected and invited topic experts from around the world to serve as evidence evaluation worksheet authors. Specialty organizations were also solicited to suggest potential worksheet authors. The qualifications of each worksheet author were reviewed by the task force, and potential conflicts of interest were disclosed and evaluated by the task force co-chairs and COI co-chairs. Worksheet authors could not have any significant COI issues pertaining to their assigned worksheet. If a COI was identified, the topic was assigned to a different worksheet author. Generally two authors were invited to complete independent reviews of each PICO question. A total of 356 worksheet authors from 29 countries completed 411 evidence reviews on 277 topics.\n\n【6】After generating formal search strategies directly from the PICO questions, the worksheet authors searched, at a minimum, four databases: the Cochrane Library (The Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, England), PubMed (National Library of Medicine, Washington, DC), Embase (Elsevier B.V., Amsterdam, Netherlands), and an internal database of articles constructed from previous ILCOR and ILCOR council CPR guidelines development cycles. Worksheet authors were asked to review the references cited in key articles to identify other relevant articles, and authors were encouraged to review any articles that cited the key studies found. Worksheet authors then submitted their search strategies, criteria for inclusion and exclusion of articles, and initial search results for review by the task force co-chairs, worksheet experts, and an evidence evaluation expert before initiating their literature review. If necessary, the search strategy was modified and repeated based on feedback from the reviewers. The complete search strategy was documented in the evidence evaluation worksheet; this process provided transparency and enabled the worksheet authors to use the same strategy to update the literature search just prior to the 2010 Consensus Conference. Articles could be included in the evidence review only if the full manuscript was published or accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Abstracts and unpublished data were excluded.\n\n【7】Classification of Evidence After a search strategy was approved, worksheet authors identified and reviewed each relevant study. Each relevant study was assigned both a numeric level of evidence (LOE) and a quality of evidence. The numeric LOE classification system was updated from the system used for the 2005 process based on a review of available classification schemes (see Table 2). The levels of evidence were reduced from seven categories in 2005 to five in 2010 (see Table 3). The LOEs were subdivided into three major categories, depending on the type of question being asked: intervention, diagnosis, or prognosis. The quality of evidence categories were reduced from five categories in 2005 to three (good, fair, poor) in 2010.\n\n【8】Several characteristics within each LOE were defined to guide the worksheet authors. Examples included methods of randomization, blinding, similarity of groups, and equal treatment of all groups. Complete instructions for both LOE and quality of evidence were provided to the worksheet authors.7 Worksheet authors also created a short summary of each article including the LOE, quality of evidence, direction of outcome effect for the question asked (supporting, neutral, or opposing), and outcome measured. Worksheet authors also noted industry support for the study and wrote a one- or two-sentence synopsis.\n\n【9】Worksheet Author Summary The worksheet authors summarized the evidence in a form similar to that typically used in published systematic reviews, using the evidence evaluation worksheet \"grid\" to position relevant studies in three dimensions: LOE, Quality, and", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care Science (Mary Fran Hazinski, John M.

By moving the schedule, Intel has attempted to rally the industry around EUV and to eliminate electron projection lithography (EPL). \"We fervently believe that there are not enough resources in the industry to develop both technologies,\" he says. \n\n【3】Silverman is also ready to blast ahead by placing an order with ASML for a $30- million EUV prototype machine, forcing the equipment manufacturer to commit to Benschop, research manager at ASML.\n\n【4】Intel would also like to bring Nikon, its other main supplier, into the fold. But the industry's largest equipment manufacturer, which is researching EUV outside of the U.S. consortium, is not ready to commit to a single technology—and it continues work on EPL with IBM. Other chipmakers, such as Motorola and Texas Instruments, have voiced support for the EUV competitor. \"It's still a horse race between EPL and EUV,\" says Gilbert L. Varnell, president and chief operating officer of Nikon Research Corporation of America. \"Intel has taken the position that there's only one technology and they want to get rid of the competition. I'm not convinced that's the best approach for the industry. What if [EUV] fails? We're a toolmaker and they're a chipmaker, and there's a lot of other things we have to consider, such as manufacturability of the lithography equipment and profitability.\" Adds Lloyd R. Harriott, a former Bell Labs employee who headed the EPL program and worked on\n\n【5】## The Collaborative Structure Of The Euv Program May Serve As A Model For How The Semiconductor Industry Conducts Future Research.\n\n【6】the early EUV program: \"I think a lot of progress has been made with EUV. But they've got a really long way to go. There's a lot of marketing hype about how this is a done deal.\" \nVarnell also believes that the current schedule—making commercial chips with EUV in 2005—is unrealistic, citing the nine years it took Nikon to develop the laser used in the current generation of lithography, a much less ambitious project. Says Varnell: \"You're going from an image to full-up production system by 2005, and it is going to come from the national labs. I've been around the toolmaking business for a long time. I don't believe that's going to happen.\"\nAlong the way, another hurdle Intel and company have faced is convincing Washington to let a foreign company, the Dutch supplier ASML, enter the cona delivery schedule. It behooves Intel to push. Although AMD, Motorola, Infineon and Micron are partners, Intel negotiated contract terms that let it get the first machines produced and, because it is the largest investor in the $250-million program, the greatest number of tools. \n\n【7】Suppliers have to implement fully two crushingly difficult generations of technology before they finish making an investment of perhaps $750 million to start producing EUV machines. Getting them to buy into the breakneck schedule set by Intel may be a bigger challenge than creating angstrom-smooth mirrors. Even ASML, which dropped its involvement with EPL, is cautious, saying existing optical technologies may last longer than the industry expects. \"It's too early to decide whether EUV will happen in the time frame Intel is pushing,\" says Jos sortium. Four years ago the only major American tool supplier in the consortium was SVG. Ultratech Stepper, an early U.S. partner in EUV research, had to settle grudgingly for a minor role when it was viewed as lacking the necessary financial resources to develop an EUV product line. ASML, moreover, has subsequently bought SVG, which would leave ASML as the primary beneficiary of this technology transfer. Intel has \"done everything in their power to give the technology on a silver platter to ASML,\" says David A. Markle, chief technology officer of Ultratech Stepper, adding that \"Intel has approached this situation with the attitude that what's good for Intel is good for America.\"\nDespite the trail of bruised egos, the EUV experience may serve as a case study for future research. It is one of the most successful collaborations between industry and national laboratories. More broadly, it constitutes a model for the creation of virtual laboratories that can undertake major projects on an as-needed basis without the huge overhead of a central research facility. \n\n【8】Whether Intel's buy-it-when-you-needit strategy can work more generally remains to be seen. The real test may come in 15 years or so if EUV or EPL gives out and some wholly new substitute for silicon chips is needed. A paradigm shift—\nusing molecules of DNA, nanotubes, quantum dots or other exotic materials to execute computations—may determine whether the virtual-research model can succeed. \"Intel did a magnificent job of picking up the technology, recognizing its worthiness and driving it home,\" Freeman says. \"But they're not putting the same effort into asking the questions about what to do when you get to 100 angstroms [10 nanometers].\" Maybe one of Moore's successors will have to lay down the law for quantum computing.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/(2001-04) Whose Blood Is It, Anyway (Scientific American) (Z-Library).pdf", "page_num": [21], "text_type": [[{"text": "Innovations", "types": "Section-header"}], [{"text": "machine should be doubled.

Prehistoric habitation of the caves in these hills created myriad sites, but the oldest known so far is the Gran Dolina, currently under excavation. The team working there has recovered evidence of occupation some 800,000 years ago by what may prove to be a new species of human ancestor, H. antecessor. The hominid bones were discovered in one horizon of the cave's sediment, intermingled with stone tools and the remains of prehistoric game animals such as deer, bison and rhinoceros. The hominid remains consist of 92 fragments from six individuals. They bear unmistakable traces of butchery with stone tools, including skinning and removal of flesh, as well as processing of the braincase and the long bones for marrow. This pattern of butchery matches that seen on the nearby animal bones. This is the earliest evidence of hominid cannibalism.\n\n【3】Cannibalism among Europe's much younger Neandertals—who lived between 35,000 and 150,000 years ago—\nhas been debated since the late 1800s, when the great Croatian paleoanthropologist Dragutin Gorjanoviˇ\nc-Kramberger found the broken, cut-marked and scattered remains of more than 20 Neandertals entombed in the sands of the Krapina rockshelter. Unfortunately, these soft fossil bones were roughly extracted by today's standards and then covered with thick layers of preservative, which obscured evidence of processing by stone tools and made interpretation of the remains exceedingly difficult. Some workers believe the Krapina Neandertal bones show clear signs of cannibalism; others have attributed the patterns of bone damage to falling rocks from the cave's ceiling, to carnivore chewing or to some form of Neandertal burial. But recent analysis of the Krapina bones as well as those from another Croatian cave, Vindija— which has younger Neandertal and animal remains—indicates that cannibalism was practiced at both sites.\n\n【4】In the past few years, yet another Neandertal site has offered support for the idea that some of these hominids practiced cannibalism. On the banks of the Rhône River in southeastern France, Alban Defleur of the University of the Mediterranean at Marseilles has been excavating the cave of Moula-Guercy for the past nine years. Neandertals occupied this small cave approximately 100,000 years ago. In one layer the team unearthed the remains of at least six Neandertals, ranging in age from six years to adult. Defleur's meticulous excavation and recovery standards have yielded data every bit the equivalent of a modern forensic crime scene investigation. Each fragment of fauna and Neandertal bone, each macrobotanical clue, each stone tool has been precisely plotted three-dimensionally. This care has allowed an understanding of how the bones were spread around a hearth that has been cold for 1,000 centuries.\n\n【5】Microscopic analysis of the Neandertal bone fragments and the faunal remains has led to the same conclusion that Spanish workers at the older Gran Dolina site have drawn: cannibalism was practiced by some Paleolithic Europeans. But determining how often it was practiced and under what conditions represents a far more difficult challenge. Nevertheless, the frequency of cannibalism is striking.\n\n【6】We know of just one very early European site with hominid remains, and those were cannibalized. The two Croatian Neandertal sites are separated by hundreds of generations, yet analyses suggest that cannibalism was practiced at both. And now a Neandertal site in France has supported the same interpretation. These findings are built on exacting standards of evidence. Because of this, most paleoanthropologists these days are asking \"Why cannibalism?\" rather than \"Was this cannibalism?\"\nSimilarly, recent discoveries at much younger sites in the American Southwest have altered the way anthropologists think of Anasazi culture in this area.\n\n【7】BURNING\nThe dark and damaged areas on these four mastoid regions—that is, the hard bump behind each ear—indicate that these human skulls were roasted. Because the mastoid region is not covered by much muscle or other tissue, damage from burning was often more intense in this area than on other parts of cranial bone. Burning patterns therefore provide clues about culinary practices.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/(2001-08) Cyber Cells (Scientific American) (Z-Library).pdf", "page_num": [52], "text_type": [[{"text": "Early European Cannibals", "types": "Section-header"}], [{"text": "THE", "types": "Text"}, {"text": "MOST", "types": "Text"}, {"text": "IMPORTANT paleoan-", "types": "Text"}, {"text": "thropological site in Europe lies in north-", "types": "Text"}, {"text": "ern Spain, in the foothills of the Sierra de", "types": "Text"}, {"text": "Atapuerca.

But even if that used to be the case, it is certainly not true anymore. The past several months ly pack that plane with thousands of circles. \n\n【7】Applying the theorem to the brain may sound easy enough, but there is one problem, Hurdal notes: the triangles that represent the surface of a brain are not lying flat, so the touching circles will stick out. To fix this, the program employs a contemporary version of circle packing. It extends the theorem to three dimensions, moving all the cortical points until they settle down with the circles into a well-packed plane. Because the resulting maps are not perfect conformal maps, Hurdal calls them quasi-conformal. She has already flat-mapped the cerebellum and various bits of the cortex. To match precise regions with brain activity, researchers can take images from subsequent scans, flatten them and overlay them on the initial MRI.\n\n【8】Surgeons may eventually rely on the maps in brain surgery, particularly in epilepsy operations in which cutting out chunks of the cortex is necessary to help stop seizures. Werner K. Doyle, a neurosurgeon who performs more than 200 such operations every year at New York University–Mount Sinai Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, says, \"Which parts are removed is often an educated guess.\" \nThe most commonly used method to locate malfunctioning regions is electroencephalography (EEG). It requires placing several electrodes directly on the surface of the brain and waiting for a seizure. Unfortunately, EEG readings don't always mark the right spot, and so too much cortex or the wrong region is sometimes removed. Flat maps turn the 3-D brain into a 2-D image, which, Doyle says, \"will make it easier and safer for neurologists to navigate the mind.\" Ideally, no one will get lost, because directions aren't included. \n\n【9】Diane Martindale is a science writer based in New York City.\n\n【10】alone have seen a remarkable outpouring of high-precision observations of the universe on its largest scales. Not only do they give the big bang theory a new quantitative rigor, they hint at secondary effects—perhaps the longsought signatures of cosmic inflation and cold Boomerang's revisions have left some cosmologists wondering what to believe, but observers respond that the agreement of independent techniques is grounds for confidence. In any case, certainty should soon arrive on the wings of NASA's Microwave Anisotropy Probe and new ground-based instruments with still higher resolution.\n\n【11】Although some media accounts described the findings as \"confirmation\" of cosmic inflation and cold dark matter, that is not quite true. Geometric flatness and scale invariance were predicted long before inflation, based on very general principles. It is true that most alternatives to inflation are ruled out, having failed to foresee multiple peaks, but that is not the same as ruling inflation in. Similarly, it's hard to be sure that dark matter is real stuff rather than a theoretical artifact.\n\n【12】Direct evidence may not be far off, though. Already there are hints of a slight\n\"tilt\"—a deviation from exact scale invariance, as inflationary models predict—in the microwave background and, according to dark matter. \"Previously, cosmology had been independent strands of thought,\" says cosmologist David Tytler of the University of California at San Diego. \"It can now go on to address the next level of detail.\"\nAlthough the big bang theory has long been supported by three observational pillars—cosmic microwave background radiation, abundance of light elements, and outward velocity of distant galaxies—these pillars uphold different aspects of the theory. Only last year did observations of the first pillar reach the precision needed to cross-check the second one. Two balloon-borne telescopes, Boomerang and Maxima, measured the microwave background with a resolution of better than one degree, revealing smallscale fluctuations. Unlike the larger-scale fluctuations made famous by the COBE satellite a decade ago—which are scale-invariant, occurring with the same relative strength no matter their size—the small ones seem to be strongest on certain scales known as peaks.\n\n【13】The size and strength of these peaks allow cosmologists to get at the geometry of space and the density of matter. The thinking is that as the universe grew, density fluctuations that started off as scale-invariant developed into synchronized oscillations on ever increasing scales. The microwave background reveals how far this process had gotten when the cosmos was 400,000 years old. After that time, the oscillations started to subside as gravity pulled matter into bodies such as galaxies.\n\n【14】Boomerang's and Maxima's results were a case of good news and bad news. The instruments saw the largest of the expected peaks, demonstrating that the universe is geometrically flat, but they failed to see a second peak. That suggested the universe had much more ordinary matter than the element abundances could countenance.\n\n【15】To universal relief, the discrepancy has now disappeared. This past April a third telescope—the ground-based Degree Angular Scale Interferometer (DASI), run by John E. Carlstrom and his group at the University of Chicago—detected the second peak. Meanwhile the Boomerang team realized that it had overestimated the pointing accuracy of its instrument, which had the effect of smudging the fine details in the images. When the team undid this bias and incorporated new data, the second peak popped out. Maxima's results for the second peak haven't changed, but its error bars encompass the other experiments' values anyway.\n\n【16】Rupert A. C. Croft of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, in the distribution of intergalactic gas clouds. As for dark matter, Arthur Kosowsky of Rutgers University says the relative strength of the peaks is the do-or-die test. Cold dark matter contributes to gravity but not to pressure, thereby accentuating the odd-numbered peaks (which represent the gravity-dominated part of the primordial oscillation cycle) at the expense of the even-numbered ones (the pressure-dominated part). If you squint at the current data, you might say that the third peak is indeed bigger. Fortunately, with observational precision improving at its present rate, squinting will soon be unnecessary.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/(2001-08) Cyber Cells (Scientific American) (Z-Library).pdf", "page_num": [9], "text_type": [[{"text": "mensional curved surface can be flattened", "types": "Text"}, {"text": "while preserving the angular information,", "types": "Text"}, {"text": "thereby yielding a so-called conformal map.", "types": "Text"}, {"text": "To flatten the cortex, Hurdal takes", "types": "Text"}, {"text": "anatomical information from a high-resolu-", "types": "Text"}, {"text": "tion, 3-D MRI scan and feeds it into her pro-", "types": "Text"}, {"text": "gram.

{"seq_id": "5c88e787-a892-4f13-ae11-c2c900658d12", "title": null, "text": "【0】页码:92\n\n【1】## Devices To Support Circulation\n\n【2】Active Compression-Decompression CPR\nActive compression-decompression CPR (ACD-CPR) is performed with a device that includes a suction cup to actively lift the anterior chest during decompression. The application of external negative suction during the decompression phase of CPR creates negative intrathoracic pressure and thus potentially enhances venous return to the heart. When used, the device is positioned at midsternum on the chest.\n\n【3】Results from the use of ACD-CPR have been mixed. In several studies61–66 ACD-CPR improved ROSC and shortterm survival compared with conventional CPR. Of these studies, 3 showed improvement in neurologically intact survival.61,64,65 In contrast, 1 Cochrane meta-analysis of 10\nstudies involving both in-hospital arrest (826 patients) and out-of-hospital arrest (4162 patients)67 and several other controlled trials68–74 comparing ACD-CPR to conventional CPR showed no difference in ROSC or survival. The metaanalysis67 did not find any increase in ACD-CPR–related complications.\n\n【4】There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the routine use of ACD-CPR. ACD-CPR may be considered for use when providers are adequately trained and monitored (Class IIb, LOE B).\n\n【5】Phased Thoracic-Abdominal Compression- Decompression CPR With a Handheld Device Phased thoracic-abdominal compression-decompression CPR (PTACD-CPR) combines the concepts of IAC-CPR and ACD-CPR. A handheld device alternates chest compression and abdominal decompression with chest decompression and abdominal compression. Evidence from 1 prospective randomized clinical study of adults in cardiac arrest75 demonstrated no improvement in survival to hospital discharge with use of PTACD-CPR during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.\n\n【6】There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of PTACD-CPR for the treatment of cardiac arrest.\n\n【7】Impedance Threshold Device The impedance threshold device (ITD) is a pressure-sensitive valve that is attached to an endotracheal tube, supraglottic airway, or face mask. The ITD limits air entry into the lungs during the decompression phase of CPR, creating negative intrathoracic pressure and improving venous return to the heart and cardiac output during CPR. It does so without impeding positive pressure ventilation or passive exhalation.\n\n【8】Originally, the ITD was used with a cuffed endotracheal tube during bag-tube ventilation and ACD-CPR.76–78 The ITD and ACD-CPR devices are thought to act synergistically to enhance venous return. During ACD-CPR with or without the ITD, 1 randomized study76 found no difference in survival, whereas another randomized study79 found that the addition of an ITD improved short-term survival (24-hour survival and survival to ICU admission).\n\n【9】The ITD also has been used during conventional CPR with an endotracheal tube or with a face mask, if a tight seal is maintained.77,80,81 During conventional CPR with and without the ITD, 1 randomized trial80 reported no difference in overall survival; however, 1 prospective cohort study82 reported improved survival to emergency department (ED) admission with the use of the ITD. One meta-analysis of pooled data from both conventional CPR and ACD-CPR randomized trials83 demonstrated improved ROSC and short-term survival associated with the use of an ITD in the management of adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients but no significant improvement in either survival to hospital discharge or neurologically intact survival to discharge.\n\n【10】Three cohort studies with historic controls that implemented 2005 Guidelines plus ITD demonstrated improved survival to hospital discharge for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.84–86 It was not possible to determine the relative contribution of the ITD to the improved outcome. The use of the ITD may be considered by trained personnel as a CPR\nadjunct in adult cardiac arrest (Class IIb, LOE B).\n\n【11】Mechanical Piston Devices A mechanical piston device consists of a compressed gasor electric-powered plunger mounted on a backboard; it is used to depress the sternum. Some incorporate a suction cup in the piston device while others do not. In 3\nstudies87– 89 the use of a mechanical piston device for CPR\nimproved end-tidal CO2 and mean arterial pressure during adult cardiac arrest resuscitation. However, compared with manual CPR, no improvement in short- and long-term survival in adult patients was demonstrated.87,90 Initiation and removal of the mechanical piston device were noted to increase interruptions in CPR.91\nThe Lund University Cardiac Arrest System (LUCAS) is a gas- (oxygen or air) or electric-powered piston device that produces a consistent chest compression rate and depth. It incorporates a suction cup attached to the sternum that returns the sternum to the starting position. There are no randomized control trials comparing the device with conventional CPR in human cardiac arrests. One case series with concurrent controls92 showed no benefit over conventional CPR for out-of-hospital witnessed cardiac arrest. Additional case series have reported variable success with the device.93–98 One feasibility study reported successful deployment during diagnostic and interventional procedures.99\nThere is insufficient evidence to support or refute the routine use of mechanical piston devices in the treatment of cardiac arrest. Mechanical piston devices may be considered for use by properly trained personnel in specific settings for the treatment of adult cardiac arrest in circumstances (eg, during diagnostic and interventional procedures) that make manual resuscitation difficult (Class IIb, LOE C). Rescuers should attempt to limit substantial interruptions in CPR during deployment. The device should be programmed to deliver high-quality CPR, ensuring an adequate compression depth of at least 2 inches (5 cm)—this may require conversion from a percent of chest depth, a rate of at least 100 compressions per minute, and a compression duration of approximately 50% of the cycle length.\n\n【12】Load-Distributing Band CPR or Vest CPR\nThe load-distributing band (LDB) is a circumferential chest compression device composed of a pneumatically or electrically actuated constricting band and backboard. Case series have demonstrated improved hemodynamics,100 ROSC,101,102\nand survival to hospital discharge with use of the LDB for cardiac arrest.102 In a study using concurrent controls,103 the use of LDB-CPR was associated with lower odds of 30-day survival (odds ratio 0.4). One multicenter prospective randomized controlled trial104,104A comparing LDB-CPR (Autopulse device) to manual CPR for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest demonstrated no improvement in 4-hour survival and worse neurologic outcome when the device was used. These results raised concerns about possible harm with use of this device. Further studies are required to determine whether site-specific factors105 and experience with deployment of the device106 could influence its efficacy.\n\n【13】The LDB may be considered for use by properly trained personnel in specific settings for the treatment of cardiac arrest (Class IIb, LOE B).

If applied in a convenient manner, therapy efficiency can improve; thus, rapid and painless treatments with negligible damage to teeth and supporting tissues can be achieved with less collateral damage and more pleasing and durable results.(14) \nOrthodontic appliances have a similar function as pharmaceuticals have in medicine. They both need an accurate diagnosis to be able to define an exact treatment. \n\n【1】In medicine, the physician makes a diagnosis and then selects the proper medication to accomplish his goals. In orthodontics, the orthodontist must make his diagnosis and then select the best appliance design to reach his objectives. In pharmacology, medicines are used to act upon cells, tissues and specific organs. In orthodontics moments and forces are used to act upon cells and specific tissue that support teeth and bone. The collateral effects of medicines are unavoidable and must be well managed. \n\n【2】Secondary effects are also produced during tooth movement and should also be recognized and managed with care. When such effects are known beforehand, precaution measures can be taken to counter these harmful effects, which in some instances can be managed to our benefit. Finally, in orthodontic appliances as in medicine the efficiency depends upon the degree of cooperation of the p, atient.(I,l1) \n\n【3】## What Is Force?\n\n【4】Force is an action exerted by a body (wire, coil, elastic, etc.) over another body (teeth or bone). It expresses itself as mass times acceleration (mass x acceleration) and is a vector that presents: \n\n【5】1. \nIntensity (measured in g). \n2. \nSense/Direction (straight or angular). The latter \nis included between the straight line and an axis \nof reference. \n3. \nModulus (sense or direction of the force).

For patients potentially eligible for fibrinolytic therapy, blood pressure must be 185 mm Hg systolic and 110 mm Hg diastolic to limit the risk of bleeding complications. Because the maximum interval from onset of stroke until effective treatment of stroke with rtPA is limited, most patients with sustained hypertension above these levels (ie, systolic blood pressure\n185 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure 110 mm Hg) will not be eligible for IV rtPA (Tables 2 and 3).68\nImaging (Box 5)\nIdeally the CT scan should be completed within 25 minutes of the patient's arrival in the ED and should be interpreted within 45 minutes of ED arrival.

Emergent CT or MRI scans of patients with suspected stroke should be promptly evaluated by a physician with expertise in interpretation of these studies.69 During the first few hours of an ischemic stroke the noncontrast CT scan may not indicate signs of brain ischemia. If the CT scan shows no evidence of intracerebral hemorrhage, the patient may be a candidate for fibrinolytic therapy (Boxes 6 and 8). If hemorrhage is noted on the CT scan, the patient is not a candidate for fibrinolytic therapy. Consult a neurologist or neurosurgeon and consider transfer as needed for appropriate care (Box 7).\n\n【7】If hemorrhage is not present on the initial CT scan and the patient is not a candidate for fibrinolytic therapy for other reasons, consider administration of aspirin (Box 9) either rectally or orally after the patient is screened for dysphagia (see below). Admit the patient to a stroke unit (if available) for careful monitoring (Box 11).\n\n【8】Fibrinolytic Therapy (Boxes 6, 8, and 10)\nThe treating physician should review the inclusion and exclusion criteria for IV fibrinolytic therapy (Tables 4 and 5) and perform a repeat neurologic examination incorporating the NIHSS or CNS. If the patient's neurologic signs are spontaneously clearing (ie, function is rapidly improving to normal and is near baseline), administration of fibrinolytics may not be required (Box 6).64\nAs with all medications, fibrinolytics have potential adverse effects. The physician must verify that there are no exclusion criteria, consider the risks and benefits to the patient, and be prepared to monitor and treat any potential complications. The major complication of IV rtPA for stroke is symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. This complication occurred in 6.4% of the 312 patients treated in the NINDS\ntrials9 and 4.6% of the 1135 patients treated in 60 Canadian centers.70 A meta-analysis of 15 published case series on the open-label use of rtPA for acute ischemic stroke in general clinical practice showed a symptomatic hemorrhage rate of\n5.2% of 2639 patients treated.71 Other complications include orolingual angioedema (occurs in approximately 1.5% of patients), acute hypotension, and systemic bleeding. In one large prospective registry, major systemic bleeding was uncommon (0.4%) and usually occurred at the site of femoral puncture for acute angiography.70,72\nIf the patient remains a candidate for fibrinolytic therapy\n(Box 8), the physician should discuss the risks and potential benefits of the therapy with the patient or family if available (Box 10). After this discussion, if the patient/family elects to proceed with fibrinolytic therapy, begin the rtPA bolus and infusion as quickly as possible and begin the stroke pathway of care (see below). Careful dose calculation and removal of excess rtPA help prevent inadvertent administration of excess rtPA. Typically neither anticoagulant nor antiplatelet treatment may be administered for 24 hours after administration of rtPA until a repeat CT scan at 24 hours shows no hemorrhagic transformation.\n\n【9】Several studies9,15,70 have documented a higher likelihood of good to excellent functional outcome when rtPA is", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care Science (Mary Fran Hazinski, John M.

One headline in the San Francisco Chronicle said that the battle between the low and high carbers had become so heated since mid 2002 that \"Knives had been drawn.\" From my vantage point (as a health and fitness professional down in the trenches), it looks more like tanks, artillery and machine guns have been drawn! Tragically, the people being hurt the most by these \"diet wars\" are not the experts, but the dieters. After its original publication in 1972, The Atkins Diet was regurgitated in 1992 as \"Dr. Atkins New Diet Revolution,\" creating a new surge of interest in low carbohydrate dieting. Then, in July of 2002, the controversy reached an all time high when the New York Times Magazine published an essay by Gary Taubes titled, \"What if it's all been a big fat lie?\"  The article suggested that new research was now proving the late Dr. Atkins had been right all along. More research in 2003 seemed to corroborate the Taubes story: Two studies in the New England Journal of Medicine in May of 2003, and another in June 2003 in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism, suggested that Atkins was equally, if not more effective for weight loss than conventional diets - at least in the short term. With the publication of this new information, Atkins supporters boasted, \"See, I told you so,\" while their opponents fired back in defense of their high carb, low fat positions. Meanwhile, low carb foods and supplements became all the rage, bread and pasta sales took a nosedive and the wheat industry cried the blues. With differences in opinion as opposite as the North and South Poles, it's become unbearably confusing and frustrating to know which weight loss method is best and safest. At the date of this writing, in late 2003, obesity has reached an all time high \n–AGAIN!  According to the Journal of the American Medical Association, 64% of Americans are overweight and 31% are obese, and it's still getting worse. Obviously, the popular weight loss methods today - including the low carb diet - are still missing something…but what? If you're confused by the whole high carb, low carb thing and if you're frustrated with your attempts at trying to lose weight and keep it off, then this may be the most important report you will ever read. In the next few minutes, you'll discover the real truth about low carb diets and a real solution to the problem of excess body fat that is beautiful in its simplicity, yet powerful in effectiveness. Read on to learn the 10 Lies about the Atkins diet and the truth that will set you free… \nLie #1: The Atkins and other low carb diets don't work If your definition of what \"works\" is quick weight loss, then the Atkins Diet DOES work. Recent studies showed that the Atkins Diet causes greater *weight loss* than the American Heart Association-recommended high carb, low fat diet. In fact, for obese people with disorders of carbohydrate metabolism (hyperinsulinemia, hypoglycemia, and insulin resistance), Atkins-style diets have been shown to work especially well. However, if your definition of what \"works\" is *permanent fat loss*, then the Atkins diet doesn't fare so well... but then again neither do any other diets. It seems that despite some encouraging initial successes, Atkin's dieters still face the same difficulties in keeping off the weight as everyone else. Some of the same studies showing rapid weight loss on Atkins in the beginning also showed substantial weight gain as soon as the diets ended. Truth is, a growing body of evidence is mounting that carbohydrate restriction can accelerate weight loss in the short term, but it has yet to be proven that it keeps the fat off in the long run. Which approach towards low carb dieting is best is also up for debate: Not all low carb diets are high fat or ketogenic and not all are \"ultra-low\" in carbs. A low carb diet can be low in carbs and high in fat, it can be low in carbs and high in protein, or it can be somewhere in the middle I predict that continued research will discover that moderate carbohydrate restriction \n(especially in a cyclical fashion) and careful selection of carbohydrates, will in fact assist with fat loss via hormonal control, metabolic efficiency and appetite regulation. I believe that neither *extreme*  - the severely restricted low carb diet (ketogenic diet) \nor the very high carb, low fat diet - will emerge the victor. Lie #2: There's a ton of new research proving the Atkins diet is effective If you surf around the Internet for a while searching for \"Atkins Diet,\" you are likely to see a lot of advertisements and news briefs pointing to the new research \"proving\" \nthat Atkins is effective.  \n \n\"New England Journal of Medicine Vindicates Atkins diet.\" \"Studies suggest Atkins diet is safe.\" \"New research challenges 30 years of Nutritional Dogma.\" Truth is, these headlines are not giving you the full picture. Until and unless you have closely examined these studies and the researcher's interpretation of the results, don't be so quick to believe the diet hearsay and gossip. The general conclusion of nearly all these studies is that Atkins IS equally if not more effective for short term weight loss than conventional diets. However, nearly all the researchers also conclude with remarks such as: \n \n\"The results are very preliminary,\" \"The take-home message is that this diet deserves further study.\" \"More research is needed.\" Furthermore, consider what the Atkin's diet was being compared to in these studies: The traditional \"food pyramid\" diet with 60-65% carbs including plenty of pasta, cereals and bread, right? What if the traditional high carb diet is wrong too? Don't write off carb restriction completely, but don't ditch all your carbs yet either… Lie #3: The new studies prove that the Atkins diet is healthy and doesn't raise cholesterol as previously believed In a May of 2003, the results of a 12-month study on the Atkins diet were reported in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). One group followed the traditional food pyramid with 60% of the calories from carbohydrates while the second group followed the Atkins diet. After one year, Atkins participants had a greater increase in the good HDL cholesterol and a larger drop in triglyceride than the high carb group. The leader of the study, Gary Foster said, \"Our initial findings suggest that low carb diets may not have the adverse effects we anticipated.\" Conventional wisdom has dictated for years that saturated fat and cholesterol were dangerous and unhealthy, contributing to coronary heart disease. This led most health professionals to condemn low carb diets that allowed large amounts of saturated fat. This belief is now being questioned. Many authors such as Mary Enig and Uffe Rashnkov have presented compelling cases that dietary cholesterol and saturated fat do not cause heart disease. The latest research seems to confirm this. However, many factors affected the results of these new studies. In some studies, the subjects did not follow the Atkins Diet to exact specifications and never entered ketosis, so conclusions about saturated fat, dietary cholesterol, ketosis and coronary health cannot be drawn yet. In other studies, cholesterollowering drugs were used. And in still others, some subjects actually showed increases in total cholesterol. Those who did show improvements may have previously been on a high refined sugar, high saturated fat diet and dropping the sugar was one step in the right direction. Furthermore, some of the drop in blood cholesterol could be attributed to the decrease in body weight. Clearly, you can't lump all dietary fats into the same category. Processed and chemically altered trans fats have been condemned by virtually every health and nutrition expert on the planet. Other fats, like salmon and fatty fish, are among the healthiest and cardio-protective foods you can eat. Much evidence is showing that reasonable amounts of naturally occurring saturated fats such as those found in whole eggs and red meat also need not be feared (especially in the absence of sugars). \n\n【3】 \nTruth is, all the information we have available at this time indicates the \"fat phobia\" and \"fat makes you fat\" scare has been unfounded because not all fat is the same. \n\n【4】However, claims that diets very high in overall and saturated fat are healthy and safe for long term use are still premature. Lie #4: The Atkins diet will help you keep fat off for good Dr. Atkins writes that his diet \"Is so perfectly adapted to use as a lifetime diet that, unlike most diets, the weight won't come back.\" It's a weight loss axiom that the more extreme a diet and the faster the weight loss, the more difficult it usually is to maintain the results.  Slow, steady and balanced seems to win the race when it comes to weight control. Unfortunately this isn't what most people want to hear. The four pounds per week and up to 15 pounds in the first two weeks that Atkins promises sounds much more impressive. There are two things you really need to know about rapid weight loss: (1) What kind of weight was lost? How much of it was body fat and how much was water, glycogen and lean tissue? (2) Are you going to you keep the weight off for good? Most low carbers won't keep the weight off for more than a year, and many will fall off the wagon long before that. Keith Ayoob, a spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association, said in an official ADA statement about the 2003 NEJM studies: \"Twelve months is an equalizer; you hit a wall. Your lifestyle starts to be affected and you get bored. A high dropout rate is a sign that extreme diets can be difficult to maintain. Truth is, despite Dr. Atkin's claims and the new research apparently supporting them, we still don't know what will happen in the long run. Based on the results of the recent three, six, and twelve month studies, researchers have begun to organize longer trials. One of them will be five years in length. What I believe you will see in long term studies is that Atkins and other low carb diets, while effective for weight *loss* in the short term, will be found no more effective for long term fat *loss* than any other restrictive diet (and that's NOT very effective). Lie #5: Calories don't count and you can eat as much as you want while on the Atkins diet. Dr. Atkins proposed that calories don't count and he advised his clients to eat as much as they want while on his program. Atkins wrote, \"The so called calorie theory has been a millstone around the necks of dieters and a miserable and malign influence on their efforts to lose.\" Here's the truth about calories and low carb diets: \nWhen you go on a very low carb (ketogenic) diet with more fat, your appetite is diminished and you feel fuller (because fat is more satiating than carbs).  \nAppetite control may be a legitimate benefit of the Atkins diet, especially for individuals who struggle with hypoglycemia, hunger and cravings. As Dr. Atkins points out, \"Our physical urges are hard to combat.\" However, this does not mean you can eat as much as you want. It means that your hunger may be blunted on Atkin's plan, causing you to automatically eat less without counting calories or even thinking about calories. People on the Atkins diet who lose weight are not eating more than they burn and losing fat in spite of it. Whether you count calories and consciously eat fewer than you burn, or you don't count them and unconsciously eat fewer than you burn, either way, the end result is the same. \n\n【5】While counting calories in the literal sense is clearly not always necessary, you always have to be *aware* of calories and portions. No diet or special combination of foods can override the law of calorie balance. Anyone who believes that you can eat as much as you want and still lose weight is living in a dream world. Lie #6: A brand new study just proved that the Atkins diet gives you a metabolic advantage so you really can eat as much as you want A 12 week study conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health and presented in October 2003 to the North American Association for the Study of Obesity found that subjects on a low carb regimen lost just as much weight as those on a standard high carb, low fat diet. The shocking part was that the group on the Atkins diet could eat 300 more calories than the group eating the conventional high carb food pyramid diet. This left researchers scratching their heads saying, \"It doesn't make sense… it defies the laws of thermodynamics.\" \"A lot of our assumptions about a calorie is a calorie are being challenged,\" Unfortunately, some of the Atkins troops were quick to interpret the results as meaning, \"See, I told you calories don't count.\" Actually, calories do count and the explanation for these results is quite simple. A calorie is NOT just a calorie. If all calories were created equal then a 2000 calorie diet of Krispy crème doughnuts would have the same effect as a 2000 calorie diet of chicken breast and salad vegetables. Do you think these two diets will have the same effects on your health and body composition? Certain foods and certain diets DO give you a metabolic advantage.  One advantage is the effect of a diet's composition on your hormones; namely insulin and glucagon. A second advantage is called the thermic effect of food. The thermic effect of food means that a certain number of calories are used just to digest and absorb the food, leaving a net calorie value substantially less than the total amount of caloric energy that was contained in the food. For example, a lean protein food such as chicken breast has a thermic effect of around 20-30%. This means that for every 100 calories of chicken breast consumed, the NET energy utilized by the body is only 70-80 calories. (Some people call this \"negative calories.\") Stated differently, this means you really CAN lose weight on a higher calorie intake if you eat foods with a high thermic effect. What's especially interesting –providing confirmation of the metabolic advantage of a high protein diet - is that the foods provided in this study were low carb, but NOT typical Atkins fare.  Instead of lots of red meat and saturated fat, the subjects in this particular study ate mostly fish, chicken, salads, vegetables and unsaturated oils. I think study's director, Penelope Green, hit the nail on the head when she said, \"Maybe they (the low carb, high protein group) burned up more calories digesting their food.\" Truth is, not one study has ever proven that you can \"eat as much as you want\" on Atkins or any diet. Even when a diet provides a metabolic advantage, AFTER that advantage is factored in and you look at NET calorie utilization, you are still left with the calories in versus calories out equation. Lie #7: The Atkins diet causes faster and greater FAT loss than conventional diets Most health, medical and nutrition organizations recommend that you lose weight (body fat) at a rate of no more than 2 pounds per week. In his book, Dr. Atkins says that the average weight loss in the first two weeks on his plan is 8 to 15 pounds. Like many diets, Atkins overstresses total weight loss (and quick weight loss), while not stressing enough the difference between body weight, body water, body fat and lean body mass. Truth is, low carb diets definitely cause greater *weight* loss, especially in the initial phases. But this is mostly due to a large drop in water weight and glycogen (stored carbohydrate), not necessarily increased fat loss. Weight loss is the wrong goal! Your goal should be permanent fat loss and you should be measuring and tracking your body fat percentage and lean body mass on a regular basis. Don't gloat over large, rapid \"weight losses\"… it might be mostly water and muscle. Lie #8: Carbohydrates make you fat Dr. Atkins wrote, and I quote, \"Carbohydrates are the very food that makes you fat.\" He also wrote, \"Diets high in carbohydrates are precisely what most overweight people don't need and can't become slim on.\" These are very misleading statements of half-truth. The \"carbs make you fat\" myth is probably the most pervasive and damaging lie about weight control ever told. It's caused tremendous confusion and frustration to already confused and frustrated dieters. First, focusing primarily on any macronutrient (protein, carbs or fat) or macronutrient ratio should be secondary to energy balance. What makes you fat is eating too many calories. Truth is, you can't blame all \"carbohydrates\" as a group for why we are getting fatter. What *type* of carbohydrates are we talking about? There are good carbs and bad carbs. The \"bad\" carbs are the refined ones; white flour and white sugar products like white bread, white pasta, sugar sweetened cereals, candy and soft drinks.  \n \nTo avoid confusion, I would suggest never using the word \"carbohydrate\" without putting the adjective \"refined\" or \"natural\" in front of it. Ironically, Dr. Atkins does make this distinction in his book, yet he still chose to recommend removal of almost ALL carbs during the induction and weight loss phases of his diet - even the good carbs that are proven healthy.  This creates rapid weight loss and the appearance of a hugely successful diet right from the first week. Again, the real questions are: What kind of weight was lost and can you keep the weight off for good? A healthy, maintainable fat burning diet should be centered on *natural foods* - and for most people, that includes natural carbs in moderation - not the total removal and demonizing of all carbohydrates. Lie #9: Ketosis makes you feel *better* and doesn't affect your performance Your body is a remarkable machine that is fully capable of adapting to whatever fuel is provided in predominance. You can burn protein, fat, or carbs for energy. \n\n【6】However, carbohydrates are your body's preferred - and most efficient - fuel source for vigorous physical activity.  \n \nMany low carbers believe that fat is a more efficient energy source than carbohydrates, but this is not true. Fat is not a more *efficient* energy source, it is only a more *concentrated* energy source. Since the fuel for muscular contraction is carbs (glycogen) a high fat, low carb diet is not the best approach to fat loss for athletes, bodybuilders or highly active individuals. These diets simply don't support high intensity training. Very low carb diets might be appropriate for the sedentary, severely overweight, or those with orthopedic conditions that prevent any exercise.  It seems that ketogenic diets take off weight even with little or no exercise (although the weight won't be pure fat and you may not keep it off). Some Atkins dieters even report feeling more energetic after adapting to the low carbs and higher fat.  It's likely, however, that most of them were relatively inactive. Low carbs and high activity don't go well together. \n\n【7】Truth is, a more balanced diet of natural foods combined with exercise is a much better way to take off pure fat for good. Anyone who CAN exercise SHOULD exercise! Of the two methods for creating a calorie deficit - burning more, or eating less - the former is the superior method with far fewer downsides. Any fat loss program that does not make exercise the centerpiece is ultimately destined for failure. Lie #10: Ketogenic diets (very low carb) are the secret to fat loss The term \"low carb\" is used very broadly. To some, a diet like the Zone, which consists of 40% carbs is \"low carbs.\" To others \"low carb\" is more extreme. A ketogenic diet is a VERY low carb diet, usually between 40-70 grams of carbs per day or less. The induction phase of the Atkins diet is limited to only 20 grams per day. \n\n【8】Because they allow virtually no carbohydrate, Ketogenic diets, by definition, are extremely strict and nutritionally unbalanced. It's an irrevocable law that the more \"extreme\" a nutrition program is, the greater the side effects will be and the more difficult the diet will be to stay on. Dr. Atkins claimed, \"Ketosis is the secret weapon of super effective dieting.\" Truth is, while some recent studies have suggested low carb diets do work, not a single study has proven that it's necessary to restrict carbs *so severely* that you go into ketosis. The benefits of reduced carbs and more protein include a higher thermic effect, appetite regulation and hormonal control. What the low carb folks don't want you to know is that a moderate reduction in carbohydrates (and/or removal of processed carbs) is often all it takes to get these benefits, while being much easier to maintain for the long haul. So if ketogenic and very low carb diets aren't the best way to achieve permanent fat loss, then what is the best way??? Dr Atkins made many excellent points about weight control in his book. He spoke out on the evils of processed carbohydrates. He identified carbohydrate sensitivity and hyperinsulinemia as contributing factors in obesity. He spoke of the metabolic advantage of high protein. He pointed out that there may not be a direct one to one correlation between saturated fat, dietary cholesterol and heart disease. The fact is, Dr. Atkins - to his credit - had discovered some important facts about weight control, and had the courage to publish and stand by them long before anyone else did. In the end, unfortunately, he drew some questionable conclusions from this information and, like so many other diet gurus, he left out some large and important pieces to the puzzle. If permanent fat loss were as simple as removing carbohydrates from your diet, then why has obesity surged to an all-new high in 2003 and why are there so many Atkins failures? \n\n【9】 \nCould it be possible that the conventional high carb, low fat food pyramid approach and the Atkins diet approach have BOTH missed the mark, and that the optimum diet for permanent fat loss is somewhere in the middle? Could it be possible that dieting is the absolute worst way to lose body fat and that the proper type of exercise program combined with a more balanced approach to nutrition is the answer? One of the biggest errors weight loss seekers make today is to accept one philosophy completely or reject it completely, taking a side and \"taking up arms\" to defend their position without considering the alternatives. Most of the weight loss philosophies being promoted today contain valid points, but as a whole, are a total mish mash of truth, half-truths and lies. That's why, for over 20 years, I have literally turned myself into a human guinea pig in my search for a sensible and healthy method of permanent fat loss. I studied and then personally tested the ketogenic diet, the high carb diet, low fat diet and nearly every other diet in between. I found good points and bad points in all of them, many of which I have already revealed to you in this report. I then compiled all the positive points of each fat loss method into a structured format, while discarding all the negatives. What emerged was nothing short of remarkable: An all-natural system that has allowed me to peak at a body fat level of \n3.4% and to maintain my body fat at 9% or less all year round… without drugs, extreme diets, or unnecessary supplements. It's worked for thousands of other people too. If you would like to learn *exactly* what I discovered about permanent, natural fat loss from two decades of study and experimentation... and if you'd like to learn how it can help you escape the diet wars for good, and finally achieve the body you've always wanted, I encourage you to visit my fat loss web page at www.burnthefat.com and take a look for yourself. \n\n【10】 ", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/10 Lies About The Atkins Diet (Tom Venuto) (Z-Library).pdf", "page_num": [1], "text_type": [[{"text": " 10 LIES ABOUT THE ATKINS DIET ", "types": "Title"}, {"text": " ", "types": "Title"}, {"text": "And The Shocking Truth The Low Carb \"Gurus\"  ", "types": "Title"}, {"text": "Don't want you to know about ", "types": "Title"}], [{"text": " ", "types": "Section-header"}, {"text": "By Tom Venuto ", "types": "Section-header"}, {"text": "www.burnthefat.com  ", "types": "Section-header"}], [{"text": " ", "types": "Section-header"}, {"text": "Low carbohydrate diets such as Atkins have always been controversial, but with the ", "types": "Text"}, {"text": "recent wave of new research and publicity, the controversy is now raging hotter than ", "types": "Text"}, {"text": "ever.

This maxillary traction is possible because the craniofacial complex is very malleable and we can obtain significant changes in the three planes of space. The maxillae bone responds to orthopedic and functional stimulus because it is of intramembranous ossification origin. Therefore, the object of the treatment is to stimulate the growth of this bone.(1\n3\n.19,35) \nPotpeschnigg (1875) was the first to develop the idea of maxillary traction; later Delaire at the end of the 60's renewed the interest of the use of the face mask for maxillary protraction, which was created to correct the posterior rotation of the maxilla and its development deficiency for the treatment of cleft lip and palate patients, Petit at the end of the 70's proposed the use of this appliance for patients with skeletal Class III patients that needed maxillary protraction. Petit modified the basic concept of Delaire, changing the anatomy of the face mask, he also increased the magnitude of the generated force exerted by the appliance and also reduced treatment time. (9.19) \nThis appliance (also called inverted traction mask) in combination with a fixed palatal expansion appliance (Hyrax), is the proposed method of treatment for the interception of true skeletal Class III malocclusions with an anterior cross bite. (35) \nThis treatment must begin as soon as the upper molars, central and lateral incisors have fully erupted; first of all, we must place a rapid maxillary expansion appliance and we must activate the appliance twice a day (2/4 of a complete turn of the screw) for a week before placing the face mask. The purpose of this is to disrupt the suture system and to facilitate the protraction of the upper maxilla with the face mask. The sutures that compose this system are: \nthe frontomaxillary suture, the nasomaxillary suture, the zygomaticotemporal suture, the zygomaticomaxillar suture, the pterygopalatine suture, the mid palatal suture, the etmoidmaxillar suture and the lacrimomaxillar suture.(19,35) ", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/1001 tips for orthodontics and its secrets (Esequiel E.

Your first assessment session will most likely identify your feelings and thoughts about having Bell's palsy. CBT sessions are usually between six and twelve weeks. The first step, as mentioned earlier, is to identify your feelings and thoughts. Your therapist will then help you break them into smaller parts so you can easily evaluate how these emotions are affecting you.\n\n【3】## Analyzing Cbt Sessions\n\n【4】CBT involves five different aspects, namely; situation, thoughts, emotions, actions and physical feelings. Situation as you can guess is the problem or event that you are facing. If you are facing any difficult situation, your brain is bombarded with emotions, thoughts and feelings, all of which compel you to take action. This action is how you respond. It can be helpful or unhelpful.\n\n【5】## For Example:\n\n【6】You enter a place where not many people know you. Suddenly, everyone starts looking at your face. At this point, you can have two types of thoughts.\n\n【7】Unhelpful: People only see my facial disfigurement. Helpful: They are looking to see if they know me.\n\n【8】When your thoughts are unhelpful, the most obvious emotions will be sadness, anger and frustration. You will want to go home and avoid further interaction with new people. On the other hand, if you have helpful thoughts in your head, you will be excited to find out whose present at the place you have just arrived at. Since you will be feeling confident, there will be no hesitation in introducing yourself and finding out if anyone knows you. Can you see the difference your thoughts can have on your responses? Remember, the more effort you put into identifying your positive feelings, the easier it will be to cope with Bell's palsy. Your cognitive behavioral therapist will advise you to maintain a diary. Whenever you feel depressed, write down the situation and thoughts and explore them with your therapist in the next CBT session. Unfortunately, many people with Bell's palsy assume that others find them unattractive. This is one of the reasons Bell's palsy patients have problems combating negative thoughts and ideas.

What Is Arterial Blood Gas (Abg) Sampling?\n\n【2】When a physician wants information on how efficiently a patient's lungs are functioning, an arterial blood gas (ABG) can provide the answer. The ABG is a blood test. Performance of a routine blood test requires blood taken from a vein, often from the area near the elbow crease. For an ABG test, however, blood is drawn from an artery instead of a vein, and it is analyzed immediately for oxygen (O2) content, carbon dioxide (CO2), and pH, a measure of acidity. The radial artery in the wrist is a frequent site for ABG sampling. The ABG gives information about the arterial blood's oxygen and carbon dioxide content, as well as the blood's acidity. Because the lungs are responsible for the extraction of oxygen from the outside air as well as for the removal of carbon dioxide, analysis of the artery sample for those gases indicates how well the lungs are functioning.\n\n【3】The main function of the respiratory system is to carry out respiration: the exchange of O2 for CO2. Respiration provides the body's vital organs with oxygen and allows for removal of accumulated \"waste products,\" primarily, acid. After the blood supply passes though the lungs and picks up oxygen, it becomes oxygen-rich and carbon dioxide-poor. The oxygen-rich blood is then pumped by the heart to the entire body—via the arteries—in order to supply organs with needed oxygen. Although an ABG is not a routine test in outpatient asthma management, it is frequently used in intensive care. If a person is suffering a severe asthmatic exacerbation, the ABG will reveal decreased oxygen and carbon dioxide. If the asthma worsens further, carbon dioxide may rise, and the pH will drop, indicating a dangerous buildup of acid. Such a scenario may indicate life-threatening asthma. If such is the case, respiratory failure will ensue from continued carbon dioxide accumulation and oxygen deprivation;\ntreatment includes \"life support\" with a ventilator. Patients on ventilator assistance may require frequent ABG monitoring to assist physicians in selecting optimal ventilator settings and to ensure adequate oxygen delivery to vital organs.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/100 Questions and Answers About Asthma (Claudia S.

It will calm your mind and relax your muscles, but it also  \nallows your body to absorb the energy that has been released through the various yoga postures, thereby maximizing the value of the session.\n\n【3】PHYSICAL RELAXATION\nAssume the Corpse pose (see pp.66–67), then physically tense and relax all the muscles in your body, one body part at a time. Start at the toes and work your way up. Once you have finished, start at the toes again and mentally relax all those same muscles. Last of all, take a few moments to relax your mind. \n\n【4】MENTAL RELAXATION\nThe yoga cool-down, or relaxation stage, is more of a mental exercise than a physical one. This is because it requires you to send mental messages to your body parts, instructing them to tense and relax. Once that is done, you finish the cool-down by relaxing your mind, too.\n\n【5】HOW LONG TO RELAX FOR?\n\n【6】Your end-of-session relaxation is based on the Corpse pose, which should also be employed at the beginning of your yoga practice. Relax  \nfully by resting in this position for at least five minutes.\n\n【7】CUPPING THE EYES\nJust as it is important to warm up the eyes before your yoga session (see p.26), you should also take the time to cool them down after your practice. \n\n【8】ENDING YOUR COOL-DOWN\nWhile in Corpse pose, allow your breath to be full and easy. Wiggle the fingers and toes, gradually waking up the body. Bend your knees, keeping your feet on the ground. Draw the knees to your chest, hug them in, and gently roll from side to side. Roll on to one side and push yourself up into a seated position. End by bringing the hands to prayer pose.\n\n【9】IMPORTANCE OF THE CORPSE POSE\nThe Corpse pose is the ideal way to end your yoga sessions, as well as being a good start to your workouts. It allows the body the time to absorb all of the good muscle and mind work that has been done during your practice time, letting released energy flow freely and expelling waste products from the muscles. It helps you relax in preparation for the rest of your day.\n\n【10】CORPSE POSE\nIn this extended version of the classic Corpse pose, the full length of the body is held in alignment and completely supported by the floor. This allows for deep relaxation in all of the muscles.\n\n【11】1\nLie with knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Interlock your fingers behind your head. Lift the head to look forward toward your knees. \n\n【12】2\nLie fully extended, with eyes closed if you want. Starting from your feet, work up the body, breathing any tightness out of your muscles.\n\n【13】3\nInhale as you raise your right leg by about \n1 \nft (30 \ncm). Tense the right leg, keeping everything else relaxed. Hold, then lower and switch legs.\n\n【14】4\nArch the upper back to lift the chest, pulling the shoulder blades in. Keep the head and bottom on the floor. Hold for one breath, then release.\n\n【15】CORPSE POSE: ADDITIONAL RELAXATION\nThe following postures can be tagged on to your Corpse pose relaxation at the end of your yoga session, or you can pick and choose the steps that you think would most benefit you on any given day, focusing on the areas that feel most tense.

This twisting is called torque and is equal to the object's weight multiplied by its distance from the fulcrum (the angle of the lever also comes in, but that does not concern us here). If the object is to the left of the fulcrum, the direction of the torque is counterclockwise; if the object is to the right, the direction is clockwise. To compute the torque around a support, simply sum all the torques of the individual objects on the lever.\n\n【7】The challenge is to keep the lever balanced while adjusting the objects on it. First, let's try a warmup problem: Assume you have a straight, evenly weighted board, 20 meters long and weighing three kilograms. The middle of the board is the center of mass, and we will call that position 0. So the possible positions on the board range from –10 (the left end) to +10 (the right end).

MSM acts as an anti-inflammatory and as such will be a benefit to Bells' palsy sufferers. By taking 500 mg of MSM three times a day will allow MSM to provide its anti-inflammatory properties for Bell's palsy sufferers.\n\n【5】## Histamine\n\n【6】Although, if taken in large amounts histamine can be toxic to the body however if it is used in small amounts it is very effective in reducing inflammation and is beneficial for Bell's palsy sufferers. Histamine is not available in tablet form but the nutrient carnosine regulates the production of histamine and it is recommended that a daily dose of 100 mg will help Bell's palsy sufferers.\n\n【7】## Adenosine Triphosphate (Atp)\n\n【8】The chemical Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) has been proven to produce energy within cells. Experiments in combining ATP with the likes of vitamins B1, B2, B6 or B12 have shown that this combination can have an impact in the recovery from Bell's palsy. The results from the experiments showed that 100% of the patients who suffered with partial paralysis of the nerve, and approximately 87% of the patients who suffered with full paralysis recovered completely. Whereas approximately only 67% of the patients treated with steroids recovered.\n\n【9】## Acetyl-L-Carnitine\n\n【10】The anti-inflammatory compound acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALC) has been found to improve the symptoms of Bell's palsy. ALC has been used for several neurological diseases such as nerve weakness, memory problems and nerve injuries.

Using two projected climate scenarios developed by other research groups, we compared the current ecoregion map with the maps predicted for the year 2099. According to these projections, by the end of this century the environment in Pittsburgh will be more like that of present-day Atlanta, and conditions in Minneapolis will resemble those in present-day St. Louis.\n\n【3】## The Future Of Clusters\n\n【4】positions, fewer iterations are needed to map the ecoregions.\n\n【5】The result of all our work was a series of maps of the continental U.S. showing each ecoregion in a different color [see illustrations B and C on page 76]. We produced maps showing the country divided into as few as four ecoregions and as many as 5,000. The maps with fewer ecoregions divided the country into recognizable zones—for example, the Rocky Mountain states and the desert Southwest. In contrast, the maps with thousands of ecoregions are far more complex than any previous classification of the country's environments. Because many plants and animals live in only one or two ecoregions, our maps may be useful to ecologists who study endangered species.\n\n【6】In our first maps the colors of the ecoregions were randomly assigned, but we later produced maps in which the colors of the ecoregions reflect the similarity of their respective environments. We statistically combined nine of the environmental variables into three composite characteristics, which we represented on the map with varying levels of red, green and blue. When the map is drawn this way, it shows gradations of color instead of sharp borders: the lush Southeast is mostly green, the cold Northeast is mainly blue, and the arid West is primarily red [*see illustration D on page 76*].\n\n【7】## More To E Xplore\n\n【8】THE TRADITIONAL MEASURE of supercomputer performance is benchmark speed: how fast the system runs a standard program. As scientists, however, we prefer to focus on how well the system can handle practical applications. To evaluate the Stone SouperComputer, we fed the same ecoregion mapping problem to ORNL's Intel Paragon supercomputer shortly before it was retired. At one time, this machine was the laboratory's fastest, with a peak performance of 150 gigaflops. On a per-processor basis, the run time on the Paragon was essentially the same as that on the Stone SouperComputer. We have never officially clocked our cluster (we are loath to steal computing cycles from real work), but the system has a theoretical peak performance of about 1.2\ngigaflops. Ingenuity in parallel algorithm design is more important than raw speed or capacity: in this young science, David and Goliath (or Beowulf and Grendel!) still compete on a level playing field.\n\n【9】The Beowulf trend has accelerated since we built the Stone SouperComputer.\n\n【10】New clusters with exotic names—Grendel, Naegling, Megalon, Brahma, Avalon, Medusa and theHive, to mention just a few—have steadily raised the performance curve by delivering higher speeds at lower costs. As of last November, 28 clusters of PCs, workstations or servers were on the list of the world's 500 fastest computers.

Sterling, J. Salmon, D. J. Becker and D. F. Savarese. MIT Press, 1999. More information about Beowulf computing can be found at the following Web sites:\nstonesoup.esd.ornl.gov/ extremelinux.esd.ornl.gov/ www.beowulf.org/ www.cacr.caltech.edu/research/beowulf/ beowulf-underground.org/\ntium III processors and is the 80th-fastest system in the world, with a performance of 237 gigaflops. The Cplant cluster at Sandia National Laboratories has 580 Compaq Alpha processors and is ranked 84th. The National Science Foundation and the U.S. Department of Energy are planning to build even more advanced clusters that could operate in the teraflops range (one trillion floating-point operations per second), rivaling the speed of the fastest supercomputers on the planet.\n\n【14】Beowulf systems are also muscling their way into the corporate world. Major computer vendors are now selling clusters to businesses with large computational needs. IBM, for instance, is building a cluster of 1,250 servers for NuTec Sciences, a biotechnology firm that plans to use the system to identify disease-causing genes. An equally important trend is the development of networks of PCs that contribute their processing power to a collective task. An example is SETI@home, a project launched by researchers at the University of California at Berkeley who are analyzing deep-space radio signals for signs of intelligent life. SETI@home sends chunks of data over the Internet to more than three million PCs, which process the radio-signal data in their idle time. Some experts in the computer industry predict that researchers will eventually be able to tap into a \"computational grid\" that will work like a power grid: users will be able to obtain processing power just as easily as they now get electricity.\n\n【15】Above all, the Beowulf concept is an empowering force. It wrests high-level computing away from the privileged few and makes low-cost parallel-processing systems available to those with modest resources. Research groups, high schools, colleges or small businesses can build or buy their own Beowulf clusters, realizing the promise of a supercomputer in every basement. Should you decide to join the parallel-processing proletariat, please contact us through our Web site (http:// extremelinux.esd.ornl.gov/) and tell us about your Beowulf-building experiences.

Use Of The Arch As Anchorage For Auxiliary Elements\n\n【4】This is used in special cases in which we want posterior sector migration (anchorage loss). In this case the DKL \narch must remain passive with the loops closed. The distal loops will be used as anchorage for the auxiliary elements, and from these loops the auxiliary elements will apply the force to the teeth of the posterior sector that we want to move.(l1) \nDKL arch modifications for retraction without torque: \nthe management of the DKL has a variant when the retraction movement must be accomplished without torque, movement is seldom planned for the upper dental arch, but on the contrary, apt for the inferior dental arch in which the retraction movement of the anterior sector must be planned with minimal or nil torque expression due to the anatomical characteristics of the alveolar ridge of this sector. To accomplish this we must wear off the arch in the anterior sector so we can eliminate the edges and this way diminish torque. Despite this, the manner and frequency of activation are the same for both cases with the objective to avoid secondary effects derived from the deepening of the Spee curveYI) \nDKL modifications in order to allow mesial migration of the posteri.or sectors: in cases where the treatment plan indicates that the posterior sectors must be mesialized, and especially in those where retrusion of the incisors is necessary, the DKL arch must not express negative torque because anchorage would increase. This is done by wearing off the arch wire on the distal portions of the loops. and this way the sharp edges of the Vv ire wIiI \ndisappear and with this the negative torque expression and friction will be reduced. This activation will be made from the first molar. Another modification can be rnade for the same purpose we must place a positive torque (around \n15 degrees), in the posterior sectors of the arch (turn the braces 180 degrees). This will place the molar roots onto trabecular bone. When an important inferior molar mesial movement is going to be done it is convenient to reinforce the inferior incisor anchorage. A higher caliber DKL arch can be used to increase anterior torque, like a 0.021\" x \n0.025\" DKL arch. In this case the wearing off will be done on the edges of the posterior segment of the arch; giving positive torque is not convenient because using a higher caliber wire increases friction and will make mesial molar migration more difficult.

Be sure you include rich sources of omega-6 in your diet such as chicken, fish, walnuts and extra virgin olive oil. Both omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids help reduce nerve inflammation and improve electrical transmission.\n\n【7】## Fruits\n\n【8】Bananas are an excellent choice as they are packed with several nutrients like potassium.

There is no added benefit in using colloid (eg, albumin) during the early phase of resuscitation.328,329\n●Treat signs of shock with a bolus of 20 mL/kg of isotonic\ncrystalloid even if blood pressure is normal (Class IIb, LOE C). Crystalloids may have an associated survival benefit over colloid for children with shock secondary to general trauma,\ntraumatic brain injury, and burns.329–332 There is no evidence\nto support the use of a specific isotonic crystalloid. Give additional boluses (20 mL/kg) if systemic perfusion fails to improve. There are insufficient data to make a recommendation for or against use of hypertonic saline for shock associated with head injuries or hypovolemia.333,334\n●There is insufficient evidence in infants and children to\nmake a recommendation about the best timing or extent of volume resuscitation for children with hemorrhagic shock following trauma.\nTrauma Some aspects of trauma resuscitation require emphasis because improperly performed resuscitation is a major cause of preventable pediatric deaths.335\nCommon errors in pediatric trauma resuscitation include failure to open and maintain the airway, failure to provide appropriate fluid resuscitation, and failure to recognize and treat internal bleeding. Involve a qualified surgeon early and, if possible, transport a child with multisystem trauma to a trauma center with pediatric expertise.\n\n【3】The following are special aspects of trauma resuscitation:\n\n【4】●When the mechanism of injury is compatible with cervical\nspinal injury, restrict motion of the cervical spine and avoid traction or movement of the head and neck. Open and maintain the airway with a jaw thrust, and do not tilt the head.\n●If the airway cannot be opened with a jaw thrust, use a head\ntilt–chin lift because you must establish a patent airway. Because of the disproportionately large head of infants and young children, optimal positioning may require recessing\nthe occiput336 or elevating the torso to avoid undesirable\nbackboard-induced cervical flexion.336,337\n●Do not routinely hyperventilate even in case of head injury\n(Class III, LOE C).338,339 Intentional brief hyperventilation\nmay be used as a temporizing rescue therapy if there are signs of impending brain herniation (eg, sudden rise in measured intracranial pressure, dilation of one or both pupils with decreased response to light, bradycardia, and hypertension).\n●Suspect thoracic injury in all thoraco-abdominal trauma,\neven in the absence of external injuries. Tension pneumothorax, hemothorax, or pulmonary contusion may impair oxygenation and ventilation.\n●If the patient has maxillofacial trauma or if you suspect a\nbasilar skull fracture, insert an orogastric rather than a nasogastric tube (Class IIa, LOE C).340\n●In the very select circumstances of children with cardiac\narrest from penetrating trauma with short transport times, consider performing resuscitative thoracotomy (Class IIb, LOE C).341,342\n●Consider intra-abdominal hemorrhage, tension pneumothorax, pericardial tamponade, and spinal cord injury in infants and children, and intracranial hemorrhage in infants, as causes of shock.343,344\nSingle Ventricle Standard prearrest and arrest resuscitation procedures should be followed for infants and children with single ventricle anatomy following Stage I palliation or in the infant or neonate with a univentricular heart and a shunt to augment pulmonary blood flow. Heparin may be considered for infants with a systemic-pulmonary artery shunt or right ventricularpulmonary artery shunt. Following resuscitation from cardiac arrest, oxygen administration should be adjusted to balance systemic and pulmonary blood flow, targeting an oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2) of approximately 80%. End-tidal CO2 (PETCO2) in the single-ventricle patient during cardiac arrest may not be a reliable indicator of CPR quality because pulmonary blood flow changes rapidly and does not necessarily reflect cardiac output during CPR.345\nNeonates in a prearrest state due to elevated pulmonaryto-systemic flow ratio prior to Stage I repair might benefit from a PaCO2 of 50 to 60 mm Hg, which can be achieved during mechanical ventilation by reducing minute ventilation, increasing the inspired fraction of CO2, or administering opioids with or without chemical paralysis (Class IIb, LOE B).346,347 Neonates in a low cardiac output state following stage I repair may benefit from systemic vasodilators such as\n-adrenergic antagonists (eg, phenoxybenzamine) to treat or ameliorate increased systemic vascular resistance, improve systemic oxygen delivery, and reduce the likelihood of cardiac arrest (Class IIa, LOE B).348–350 Other drugs that reduce systemic vascular resistance (eg, milrinone or nipride)351 may also be considered for patients with excessive Qp:Qs (Class IIa, LOE B).352 Following Stage I repair, evaluation of oxygen delivery and extraction (eg, using central venous oxygen saturation [ScvO2] and near-infrared spectroscopy) may help identify evolving changes in hemodynamics that may herald impending cardiac arrest.353–355\nDuring cardiopulmonary arrest, it is reasonable to consider extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for patients with single ventricle anatomy who have undergone Stage I procedure (Class IIa, LOE B).129,132,152,356,357\nHypoventilation may improve oxygen delivery in patients in a prearrest state with Fontan or hemi-Fontan/bidirectional Glenn (BDG) physiology (Class IIa, LOE B).358–361 Negativepressure ventilation may improve cardiac output (Class IIa, LOE C).362,363 During cardiopulmonary arrest, it is reasonable to consider extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for patients with Fontan physiology (Class IIa, LOE C).364 It is unclear at this time whether patients with hemi-Fontan/BDG physiology in cardiac arrest might benefit from ECMO.\n\n【5】Pulmonary Hypertension Standard PALS, including oxygenation and ventilation, should be provided to patients with pulmonary hypertension and a cardiopulmonary arrest. It may be beneficial to attempt to correct hypercarbia. Administration of a bolus of isotonic fluid may be useful to maintain preload to the systemic ventricle. If intravenous or inhaled therapy to decrease pulmonary hypertension has been interrupted, reinstitute it (Class IIa, LOE C). Consider administering inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) or aerosolized prostacyclin or analogue to reduce pulmonary vascular resistance (Class IIa, LOE C). If iNO is not available, consider giving an intravenous bolus of prostacyclin (Class IIa, LOE C).365–367 ECMO may be beneficial if instituted early in the resuscitation (Class IIa, LOE C).368\nChildren With Special Healthcare Needs Children with special healthcare needs369 may require emergency care for chronic conditions (eg, obstruction of a tracheostomy), failure of support technology (eg, ventilator failure), progression of their underlying disease, or events unrelated to those special needs.370\nFor additional information about CPR see Part 13: \"Pediatric Basic Life Support.\"\nVentilation With a Tracheostomy or Stoma Parents, school nurses, and home healthcare providers should know how to assess patency of the airway, clear the airway, replace the tracheostomy tube, and perform CPR using the artificial airway in a child with a tracheostomy.\n\n【6】Parents and providers should be able to ventilate via a tracheostomy tube and verify effectiveness by assessing chest expansion. If, after suctioning, the chest does not expand with ventilation, remove the tracheostomy tube and replace it or insert a same-sized endotracheal tube, if available, into the tracheal stoma. If a clean tube is unavailable, perform mouth-to-stoma or mask-to-stoma ventilations. If the upper airway is patent, bag-mask ventilation via the nose and mouth may be effective if the tracheal stoma is manually occluded.\n\n【7】Toxicological Emergencies Overdose with local anesthetics, cocaine, narcotics, tricyclic antidepressants, calcium channel blockers, and -adrenergic blockers may require specific treatment modalities in addition to the usual resuscitative measures.\n\n【8】Local Anesthetic Local anesthetics are used topically, intravenously, subcutaneously, and in epidural or other catheters for delivery of regional analgesia. The toxicity of local anesthetics is well recognized in children; they may cause changes in mental status, seizures, arrhythmias, or even cardiac arrest in settings of overdose or inadvertent vascular administration. Multiple case reports, including some pediatric reports, have described successful treatment of local anesthetic toxicity with intravenous lipid emulsion.371\n by guest on September 4, 2011\nCocaine Acute coronary syndrome, manifested by chest pain and cardiac rhythm disturbances (including VT and VF), is the most frequent cocaine-related reason for hospitalization in adults.372,373 Cocaine also may prolong the action potential and QRS duration and impairs myocardial contractility.374,375", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care Science (Mary Fran Hazinski, John M.

Electroencephalography (EEG) or neuro-feedback used to measure brain\nwave activity.\n\n【4】## What Happens During Biofeedback Therapy?\n\n【5】A typical biofeedback session will involve attaching tiny electrodes to your skin. These electrodes then send information to a small box that translates the signals your body is giving out. You will see lines that vary in pitch on a computer screen. The biofeedback therapist in charge will then guide you through some mental exercises.

Daniel Mange, however, likes it when visitors walk up to one of his inventions and press the button marked KILL. The lights on the panel go out; a small box full of circuitry is toast. Early in May his team unveiled its latest contraption at a science festival here—a wall-size digital clock whose components you can zap at will—and told the public:\nGive it your best shot. See if you can crash the system.\n\n【3】The goal of Mange and his team is to instill electronic circuits with the ability to take a lickin' and keep on tickin'—just like living things. Flesh-and-blood creatures might not be so good at calculating π to the millionth digit, but they can get through the day without someone pressing Ctrl-Alt-Del. Combining the precision of digital hardware with the resilience of biological wetware is a leading challenge for modern electronics.\n\n【4】Electronics engineers have been working on fault-tolerant circuits ever since there were electronics engineers [see \"Redundancy in Computers,\" by William H. Pierce; SCIENTIFIC\nAMERICAN, February 1964]. Computer modems would still be dribbling data at 1200 baud if it weren't for error detection and correction. In many applications, simple quality-control checks, such as extra data bits, suffice. More complex systems provide entire backup computers. The space shuttle, for example, has five processors. Four of them perform the same calculations; the fifth checks whether they agree and pulls the plug on any dissenter.\n\n【5】The problem with these systems, though, is that they rely on centralized control. What if that control unit goes bad?\n\n【6】Nature has solved that problem through radical decentralization. Cells in the body are all basically identical; each takes on a specialized task, performs it autonomously and, in the event of infection or failure, commits hara-kiri so that its tasks can be taken up by new cells. These are the attributes that Mange, a professor at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology here, and others have sought since 1993 to emulate in circuitry, as part of the \"Embryonics\" (embryonic electronics) project.\n\n【7】One of their earlier inventions, the MICTREE (microinstruction tree) artificial cell, consisted of a simple processor and four bits of data storage. The cell is contained in a plastic box roughly the size of a pack of Post-its. Electrical contacts run along the sides so that cells can be snapped together like Legos. As in cellular automata, the models used to study the theory of self-replication, the MICTREE cells are connected only to their immediate neighbors. The communication burden on each cell is thus independent of the total number of cells. The system, in other words, is easily scalable—\nunlike many parallel-computing architectures.\n\n【8】Cells follow the instructions in their \"genome,\" a program written in a subset of the Pascal computer language. Like their biological antecedents, the cells all contain the exact same genome and execute part of it based on their position within the array, which each cell calculates relative to its neighbors. Waste-\nCRASH-PROOF COMPUTER is a two-dimensional array of artificial cells, each one a simple processor. In this application, four cells work together as a stopwatch, one cell per digit. Each cell counts up to either five or nine, depending on its coordinates within the array. The rest of the cells in the array are spares that take over if a cell fails or is killed. The Biodule 601 cells shown here are based on the MICTREE architecture described in the text.\n\n【9】ful though it may seem, this redundancy allows the array to withstand the loss of any cell. Whenever someone presses the KILL button on a cell, that cell shuts down, and its left and right neighbors become directly connected. The right neighbor recalculates its position and starts executing the deceased's program. Its tasks, in turn, are taken up by the next cell to the right, and so on, until a cell designated as a spare is pressed into service. \n\n【10】Writing programs for any parallel processor is tricky, but the MICTREE array requires an especially unconventional approach.\n\n【11】Instead of giving explicit instructions, the programmer must devise simple rules out of which the desired function will emerge. Being Swiss, Mange demonstrates by building a superreliable stopwatch. Displaying minutes and seconds requires four cells in a row, one for each digit. The genome allows for two cell types: a counter from zero to nine and a counter from zero to five. An oscillator feeds one pulse per second into the rightmost cell. After 10 pulses, this cell cycles back to zero and sends a pulse to the cell on its left, and so on down the line. The watch takes up part of an array of 12 cells; when you kill one, the clock transplants itself one cell over and carries on. Obviously, though, there is a limit to its resilience: the whole thing will fail after, at most, eight kills.\n\n【12】The prototype MICTREE cells are hardwired, so their processing power cannot be tailored to a specific application. In a finished product, cells would instead be implemented on a fieldprogrammable gate array, a grid of electronic components that can be reconfigured on the fly [see \"Configurable Computing,\" by John Villasenor and William H.

Blake And Peter Jenniskens\n\n【2】AS VOYAGER 1 RACED OUT OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM\n11 years ago, NASA engineers turned the spacecraft's camera arm around to take a parting snapshot of Earth. The planet appeared as a single paleblue pixel, its color arising from the scattering of sunlight in its vast oceans. Earth is a water planet. And no matter how far researchers travel around the globe, no matter how high or deep they send their probes, if they find liquid water, they find some form of life that manages to survive.\n\n【3】And yet there is a cruel dichotomy about water's nature. Liquid water cradles life, but water in its solid crystalline form destroys it. Organisms can roost in geysers, wallow in brine and gulp down acid, but they recoil from ice. The rigid ordering of water molecules in ice crystals expels impurities and tears organic tissue beyond repair. Such is the nature of ice on Earth. Yet recent discoveries about an unusual kind of frozen water that is absent from Earth but ubiquitous in interstellar space have inspired scientists to revise their assumptions about ice. In its interstellar form, water ice (as distinct from icy forms of carbon dioxide or other compounds) can harbor the kind of simple organic compounds from which life arose—and may even encourage their formation. As a result, this interstellar ice may actually have played an intrinsic role in the origins of life.\n\n【4】Uncovering the source of the organic materials that may have been the precursors to life has long been one of the most passion-inspiring quests in origins-of-life research. For more than a decade, scientists have known that organic compounds thrive in interstellar clouds and comets. They have also concluded that a frost rich in water ice exists everywhere in space where dust and gas become cold enough to condense into solids—primarily in cold molecular clouds [see \"Life's Far-Flung Raw Materials,\" by Max P. Bernstein, Scott A. Sandford and Louis J. Allamandola; Scientific American, July 1999].\n\n【5】Many planetary scientists have gone further, arguing that the icebound organics could have hitched a ride to Earth. When a cold molecular cloud collapsed to form our solar system 4.5 billion years ago, as the theory goes, some of the cloud's ice would have coalesced into comets. These balls of ice and rock could then have carried the organic compounds on a collision course with the young Earth. After reaching this planet, the organics could have participated in the chemical reactions from which the first living organisms arose.\n\n【6】This scenario has offered a compelling explanation for how organic compounds could have been delivered to Earth, but until recently no one DAVID F.

Is Obesity Related To Asthma?\n\n【2】A suspected relationship between obesity and asthma continues to stimulate medical interest. Physicians as well as the general public have long postulated a link between obesity and asthma. The prevalence of both obesity and asthma are rising in parallel in Western societies. Several human population studies have demonstrated an association between being overweight and the likelihood of carrying an asthma diagnosis. Yet, the precise relationship between the two conditions remains controversial. Does asthma cause obesity? Does obesity cause asthma? Or, is there a common underlying factor that causes both asthma and obesity? The scientific pulmonary community has started to tackle these questions. One traditional theory maintains that asthma, particularly less than optimally managed asthma, leads to a more sedentary lifestyle. According to the theory, certain asthmatics do not exercise, either because of a mistaken belief that exercise is \"bad\" for asthma or because their asthma is not well controlled and flares with exercise. Because of lack of exercise, the asthmatic becomes more out of shape, more sedentary, gains more weight, and ultimately joins the ranks of the obese. An alternative theory suggests that obesity is the primary event, and that the obese state leads to changes in the lungs and airways, and ultimately asthma. Both theories have their merits, but neither one satisfactorily explains why asthma does not affect males and females equally. A third, more contemporary approach, with intriguing supportive data in laboratory animals, attempts to sort out the influence of chromosomal changes and hormonal factors that might confer predispositions to both asthma and overweight status. In 1994, a protein molecule called leptin was identified in humans. Leptin is primarily produced by fatty tissues. Leptin and a second protein called ghrelin are both suspected of playing important roles in the regulation of food intake, energy balance, and ultimately of weight.\n\n【3】Of interest to lung researchers, lung and airway cells have receptors for leptin on their surfaces, and leptin furthermore stimulates the proliferation of the lung and airway cells, acting as a kind of stimulatory lung growth factor. Some preliminary studies in humans have documented elevated blood leptin levels in certain types of marked obesity. The finding raises the tantalizing possibility that there could be an association between obesity and asthma on one hand, and abnormal blood levels of leptin and even ghrelin on the other. A key to better understanding the obesity-asthma link may come from the study of girls and boys in puberty and adolescence. More than 1,000 babies born between May 1980 and January of 1984 were entered at birth in the ambitious and ongoing Tucson Children's Respiratory Study. Nearly 1,300 subjects were enrolled in the study, and have been followed and reassessed at regular intervals for over 20 years by Dr. Fernando Martinez and his team. The study was designed to study respiratory health and illness over time, in a prospective fashion. In particular, the development of asthma was carefully evaluated. In 2001, Dr. Martinez and his co-workers reported that females who became overweight or obese between the ages of 6 and 11 years of age had an increased risk for developing new asthma symptoms during early adolescence. They found that girls—but not boys—who became overweight between 6 and 11 years of age were 5 to 7 times more likely to develop new asthma symptoms at ages 11 and 13, compared to girls who did not become overweight or obese at ages 6 and 11 years. Boys who became significantly overweight between 6 and 11 years of age did not exhibit an increased risk for the development of asthma or asthmalike symptoms. The strongest association between overweight status and asthma risk was seen in females who underwent puberty before the age of 11 years. Being overweight is associated with earlier onset of puberty. Could there be a common factor that leads to overweight status in girls, followed by early puberty and then the development of asthma? The findings are especially interesting because it has long been observed that new cases of asthma in females are especially common in the adolescent years. Further, the male (2:1) preponderance of asthma seen in young, school-age children changes over to a female preponderance by adulthood. A role for female hormones has long been suspected, and the data from the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study supports this theory and suggests avenues for further research. Apart from consideration of the links between obesity and asthma risk, being overweight is medically undesirable. Even my patients with very well-controlled asthma symptoms report that their breathing is \"so much easier\" when they maintain a \"comfortable\" weight. They feel more limber, less achy, and describe greater endurance. It makes sense that if you carry excess weight on your frame, it literally \"feels\" as if you are transporting additional pounds as you walk around. How can you tell whether you or your child are obese? An obese adult is, by definition, a person who weighs 30% or more above their predicted or ideal body weight. One useful and handy formula for calculating an adult's ideal body weight requires knowledge of your height. Females are allowed 100 pounds for the first 5 feet of height, and 5 more pounds for each additional inch above 5 feet. A few additional pounds are added or subtracted for persons with large or small frames. So, a 5'3\" woman should ideally weigh about 115 pounds. The formula for men is similar: A man is allowed 106 pounds for \"the first\" 5 feet of height, and 6 additional pounds are added for every additional inch over 5 feet. A 6-foot tall man of average build would thus be expected to weigh 178 pounds. As for women, there is a correction for individuals with small and large frames. Ideal body weight for children is best determined by computation of the body mass index (BMI). BMI is a measure that can also be used in adults. Assessment of BMI requires accurate measurement of height and weight, ideally in meters and kilograms. The BMI is the weight (in kilograms) divided by the square of the height (in meters). You will need to obtain a table of predicted BMI for any age to compare your child's BMI to the standard. A child with a BMI greater or equal to the 95th percentile for his or her age is considered obese. If you prefer not to do the math, there are several clever Web sites that ask you to enter data such as your weight, height, and age, and then calculate your ideal body weight and BMI for you. Simply go to your preferred search engine, and type a phrase such as: \"ideal body weight calculator,\" or \"BMI computation\" to navigate among the different sites, and learn how you compare!", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/100 Questions and Answers About Asthma (Claudia S.

Margaret Mellon,\n\n【2】How did you become interested in genetically modified foods?\n\n【3】I became aware of genetic engineering while running a program on toxic chemicals at the Environmental Law Institute in the 1980s. I was initially more positively disposed toward biotechnology than I came to be over the years. Like a lot of folks, I wasn't very critical. But the more I knew about the technology and the deeper the questions I asked about it, the less likely I was to accept at face value the extravagant promises made on its behalf.\n\n【4】I should also say, however, that my colleagues and I at the Union of Concerned Scientists are not opposed to biotechnology. We director of the agricultural and biotechnology program of the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington, D.C., holds a law degree and a Ph.D. in molecular biology.\n\n【5】She explains her concerns about the effects of GM\nfoods on human health and the environment.\n\n【6】think its use in drug manufacture, for example, makes a lot of sense. The therapeutic benefits of the new drugs outweigh the risks, and often there aren't any alternatives. But in agriculture, it's different. So far, at least, there are only modest benefits associated with biotechnology products, and it has yet to be shown that the benefits outweigh the risks. And there are exciting alternatives to solving agricultural problems that we are simply ignoring.\n\n【7】Agriculture isn't like medicine. We in the U.S. produce far more food than we need. And we are so wealthy that whatever we can't produce we can buy from somebody else. As a result, there are about 300,000 food products on our grocery shelves and 10,000 new ones added every year. The notion that consumers in the U.S. fundamentally need new biotechnology foods isn't persuasive.\n\n【8】But, of course, many scientists and policy experts argue that we do need biotechnology to feed the world, especially the developing world.\n\n【9】That is an important question to ask because so many people—about 800 million—are undernourished or hungry. But is genetic engineering the best or only solution? We have sufficient food now, but it doesn't get to those who need it. Most hungry people simply can't afford to buy what's already out there even though commodity prices are at all-time lows. How does genetic engineering address the problems of income disparity?\n\n【10】The real tragedy is that the debate about biotechnology is diverting attention from solving the problem of world hunger. I'd like to see people seriously asking the question, \"What can we do to help the world's hungry feed themselves?\" and then make a list of answers. Better technology, including genetic engineering, would be somewhere on the list, but it would not be at the top. Trade policy, infrastructure and land reform are much more important, yet they are barely mentioned.\n\n【11】Genetic engineering has a place and should not be taken off the table, but I don't believe it is a panacea for world hunger. Treating it as if it is distorts this important debate. It is also amazing to me how quickly some have dismissed the virtues of traditional breeding—the technology that, after all, made us into an agricultural powerhouse. \n\n【12】Can we turn to another potential benefit that people claim for GM foods: agriculture that is more environmentally friendly?\n\n【13】Let's ask a question: What is a green agriculture? Is it one that doesn't depend on pesticides? I think it's a lot more than that, actually. But if we just consider avoiding pesticide use, we now have some data on the impacts of engineered crops. Surveys of American farmers by the Department of Agriculture show that the use of Bt [pest-resistant] corn aimed at the corn borer, for example, hasn't done much to reduce the application of pesticides to corn, because the vast majority of corn acreage isn't treated with pesticide to control that pest. \n\n【14】The introduction of Bt cotton, however, has resulted in a measurable drop in pesticide use. That's good for the environment and good for the farmers who cut their input costs. But this benefit will last only as long as the Bt trait keeps working. I think most scientists expect that the way Bt crops are being deployed will lead—sooner rather than later—to the evolution of resistance in the target pests, which means that the Bt cotton won't work anymore. We are likely to run through Bt cotton just like we ran through all the pesticides before it. So it isn't a durable path to a greener agriculture.\n\n【15】And there are environmental risks out there. Most scientists agree now that gene flow will occur—genes *will* go from engineered crops to nearby relatives. That means pollen will carry novel genes from the agricultural settings into neighbors' fields or into the wild. Gene flow from herbicide-resistant GM crops into the wild is already leading to the creation of herbicideresistant weeds in Canada.\n\n【16】What about the health risks of GM foods? Do you see any looming problems?\n\n【17】I know of no reason to say the foods currently on the market are not safe to consume. But I don't have as much confidence as I should in that statement. There was a letter published in the journal *Science* last June from someone who had searched the literature for peer-reviewed studies comparing GM food to non-GM food. The researcher found something like five studies. That's not enough of a basis on which to claim, from a scientific standpoint, that we know enough to assure ourselves that these foods are going to be safe.\n\n【18】With the little we know about the food safety issue, I would say the biggest concern is allergenicity. Introducing new toxins into food is also a risk. Of course, breeders are going to try to avoid doing that, but plants have lots of toxins in them; as scientists manipulate systems that they don't completely understand, one of the unexpected effects could be turning on genes for toxins. There are rules that govern how genes come together and come apart in traditional breeding. We're not obeying those rules. \n\n【19】So you don't see genetic engineering of crops to be an extension of traditional breeding?\n\n【20】No, not at all. You just can't get an elephant to mate with a corn plant. Scientists are making combinations of genes that are not found in nature.\n\n【21】From a scientific standpoint, there is no dispute that this is fundamentally different from what has been done before. And that it is unnatural. Now, because it's new and unnatural doesn't necessarily mean that it will prove to be more risky. But it is certainly a big enough break with what we have done before to demand an extra measure of caution.\n\n【22】And caution is particularly appropriate where the technology involves our food supply. Lots and lots of people—virtually the whole population—could be exposed to genetically engineered foods, and yet we have only a handful of studies in the peer-reviewed literature addressing their safety. The question is, do we *assume* the technology is safe based on an argument that it's just a minor extension of traditional breeding, or do we prove it? The scientist in me wants to prove it's safe. Why rest on assumptions when you can go into the lab?\n\n【23】Science can never prove that any technology is 100 percent safe. Will you ever be satisfied that we've tested GM foods enough? And how much risk is acceptable?\n\n【24】Sure, I could be satisfied that GM foods have been adequately tested. But it's premature to address that question now. Nobody is saying, \"Look, we've got this large body of peer-reviewed experimental data comparing GM with non-GM foods on a number of criteria that demonstrate the food is safe.\"\nWhen we have generated such a body of evidence, then there will be an issue of whether what we have is enough. And eventually, if things go well, we'll get to a point where we say, we've been cautious, but now we're going to move ahead—we need to fish or cut bait. But we're nowhere near that point now.\n\n【25】Obviously, we take risks all the time. But why are we taking these risks? If we didn't have an abundant food supply, if we didn't have something like 300,000 food products on our shelves already, then we would have an argument for taking this society-wide risk. But we've got plenty of food. In fact, we've got too much. And although we have many problems associated with our food system, they are not going to be solved by biotechnology.\n\n【26】Sasha Nemecek, a former editor at Scientific American, is a science writer based in New York City.\n\n【27】VIRTUALLY\nThree-dimensional tele-immersion may eventually bring the world to your desk THERE\nBY JARON LANIER\nPHOTOGRAPH BY DAN WINTERS", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/(2001-04) Whose Blood Is It, Anyway (Scientific American) (Z-Library).pdf", "page_num": [46], "text_type": [[{"text": "NO", "types": "Section-header"}, {"text": "Does theWorldNeedGMFoods?", "types": "Section-header"}, {"text": "MARGARET MELLON, ", "types": "Section-header"}], [{"text": "How did you become interested in genetically", "types": "Text"}, {"text": "modified foods?", "types": "Text"}, {"text": "I became aware of genetic engineering while", "types": "Text"}, {"text": "running a program on toxic chemicals at the En-", "types": "Text"}, {"text": "vironmental Law Institute in the 1980s.

Marketing Tactics And Privacy Issues Raise Eyebrows\n\n【2】LAST SEPTEMBER a little girl from California named Molly received a lifesaving transplant of umbilical cord blood from her newborn brother, Adam. Molly, who was then eight years old, suffered from a potentially fatal genetic blood disorder known as Fanconi anemia. But what made the procedure particularly unusual was that Adam might not have been born had his sister not been sick. He was conceived through in vitro fertilization, and physicians specifically selected his embryo from a group of others for implantation into his mother's womb after tests showed that he would not have the disease and that he would be the best tissue match for Molly.\n\n【3】Was this ethically appropriate? A panel of bioethicists decided that it was, because donating cord blood would have no effect on Adam's health. \n\n【4】Selectively conceiving a potential donor is only one of the myriad ethical issues surrounding umbilical cord blood transplantation. One of the most significant has to do not with how the blood is used but with the marketing campaigns aimed at prospective parents by for-profit companies that offer to collect and store a baby's cord blood—for a hefty fee—in case he or she might need it later.\n\n【5】Such companies market cord blood collection as \"biological insurance\" to expectant parents. But \"the odds are so extraordinarily against their child's ever needing it,\" says Paul Root Wolpe, a fellow at the University of Pennsylvania Health System Center for Bioethics. He fears that parents who can scarcely afford the service might feel impelled to buy it even though their families have no history of blood disorders.\n\n【6】Viacord, a cord blood–preserving company based in Boston, says that just five of their 6,500 clients have so far needed infusions of their stored cord blood. Moreover, only 20 percent have a family history of a blood disorder or are now in treatment.\n\n【7】The American Academy of Pediatrics issued a policy statement on umbilical cord blood banking in July 1999 cautioning that \"it is difficult to recommend that parents store their children's cord blood for future use\" unless a family member has had a blood disorder. Instead it encouraged parents to donate their baby's cord blood to public banks.\n\n【8】Questions have been raised in the past concerning the ownership of cord blood. But bioethicist Jeremy Sugarman of Duke University states that it is now fairly clear that although an infant owns his or her own cord blood, parents have legal guardianship over it—just as they do over the child—until he or she reaches age 18. Sugarman and Wolpe contributed to a 1997 consensus statement on the ethics of umbilical cord blood banking in the *Journal of the American Medical Association*.\n\n【9】Sugarman adds that it is perfectly appropriate for a parent to use one sibling's cord blood to treat another. If the first child develops a need for a transplantation later on, the fact that the parents already used his or her stored blood is unfortunate but not unethical.\n\n【10】Of more concern is how to ensure the safety of cord blood donated to cord banks.\n\n【11】What happens if parents donate a newborn's cord blood to a public bank and the child develops leukemia years later? If the donated blood has no identifying information to link it to the donor, there would be no way to prevent it from being used in another child. Stem cells in the umbilical cord blood of a child who later gets leukemia could also cause leukemia in a recipient. But keeping permanent records of donors carries privacy risks: What if the blood is transplanted into a recipient but doesn't take, and the sick child's parents want to track down the donor child for bone marrow cells?\n\n【12】Most public cord blood banks label samples so they can be linked to a particular donor for several years, at which time they destroy the identifying information. Wolpe says that this is a good trade-off but that risks will always be associated with donor cord blood, just as they are with donor adult blood. \"You try to keep it as safe as you can,\" he says, \"but people take a chance.\"\ning sprung from the donor's stem cells.\n\n【13】But it took years for other physicians to recognize the potential of umbilical cord blood transplantation. In 1989 Hal E. Broxmeyer of the Indiana University School of Medicine, Edward A. Boyse of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City and their colleagues revived interest in the technique by showing that human cord blood contains as many stem cells as bone marrow does. That same year Broxmeyer, Eliane Gluckman of  Saint-Louis Hospital in Paris and their co-workers reported curing Fanconi anemia—a potentially fatal genetic disorder—\nin a five-year-old boy using blood from his baby sister's umbilical cord. Since then, approximately 75 percent of umbilical cord blood transplants have used cord blood from a nonrelative obtained from cord blood storage programs.\n\n【14】What's Bred in the Bone umbilical cord blood transplantation aims to obtain a source of stem cells that is the best possible match for a particular patient's tissue type. Tissue type is determined by a set of genes that make proteins called human leukocyte antigens (HLAs), which are found on the surfaces of all body cells. The immune system recognizes cells bearing the HLA proteins it has encountered since birth as normal, or belonging to the \"self.\" Any other HLA proteins are regarded as \"nonself,\" or foreign; cells carrying them are quickly killed.\n\n【15】There are six major HLA genes. Every person has two copies, or alleles, of each—\none from each parent. (Each allele can come in more than 30 different types.) For bone marrow transplants, physicians aim to match the six alleles (of the total 12) that are most clinically relevant in transplantation. But because cord blood cells are immunologically different from bone marrow cells, doctors can use donor cord blood samples that match five—or even three—HLA alleles.\n\n【16】The genetic blueprints for making HLA proteins are found on chromosome 6. The rules of genetics dictate that the probability that two siblings will inherit the same maternal and paternal chromosome 6—and will therefore be good tissue-type matches—is only 25 percent. \n\n【17】Receiving a bone marrow transplant from someone who is not a good tissuetype match is potentially fatal. On one hand, the graft can fail if even a tiny amount of the recipient's own immune cells survive to generate an immune response that deems the transplanted cells foreign and kills them. This graft failure essentially leaves the patient without a many unknown minor HLA proteins. Although these proteins are not actively matched in sibling transplants either, the close genetic relationship of siblings ensures that many of them will be matched simply by chance. A good sibling pairing, however, still carries a 20 percent risk of graft-versus-host disease. \n\n【18】One way to slash this incidence would", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/(2001-04) Whose Blood Is It, Anyway (Scientific American) (Z-Library).pdf", "page_num": [30], "text_type": [[{"text": "But Is It Ethical?", "types": "Section-header"}, {"text": "Marketing tactics and privacy issues raise eyebrows", "types": "Section-header"}], [{"text": "LAST SEPTEMBER a little girl from California named Molly received a lifesaving", "types": "Text"}, {"text": "transplant of umbilical cord blood from her newborn brother, Adam.

Bu antibiyotik öncesi günlerde, yaralanmaların yaygın görülen sonuçlarından biri de kangrendi ve binlerce yaralı askerin iltihaplı uzvunu kesen cerrahlar da evlerine hayalet uzuvlar ve bunlara neyin neden olabileceği konusunda düzinelerce yeni açıklamayla döndüler. Silas Weir Mitchell bu fenomene çok şaşırmıştı ve ilk makalesini, profesyonel bir tıp dergisinde yayımlayıp arkadaşlarının alaylarına maruz kalmak yerine *Lippincott's Journal* adlı popüler bir dergide takma isimle yayımladı. Hayaletler, düşündüğünüzde, daha ziyade ürkütücü bir fenomendir. \n\n【5】Silas Weir Mitchell döneminden beri hayalet uzuvlar hakkında çok güzel olanlardan son derece saçma olanlara dek her tür spekülasyon ortaya atılmıştır. Geçenlerde, yirmi yıl kadar önce, *Canadian Journal of Psychiatry*'de çıkan bir yazı, hayalet uzuvların sadece hüsnükuruntu yüzünden olduğunu belirtti. Yazarlar, hastanın umutsuzca kolunu geri istediğini ve bu yüzden hayalet uzuv deneyimi yaşadığını söylediler - kısa süre önce kaybedilen anne veya babayı \nrüyada sık görmeye, hatta \"hayalet\"lerini görmeye benzer bir durummuş bu. Böylesi bir sav, ilerde göreceğimiz gibi çok saçmadır. \n\n【6】Hayalet uzuvlar için ikinci ve daha popüler bir açıklama, güdükteki (kesilen uzuvdan kalan parça) yıpranıp kıvrılmış sinir uçlarının (nöromalar) ateşlendiği ve harekete geçtiği, böylece kaybedilen uzvun hala oradaymış gibi düşünülmesini sağlayacak şekilde yüksek beyin merkezlerinin aldandığı şeklindedir. Bu harekete geçen sinirler kuramıyla ilgili birçok sorun olmasına rağmen, basit ve uygun bir açıklama oluşu yüzünden çoğu doktor buna sarılmaktadır. \n\n【7】Çoğu doktor gibi, ilk karşılaştığım andan itibaren hayalet uzuvlar dikkatimi çekti ve o andan beri bunlara şaşırıyorum. Ampüteler arasında çok yaygın olan hayalet kol ve bacaklara ek olarak radikal mastektomi sonrası hayalet memeleri olan kadınlar, hatta hayalet apandisiti olan bir hasta gördüm. Ameliyatla çıkarılmasına rağmen tipik spazmodik apandisit ağrısı azalmamıştı, öyle ki hasta, cerrahın onu kesip aldığını kabul etmiyordu! Bir bilim öğrencisi olarak, bu duruma hastalar kadar şaşırmıştım ve başvurduğum kitaplar sadece gizemi daha da derinleştirdi. Penisi kesilip alındıktan sonra bir hastanın hayalet ereksiyonlar yaşadığını, fenomenin neden ortaya çıktığını da merak ediyordum. Neden bir kol, alındıktan sonra hastanın zihninde uzun süre kalmaktadır? Akıl neden uzvun kaybedildiğini kabul ederek vücut imgesi \"yeniden şekillendirmez\"? Bu fenomenin incelenmesinin, beynin ani ve devasa kayıplarla nasıl başa çıktığını anlamamıza yardımcı olmanın yanı sıra kalıtım mı yoksa çevre mi gibi daha temel bir tartışmayı –zihnimizin diğer yönleri gibi vücut imgesinin de ne ölçüye kadar genlerle belirlendiği ve ne ölçüye kadar deneyimlerle düzenlendiği meselesine de- ışık tutacağını fark ettim. \n\n【8】Beth Brieter, çaresiz durumdaydı. \"Doktor,\" dedi, \"bana yardım edebileceğinizi ümit ediyorum.\" Kayıp koluna doğru baktı. \"On yıl önce kaybettim. Fakat o zamandan beri hayalet dirseğim, bileğim ve parmaklarımda korkunç ağrılar var\". İlerleyen sohbetimizde bu on yıl boyunca Beth'in hayalet kolunu hiç oynatamadığını keşfettim. Her zaman tuhaf bir konumda sabit duruyordu. Beth öğrenilmiş felçten mi mustaripti? Eğer öyleyse, bizim sanal gerçeklik kutusunu kullanarak hayalet uzvunu canlandırıp yeniden hareket kazandırabilir miydik? \n\n【9】Beth'ten sağ elini kutudaki aynanın sağ tarafına yerleştirmesini ve sol elinin (hayalet elinin) de sol tarafta olduğunu hayal etmesini istedim. \"Sağ ve sol kollarını aynı anda hareket ettirmeni istiyorum\" diye talimat verdim. \n\n【10】\"Bunu yapamam\" dedi Beth. \"Sağ kolumu hareket ettirebiliyorum fakat sol kolum hareketsiz. Her sabah uyandığımda, hayalet kolumu hareket ettirmeye çalışıyorum, çünkü komik bir konumda kalakaldı ve hareket etmesinin ağrıyı azaltacağını hissediyorum. Fakat\" dedi, görünmez koluna bakarak, \"küçük bir hareket kıvılcımı bile oluşturamadım.\" \n\"Tamam, Beth, fakat yine de denemelisin\" \nBeth vücudunu döndürdü, omzunu kaydırarak cansız hayalet kolunu kutunun içine \n\"yerleştirdi\". Sonra sağ elini aynanın diğer tarafına koydu ve senkron hareketler yapmaya çalıştı. Aynaya baktığında önce nefesini tuttu ve artından \"Tanrım! Tanrım, doktor! Bu inanılmaz. Akıllara durgunluk verici!\" diye çığlık attı. Bir çocuk gibi hoplayıp zıplıyordu. \"Sol kolum yeniden yerinde. Sanki geçmişteki gibiyim. Bunca yıl sonra tüm bu anılarım tekrar hızla canlanıyor. Kolumu tekrar hareket ettirebiliyorum. Dirseğimi, bileğimi tekrar oynatabiliyorum. \n\n【11】Her yeri hareket ediyor.\" \nBiraz sakinleştikten sonra \"Pekâlâ Steve şimdi gözlerini kapat\" dedim. \n\n【12】\"Tanrım!\" Açıkçası hayal kırıklığına uğramıştı. \"Yeniden dondu. Sağ elimin hareketini hissediyorum, fakat hayalet kolum hareketsiz.\" \n\"Gözlerini aç.\" \"Oh, evet. Şimdi tekrar hareket ediyor.\" \nSanki Steve'in hayalet uzvunu hareket ettiren sinir devrelerinde geçici bir bastırma veya engellenme vardı ve görsel geribildirim bu engellemeyi ortadan kaldırmıştı. Daha da ilginç olanı, önceki on yıl boyunca hiç hissedilmemiş olmasına rağmen, kol hareketine dair bu bedensel duyuları anında canlanmıştı.2 \nSteve'in tepkisi heyecan vericiydi ve öğrenilmiş felçle ilgili hipotezim için destekleyici bilgi sağlıyordu, ama o gece eve gittiğimde kendi kendime sordum: \"Eee, şimdi ne oldu? Bu adamın hayalet uzvunu tekrar hareket ettirdik, fakat biraz düşününce tamamen yararsız bir beceri; bazen biz tıp araştırmacılarının üzerinde çalışmakla suçlandığı gizli saklı bir şeye benziyor.\" Bir kişinin hayalet uzvunu hareket ettirmesini sağladığım için bir ödül kazanamayacağımı fark ettim. \n\n【13】Fakat öğrenilmiş felç belki de daha yaygın bir olaydır.3 Gerçek uzuvları felçli kişilerde de, örneğin inme sonrası oluyordur belki. İnsanlar inme sonrası neden kollarının kullanımını kaybediyorlar? Beyni besleyen bir damar tıkandığında, beynin ön bölümünden omuriliğe uzanan lifler oksijensiz kalıp zedelenir ve kol felç olur. Fakat inmenin erken dönemlerinde, beyin şişer ve geçici olarak bazı sinirlerin ölmesine, bazılarının da afallayıp iletişimi kesmesine daha önceki sonuçların sadece deney ortamından kaynaklanan hatalı ve uydurma bir sonucu olma olasılığını dışlamakta. Eğer uydurma olsaydı, neden tüm eli ve dirseğini oynatırken parmaklarını tek tek oynatamasın. \n\n【14】3 Öğrenilmiş felç kavramı çok kışkırtıcıdır ve felçli hayalet uzuvları tedavi etmenin ötesinde anlamları olabilir. \n\n【15】Örnek olarak, yazar krampını ele alalım (fokal distoni). Hasta, parmaklarını oynatabilir, burnunu kaşıyabilir veya sorunsuz bir biçimde kravatını bağlayabilir, fakat nedense eliyle yazı yazamaz. Bu durumu açıklamaya yönelik kuramlar arasında kas kramplarından tutun da \"histerik felce\" kadar bir sürü görüş var. Fakat bu da bir tür öğrenilmiş felç örneği olabilir mi? Öyle ise ayna kullanmak gibi basit bir hile bu hastalarda kullanılabilir mi? Aynı sav, aleni felç ile uzvun hareket ettirilmesine isteksizlik –bir tür zihinsel engel- arasında uzanan diğer sendromlara da uygulanabilir mi? İdeomotor apraksi –hüner gerektiren hareketleri emirle yapamama (hasta bağımsız olarak mektup yazabilir, fakat yapması istenildiğinde çayın şekerini karıştıramaz veya güle güle demek için elini sallayamaz)- felçli hayalet uzvun öğrenilmesi anlamında kesinlikle \"öğrenilmemiştir\". Fakat bir tür geçici sinirsel engellemeye bağlı olabilir? Öyle ise, görsel geribildirim bu engeli aşmaya yardımcı olur mu? Son olarak da Parkinson hastalığı var; kaskatı kesilme, şiddetli titreme ve yüz de dâhil (maske benzeri ifade) tüm beden hareketlerinde azalma (akinezi) görülür. Bu hastalığın erken döneminde, kaskatı kesilme ve titreme sadece bir eli etkiler, dolayısıyla sağlam elin yansıması kullanılarak ayna tekniği denenebilir. Görsel geribildirimin Parkinson hastalığını etkilediği bilindiği için (örneğin, hasta normalde yürüyemez, ama zeminde siyah beyaz kareler varsa yürüyebilir), belki de ayna tekniği onlara da yardımcı olabilir.

Given the potential for the rapid development of oropharyngeal or laryngeal edema,66 immediate referral to a health professional with expertise in advanced airway placement is recommended (Class I, LOE C).\n\n【3】Circulation The intramuscular (IM) administration of epinephrine (epinephrine autoinjectors, eg, the EpiPen™) in the anterolateral aspect of the middle third of the thigh provides the highest peak blood levels.67 Absorption and subsequent achievement of maximum plasma concentration after subcutaneous administration is slower than the IM route and may be significantly delayed with shock.67\nEpinephrine68 should be administered early by IM injection to all patients with signs of a systemic allergic reaction, especially hypotension, airway swelling, or difficulty breathing (Class I, LOE C). The recommended dose is 0.2 to 0.5 mg (1:1000) IM to be repeated every 5 to 15 minutes in the absence of clinical improvement (Class I, LOE C).69 The adult epinephrine IM\nauto-injector will deliver 0.3 mg of epinephrine and the pediatric epinephrine IM auto-injector will deliver 0.15 mg of epinephrine. In both anaphylaxis and cardiac arrest the immediate use of an epinephrine autoinjector is recommended if available (Class I, LOE C).\n\n【4】## Acls Modifications\n\n【5】Airway Early recognition of the potential for a difficult airway in anaphylaxis is paramount in patients who develop hoarseness, lingual edema, stridor, or oropharyngeal swelling. Planning for advanced airway management, including a surgical airway,70 is recommended (Class I, LOE C).\n\n【6】Fluid Resuscitation In a prospective evaluation of volume resuscitation after diagnostic sting challenge, repeated administration of 1000-mL\nbolus doses of isotonic crystalloid (eg, normal saline) titrated to systolic blood pressure above 90 mm Hg was used successfully in patients whose hypotension did not respond immediately to vasoactive drugs.61,71 Vasogenic shock from anaphylaxis may require aggressive fluid resuscitation (Class IIa, LOE C).\n\n【7】Vasopressors There are no human trials establishing the role of epinephrine or preferred route of administration in anaphylactic shock managed by ACLS providers.68 In an animal study of profound anaphylactic shock, IV epinephrine restored blood pressure to baseline; however, the effect was limited to the first 15 minutes after shock, and no therapeutic effect was observed with the same dose of epinephrine administered IM or subcutaneously.72\nTherefore, when an IV line is in place, it is reasonable to consider the IV route as an alternative to IM administration of epinephrine in anaphylactic shock (Class IIa, LOE C).\n\n【8】For patients not in cardiac arrest, IV epinephrine 0.05 to 0.1\nmg (5% to 10% of the epinephrine dose used routinely in cardiac arrest) has been used successfully in patients with anaphylactic shock.73 Because fatal overdose of epinephrine has been reported,64,71,74,75 close hemodynamic monitoring is recommended\n(Class I, LOE B).\n\n【9】In a study of animals sensitized by ragweed, a continuous IV\ninfusion of epinephrine maintained a mean arterial pressure at 70% of preshock levels better than no treatment or bolus epinephrine treatment (IV, subcutaneous, or IM).76 Furthermore, a recent human study suggests that careful titration of a continuous infusion of IV epinephrine (5 to 15 mcg/min), based on severity of reaction and in addition to crystalloid infusion, may be considered in treatment of anaphylactic shock.71 Therefore, IV infusion of epinephrine is a reasonable alternative to IV boluses for treatment of anaphylaxis in patients not in cardiac arrest (Class IIa, LOE C) and may be considered in postarrest management (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【10】Recently vasopressin has been used successfully in patients with anaphylaxis (with or without cardiac arrest) who did not respond to standard therapy.77–79 Other small case series described successful results with administration of alternative\n-agonists such as norepinephrine,80 methoxamine,81,82 and metaraminol.83–85 Alternative vasoactive drugs (vasopressin, norepinephrine, methoxamine, and metaraminol) may be considered in cardiac arrest secondary to anaphylaxis that does not respond to epinephrine (Class IIb, LOE C). No randomized controlled trials have evaluated epinephrine versus the use of alternative vasoactive drugs for cardiac arrest due to anaphylaxis.\n\n【11】Other Interventions There are no prospective randomized clinical studies evaluating the use of other therapeutic agents in anaphylactic shock or cardiac arrest. Adjuvant use of antihistamines (H1 and H2\nantagonist),86,87 inhaled -adrenergic agents,88 and IV corticosteroids89 has been successful in management of the patient with anaphylaxis and may be considered in cardiac arrest due to anaphylaxis (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【12】Extracorporeal Support of Circulation Cardiopulmonary bypass has been successful in isolated case reports of anaphylaxis followed by cardiac arrest.90,91 Use of these advanced techniques may be considered in clinical situations where the required professional skills and equipment are immediately available (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【13】Part 12.3: Cardiac Arrest Associated With Pregnancy Scope of the Problem The Confidential Enquiries into Maternal and Child Health (CEMACH) data set constitutes the largest population-based data set on this target population.92 The overall maternal mortality rate was calculated at 13.95 deaths per 100 000 maternities. There were 8 cardiac arrests with a frequency calculated at 0.05 per 1000 maternities, or 1:20 000. The frequency of cardiac arrest in pregnancy is on the rise with previous reports estimating the frequency to be 1:30 000 maternities.93 Despite pregnant women being younger than the traditional cardiac arrest patient, the survival rates are poorer, with one case series reporting a survival rate of 6.9%.93,94\nDuring attempted resuscitation of a pregnant woman, providers have 2 potential patients: the mother and the fetus. The best hope of fetal survival is maternal survival. For the critically ill pregnant patient, rescuers must provide appropriate resuscitation based on consideration of the physiological changes caused by pregnancy.\n\n【14】Key Interventions to Prevent Arrest The following interventions are the standard of care for treating the critically ill pregnant patient (Class I, LOE C):", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care Science (Mary Fran Hazinski, John M.

Performance of these steps is inconsistent and time consuming. For this reason the *2010 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC* stress\nimmediate activation of the emergency response system and starting chest compressions for any unresponsive adult victim with no breathing or no normal breathing (ie, only gasps).\n●Encourage **Hands-Only (compression only) CPR** for the\nuntrained lay rescuer. Hands-Only CPR is easier to perform by those with no training and can be more readily guided by dispatchers over the telephone.\n●Initiate chest compressions before giving rescue breaths (C-\nA-B rather than A-B-C). Chest compressions can be started\nimmediately, whereas positioning the head, attaining a seal for mouth-to-mouth rescue breathing, or obtaining or assembling a bag-mask device for rescue breathing all take time. Beginning CPR with 30 compressions rather than 2 ventilations leads to a shorter delay to first compression.\n●There is an increased focus on methods to ensure that\nhigh-quality CPR is performed. Adequate chest compressions require that compressions be provided at the appropriate depth and rate, allowing complete recoil of the chest after each compression and an emphasis on minimizing any\npauses in compressions and avoiding excessive ventilation. Training should focus on ensuring that chest compressions are performed correctly. The recommended depth of compression for adult victims has increased from a depth of 11⁄2\nto 2 inches to a depth of at least 2 inches.\n●Many tasks performed by healthcare providers during resuscitation attempts, such as chest compressions, airway management, rescue breathing, rhythm detection, shock delivery, and drug administration (if appropriate), can be performed concurrently by an integrated team of highly trained rescuers in appropriate settings. Some resuscitations start with a lone rescuer who calls for help, resulting in the arrival of additional team members. Healthcare provider training should focus on building the team as each member arrives or quickly delegating roles if multiple rescuers are present. As additional personnel arrive, responsibilities for tasks that would ordinarily be performed sequentially by fewer rescuers may now be delegated to a team of providers who should perform them simultaneously.\n\n【3】## Key Points Of Continued Emphasis For The 2010 Aha Guidelines For Cpr And Ecc\n\n【4】●Early recognition of sudden cardiac arrest in adults is based\non assessing responsiveness and the absence of normal breathing. Victims of cardiac arrest may initially have gasping respirations or even appear to be having a seizure. These atypical presentations may confuse a rescuer, causing a delay in calling for help or beginning CPR. Training should focus on alerting potential rescuers to the unusual presentations of sudden cardiac arrest.\n●Minimize interruptions in effective chest compressions\nuntil ROSC or termination of resuscitative efforts. Any unnecessary interruptions in chest compressions (including longer than necessary pauses for rescue breathing) decreases CPR effectiveness.\n●Minimize the importance of pulse checks by healthcare\nproviders. Detection of a pulse can be difficult, and even highly trained healthcare providers often incorrectly assess the presence or absence of a pulse when blood pressure is abnormally low or absent.

The maxillary teeth tend to incline toward the palate causing a unilateral posterior cross bite without a deviation of the dental midline, meanwhile, the mandibular tissues are not affected because it is a mobile bone and escapes the pressure by sliding.(23) \nWhen a shift of the midline is present, the cause of the cross bite will not be the posture habit but a mandibular shift caused probably by a premature contact of the deciduous canines (functional or false posterior cross bite) (please refer to Cross Bite chapter). \n\n【4】## Correction\n\n【5】For the correction of a posture habit, the use of a Hawley plate with a buccal grill on the side where the cross bite is being produced is indicated. This appliance will serve as a reminder to the patient, and whenever the patient leans the head on the hand or the arm, they will squeeze the cheek against this grill. \n\n【6】For the correction of true unilateral cross bites in the permanent dentition, we can use \"z\" 1/8\" diameter elastics, from the palatine aspects of the upper teeth to the buccal aspects of the lower teeth on the side where the cross bite is located (please refer to Cross Bite chapter). \n\n【7】Now then, if the unilateral cross bite is in the deciduous dentition, it can be corrected with a plate with a unilateral expansion screw. \n\n【8】## Mouth Breathing Habit\n\n【9】Normal breathing, also called nasal breathing, is the one in which the air flows freely through the nose with a simultaneous closure of the oral cavity, therefore creating a negative pressure between the tongue and the hard palate at the moment of aspiration; the tongue is elevated and it leans against the palate, exerting a positive development stimuli. When the patient breathes through the mouth the tongue adopts a descendant position to allow the flow of air. Oral breathing is normally associated to patients with lingual and lip interposition. \n\n【10】During mouth breathing, the air passes through the oral cavity, and as a consequence, an increase of pressure in the intraoral area is produced. The palate becomes deeper, and at the same time, because air does not flow through the nasal cavity, the maxillary sinuses become atresic, giving the patient a characteristic aspect (long face or adenoid fasciae) .(23) \nWhen the infant is bottle fed, the infant must be in an upright position, in order to avoid breathing problems, that could bring, as a consequence the habit of mouth breathing.

This is the only force system capable of producing pure rotation of a body around its center of resistance.(14) In this case the tooth maintains its position because both forces annul each other since both lines of force act at a same distance perpendicular to the center of resistance, leaving only the pure Moment (pure rotation).(5) \n\n【3】## ,What Is Static Equilibrium?\n\n【4】In order to have static equilibrium in an orthodontic system, three basic criteria must be met: \n1. \nThat the sum of \nall *vertical* forces that act in the system \nbe equal to O. \n2. \nThat the sum of all *horizontal* forces that act in the \nsystem be equal to O. \n3. \nThat the sum of \nthe moments that can act in any point \nbe equal to O. (6,11) \nClearly understanding the basic concepts of orthodontic biomechanics and the physiology of dental movement, we shall now analyze the different actions and reactions that can happen during the different stages of orthodontic treatment and select, apply and control in an efficient manner the force systems that will be utilized. \n\n【5】## Action And Reaction\n\n【6】The third law of Newton applies in almost all orthodontic movements; the law of Action and Reaction, which states that to every action there is always opposing and equal reaction. Sometimes the reaction to a movement results in an unwanted movement. \n\n【7】Another example of the third law of Newton would be when we want to align intruded or extruded teeth, where the same force produced to make these movements will be applied on the surrounding teeth provoking a movement in opposite direction to the one we want to produce. \n\n【8】In order to determine the action of a bend, we must know where we are going to put it, this way we can identify what type of forces are going to be applied and the moments we can expect with the bends on a determined group of teeth. \n\n【9】The easiest way to determine the direction of a movement of a bend made on an arch wire is to put it in a passive manner in the slots of two braces, and we will observe where the arch is headed to, so that when we activate the wire, placing it in the slots, we can predict the direction of the movement to take place. (I) \nIn thes~ images we can observe the direction where the arch wire is going when it is placed in the slot of the brace of the central incisor in a passive way, and what movements we can expect once the arch is activated. In this case, as soon as we insert the arch in the slot of the brace on the lateral incisor, this tooth will be intruded and the central incisor will extrude (action and reaction: third law of Newton). \n\n【10】In the next set of images, the same case is presented but seen from another perspective; the arch wire is passive in the slot of the lateral incisor and the bend is over the brace of the central incisor; when activated, it is going to produce the same movements, extrusion of the central incisor and intrusion of the lateral incisor. \n\n【11】Both examples are useful in order to predict the direction of dental movements produced by the forces of the arch wire. Now we have to know where to place the bend so we can identify over which teeth we want to place the force. \n\n【12】If a bend is located far from the center of the arch wire, we will have two segments, a short one and a long one, that will produce equal forces in different directions. When the short segment of the bend is inserted in the tube, the long segment will indicate us the direction of the force produced over the teeth that are going to receive this segment. In this case, what is produced is what we call force equilibrium, where equal and opposed forces with different moments take place, being the greater moment the side that receives the shorter segment of the bend. (1,4,7) \nOn the contrary, if the bend is located in the center of the arch wire, between both teeth, the forces that are produced cancel one another when the wire is inserted in the slot of the braces. In this case the system is in equilibrium, because the associated forces are equal and opposed and cancel each other. This type of centered bend is only going to produce equal moments that are going to oppose each other.(1,4,1\n2\n) ", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/1001 tips for orthodontics and its secrets (Esequiel E.

Intel, the company that has served as the standard bearer for Moore's law, has waged a five-year crusade to develop a method of printing circuit patterns on chips that could take the reigning CMOS chip technology until circuits can be made no smaller, the last data point on the Moore curve.\n\n【4】These new lithographic machines for making billion-transistor microprocessors will mark one of the most spectacular forays into the realm of nanotechnology, the precise manipulation of matter at the scale of a few billionths of a meter. The Intel-nurtured technology—extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV)—has recently created one of its first images of a whole chip at a Department of Energy laboratory set up to engineer nuclear weapons.

The popular press sensationalized the findings by suggesting that synthetic bugs might soon be crawling out of test tubes. The scientific community was more restrained, but many workers sensed that the major obstacle to creating life in the laboratory had been solved.\n\n【3】It did not take long to disabuse researchers of that notion. Miller may have discovered a way to make many of life's building blocks out of the earth's early supply of water and gas, but he had not discovered how or where these simple units would have linked into the complex molecular structures—such as proteins and DNA—that are intrinsic to life. \n\n【4】To answer that riddle, Miller and other origins scientists began proposing rocks as props. They speculated that organic molecules, floating in seawater, might have splashed into tidal pools along rocky coastlines. These molecules would have become increasingly concentrated through repeated cycles of evaporation, like soup thickening in a heated pot.\n\n【5】In recent years, however, researchers have envisioned that life's ingredients might have accumulated in much smaller containers. Some rocks, like gray volcanic pumice, are laced with air pockets created when gases expanded inside the rock while it was still molten. Many common minerals, such as feldspar, develop microscopic pits during weathering. Each tiny chamber in each rock on the early earth could have housed a separate experiment in molecular self-organization. Given enough time and enough chambers, serendipity might have produced a combination of molecules that would eventually deserve to be called \"living.\"\nUnderlying much of this speculation was the sense that life was so fragile that it depended on rocks for survival.

That view began to change when deepocean explorers first encountered diverse ecosystems thriving at the superheated mouths of volcanic vents on the seafloor. These extreme environments manage to support elaborate communities of living creatures in isolation from the sun.

We can identify this malocclusion when the lower teeth are in a buccal or labial position in regard to the upper teeth, in a unilateraL \nbilateraL anterior and/or posterior mannery ,24,22,31) These malocclusions can have a skeletal or dental component or a inix of both, they are relatively easy to treat if they are intercepted at an early age; doing so can avoid the need for surgical correction in the future.(7,24) \nAt the transversal leveL a normal occlusion is considered as such when the palatine cusps of the upper molars and premolars occlude in the main fossas of the lower molars and premolars. At the **anteroposterior** leveL the occlusion is considered normal when the upper incisors occlude on the buccal aspects of the lower incisors; thus, a posterior and anterior overbite exists, meaning that, the upper teeth must cover the lower teeth. \n\n【5】(\n1\n6) \nWe can divide this type of malocclusion in: \n\n【6】1. \nSagittal type cross bite (anterior cross bite). \n2. \nTransversal type cross bite (posterior cross bite). \nIn this chapter we will discuss the many treatment options for the correction of this malocclusion. \n\n【7】## Anterior Cross Bite\n\n【8】Anterior cross bite is one of the most common orthodontic problems in growing patients. It generally occurs in the primary and mixed dentition as 1:he result of a disharmony in the skeletaL functional and dental components of the child.

The EMS provider checks for 3 physical findings: facial droop, arm weakness, and speech abnormalities. The presence of a single abnormality on the CPSS has a sensitivity of 59% and a specificity of 89% when scored by prehospital providers.33 Another assessment tool, the LAPSS, requires that the provider rule out other causes of altered level of consciousness (eg, history of seizures, hypoglycemia) and then identify asymmetry in any of 3 examination categories: facial smile or grimace, grip, and arm strength. The LAPSS has a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 97%.35,36\nWith standard training in stroke recognition, paramedics demonstrated a sensitivity of 61% to 66% for identifying patients with stroke.34,37,38 After receiving training in use of a stroke assessment tool, paramedic sensitivity for identifying patients with stroke increased to 86% to 97%.36,39,40 We recommend that all paramedics and emergency medical technicians-basic (EMT-basic) be trained in recognition of stroke using a validated, abbreviated out-of-hospital screening tool such as the CPSS or LAPSS (Class I, LOE B).\n\n【3】Prehospital Management and Triage (Box 2)\nAs with any other time-sensitive acute illness, prehospital providers must perform an initial assessment and intervene if necessary to provide cardiopulmonary support. In addition, for stroke, providers must clearly establish the time of onset of symptoms. This time represents time zero for the patient. If the patient wakes from sleep or is found with symptoms of a stroke, the time of onset of symptoms is defined as the last time the patient was observed to be normal. EMS providers must be able to support cardiopulmonary function, perform rapid stroke assessment, establish time of onset of symptoms\n(or the last time the patient was known to be normal), triage and transport the patient, and provide prearrival notification to the most appropriate receiving hospital.31,41–44\nPatients with acute stroke are at risk for respiratory compromise from aspiration, upper airway obstruction, hypoventilation, and (rarely) neurogenic pulmonary edema. The combination of poor perfusion and hypoxemia will exacerbate and extend ischemic brain injury and has been associated with worse outcome from stroke.45 Both out-of-hospital and in-hospital medical personnel should administer supplemental oxygen to hypoxemic (ie, oxygen saturation 94%) stroke patients (Class I, LOE C) or those with unknown oxygen saturation.\n\n【4】Although blood pressure management is a component of the ED care of stroke patients, there are no data to support initiation of hypertension intervention in the prehospital environment. Unless the patient is hypotensive (systolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg), prehospital intervention for blood pressure is not recommended (Class III, LOE C).\n\n【5】Transport and Destination Hospital EMS providers should consider transporting a witness, family member, or caregiver with the patient to verify the time of stroke symptom onset. En route to the facility, providers should continue to support cardiopulmonary function, monitor neurologic status, check blood glucose if possible, and provide prehospital notification.\n\n【6】Prearrival hospital notification by the transporting EMS\nunit has been found to significantly increase the percentage of patients with acute stroke who receive fibrinolytic therapy.46–48 Bypass of community hospitals in favor of transporting patients directly to a stroke center has undergone investigations that merit attention. Investigators in New York, Canada, Italy, and Australia have performed before-and-after studies examining the difference in rates of rtPA administration after implementation of a hospital bypass protocol for EMS. All have found significantly larger percentages of patients with ischemic stroke treated with rtPA when patients are transported directly to stroke centers.47,49,50 Recently investigators have begun to examine the impact of direct activation of stroke teams by EMS.50,51\nEMS providers must rapidly deliver the patient to a medical facility capable of providing acute stroke care and provide prearrival notification to the receiving facility.41,46,48 Each receiving hospital should define its capability for treating patients with acute stroke using the definitions established for strokeprepared hospitals, primary stroke centers, and comprehensive stroke centers3,6,7 and should communicate this information to the EMS system and the community. Although not every hospital is capable of organizing the necessary resources to safely administer fibrinolytic therapy, every hospital with an ED should have a written plan that is communicated to EMS systems describing how patients with acute stroke are to be managed in that institution. The plan should detail the roles of healthcare professionals in the care of patients with acute stroke and define which patients will be treated with fibrinolytic therapy at that facility and when transfer to another hospital with a dedicated stroke unit is appropriate.\n\n【7】The role of stroke centers and in particular stroke units continues to be defined, but a growing body of evidence47,49,50,52–58 indicates a favorable benefit from triage of stroke patients directly to designated stroke centers (Class I, LOE B). EMS systems should establish a stroke destination preplan to enable EMS providers to direct patients with acute stroke to appropriate facilities. When multiple stroke hospitals are within similar transport distances, EMS personnel should consider triage to the stroke center with the highest capability of stroke care.\n\n【8】Multiple randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses in adults50,59–62 document consistent improvement in 1-year survival rate, functional outcome, and quality of life when patients hospitalized with acute stroke are cared for in a dedicated stroke unit by a multidisciplinary team experienced in managing stroke. Although the studies reported were conducted outside the United States at in-hospital units that provided both acute care and rehabilitation, the improved outcomes were apparent very early in stroke care. These results should be relevant to the outcome of dedicated stroke units staffed with experienced multidisciplinary teams in the United States. When such a facility is available within a reasonable transport interval, stroke patients who require hospitalization should be admitted there (Class I, LOE B).\n\n【9】In-Hospital Care Initial ED Assessment and Stabilization (Box 3)\nProtocols should be used in the ED to minimize delay to definitive diagnosis and therapy: \"Time is Brain.\"43 As a goal, ED personnel should assess the patient with suspected stroke within 10 minutes of arrival in the ED. General care includes assessment, cardiopulmonary support (airway, breathing, circulation), and evaluation of baseline vital signs. Administration of oxygen to hypoxemic patients with stroke\n(oxygen saturation 94%) is recommended (Class I, LOE C).\n\n【10】On arrival ED personnel should establish or confirm IV\naccess and obtain blood samples for baseline studies (eg, complete blood count, coagulation studies, blood glucose). If not already identified in the prehospital setting, ED staff should promptly identify and treat hypoglycemia. The ED physician should perform a neurologic screening assessment, order an emergent computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain, and activate the stroke team or arrange for consultation with a stroke expert.\n\n【11】A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) does not take priority over the CT scan but may identify a recent acute myocardial infarction or arrhythmias (eg, atrial fibrillation) as the cause of an embolic stroke. If the patient is hemodynamically stable, treatment of other arrhythmias, including bradycardia, premature atrial or ventricular contractions, or asymptomatic atrioventricular conduction block, may not be necessary.63\nThere is general agreement to recommend cardiac monitoring during the first 24 hours of evaluation in patients with acute ischemic stroke to detect atrial fibrillation and potentially life-threatening arrhythmias.64\nAssessment (Box 4)\nThe treating physician should review the patient's history and verify time of onset of symptoms.65–67 This may require interviewing out-of-hospital providers, witnesses, and family members to establish the time that the patient was last known to be normal.

Auscultation requires a stethoscope. As described in Question 15, the examiner will ask the patient to inhale and exhale deeply and regularly during auscultation. The presence or absence of wheezing is especially significant. After the history and the physical exam are completed, the doctor will be able to generate a list of diagnostic possibilities, called \"the differential diagnosis.\" The doctor's \"clinical impression\" rates the possible diagnoses in order of likelihood. Sometimes it may be obvious to the doctor that asthma is present. If not, and if asthma is high on the list of possible explanations for a patient's symptoms, then additional diagnostic testing is often obtained (Table 9).\n\n【1】## 27. What Diagnostic Tests Are Used To Help Diagnose Asthma?\n\n【2】The most helpful diagnostic tests for asthma are pulmonary function tests, often referred to as PFTs (discussed in Question 28). Other useful tests include blood tests and X-ray studies. Additional, more specialized studies may be indicated. An example of a specialized study is skin-prick testing for suspected allergy. Blood tests are useful in getting an overall picture of a person's health, as well as in excluding other diagnoses. Assessment of immune function and allergies, for example, can be performed in part via blood testing. X-ray studies include conventional chest X-rays, as well as three-dimensional chest CT (computed tomography) scans. Chest X-rays and CT scans provide information about the anatomy or structure of the lungs and larger breathing passages. In quiescent, controlled asthma, the chest X-ray should be entirely normal. The same is true of the chest CT scan. During an exacerbation, however, the lungs' appearance on an X-ray may suggest what radiologists call \"hyperinflation,\" and the CT might reveal \"air-trapping.\" Both findings reflect the uneven lung filling and emptying when breathing occurs through inflamed, constricted air tubes. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scanning and PET (positron emission tomography) scanning, while useful in other types of lung diseases, are not required in asthma. The same is true of nuclear medicine scans, such as ventilation-perfusion scans, and gallium scans.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/100 Questions and Answers About Asthma (Claudia S.

Chopping\n\n【2】other animals, however, they mark bones with more than just their teeth. They process carcasses with tools of stone or metal. In so doing, they leave imprints of their presence and actions in the form of scars on the bones. These same imprints can be seen on butchered human skeletal remains.\n\n【3】The key to recognizing human cannibalism is to identify the patterns of processing—that is, the cut marks, hammering damage, fractures or burns seen on the remains—as well as the survival of different bones and parts of bones. Nutritionally valuable tissues, such as brains and marrow, reside within the bones and can be removed only with forceful hammering—and such forced entry leaves revealing patterns of bone damage. When human bones from archaeological sites show patterns of damage uniquely linked to butchery by other humans, the infertice from Papua New Guinea, where cannibalism was recorded ethnographically, illustrates this point. There skulls of the deceased were carefully cleaned and the brains removed. The dry, mostly intact skulls were then handled extensively, often creating a polish on their projecting parts. They were sometimes painted and even mounted on poles for display and worship. Soft tissue, including brain matter, was eaten at the beginning of this process; thus, the practice would be identified as ritual cannibalism. If such skulls were encountered in an archaeological context without modern informants describing the cannibalism, they would not constitute direct evidence for cannibalism under the stringent criteria that my colleagues and I advocate.\n\n【4】Nevertheless, adoption of these standards of evidence has led us to some clear determinations in other, older situations. The best indication of prehistoric cannibalism now comes from the archaeological record of the American Southwest, where archaeologists have interpreted dozens of assemblages of human remains as providing evidence of cannibalism. Compelling evidence has also been found in Neolithic and Bronze Age Europe. Even Europe's earliest hominid site has yielded convincing evidence of cannibalism.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/(2001-08) Cyber Cells (Scientific American) (Z-Library).pdf", "page_num": [51], "text_type": [[{"text": "One of the challenges facing archaeologists is the amazing", "types": "Section-header"}, {"text": "variety of ways in which people dispose of their dead.", "types": "Section-header"}, {"text": "CHOPPING", "types": "Section-header"}], [{"text": "other animals, however, they mark bones", "types": "Text"}, {"text": "with more than just their teeth.

Hold for one breath, and exhale to lower.\n\n【1】2\nInhale to raise both arms, palms up and fingers apart. Tense your arm muscles. Hold for one breath, then exhale as you take the arms back down.\n\n【2】3\nClench your fists and breathe in as you hunch your shoulders up and raise your arms off the floor. Hold for one breath, then exhale to release.\n\n【3】4\nLie completely relaxed. Free your mind of all concerns. Each time you breathe out, focus on the tension leaving your body. Rest for a few minutes.\n\n【4】5\nAt the end of your relaxation, bend your knees and roll to one side. Rest a while, then use the hands to push the upper body off the floor and into a kneeling position. \n\n【5】USING MEDITATION\nAlthough meditation is perfectly suited to everyone, it is particularly beneficial for those who have busy lives, either because of stressful jobs or because of a vast array of family and household commitments. Meditation helps calm the overactive mind, thereby reenergizing you, increasing your stamina, and improving your powers of concentration. Through the regular use of meditation, it is within your grasp to create a sense of inner peace and have a clear mind. \n\n【6】WHERE & WHEN TO MEDITATE\nYou are free to meditate wherever you are comfortable, but there are some considerations to bear in mind. If you choose to meditate indoors, pick a room that is warm, clutter-free, and away from distracting noises. If you go outside, find somewhere with as little activity as possible but where you are safe and able to relax fully. Meditation can be practiced at any time of day or night, but it is easier to train your mind if you are able to set a regular time slot.\n\n【7】WHAT IS MEDITATION?\n\n【8】A good way to grasp the real essence of true meditation is to consider a lake. Think about how you can clearly see the bottom of the lake when the surface is still. However, when there are a lot of waves, you are unable to see much below the surface at all. This is the perfect analogy for the mind: when your mind is still, you are better able to experience inner calm.\n\n【9】MEDITATING TOGETHER \nYou do not have to meditate alone. It can be done in pairs or even in larger groups. Mass meditations are often held around the world.\n\n【10】MEDITATION \nPOSITION\nTo allow yourself to meditate correctly without any distractions it is important to take a comfortable sitting pose. Your legs should be crossed, and your spine should be straight. Keep your shoulders straight but relaxed. This is an easy, natural pose for children, but adults may require some assistance. If you feel any tension in your lower back, try sitting on the front edge of a cushion. \n\n【11】YOGIC BREATHING\nCorrect breathing is a key part of meditation and concentration. First, oxygenate your brain with 5 minutes of deep abdominal breathing. Next, slow down but still breathe rhythmically, in for 3 seconds, then out for 3 seconds.\n\n【12】HAND POSITIONS\nThe hand positions shown below are all used in meditation. Make your hands as comfortable as you can; this helps you relax. Resting your hands on your knees or in your lap also helps keep the back and shoulders straight.\n\n【13】HANDS CUPPED\nPlace one hand on top of the other, palms up, and place them in your lap.\n\n【14】HANDS CLASPED \nInterlock your fingers gently, and lay your hands in your lap.\n\n【15】CHIN MUDRA \nForm a circle from your thumb and index finger, and rest the hands on your knees.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/101 Essential Tips Yoga (Dorling Kindersley (DK)) (Z-Library).pdf", "page_num": [68], "text_type": [[{"text": "1", "types": "List-item"}], [{"text": "Inhale, raising your ", "types": "Text"}, {"text": "arms by about 1 ", "types": "Text"}, {"text": "ft ", "types": "Text"}, {"text": "(30 ", "types": "Text"}, {"text": "cm).

In these studies ACE inhibitors were not administered in the presence of hypotension (SBP 100 mm Hg or\n30 mm Hg below baseline). The beneficial effects are most pronounced in patients with anterior infarction, pulmonary congestion, or LV ejection fraction 40%.\n\n【3】Administration of an oral ACE inhibitor is recommended within the first 24 hours after onset of symptoms in STEMI patients with pulmonary congestion or LV ejection fraction\n40%, in the absence of hypotension (SBP 100 mm Hg or\n30 mm Hg below baseline) (Class I, LOE A). Oral ACE inhibitor therapy can also be useful for all other patients with AMI with or without early reperfusion therapy (Class IIa, LOE B). IV administration of ACE inhibitors is contraindicated in the first 24 hours because of risk of hypotension (Class III, LOE C).\n\n【4】ACE Inhibitors in the Prehospital Setting Despite multiple studies that have shown a benefit of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in patients with a myocardial infarction when therapy is started during the first 24 hours of the index hospitalization, no trial specifically evaluates patients in the ED or prehospital settings. An older randomized trial showed a reduction in mortality with an increased risk of hypotension in patients treated soon after presentation in the inpatient setting.183 Several trials showed a reduction in the rate of heart failure and mortality in patients treated soon after fibrinolysis,363–365 and several others showed no benefit with the early or prehospital use of angiotensin converting enzyme.364,366,367\nIn conclusion, although ACE inhibitors and ARBs have been shown to reduce long-term risk of mortality in patients suffering an AMI, there is insufficient evidence to support the routine initiation of ACE inhibitors and ARBs in the prehospital or ED setting (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【5】HMG Coenzyme A Reductase Inhibitors (Statins)\nA variety of studies documented consistent reduction in indicators of inflammation and complications such as reinfarction, recurrent angina, and arrhythmias when statin treatment is administered within a few days after onset of an ACS.368–371 There is little data to suggest that this therapy should be initiated within the ED; however, early initiation (within 24 hours of presentation) of statin therapy is recommended in patients with an ACS or AMI (Class I, LOE C). If patients are already on statin therapy, continue the therapy (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【6】An increase in short-term mortality and incidence of major adverse cardiac events have been reported with discontinuation of statin treatment in ACS patients at hospital admission. Statins should not be discontinued during the index hospitalization unless contraindicated (Class III, LOE C).372–381\nPretreatment with statins in patients undergoing elective percutaneous angioplasty for stable angina or hemodynamicaly stable ACS has been shown to significantly reduce biomarkers of myocardial necrosis or inflammation compared to placebo when given between 3 and 7 days prior to the procedure.382,383\nFurthermore, pretreatment with atorvastatin 80 mg 12\nhours before and an additional 40 mg immediately before PCI for NSTEMI or documented ischemia has been shown to significantly decrease the 30 day composite of death, MI, and unplanned revascularization compared to placebo in a prospective randomized trial. There were no deaths in any of the two groups and the primary end point was driven by periprocedural myocardial infarction in concordance to the previously published studies.384\nIn conclusion, intensive (target LDL values optimally 70\nmg/dL) statin treatment should be initiated within the first 24 hours after onset of an ACS event (eg, immediately after hospital admission) in all patients presenting with any form of ACS unless strictly contraindicated (eg, by proven intolerance) (Class I, LOE A).\n\n【7】It is reasonable to use statin pretreatment for patients who will be undergoing elective or urgent angioplasty in order to decrease perioperative myocardial infarction. There are no reports on risk or safety considerations of early initiation of statin treatment in ACS.\n\n【8】Glucose-Insulin-Potassium Although glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) therapy was formerly thought to reduce the chance of mortality during AMI by several mechanisms, recent clinical trials found that GIK\ndid not show any benefit in STEMI.385,386 At this time there is little evidence to suggest that this intervention is helpful (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【9】Management of Arrhythmias This section discusses management of arrhythmias during acute ischemia and infarction.\n\n【10】Ventricular Rhythm Disturbances Treatment of ventricular arrhythmias during and after AMI has been a controversial topic for three decades. Primary VF accounts for the majority of early deaths during AMI.387–389 The incidence of primary VF is highest during the first 4\nhours after onset of symptoms28,390–392 but remains an important contributor to mortality during the first 24 hours. Secondary VF occurring in the setting of CHF or cardiogenic shock can also contribute to death from AMI. VF is a less common cause of death in the hospital setting with the use of fibrinolytics and percutaneous revascularization as early reperfusion strategies. Broad use of -blockers also contributes significantly in the reduction of VF incidence in the after AMI.\n\n【11】Although prophylaxis with lidocaine reduces the incidence of VF, an analysis of data from ISIS-3 and a meta-analysis suggest that lidocaine increased all-cause mortality rates.393\nThus, the practice of prophylactic administration of lidocaine is not recommended (Class III, LOE A).\n\n【12】Sotalol has not been adequately studied (Class IIb, LOE C). Amiodarone in a single RCT did not appear to improve survival in low doses and may increase mortality in high doses when used early in patients with suspected myocardial infarction (Class IIb, LOE C).394\nTwenty published studies including 14 RCTs and 4\nmeta-analyses/reviews provide no good evidence that prophylactic antiarrhythmics improve outcomes (survival to discharge, 30/60 day mortality) and despite a documented decrease in the incidence of malignant ventricular arrhythmias, they may cause harm. Therefore prophylactic antiarrhythmics are not recommended for patients with suspected ACS or myocardial infarction in the prehospital or ED (Class III, LOE A).\n\n【13】Routine IV administration of -blockers to patients without hemodynamic or electric contraindications is associated with a reduced incidence of primary VF (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【14】Low serum potassium, but not magnesium, has been associated with ventricular arrhythmias. It is prudent clinical practice to maintain serum potassium 4 mEq/L and magnesium 2 mEq/L (Class IIB, LOE A).\n\n【15】Routine administration of magnesium to patients with MI\nhas no significant clinical mortality benefit, particularly in patients receiving fibrinolytic therapy.183 ISIS-4 enrolled\n58 000 patients and showed a trend toward increased mortality rates when magnesium was given in-hospital for primary prophylaxis to patients within the first 4 hours of known or suspected AMI.\n\n【16】Following an episode of VF, there is no conclusive data to support the use of lidocaine or any particular strategy for preventing VF recurrence. Further management of ventricular rhythm disturbances is discussed in Part 8.2: \"Management of Cardiac Arrest\" and Part 8.3: \"Management of Symptomatic Bradycardia and Tachycardia.\"\nSummary There has been tremendous progress in reducing disability and death from ACS. But many patients still die before reaching the hospital because patients and family members fail to recognize the signs of ACS and fail to activate the EMS system. Once the patient with ACS contacts the healthcare system, providers must focus on support of cardiorespiratory function, rapid transport, and early classification of the patient based on ECG characteristics. Patients with STEMI\nrequire prompt reperfusion; the shorter the interval from symptom onset to reperfusion, the greater the benefit. In the STEMI population, mechanical reperfusion with percutaenous coronary intervention improves survival and decreases major cardiovascular events compared to fibrinolysis. Patients with UA/NSTEMI (non-STEMI ACS) or nonspecific or normal ECGs require risk stratification and appropriate monitoring and therapy. Healthcare providers can improve survival rates and myocardial function of patients with ACS by providing skilled, efficient, and coordinated out-ofhospital and in-hospital care.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care Science (Mary Fran Hazinski, John M.

Dispatchers may also instruct untrained bystanders in the performance of compression-only (Hands-Only) CPR.\n●BLS skills can be learned equally well with \"practice while\nwatching\" (video-based) training as through longer, traditional instructor-led courses.\n●To reduce the time to defibrillation for cardiac arrest\nvictims, AED use should not be limited only to persons with formal training in their use. However, AED training does improve performance in simulation and continues to be recommended.\n●Training in teamwork and leadership skills should continue\nto be included in ALS courses.\n●Manikins with realistic features such as the capability to\nreplicate chest expansion and breath sounds, generate a pulse and blood pressure, and speak may be useful for integrating the knowledge, skills, and behaviors required in ALS training. However, there is insufficient evidence to recommend their routine use in ALS courses.\n●Written tests should not be used exclusively to assess the\ncompetence of a participant in an advanced life support (ACLS or PALS) course (ie, there needs to be a performance assessment as well).\n●Formal assessment should continue to be included in\nresuscitation courses, both as a method of evaluating the success of the student in achieving the learning objectives and of evaluating the effectiveness of the course.\n●The current 2-year certification period for basic and advanced life support courses should include periodic assessment of rescuer knowledge and skills with reinforcement provided as needed. The optimal timing and method for this assessment and reinforcement are not known and warrant further investigation.\n●CPR prompt and feedback devices may be useful for training\nrescuers and may be useful as part of an overall strategy to improve the quality of CPR for actual cardiac arrests.\n●Debriefing is a learner-focused, nonthreatening technique\nto assist individual rescuers or teams to reflect on and improve performance. Debriefing should be included in\nadvanced life support courses to facilitate learning and can be used to review performance in the clinical setting to improve subsequent performance.\n●Systems-based approaches to improving resuscitation performance, such as regional systems of care and rapid response systems, may be useful to reduce the variability of survival for cardiac arrest.\nFirst Aid Once again, a review of the literature on many topics relevant to first aid found that little investigation is being carried out in this field, and many recommendations have had to be extrapolated from research published in related fields. The following are new recommendations or reinforcements of previous recommendations.\n\n【1】●Evidence suggests that, without training, laypersons and\nsome healthcare professionals may be unable to recognize the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis. Therefore, initial or subsequent administration of epinephrine for anaphylaxis by either of these groups may be problematic. This issue takes on added importance in view of legislation permitting the practice in some jurisdictions.\n●Except in diving decompression injuries, there is no evidence of any benefit of administration of oxygen by first aid providers.\n●The administration of aspirin by a first aid provider to a\nvictim experiencing chest discomfort is problematic. The literature is clear on the benefit of early administration of aspirin to victims experiencing a coronary ischemic event except when there is a contraindication, such as true aspirin allergy or a bleeding disorder. Less clear, however, is whether first aid providers can recognize the signs and symptoms of an acute coronary syndrome or contraindications to aspirin and whether administration of aspirin by first aid providers delays definitive therapy in an advanced medical facility.\n●No evidence of benefit was found for placing an unresponsive victim who is breathing in a \"recovery\" position. Studies performed with volunteers appear to show that if a victim is turned because of emesis or copious secretions, the HAINES (High Arm IN Endangered Spine) position is an example of a recovery position that may have some theoretic advantages.\n●Since 2005 considerable new data have emerged on the use of\ntourniquets to control bleeding. This experience comes primarily from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan. There is no question that tourniquets do control bleeding, but if left on too long, they can cause gangrene distal to the application and systemic complications, including shock and death. Protocols\nfor the proper use of tourniquets to control bleeding exist, but there is no experience with civilian use or how to teach the proper application of tourniquets to first aid providers. Studies have shown that not all tourniquets are the same, and some manufactured tourniquets perform better than others and better than tourniquets that are improvised.\n●Because of its importance, the issue of spinal stabilization\nwas once again reviewed. Unfortunately very little new data are available, and it is still not clear whether secondary spinal cord injury is a real problem and whether the\nmethods recommended for spinal stabilization or movement restriction are effective.\n●The literature regarding first aid for snake bites was once\nagain reviewed. In the 2005 review evidence was found for a beneficial effect from pressure immobilization for neurotoxic snake bites, but it now appears that there is a benefit even for non-neurotoxic snake bites. The challenge is that the range of pressure needed under the immobilization bandage appears to be critical and may be difficult to teach or estimate in the field.\n●A new section on jellyfish stings has been added and new\nrecommendations for treatment have been made.\n●The literature on the first aid treatment of frostbite was\nreviewed. There continues to be evidence of potential harm in thawing of a frozen body part if there is any chance of refreezing. The literature is mixed on the benefit of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents as a first aid treatment for frostbite. Chemical warmers should not be used because they may generate temperatures capable of causing tissue injury.\n●Oral fluid replacement has been found to be as effective as\nIV fluid in exercise- or heat-induced dehydration.

Technically, COPD refers in a general way to several different lung conditions that demonstrate an abnormality on spirometry, a type of pulmonary function test. The abnormality that characterizes COPD is called \"obstructive dysfunction.\" Several different lung conditions typically exhibit the obstructive dysfunction pattern of abnormality on pulmonary function testing. They include emphysema, chronic obstructive bronchitis, exacerbated asthma, and bronchiectasis. The two first diseases, in particular, share several features. Both emphysema and chronic obstructive bronchitis are associated with cigarette smoking. Both exhibit obstructive dysfunction on spirometry that does not completely reverse with medication, and thus demonstrate a \"fixed\" or \"irreversible\" type of obstructive dysfunction. Both cause respiratory symptoms such as breathlessness or cough. Interestingly, emphysema and chronic obstructive bronchitis frequently coexist in the same person, usually a current or former cigarette smoker.

Sayre, Co-Chair*; Robert E. O'Connor, Co-Chair*; Dianne L. Atkins; John E. Billi;\nClifton W. Callaway; Michael Shuster; Brian Eigel; William H. Montgomery; Robert W. Hickey;\nIan Jacobs; Vinay M. Nadkarni; Peter T. Morley; Tanya I. Semenko; Mary Fran Hazinski E\nvidence-based medicine integrates the best available evidence and clinical expertise to deliver the finest possible patient care.1 The victim of cardiac arrest requires immediate action, and potential rescuers must be ready to respond. Evidence must be compiled, analyzed, and discussed; clear recommendations must be established prior to the patient encounter. The 2010 American Heart Association\n(AHA) Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and Emergency Cardiovascular Care (ECC) (2010 AHA\nGuidelines for CPR and ECC) are based on a transparent, expert review of scientific evidence, informed by the clinical expertise of the writing teams. These guidelines are designed to provide rescuers and clinicians with a strategy for action that can save lives from cardiac arrest. Clinicians should always apply these evidence-based guidelines in combination with clinical judgment.\n\n【2】The International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation\n(ILCOR), an international consortium of many of the world's resuscitation councils, was formed in 1992, in part to collect, discuss, and debate scientific data on resuscitation. The majority of ILCOR's work focuses on reviewing published, peer-reviewed evidence on resuscitation to produce sciencebased consensus summaries.2 As one of ILCOR's member councils, the AHA transforms international scientific consensus statements into periodic revisions of the AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC.\n\n【3】During production of the 1992 AHA Guidelines for CPR\nand ECC, an evidence evaluation process was developed to guide topic experts in conducting a thorough evidence review, distilling the evidence, and producing treatment recommendations. This evidence evaluation process was revised in 2000, when an international set of CPR and ECC guidelines was developed. The evidence evaluation process was refined for the creation of the 2005 International Consensus on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care Science With Treatment Recommendations\n(ILCOR 2005 CPR Consensus).3 For the 2010 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC, the process was further refined, and a comprehensive description of the 2010 process has been published.4 The purpose of this chapter is to briefly describe this evidence evaluation process and its translation to the 2010 AHA Guidelines for CPR and ECC.\n\n【4】Evidence Evaluation Process To begin the 2010 review process, ILCOR representatives established six task forces: basic life support; advanced life support; acute coronary syndromes; pediatric life support; neonatal life support; and a task force for education, implementation, and teams. The AHA established two additional task forces that were not part of the ILCOR process, one for stroke and one for first aid. Two co-chairs were recruited for each task force to oversee the processes of evidence evaluation and consensus development. For most task forces, one co-chair was recruited from the AHA and the other from the international resuscitation councils. Within the advanced life support (ALS) task force, five domain subgroups were created: electrical therapy, CPR and airway devices, drugs, special situations, and post–cardiac arrest care. The ALS co-chairs designated leaders for these domains to direct completion of the evidence reviews. Three worksheet experts (Atkins, Callaway, and Jacobs) and one evidence evaluation expert (Morley) were recruited to oversee the evidence evaluation worksheets, review the search strategies, ensure correct assignment of levels of evidence (LOE), and verify completeness. The lead evidence evaluation expert, trained in the Cochrane methodology and experienced in the CPR and ECC evidence evaluation process, and the three similarly trained worksheet experts shepherded individual evidence evaluation worksheet authors through the established ILCOR process.\n\n【5】The process included the appointment of two co-chairs\n(Billi and Shuster) to review conflict of interest (COI)", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care Science (Mary Fran Hazinski, John M.

A combination of anti-viral medication and oral steroids is known to improve the chances of recovery among Bell's palsy patients. Even without any formal treatment, a lot of people completely recover from Bell's palsy. Nonetheless, there are various therapeutic options that help reduce the risk of complications.

Biological reactions require nitrogen in the form of ammonia, but the only common nitrogen compound thought to have been available on the primitive earth is nitrogen gas. Perhaps, Brandes thought, the environment at hydrothermal vents mimics an industrial process in which ammonia is synthesized by passing nitrogen and hydrogen over a hot metallic surface.

In 1988 Wächtershäuser advanced a sweeping theory of organic evolution in which minerals—mostly iron and nickel sulfides that abound at deepsea hydrothermal vents—could have served as the template, the catalyst and the energy source that drove the formation of biological molecules. Indeed, he has argued that primitive living entities were molecular coatings that adhered to the positively charged surfaces of pyrite, a mineral composed of iron and sulfur. These entities, he further suggests, obtained energy from the chemical reactions that produce pyrite. This hypothesis makes sense in part because some metabolic enzymes—the molecules that help living cells process energy—have at their core a cluster of metal and sulfur atoms.\n\n【4】For much of the past three years, Wächtershäuser's provocative theory has influenced our experiments at Carnegie.

How Can I Tell When My Inhaler Is Nearly Empty?\n\n【2】It is easy to know whether a dry powder inhaler (DPI) is empty or not because DPIs are specifically designed with counters that keep track of how many doses remain in the inhaler and \"remind\" you when to refill your prescription. Preloaded DPIs such as the Diskus® are dispensed by your pharmacist in a moisture-protective foil wrapper. The preloaded DPI must be discarded within 30 days of opening the foil wrapper, regardless of whether or not the counter registers \"0\" doses. Metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) do not have built-in dose counters. Various strategies have been advocated over the years to help you know when your MDI is empty or nearly empty. One suggestion involved removing the metal MDI canister from its plastic mouthpiece and dropping it into a tall glass of water. If the metal canister sank to the bottom, it was close to full. If it settled halfway to the surface, you still had plenty of medicine. If it started to bob close to the surface, it was time to head for the pharmacy for a refill. MDI manufacturers are strongly opposed to immersing the metal MDI canister in water, so most doctors don't currently recommend \"floating\" the canister under any circumstances. You cannot tell whether an MDI is empty or not by shaking it. It may have propellant in it even after the active medicine has been used up. The only way to be certain that an MDI still has medicine in it is to actually count each and every dose used. Small external counters that fit in the palm of your hand, like the counters used to count attendance at museums or concerts, can be \"clicked\" each time you use the MDI. The truth is that there is no method of MDI dose counting that is both reliable and convenient at the same time. So, instead of trying to guess when your MDI is completely empty, I would suggest that you estimate ahead of time when you will need to replace the MDI. Your estimate should take into account (1) how many doses or \"actuations\" the MDI contains, and (2) how frequently you use the MDI. For example, let's say that you are prescribed an MDI that contains 240 puffs of medicine. If you take two puffs of the medication three times a day, then you are using it for a total of six puffs daily. Given that the new MDI comes with 240 puffs, it should provide enough medicine for 40 days. You can also ask your pulmonary doctor or pharmacist to help you estimate in advance when you will need to obtain an MDI refill. Basically, you divide the total number of doses in the full MDI by the number total of daily doses you plan to use to determine how long the MDI will last. Consider writing the date in your calendar or PDA ahead of time so you remember to contact your pharmacist a day or two ahead of the anticipated \"empty\" MDI date. Finally, note that CFC-free MDIs may have special requirements. The CFC-free Ventolin HFA®, which is often prescribed as a \"rescue\" asthma medication, should be discarded and replaced after you have released 200\npuffs from the MDI, or if 90 days have passed since you opened the sealed, moisture-protective foil wrapper, whichever comes first.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/100 Questions and Answers About Asthma (Claudia S.

Most patients find it difficult to brush their teeth properly, especially on the side of the face that is affected by the condition. They experience difficulty opening their mouth and suffer from nagging problems such as food spilling from their mouth and dry mouth. Apart from the difficulty in maintaining oral hygiene, patients also complain of changes in the quantity of saliva that is produced. Patients, who experience decreased production of saliva, are susceptible to tooth decay and gum disease. Remember, saliva has a crucial responsibility of protecting your teeth.\n\n【1】## Taking Care Of Your Oral Health\n\n【2】Dentists emphasize the significance of flossing apart from brushing your teeth twice a day. For good oral hygiene, a good quality mouthwash should also be included in your list of essentials.

Once the earth formed 4.5 billion years ago, asteroid impacts periodically shattered and sterilized the planet's surface for another half a billion years.

Indeed, a recent flurry of fascinating experiments is revealing that minerals play a crucial part in the basic chemical reactions from which life must have arisen. \n\n【7】The first act of life's origin story must have introduced collections of carbon-based molecules that could make copies of themselves. Achieving even this nascent step in evolution entailed a sequence of chemical transformations, each of which added a level of structure and complexity to a group of organic molecules. The most abundant carbon-based compounds available on the ancient earth were gases with only one atom of carbon per molecule, namely, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and methane. But the essential building blocks of living organisms—energy-rich sugars, membrane-forming lipids and complex amino acids—may include more than a dozen carbon atoms per molecule. Many of these molecules, in turn, must bond together to form chainlike polymers and other molecular arrays in order to accomplish life's chemical tasks.

BURCH is vice president of the Space Science and Engineering Division of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Tex., and principal investigator for the IMAGE mission. Burch earned his Ph.D. in space science from Rice University in 1968. His main research interests are auroral processes, magnetic reconnection and magnetospheric imaging. He is a Fellow of the American Geophysical Union and current chairman of the Committee on Solar and Space Physics of the National Research Council.\n\n【3】Here Comes the Sun THE ORIENTATION OF THE IMF turns southward quite frequently, so magnetospheric substorms are fairly common: on average, they happen a few times every day and last for one to three hours. But major geomagnetic storms such as the Bastille Day event are much rarer. Although they can occur anytime during the 11-year solar cycle, they are most frequent in the solar maximum period.\n\n【4】Until the early 1990s, it was widely believed that solar flares triggered geomagnetic storms. Space and solar physicists, however, had been assembling evidence that pointed strongly to another culprit, and in 1993 John T. Gosling of Los Alamos National Laboratory wove the various threads of evidence together in an article in the *Journal of Geophysical Research* that challenged the \"solar flare myth.\" Gosling set forth a compelling argument for the central role of coronal mass ejections in setting off large geomagnetic storms. Scientists still do not know what causes these violent eruptions in the sun's corona, but the phenomenon most likely involves a reconfiguration of the magnetic field lines there. CMEs are often, but not always, associated with solar flares.\n\n【5】Not all CMEs cause geomagnetic storms. Most of the eruptions are not directed at the earth, and of those that are, only about one in six is \"geoeffective\"—strong enough to trigger a storm. The primary factor is the CME's speed relative to that of the solar wind. Only fast CMEs are geoeffective. Why? When fast CMEs plow through the slower solar wind, they produce interplanetary shock waves, which are responsible for the high-energy particle showers and the severe deformations of the earth's magnetic field. Even more important, a fast-moving CME compresses the solar wind ahead of it, thereby increasing the strength of the magnetic field in the compressed region and in the front part of the CME itself. Moreover, this draping of the field around the CME tends to tilt the IMF more along the north-south direction, which causes a stronger reconnection when the IMF encounters the earth's magnetic field. \n\n【6】A weaker kind of geomagnetic storm occurs during the declining phase of the solar cycle and near the solar minimum period. These disturbances, which tend to recur in phase with the sun's 27-day rotational period, are set off by the interaction between fast solar winds emanating from holes in the corona and slower winds arising from the sun's equatorial streamer belt. Although CMEs are not the primary cause of recurrent storms, they may contribute to their intensity.\n\n【7】With the launch of IMAGE last year, researchers finally had the means to obtain global views of the minute-by-minute progress of a large geomagnetic storm. The satellite travels in of the earthward plasma flow greatly increases the number and energies of the charged particles in the ring current. An extended period of southward IMF can also lead to a rapid succession of substorms, each of which injects more particles toward the earth. The resulting growth in strength of the ring current is the classic hallmark of a full-fledged geomagnetic storm.\n\n【8】of high-speed ions circling the earth in this composite illustration.

This orbit allows the craft to observe a large part of the magnetosphere, including the dayside magnetopause, the inner reaches of the magnetotail and the polar cusp regions, which are the main entryways for the particles from the solar wind.\n\n【10】The Perfect Space Storm IMAGE'S INSTRUMENTS ARE DESIGNED to observe the magnetosphere's plasmas, but they do so in different ways. The craft contains three Energetic Neutral Atom (ENA) imagers that indirectly measure ion flows. When a fast-moving ion (such as an oxygen ion) collides with one of the neutral hydrogen atoms in the magnetosphere, it sometimes strips away the hydrogen atom's lone electron and becomes an energetic neutral atom. Because this atom no longer carries a charge, it does not have to move along the geomagnetic field lines. Instead it travels in a straight path from where it was created. The ENA imagers record the number and energies of the neutral atoms coming from a particular region, and researchers can deduce from those data the mass, speed, direction and density of the ions in that region.\n\n【11】The satellite also carries several instruments that monitor emissions in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. The Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) imager measures the density of singly ionized helium atoms in the plasmasphere—a doughnut-shaped region of the inner magnetosphere containing low-energy plasma—by detecting the solar ultraviolet light that they absorb and then reradiate. The Far Ultraviolet (FUV) imaging system has two instruments for viewing auroras—the Wideband Imaging Camera and the Spectrographic Imager—as well as the Geocorona Photometers for detecting emissions from neutral hydrogen atoms. Last, the Radio Plasma Imager sends out pulses of radio waves that bounce off clouds of charged particles. It works like a state trooper's radar gun: the returning radio signals convey information about the direction, speed and density of the plasma clouds.\n\n【12】During the Bastille Day event, IMAGE began recording the storm's effects less than two minutes after the CME-driven shock wave hit the earth's magnetic field on July 15. The Wideband Imaging Camera sent back stunning photographs of the aurora borealis triggered by the compression of the field [see bottom illustrations on pages 90 and 91]. A movie created from the images shows a sudden dramatic brightening of a ring above the Arctic region—the auroral oval—with brilliant emissions racing like brushfires toward the North Pole. The aurora quieted less than an hour after the storm began but flared up again when a second shock hit at about 17:00 UT. Powerful substorms followed, as energy stored in the magnetotail was studies that the eroded material from the plasmasphere would form a long tail extending to the dayside magnetopause and that from there it would become lost in the solar wind. Global images of the plasmasphere from IMAGE's EUV instrument have now confirmed this 30-year-old hypothesis [see illustration at left]. At the same time, the images have revealed structures in the plasmasphere that raise new questions about its dynamic response to magnetospheric disturbances.\n\n【13】On the Horizon ALTHOUGH IMAGE HAS OPENED a new window on the magnetosphere, our view of space weather is still imperfect. Unlike terrestrial clouds, the clouds of plasma seen by IMAGE are completely transparent: nothing is hidden from sight, but depth perception is lacking. Thus, there will always be the need for satellites that make local measurements of the plasmas, as well as the fields and currents that govern their motion.\n\n【14】The next step for space weather observation will involve clusters of satellites acting like hurricane-hunter planes—they will go where the action is. The European Space Agency is conducting the first such mission, called Cluster II, which was launched in the summer of 2000. (A predecessor mission, Cluster I, was destroyed in a rocket explosion just after liftoff in 1996.) Cluster II consists of four closely grouped identical spacecraft designed to probe turbulent plasma phenomena in the magnetosphere and nearby solar wind. NASA is also planning a cluster mission for launch in 2006. The Magnetospheric Multiscale mission will study reconnection, charged particle acceleration, and turbulence at the dayside magnetopause and at specific locations in the magnetotail where substorms are triggered.\n\n【15】The space agencies are considering even more ambitious missions involving constellations of satellites: dozens of tiny spacecraft that will monitor large regions of space, just as the global weather networks now monitor conditions on the earth. The first constellations will most likely observe the inner magnetosphere and the dayside magnetopause, with each cake-size craft recording the basic characteristics of the plasmas and magnetic fields.\n\n【16】The earth's magnetosphere is at once protective and dangerous. Its strong magnetic field shields humans from penetrating radiation that would otherwise be lethal. But the field is not strong enough to ward off the most powerful shock waves from the sun. Like the tornado belt or the tropical cyclone zone, the magnetosphere is a place of sudden storms. And that's why storm watchers such as the IMAGE satellite are so important.\n\n【17】explosively released into the upper atmosphere. Substorms and the attendant auroral displays continued through the rest of July 15 and into the morning of July 16.\n\n【18】During the storm's main phase, which began four hours after its start, the magnetic field strength on the earth's surface fell precipitously, dropping 300 nanoteslas below its normal value. This phenomenon, the defining feature of geomagnetic storms, resulted from the rapid growth of the ring current. IMAGE's Energetic Neutral Atom imagers produced vivid pictures of this flow of ions and electrons around the earth as it reached its peak on July 16 and then began to diminish [see top illustrations on page 91]. Once the transfer of energy from the solar wind abates, the flow of plasma into the inner magnetosphere slows, and ions are lost from the ring current more rapidly than new ones arrive. As the current weakens, the magnetic field on the earth's surface rebounds. The return to pre-storm levels usually takes one to a few days but may require more than a month in the case of major tempests.\n\n【19】Geomagnetic storms also change the shape of the plasmasphere. The enhanced flow of plasma from the magnetotail toward the earth erodes the plasmasphere by sweeping its charged particles toward the dayside magnetopause. When a storm subsides, the plasmasphere is refilled by ion outflow from the upper atmosphere.

DNAR documentation can take many forms (eg, written bedside orders, wallet identification cards, identification bracelets, or predefined paper documents approved by the local emergency medical services [EMS] authority). The ideal out-of-hospital DNAR documentation is portable and can be carried on the person.16\nDelayed or token efforts such as so-called \"slow-codes\"\n(knowingly providing ineffective resuscitative efforts) are inappropriate. This practice compromises the ethical integrity of healthcare providers, uses deception to create a false impression, and may undermine the provider-patient relationship. The practice of \"pseudo resuscitation\" was self-reported by paramedics to occur in 27% of cardiac arrests in a community where a prehospital DNAR and termination-of-resuscitation protocols were not in place.20\nSome EMS systems have extended the DNAR protocol to include verbal DNAR requests from family members as grounds to withhold therapy.21,22 Paramedics withheld care to patients in cardiac arrest with a history of a terminal illness, who were under the care of a physician, and when at the time of the cardiac arrest the family requested that resuscitation not be attempted. The numbers of patients for whom resuscitation was withheld doubled after implementation (from 45 to 99 a year). This is an important first step in expanding the clinical decision rule pertaining to when to start resuscitation in OHCA, however there is insufficient evidence to support this approach without further validation.\n\n【1】Advance Directives in OHCA\nAdvance directives do not have to include a DNAR order, and a DNAR order is valid without an advance directive. A significant number of cardiac arrest victims for whom EMS is summoned have a terminal illness, and many have written advance directives. Laws detailing the actions of a prehospital provider in response to an out-of-hospital DNAR order vary across jurisdictions. In general, EMS professionals should initiate CPR and advanced life support if there is reasonable doubt about the validity of a DNAR order, if there is concern that the victim may have had a change of mind, or if there is a question about whether the patient intended the advance directive to be applied under the actual conditions for which EMS has been called.\n\n【2】The DNAR order should be shown to EMS responders as soon as they arrive on the scene. If the EMS professional cannot obtain clear information about the victim's wishes, they should not hesitate to start resuscitation. Sometimes within a few minutes of starting resuscitation, relatives or other medical personnel will arrive and confirm that the victim had clearly expressed a wish that resuscitation not be attempted. CPR or other life-support measures may be discontinued by following local directives or protocols, which may include real-time consultation with medical direction.\n\n【3】## Terminating Resuscitative Efforts In Ohca\n\n【4】Terminating Resuscitative Efforts in Neonatal or Pediatric OHCA\nNo predictors of neonatal or pediatric (infant or child) out-ofhospital resuscitation success or failure have been established. No validated clinical decision rules have been derived and evaluated. Further research in this area is needed.\n\n【5】In the absence of clinical decision rules for the neonatal or pediatric OHCA victim, the responsible prehospital provider should follow BLS pediatric and advanced cardiovascular life support protocols and consult with real-time medical direction or transport the victim to the most appropriate facility per local directives.\n\n【6】Terminating Resuscitative Efforts in Adult OHCA\nTerminating Resuscitative Efforts in a BLS Out-of-Hospital System Rescuers who start BLS should continue resuscitation until one of the following occurs:\n\n【7】●Restoration of effective, spontaneous circulation ●Care is transferred to a team providing advanced life\nsupport\n●The rescuer is unable to continue because of exhaustion,\nthe presence of dangerous environmental hazards, or because continuation of the resuscitative efforts places others in jeopardy\n●Reliable and valid criteria indicating irreversible death are\nmet, criteria of obvious death are identified, or criteria for termination of resuscitation are met.\nOne set of reliable and valid criteria for termination of resuscitation is termed the \"BLS termination of resuscitation rule\" (see Figure 1).23 All 3 of the following criteria must be present before moving to the ambulance for transport, to consider terminating BLS resuscitative attempts for adult victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: (1) arrest was not witnessed by EMS provider or first responder; (2) no return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) after 3 full rounds of CPR and automated external defibrillator (AED) analysis; and (3) no AED shocks were delivered.\n\n【8】The BLS termination of resuscitation rule can reduce the rate of hospital transport to 37% of cardiac arrests without compromising the care of potentially viable patients. This was prospectively validated in rural and urban EMS services23 and externally validated in additional locations in the US, Canada, and Europe.24–29 The rule should be applied before moving to the ambulance for transport.30 This clinical prediction rule consistently generates the highest specificity and positive predictive values when compared to previous guidelines.29 It is recommended that regional or local EMS authorities use the BLS termination rule to develop protocols for the termination of resuscitative efforts by BLS providers for adult victims of cardiac arrest in areas where advanced life support is not available or may be significantly delayed (Class I, LOE A). The reliability and validity of this rule is uncertain if modified (Class IIb, LOE A).\n\n【9】Implementation of the rule includes real-time contacting of medical control when the rule suggests termination. Before the protocol is implemented, EMS providers require training in sensitive communication with the family about the outcome of the resuscitative attempt.31 This strategy will help to ensure comfort of the provider and appropriate support of the grieving family. Support for the prehospital protocol should be sought from collaborating external agencies (eg, destination hospital emergency departments [EDs], coroner, medical directors, and police) before implementation.\n\n【10】Terminating Resuscitative Efforts in an ALS Out-of-Hospital System A different rule may be useful when the additional diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities of an advanced life support EMS response are available to the victim. The National Association of EMS Physicians (NAEMSP) suggested that resuscitative efforts could be terminated in patients who do not respond to at least 20\nminutes of ALS care.32 An ALS termination of resuscitation rule was derived from a diverse population of rural and urban EMS\nsettings.33 This rule recommends considering terminating resuscitation when ALL of the following criteria apply before moving to the ambulance for transport (see Figure 2): (1) arrest was not witnessed; (2) no bystander CPR was provided; (3) no ROSC after full ALS care in the field; and (4) no AED shocks were delivered.\n\n【11】This rule has been retrospectively externally validated for adult patients in several regions in the US, Canada, and Europe,25,27–29 and it is reasonable to employ this rule in all ALS\nservices (Class IIa, LOE B).\n\n【12】Terminating Resuscitative Efforts in a Combined BLS and ALS Out-of-Hospital System In a tiered ALS- and BLS-provider system, the use of a universal rule can avoid confusion at the scene of a cardiac arrest without compromising diagnostic accuracy.25,28,29 The BLS rule is reasonable to use in these services (Class IIa, LOE B).\n\n【13】Termination of Resuscitative Efforts and Transport Implications Field termination reduces unnecessary transport to the hospital by 60% with the BLS rule and 40% with the ALS rule,25\nreducing associated road hazards34,35 that put the provider, patient, and public at risk. In addition field termination reduces inadvertent paramedic exposure to potential biohazards and the higher cost of ED pronouncement.36–38 More importantly the quality of CPR is compromised during transport, and survival is linked to optimizing scene care rather than rushing to hospital.39–41\nWithholding and Withdrawing CPR\n(Termination of Resuscitative Efforts) Related To In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Criteria for Not Starting CPR in Newly Born Infant IHCA\nThere are prescribed recommendations to guide the initiation of resuscitative efforts in newly born infants. When gestational age, birth weight, or congenital anomalies are associated with almost certain early death and when unacceptably high morbidity is likely among the rare survivors, resuscitation is not indicated. Examples may include extreme prematurity (gestational age\n23 weeks or birth weight 400 g), anencephaly, and some major chromosomal abnormalities such as trisomy 13 (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【14】In conditions associated with uncertain prognosis where survival is borderline, the morbidity rate is relatively high, and the anticipated burden to the child is high, parental desires concerning initiation of resuscitation should be supported (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【15】There should be a consistent and coordinated approach from the obstetric and neonatal teams in applying these guidelines and in communicating with the parents in developing an agreedupon management plan when possible.\n\n【16】Criteria for Not Starting CPR in Pediatric and Adult IHCA\nFew criteria can accurately predict the futility of continued resuscitation. In light of this uncertainty, all pediatric and adult patients who suffer cardiac arrest in the hospital setting should have resuscitative attempts initiated unless the patient has a valid DNAR order or has objective signs of irreversible death (eg, dependent lividity).\n\n【17】DNAR Orders in IHCA\nUnlike other medical interventions, CPR is initiated without a physician's order, based on implied consent for emergency treatment. A licensed physician's order is necessary to withhold CPR in the hospital setting. Physicians should initiate a discussion about the use of CPR with all patients admitted for medical and surgical care or with their surrogates. Terminally ill patients may fear abandonment and pain more than death, so physicians should also reassure the patient and family that control of pain and other symptoms as well as other aspects of support will continue even if resuscitation is withheld.\n\n【18】The attending physician should write the DNAR order in accordance with local policy in the patient's chart, with a note explaining the rationale for the DNAR order, other specific limitations of care, and documenting discussions with the patient, surrogate, and family. Oral DNAR orders are not acceptable. The limitation-of-treatment order should provide explicit instructions for specific emergency interventions that may arise, including the use of vasopressor agents, mechanical ventilation, blood products, or antibiotics. The scope of a DNAR order should specify which interventions are to be withheld.\n\n【19】It is important to emphasize that all other care should be administered without delay and as appropriate for all patients. A DNAR order does not automatically preclude interventions such as administration of parenteral fluids, nutrition, oxygen, analgesia, sedation, antiarrhythmics, or vasopressors, unless these are included in the order. Some patients may choose to accept defibrillation and chest compressions but not intubation and mechanical ventilation. DNAR orders carry no implications about other forms of treatment, and other aspects of the treatment plan should be documented separately and communicated to members of the healthcare team. DNAR orders should be reviewed periodically as per local protocol, particularly if the patient's condition changes.42 DNAR orders should also be reviewed before surgery by the anesthesiologist, attending surgeon, and patient or surrogate to determine their applicability in the operating suite and during the immediate postoperative recovery period.43", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {"obj_key": "oss://inf-beta/datasets/medical_books_v1130/2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care Science (Mary Fran Hazinski, John M.

Uterine obstruction of venous return can produce hypotension and may precipitate arrest in the critically ill patient.95,96\n●Give 100% oxygen. ●Establish intravenous (IV) access above the diaphragm. ●Assess for hypotension; maternal hypotension that warrants therapy has been defined as a systolic blood pressure\n100 mm Hg or 80% of baseline.97,98 Maternal hypotension can result in reduced placental perfusion.99–102 In\nthe patient who is not in arrest, both crystalloid and colloid solutions have been shown to increase preload.103\n●Consider reversible causes of critical illness and treat\nconditions that may contribute to clinical deterioration as early as possible.\nResuscitation of the Pregnant Patient in Cardiac Arrest (Figure 1)\nThere are no randomized controlled trials evaluating the effect of specialized obstetric resuscitation versus standard care in pregnant patients in cardiac arrest. There are reports in the literature of patients not in arrest that describe the science behind important physiological changes that occur in pregnancy that may influence treatment recommendations and guidelines for resuscitation from cardiac arrest in pregnancy.\n\n【1】## Bls Modifications\n\n【2】Patient Positioning Patient position has emerged as an important strategy to improve the quality of CPR and resultant compression force and output.\n\n【3】The pregnant uterus can compress the inferior vena cava, impeding venous return and thereby reducing stroke volume and cardiac output. Reports of noncardiac arrest parturients indicate that left-lateral tilt results in improved maternal hemodynamics of blood pressure, cardiac output, and stroke volume96,98,104; and improved fetal parameters of oxygenation, nonstress test, and fetal heart rate.100–102\nAlthough chest compressions in the left-lateral tilt position are feasible in a manikin study,105 they result in less forceful chest compressions than are possible in the supine position.106 Two studies found no improvement in maternal hemodynamic or fetal parameters with 10° to 20° left-lateral tilt in patients not in arrest.107,108 One study reported more aortic compression at 15°\nleft-lateral tilt compared with a full left-lateral tilt.97 In addition, aortic compression has been found at 30° of tilt,109 however the majority of these patients were in labor.\n\n【4】If left-lateral tilt is used to improve maternal hemodynamics during cardiac arrest, the degree of tilt should be maximized. However, at a tilt 30° the patient may slide or roll off the inclined plane,106 so this degree of tilt may not be practical during resuscitation. Although important, the degree of tilt is difficult to estimate reliably; 1 study reported that the degree of table tilt is often overestimated.110 Using a fixed, hard wedge of a predetermined angle may help.\n\n【5】 by guest on September 4, 2011\nTwo studies in pregnant women not in arrest found that manual left uterine displacement, which is done with the patient supine, is as good as or better than left-lateral tilt in relieving aortocaval compression (as assessed by the incidence of hypotension and use of ephedrine).111,112\nTherefore, to relieve aortocaval compression during chest compressions and optimize the quality of CPR, it is reasonable to perform manual left uterine displacement in the supine position first (Class IIa, LOE C). Left uterine displacement can be performed from either the patient's left side with the 2-handed technique (Figure 2) or the patient's right side with the 1-handed technique (Figure 3), depending on the positioning of the resuscitation team. If this technique is unsuccessful, and an appropriate wedge is readily available, then providers may consider placing the patient in a left-lateral tilt of 27° to 30°,106 using a firm wedge to support the pelvis and thorax (Figure 4) (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【6】If chest compressions remain inadequate after lateral uterine displacement or left-lateral tilt, immediate emergency cesarean section should be considered. (See \"Emergency Cesarean Section in Cardiac Arrest,\" below.)\nAirway Airway management is more difficult during pregnancy (see \"ACLS Modifications: Airway,\" below), and placing the patient in a tilt may increase the difficulty. In addition, altered airway anatomy increases the risks of aspiration and rapid desaturation. Therefore, optimal use of bag-mask ventilation and suctioning, while preparing for advanced airway placement (see \"ACLS Modifications\") is critical.\n\n【7】Breathing Pregnant patients can develop hypoxemia rapidly because of decreased functional residual capacity and increased oxygen demand. One study in normal pregnancy reported increased intrapulmonary shunting of 12.8% to 15.3% compared with the nonpregnant state, in which the normal value is 2% to 5%,113 which further increases the risk of hypoxemia. Ventilation volumes may need to be reduced because the mother's diaphragm is elevated. Providers should be prepared to support oxygenation and ventilation and monitor oxygen saturation closely.\n\n【8】Circulation Chest compressions should be performed slightly higher on the sternum than normally recommended to adjust for the elevation of the diaphragm and abdominal contents caused by the gravid uterus.\n\n【9】Defibrillation Use of an AED on a pregnant victim has not been studied but is reasonable.\n\n【10】ACLS Modifications There should be no delay in delivering usual treatments during the management of cardiac arrest in pregnancy.\n\n【11】Airway Pregnancy results in changes in airway mucosa, including edema, friability, hypersecretion, and hyperemia.114,115 In addition, 1 study found that the upper airway in the third trimester of pregnancy is smaller compared with that of nonpregnant women and women in the postpartum period.116 Therefore, airway management of the pregnant patient may be more difficult than airway management of the nonpregnant patient.\n\n【12】There is significant literature recognizing the issue of failed intubation in obstetric anesthesia as a major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality.117,118 All providers involved in a resuscitation attempt should be aware of the increased risk for pregnancy-related complications in airway management. Intubation with an endotracheal tube or supraglottic airway should be performed only by experienced providers if possible.\n\n【13】Cheun et al119 found that during apnea desaturation in pregnant patients is significantly faster than in nonpregnant patients.

All shortacting β2 agonist \"rescue\" inhaled bronchodilator medications, for example, are classified as category C, even though they have been in use for over two decades, and are widely viewed as very safe by the medical profession. They have not been shown to have adverse effects on the course of the pregnancy, and have not been shown to be harmful to the human fetus. All long acting β2 agonist inhaled bronchodilators are also category C medicines. The \"C\" classification for the β2\nagonist group of inhalers reflects the absence of studies in pregnant women. One inhaled corticosteroid preparation, Pulmicort® (budesonide), is category B; all other inhaled steroids are, as of this writing, labeled category C.

It is crucial to normalize maternal lung function and ensure that the mother is not experiencing any symptoms of asthma. Pulmonologists take the point of view that any medicine that is required for optimal asthma treatment should be administered to a pregnant woman. For example, steroid bursts are used in the setting of pregnancy just as they are when a woman is not pregnant. As a rule of thumb, we would use category B medicines first, adding any required medicines that may fall into the C category (or even D), if needed to achieve good asthma control.

{"seq_id": "44c56a4d-29ba-4785-b839-41b7b4ede31b", "title": null, "text": "【0】页码:259\nThere are several sources of data that use large populations to identify the 5th percentile for systolic blood pressure at various ages.27,28 For purposes of these guidelines, hypotension is defined as a *systolic* blood pressure:\n\n【1】●60 mm Hg in term neonates (0 to 28 days) ●70 mm Hg in infants (1 month to 12 months) ●70 mm Hg  (2  age in years) in children 1 to 10 years ●90 mm Hg in children 10 years of age\n\n【2】## Airway\n\n【3】Oropharyngeal and Nasopharyngeal Airways Oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal airways help maintain an open airway by displacing the tongue or soft palate from the pharyngeal air passages. Oropharyngeal airways are used in unresponsive victims who do not have a gag reflex. Make sure to select the correct size: an oropharyngeal airway that is too small may push the base of the tongue farther into the airway; one that is too large may obstruct the airway.\n\n【4】Nasopharyngeal airways can be used in children who do have a gag reflex. Pay careful attention to proper diameter and length. A nasopharyngeal airway that is too short may not maintain an open airway, while one that is too long may obstruct it. A small-diameter nasopharyngeal airway may be obstructed easily by secretions. It may therefore require frequent suctioning.\n\n【5】Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA)\nAlthough several supraglottic devices have been used in children, clinical studies of devices other than the LMA in pediatric patients are limited. When bag-mask ventilation (see\n\"Bag-Mask Ventilation,\" below) is unsuccessful and when endotracheal intubation is not possible, the LMA is acceptable when used by experienced providers to provide a patent airway and support ventilation (Class IIa, LOE C).29–37 LMA\ninsertion is associated with a higher incidence of complications in young children compared with older children and adults.38–43\nOxygen It is reasonable to ventilate with 100% oxygen during CPR because there is insufficient information on the optimal inspired oxygen concentration (Class IIa, LOE C). Once the circulation is restored, monitor systemic oxygen saturation. It may be reasonable, when the appropriate equipment is available, to titrate oxygen administration to maintain the oxyhemoglobin saturation 94%. Provided appropriate equipment is available, once ROSC is achieved, adjust the FIO2 to the minimum concentration needed to achieve an arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation at least 94%, with the goal of avoiding hyperoxia while ensuring adequate oxygen delivery. Since an arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation of 100%\nmay correspond to a PaO2 anywhere between 80 and\n500 mmHg, in general it is appropriate to wean the FIO2 when saturation is 100%, provided the oxyhemoglobin saturation can be maintained 94% (Class IIb, LOE C). Remember that adequate oxygen delivery requires not only adequate arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation but also adequate hemoglobin concentration and cardiac output.\n\n【6】Pulse Oximetry If the patient has a perfusing rhythm, monitor oxyhemoglobin saturation continuously with a pulse oximeter because clinical recognition of hypoxemia is not reliable.44 Pulse oximetry may, however, also be unreliable in patients with poor peripheral perfusion, carbon monoxide poisoning, or methemoglobinemia.\n\n【7】Bag-Mask Ventilation Bag-mask ventilation can be as effective, and may be safer, than endotracheal tube ventilation for short periods during out-of-hospital resuscitation.45–52 In the prehospital setting it is reasonable to ventilate and oxygenate infants and children with a bag-mask device, especially if transport time is short (Class IIa, LOE B). Bag-mask ventilation requires training and periodic retraining in selecting a correct mask size, maintaining an open airway, providing a tight seal between mask and face, providing ventilation, and assessing effectiveness of ventilation (see Part 13, \"Pediatric Basic Life Support\").\n\n【8】Precautions Use only the force and tidal volume needed to just make the chest rise visibly (Class I, LOE C); avoid delivering excessive ventilation during cardiac arrest (Class III, LOE C). Evidence shows that cardiac arrest victims frequently receive excessive ventilation.22,53–55 Excessive ventilation during cardiac arrest increases intrathoracic pressure, which impedes venous return, thus reducing cardiac output and cerebral and coronary blood flow. These effects will reduce the likelihood of ROSC.54 In addition, excessive ventilation may cause air trapping and barotrauma in patients with small airway obstruction. It also increases the risk of stomach inflation, regurgitation, and aspiration.\n\n【9】If the infant or child is not intubated, pause after 30 chest compressions (1 rescuer) or after 15 chest compressions (2 rescuers) to give 2 ventilations (mouth-to-mouth, mouth-tomask, or bag-mask). Deliver each breath with an inspiratory time of approximately 1 second. If the infant or child is intubated, ventilate at a rate of about 1 breath every 6 to 8 seconds (8 to 10 times per minute) without interrupting chest compressions (Class I, LOE C). It may be reasonable to do the same if an LMA is in place (Class IIb, LOE C).\n\n【10】In the victim with a perfusing rhythm but absent or inadequate respiratory effort, give 1 breath every 3 to 5 seconds (12 to 20 breaths per minute), using the higher rate for the younger child (Class I, LOE C). One way to achieve that rate with a ventilating bag is to use the mnemonic \"squeeze-release-release\" at a normal speaking rate.45,56\nTwo-Person Bag-Mask Ventilation A 2-person ventilation technique may be preferable when personnel are available and may be more effective than ventilation by a single rescuer if the patient has significant airway obstruction, poor lung compliance, or the rescuer has difficulty in creating a tight mask-to-face seal.57,58 One rescuer uses both hands to maintain an open airway with a jaw thrust and a tight mask-to-face seal while the other compresses the ventilation bag. Both rescuers should observe the victim's chest to ensure chest rise.\n\n【11】Gastric Inflation Gastric inflation may interfere with effective ventilation59 and cause regurgitation, aspiration of stomach contents, and further ventilatory compromise.
