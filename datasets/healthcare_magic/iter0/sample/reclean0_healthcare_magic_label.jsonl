As the total bilirubin is composed of two fractions (indirect and direct bilirubin) and direct bilirubin is normal, it seems that indirect (unconjugated) bilirubin is abnormally elevated.The reason for this increase in indirect bilirubin are several:- hemolytic anemia,- a genetic disorder like XXXXXXX syndrome causing slightly increased indirect bilirubin without other signs and symptoms,- bleeding in the skin due to trauma,- bleeding in the lung due to blood clot, etc.You need to discus with your attending physician (GP or internist) on the above possible alternatives.Hope you will find this answer helpful!In case of any other uncertainties, feel free to ask me again.Kind regards,Dr. Iliri", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "healthcare_magic", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Thanks for writing to us at healthcaremagic.I am Dr. Kakkar. I have gone through your query.Sweating is a physiological and vital process. The main function of sweating is to maintain body temperature/thermoregulation. However, if excessive sweating/ hyperhidrosis, it can result in substantial suffering.I would like to gather more information from you in order to be able to guide you better- is the sweating generalized?- Or do you sweat more from the palms, soles, axilla, face predominantly?The two instances that you have mentioned in your query i.e sweating on intake of hot fluids and on walking/exercising, is not considered to be hyperhidrosis.The central mechanism behind sweating in these situations is \"Increase in core body temperature\" which happens when we exercise/walk and also on intake of hot fluids like tea/coffee; this in turn induces sweating as a mechanism to release heat.A slight weight reduction would be all that I would suggest as of now.Regards \n\n【2】**Question**: Hi, thank you for the reply. I sweat more on my forehead or underarms when I am having tea or when I have to face some heat.When I walk I sweating is in general.But is it normal to sweat that much even after walking for a kilometer? How much weight loss would you recommend ? \n\n【3】**Answer**: Brief Answer:Try weight lossDetailed Answer:Hi.Sweating is normal after walking or any form of exercising. It varies in extent in different individualsYour BMI (body mass index) is in the overweight category.An overweight individual would heat up a lot faster and therefore sweat more than a leaner person.Moreover excess fat acts as an insulator to dissipation of body heat, this also raises core body temperature. Together the result is increased sweating.Your weight should ideally be in the higher 60's rather than higher 70'sRegards", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "healthcare_magic", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

After extractions I had foul smell in sinus', s and pain in left ear eyes and throat went back to dentist on 4/27 dentist he said that's very strange, looked in my mouth and said that everything is healing well and that I probably have sinus issues, but gave me penicillian 500 mg. On 5/9 still had the foul smell he looked in my mouth and again said everything is healing well and he has no idea why I have that smell but gave me azrithromycin 250 dose pack and dexamethasone oral solution and said that I probably have sinus issues. On 6/1 I went to ENT who looked in my mouth and ear, because at this point my ear is totally clogged, I had explained about the extractions, she put me on Levoflaxin 500 mg and Fluticasone 50 mg told me to buy nasal rinse and sudafed and come back in two weeks if nothing changes ( I was the last patient of the day, not that that should matter but maybe that's why I was ONLY given meds). But at this point I started having sever pain in right hip and left shoulder I went to ER for CT was told I have synovial cyst in hip and possible torn rotator cuff and to go get MRI, so I asked my GP to send me for MRI of hip and shoulder and sinus CT since I still had sinus issue. On 6/13 the report from sinus Ct is as follows: Findings : the frontal sinus is aplastic, right sinus clear sphenoid sinus and sphenoethmodial recess are clear ,right maxillary sinus and ostiomeatal complex appear unremarkable. There is a 2 mm cell on right. The nasal septum is deviated to the left. There is complex opacification of the left maxillary. Within the left maxillary sinus, there is a density which may represent a tooth. This area measures approximately 1.4 mm in greatest dimension. The left maxillary sinus is totally opacified. There is a boney defect of the left maxilla near the maxillary sinus antrum.

This can cause compression of the nerves travelling to the hands from the neck. This has occurred due to mild disc prolapse. It does not require surgery at the moment. This is why you are experiencing pins and needles sensation. Avoid bending neck forward or lifting weights. Avoid using thick pillow. Apply hot packs to the affected region. Perform neck extension exercises. The following are prescription drugs which you can take to give you good relief. Tablet Diclofenac with Thicolchicoside combination twice a day after meals and Tablet Rabeprazole twice a day before meals for 5 days. I hope I have answered your query.

A popper is a piece of tobacco covered with weed smoked through a metal shaft in a bong and it gives you a head rush. I used it to get over cocaine but I no longer even enjoy drinking and don't enjoy many things my question is are the effects reversible in any way after six years of consistent smoking? I am at the point where I smoke them only before bed but about five to twenty. \n\n【1】**Answer**: Addiction Medicine Specialist,  Dr. Dr. Matt Wachsman's  Response Ok, cocaine first. IT causes some changes in the brain that keep one wanting to take it. It can cause progressive damage to the heart and heart failure. The damage, like knife and gun wounds are only when it happens and not later when not getting injured. Like other injuries there is some healing and maybe the injuries get all better and maybe they don't and it is mainly how bad the injury was. If nothing much happened from the injury (and you would know it if you had a lot of heart damage), then there isn't much healing needed and if you don't get injured again, then you are ok.I hate to say marijuana (which doesn't kill people) is worse than cocaine (which kills most people my age who use it.. I am old enough to be your GRANDFATHER), but:1) the lung effects of smoking anything add up. Everyone who smokes tobacco gets lung injury. A small amount of those who smoke marijuana get some lung reactivity but the damage is less with marijuana. Irritation goes away promptly when one stops smoking. Damage stays but it is basically not possible to have much damage from smoking with under 10 years of use.2) the brain effects of marijuana are a serious concern when used by people under 21. There is loss of intelligence and this might not come back. There are also changes in the brain that make someone more prone to addictions from marijuana, and this also might not reverse.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "healthcare_magic", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

I am suffering from extreme anxiety (ocd and ptsd) after I was told in October 2014 that I was in CHF, had dilated cardiomyopathy, and would likely have a short life, and sudden death. It turned out I was having 65,000 pvcs a day so it was pvc-induced cardiomyopathy, and after successful ablation in December 2015, my heart function and size returned to normal by January 2015. Now 7 months later, I am so terrified of recurrence that I cannot function. I am particularly focused on water retention because one of my doctors told me I would always be in danger of going back into CHF. I constantly monitor water intake and output and am terrified, always, that I may not be urinating enough. It is paralyzing me. My cardiologist just tells me I'm cured and being crazy but I feel some clinical explanation of why this is not possible would be helpful because I am so scared. Specifically- is it possible with normal heart, kidney, and liver function to retain water and quickly go into CHF?I had my last echo two weeks ago and am so scared that my heart has weakened even in this short time. Is that possible? My echo 6 weeks ago showed EF of 55-60, and two weeks ago echo showed 65-70. Does this mean EF could be going up or can a different tech/machine make this much difference? Couldn't EF go down that quickly too then, to 45-50? I am trying to not be so focused on numbers but when I had EF of 25-30, I had no symptoms so I feel like the only reassurance I get is through tests. Also- 6 weeks ago echo showed PASP of 24 and two weeks ago it was 34. My doctor says both numbers are normal and to just stop worrying. Is it normal for PASP to change that much so quickly?Thank you so much. I am trying to calmDown so I can be happy and get my life back. It is so hard to believe I'm normal again after being told I would die very soon. How do I start to really believe it when I had no symptoms other than PVCs?Thank you. \n\n【1】**Answer**: Brief Answer: Nothing wrong is happening with your heart. Detailed Answer: Hello XXXXX! IIt's nice to hear from you again! I am sorry for your persistent anxiety on these cardiac issues. But, I would be glad helping you to relieve such an unpleasant feeling on possible cardiac disorders. I would like to explain that water retention is an expression of heart, liver, or renal dysfunction. So, it is quite impossible for that to happen, as all the above mentioned organs are functioning perfectly well. So relax! Regarding your echo parameters concern, I would repeatedly assure you that all those EF fluctuations are due to interobserver variability, and not to any ongoing pathological process. This conclusion is supported even by your PASP values. As a general rule, when EF decreases, PASP increases. But it is not the case with your last echos: EF and PASP are increased on the samd direction, confirming tgat this is just an examinations variability, and has nothing to do with a deteriorating heart function. Hope to have been helpful to you! Feel free to ask me whenever you need! Greetings! Dr. Iliri \n\n【2】**Question**: Dr Iliri, I am quite embarrassed by needing so much reassurance but I cannot relax and always always feel that I am dying, and that my heart is failing again. I cannot forget that I was told that I wouldn't see my baby grow up. I am in therapy to address the anxiety, and taking anti-anxiety medications but nothing is working very quickly.Is it not possible for EF to fall in the same way it seemed to go up? You said to go by my clinical condition, but even at EF 25/30, I felt fine. It worries me so much that I can't know for sure that my heart is still ok without an echo. I went to three clinics for drug allergy and none of them found cardiomyopathy. It wasn't found until I saw a cardiologist for my PVCs which I had, on and off for many years and was always told that no number of PVCs could hurt me.So I have so much trouble trusting what doctors have told me and I have such incredible fear of drinking because I think that the liquid will just get stuck in my body and I will be in CHF.Can I truly forget about monitoring fluids and just live my life normally? I know I should just be grateful for my recovery but I am so scared to believe I'm normal in case I were to get sick again. Thank you, Dr. Iliri, I'm sorry to take so much of your time. I wish I could just believe I am normal again but it is so hard for me to let go and trust. \n\n【3】**Answer**: Brief Answer: I would be glad to be helpful for you! Detailed Answer: Hi again dear XXXX! I know, it is so hard to face with anxiety disorders, But that's why we are here; just to help and support you. So never feel embarrassed to discuss your fears and uncertainties! This is a reasonable way to manage your anxiety, and if coupled with a good cognitive behavioral therapy, I think your fears will definitely vanish. I would like to firmly assure you again about your opportunity to follow a quite normal and healthy life-style and diet without any substantial water retention. It is my professional conviction and the most reasonable conclusion, to declare you all my above mentioned opinions. You can keep performing periodically scheduled cardiac ultrasounds, just to be in touch with you current clinical conditions. Meanwhile, what I stated above regarding LV EF is quite important to remember time after time, as it may help to avoid new uncertainties to perturb your mind. My best wishes, Dr. Iliri \n\n【4】**Question**: Dear Dr Iliri,You are so kind and patient, thank you.I had such a bad panic attack today that I went to ER. Chest xray and echo looked good and all bloodwork was normal but creatinine went from .7 to .8 ans proBNP went from 67 to 71. Do you think these are normal variations or could there be a trend towards bad numbers and worsening kidney and heart function?Thank you so much. \n\n【5】**Answer**: Brief Answer: You are in perfectly normal conditions. Detailed Answer: Dear XXXX! Those lab tests results are perfectly normal; just tiny variations related to a normal body physiology. If you have further uncertainties, do not hesitate to contact me! Regards, Dr. Iliri \n\n【6】**Question**: Thank you so much, Dr Iliri. When I had blood tests yesterday, it was late in the afternoon and I hadn't had anything to eat or drink since early morning. Other times I usually have had blood drawn in the morning, shortly after breakfast. Could this account for slight increase in creatinine? I am worried (of course I am) because creatinine was .6 in May, .7 in XXXXXXX and July, and then .8 yesterday so it seems like upward trend. Do I need to keep testing frequently or just let it go as it is all normal range? I don't have any risk factors for kidney disease but as you know I am very very afraid of fluid imbalance. Thank you! \n\n【7】**Answer**: Brief Answer: Everything seems to be normal. Detailed Answer: Hi XXXX! All the above values are within normal ranges, so nothing to worry about. Creatinine level may be influenced by several factors, like diet profile (the amount of meat consumed), physical activity performed prior to blood sample provision, hormonal balance, possible muscle injury, etc. Because of so many interfering factors, two blood creatinine levels could be hardly the same. I don't think you should check more frequently creatinine level. Just perform the routine medical check up, as usually scheduled.

I am 22 and I am uncircumcised and this is the first time this has happened. I should also mention there is not really any pain during urination. \n\n【1】**Answer**: Hi,Thanks for posting your query.I do not see any reason for concern.There are two main reasons for a swollen foreskin one, rough masturbation and two, a tight foreskin. As you do not have this in past, this seems to be due to rough masturbation, the swelling will go down by its self within a day or two. Just avoid doing masturbation for couple of days, avoid pressure and friction to the part.In case of discomfort or pain, you can take analgesics like Tylenol to have relief.You can apply some moisturizer to the part to avoid irritation. In most of the cases doing this or nothing should solve this in a day or two.In case the swelling increases, you can retract your foreskin with ease; you need to see your doctor for examination and treatment.I hope this helps.Regards,Dr.Pragnesh \n\n【2】**Question**: Thank you so much. There is quite a bit of conflicting information floating around the internet so i appreciate a direct answer. One more question, as far a healing as quickly as possible does it matter if im taking hot or cold showers? and would applying an ice pack or anything be beneficial? Thanks again \n\n【3】**Answer**: Hi,Good to hear from you again.As written earlier, nothing needs to be done.When ever there is injury to any part of body, the body had got a tendency to increase blood supply to that part and there is release of some chemicals which starts the repair process.As result of this there is local swelling and redness at site of injury.As the repair process goes on the reaction subsides and the things come back to normal.Cold application reduce the extent of this reaction and helps in reducing swelling faster, but it is not must and not advised in these kind of injury.Just let the body takes it own course and as mentioned if the swelling increases or does not subside in couple of days seek medical advice.I hope this clarifies your concern.Regards,Dr.Pragnesh", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "healthcare_magic", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

These are one of the mildest creams and can be applied around the eyes. Looking at the severity of lesions it is the recommended treatment. The only precaution you should make is to apply in a thin layer in morning and at night time. Apply in a very thin layer so that it should not be visible to naked eye. Also should not go inside the eyes. I suggest to apply it for 7 days and then stop it after that.For irritation or itching I suggest tablet “Loratadine” or \"Deslotatadine\" (Claritin) tablet by mouth up to 2 times or 3 times also if the itching is more.If at all you are not getting better in 72 hours then in patients I suggest them a short course of oral steroids for 3-5 days in tapering dose.In case you have confusion then can meet a family physician and apprise him/her with my suggestions and take action accordingly.The rest of the precautions are as suggested before and I reassure you fully that this condition is quite simple and can be managed easily by active measures and the suggestions told above.I hope these information's will help you.

I dont know what has caused this, I cant think of anything new I have added to my diet and or facial regime. A couple weeks ago, I started getting these almost welted looking \"pimples\" on my face. They are painful especially when I go outdoors and the sun is out/warm. There are times for some of them that they get big and the pressure is too much to take, so I will apply a warm compress to bring the \"yuk of the pimple\" to a head and do my best to pop it - this DOES relieve the pressure for some period of time - what comes out though is something I have not seen in a pimple... it is USUALLY a harder almost gritty like substance. I would wash and not put make up on my skin to allow it to breathe and try to heal as natural as possible. They started to go away and I was super stoked until Sunday... face almost clear, we went outside for a few hours and it was like I could actually FEEL in a cetain spot a \"pimple\" forming and then the warmer it got and humid as well, the more painful the burning sensation became. What is this, what can I do to make it stop??? \n\n【1】**Answer**: Brief Answer:Acne and photo allergyDetailed Answer:HelloThanks for the query,Your description suggests that you have nodular acne as well as photo allergy.Can you please upload a photograph of your face showing the lesions?This will help me in giving a closer diagnosis and a better way of management.There is an option to upload photos on right side of query page.Please utilize it.Thank you \n\n【2】**Question**: Please excuse my ugliness I have messed with these after washing a while ago but have been treating them as pimples. They hurt, burn occassionally and as mentiined before, i can literally feel them appearing on my face This is weird What would i be allrgic to, what can i do to make this look better and what is the recovery turn-around?I have been in the sun and i live in XXXXXXX so we have a lot of sun and a lot of hot. Please look at that unsightly pucture attached lemmme know what we can look forward to now and in yhe future Thanks also for helping me! Talk to ya soon \n\n【3】**Answer**: Brief Answer:Combined approachDetailed Answer:HelloThanks for the photograph.It is typically acne.Acne treatment needs a combination of approach.Please follow this regimen.1. Apply adapalene based cream in night keep it for an hour and wash your face.2. Apply some moisturiser and sleep.3. In early morning apply an antibacterial cream like clindamycin.4. After bath apply a water based sunscreen.Carry on with this regimen for a month you will notice improvement.Let me know if you have any other doubts.Thank you \n\n【4】**Question**: Is there any explaination as to why this acne has just reared its ugly head? I have NEVER had acne reallly before... Maybe one pimple here (white head) and one there but never all at one time all over my face. And it BURNS when i go into the sun and not only that, and this may sound odd, but its almost like when in the sun/heat , they get worse and that is when they start to appear and i can actually feel the place where each new one will be because it is crazy painful in that spot. Then the day after being outside sunlight/heat, ill wake up looking like a hormonal high schooler. It makes no sence i go almost 40 years with out and then BAM... Acne time? Also theyve now shown up in other places as well Arms Shoulder Cleavage area And these \"pimples\" are of a kind i have never seen or heard of before They are these hard and at times almost gritty feeling and it obviously bothered me so obviously i picked around at some of them, as long as i wouldnt hurt for the most part... But there were some that looked as though they wanted to come out - and this actually freaked me out - but that white thing would (for lack of a better phrase) \"get stuck\" and i would literally have to get tweezers and pull it out.. Those were even harder than some of the others (obviously)... And they leave little divits and peel... When i would get the entire thing out its like the next day it scabs up and has this almost puss like stuff, more blister fluid like. Not pimple puss like at all... But youre saying THAT all this is only acne? I just cant fathom that being a pimple. If i havent changed my diet, make-up, cleansers or anything in the house, what could possibly be the cause of my middle age acne issue? Is there anything that can prevent these from coming back? Is there any medication that can be prescribed to used with my dauly cleaning regimen to possibly a topical or even an oral item... Something to assist me in combating these awful things What you said originally the other day, after looking online at the signs/symptoms etc.. That sounded like what i was experiencing.. The itch, the burning sensation, i mean, i walk outside and in a few mins, i just feel like my face (mostly as most my bidy is covered) is on fire and it wont stop until i am out of the sun and heat. Please look into this for me... I really cant have tjis happening to me. It makes me super stress and i also look pretty nasty when it hits. I cant have this for life if it was mever there befoe, right? I sincerely appreciate all the assistance thus far! Hope to hear back from you soon again' Thanks, XXXX \n\n【5】**Answer**: Brief Answer:Acne rosaceae overlapDetailed Answer:HelloPlease dont worry.I will explain you in detail.Acne is blockade of sebaceous glands.Usually it happens at younger age but a hormonal imbalance can lead to acne even at a later age.1.As these glands are mainly concentrated on face, upper chest, back and arm, you are getting these lesions on these areas.2.There are four grades of acne and It is not necessary that all acne lesions will extrude out puss when pressed. However you are doing a very bad thing by pressing them. It will introduce infection from outside and also lead to scarring.3. The photo sensitivity is due to damage to blood vessels underlying. This is called as acne Rosaceae overlap.Topical medication I have already suggested you.Apart from those I usually prescribe capsule doxycycline to my patients and they show great response with it.You too can give it a trial.Let me know if you have any other doubts.Thank you", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "healthcare_magic", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

What Could Be Causing This And Cure?\n**Question**: Question: Hello, about a year ago when i get out of the shower i see in left side of the urethra like a lump when o look closer i see a blue vein (i don’t know if is really a vein if there are veins of this side on the surface of the glans). But after a day it disappear (but if i stretch the skin in that spot i can see the vein with a blue color (but like a string... very very thin). But today e get again out of the shower and i see the same thing... what do you thing is that?... i don’t have apparently reason to have this don’t have intercourse about one week and masturbation as well. I don’t have any pain the feel of the enlarged vein is soft.. i can send some pictures. \n\n【1】**Answer**: Hi there XXXXXXX, I read your history & saw all the very clear commendable photographs. It is just that : a blue vein. The penile tissue & the head of penis is an extremely vascular tissue. Sometimes these do appear & are perfectly normal & will cause you no problem at all. If your testes are normal on both sides & such an activity is not present there, then you have nothing to fear about. Sometimes such veins when present in abundance on the scrotal/testes region give rise to what is called a 'varicocele' of the testes & this may even lead to infertility if not addressed. In your case, nothing to be feared. But is you want to be extra safe, get a colour doppler scan of the penile & testicular region @ any major hospital in your native Algarve & this will give you a more definitive picture. In the meantime, all is well & hope i have reassured & relaxed you & helped you make a definitive road map to its managment. Obregado! Cheers & Godspeed! Dr Praveen Rodrigues MD \n\n【2】**Question**: Thank you doctor for your answer, that give-me some relax.But some other questions, like i said i don’t know that the glans have such large veins, but ok, if you said there are normal i stay more relax, but may question is, why this vein pop up this way, because like you see in the pictures the vein is very larged and the glans stay with a significative bump, and i don’t know why this happened or if is normal this situation, because it only happened two times, the last time more than a year, and appear with no apparent reason.In this time (this is the second day) i still notice the vein (more thin that in the pictures with a very small bump), but is still there, last time in the next day i don’t see the vein, only if i stretched the glans. My preoccupation is because i don’t know why it appears, that´s the reason because i think this is not so normal. \n\n【3】**Answer**: Hey XXXXXXX, The catholic church has 'dogmas'! So does 'medicine' :) Honestly, cant answer your question 100%. Believe though, it is a local vasculature issue that causes the vein to pop-up much like in other tissues such as the skin/scalp where the skin layers are thin...same for the penis head. So relax. It will pop back in..:) Cheers & Godspeed! Dr Praveen Rodrigues MD Dermatologist, Cosmetologist, Venereologist XXXXXXX Hospital, Bangalore, India. \n\n【4】**Question**: Thanks for the answered, but one final question, its XXXXXXX to have sexual intercourse while have this vein pop-up??? Can it burst and have bleeding? or doing more damage and this pop-up stay permanent? because like you see in the pictures is not very cosmetic have a prominent vein in that spot permanent.Thank you for all the explanations \n\n【5】**Answer**: heya XXXXXXX, Not XXXXXXX but be gentle & use some lubricant like KY jelly. If you can give it some time say a week, it will be useful for the long run. Cheers & Good Luck!

It depends on the specifics of the individual, blood pressure, heart disease etc. In a young healthy person marijuana is not associated with much cardiovascular risk at all.

Most parts are normal brown colour but some especially the first part of the bowel movement are darker brown colour. The consistency is soft but the stool is hard to separate. It was hard separating smaller pieces for a stool sample because the stool stays together almost like a mozzarella cheese consistency. What can cause this? Also I was desperate and have some urin sticks for testing at home and tried to use it on my stool sample and in the water Nd both times the pee stick reacted on blood. Is it possible to test this with a urine stick or is the sample reacting on other things? \n\n【1】**Answer**: Brief Answer: Color and mild change in consistency are very normal things. Detailed Answer: Hello, Have seen your details and I appreciate your concerns. Stool can have a range of colors. All shades of brown and even green are considered normal. Only rarely does stool color indicate a potentially serious intestinal condition(for eg. tarry black). Stool color is generally influenced by what you eat as well as by the amount of bile a yellow-green fluid that digests fats in your stool. However there are a few things to consider when a person suspects she has blood in the stool. The first thing is if it is really blood. There are some food and industrial chemicals that might be in stool and give the impression of blood and in fact, it is not. Unless it bright red blood (which is clear that it is blood). Other times the way to know if you are bleeding or not is having a stool occult blood test or a stool microscopy that will confirm the presence of blood with the stools. No urine stick is designed for the ph urine and fecal Ph is very different from that of urine. A CBC would be a good test to be done if you suspect bleeding to see if you are developing anemia as a complication of bleeding and need treatment for it or not. So to conclude: 1. we need to be sure you are bleeding or not- a stool test like fecal occult blood test and or stool microscopy for blood will help in this. 2. if it is confirmed that you are bleeding then you will need a colonoscopy to find the cause of it. 3.Take a probiotic and fibers to improve consistency of stools. I hope this is helpful and answers your questions but please feel free to reply in case any more clarification is needed on this. Regards, Dr. Ramesh Kumar \n\n【2】**Question**: As always you help me out, thank you.I just wish these things issues would stop or a cause would be found, but there seems to keep coming something new all the time.Just to be 100 % sure, the urine stick I have also shows other things than just the pH, it also test for blood, density, and many more are you sure that this test that got positive on contact with my stool is not useful?Alright so I should make them test my stool for 2 things? Do I need to sample more than one or is one sample enough? (They gave me only one test tube).I just want to be sure I get all the tests done, because they only test very specifically and then I have to keep coming back to get new tests done over and over. \n\n【3】**Answer**: Brief Answer: Follow up answer. Detailed Answer: Hello, These are all biotechnologically developed things so i don't think that a urine dip stick would be sensitive for stools. One sample of stool is enough. Just go for stool for occult blood and stool routine and sensitivity test. If they are normal every thing is normal. Follow up with reports. Thank you.

Nicotine goes out of the system in the time between cigarettes. All breakdown products decrease by 50% each 17 hrs.

Psychological issues can last indefinitely; certainly one month after quitting but even longer than that. For as long as one thinks about cigarettes. A long time.Of course many people who have quit cigarettes have other health issues like traffic accidents, gunshot wounds, lightning strikes that are not clearly related to cigarettes. These often occur a long time after quitting. Some people might say to me that their dog bite three years after being off cigarettes was due to the withdrawal but personally, I would have a bias towards it having to be closely related to the time of quitting.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "healthcare_magic", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

When I was in Japan they told me they don't do deep cleaning because of the threat of this infection. When I went to my dentist, I hadn't had my teeth cleaned in awhile. He did a simple cleaning ($35.00...my share of the Japanese Health Insurance payment was $7.50) every month for thee months, then every other month for three months and then every 3 months all the rest of the time I lived there.

This is actually in correct. I would like to present some facts that are used to determine whether or not deep cleaning is necessary. Based upon the facts, you can be the best judge to continue with the treatment or not. 1. Deep cleaning is not done in every case. It is advised to those patient who have pocket formation, Gum recession and moderate to severe loss of gingival (gum) attachment. 2. In case of pocket formation the gum looses its normal attachment with the bone and forms a pocket. This pocket further harbors millions of bacterias, fungus and microorganisms causing further damage odors and mobility of teeth. You may need to undergo deep scaling and clean this place (pocket); so that gum attachment can be restored back and the teeth along with gums can be saved. If you can upload picture of your teeth and gums, I may be able to figure out if you have those pockets. You can use the site's uploader to send me the pictures. 3. Unfortunately mouth being the primary active site and due to poor hygiene maintenance, it becomes a failure in most of the cases. Thus misunderstood. That being said, if you have history of diabetes, hypertension, chronic illness and immunocompromised, it would be better to avoid deep cleaning procedure. Hope I have given you detail answer.

Eleurphrat is a steroidal cream and if the rash subsides on application and comes back after discontinuing it then it means either you are suffering from a fungal infection or irritant dermatitis due to the protection you must have used. Fungal infection is more of a possibility and an oral course of fluconazole along with application of anti fungal cream should take care of the rash. Your doctor knows about the course of fluconazole. He can prescribe it safely. An irritant dermatitis might be as a result of cleansers that you might be using to keep the area clean.

Thank you writing to us at healthcaremagicI have answered your earlier query too, so hello again!!I have gone through your query and I have also seen the Images.I have noted that you have a combination skin, where central T zone is oily and the rest is normal or dry. This is the most common skin type.In the Images I can see that you have a moderate grade of acne, mainly comedones and few papules.Acne in general is more common in oily skin types and combination skin type.Wearing make up can clog pores and therefore may be the cause behind your acne.Other factors like moisturizers, sunscreens etc can be too oily sometimes and may be predisposing to your acne.Work stress, diet too may have a role to play in acne flare.I would suggest you to use a light make up and for as short a period of time as possible.Topically you may use a topical retinoid e.g Adapalene 0.1% gel at night.Topical retinoids are antiinflammatory as well as comedolytic and therefore prevent new acne in addition to treating existing ones. They also help lighten the marks. Use it over the whole affected area, once daily at night, 30 min after washing your face.Topical retinoids are also good for maintenance of improvement i.e once acne are cleared, you may use adapalene gel every alternate night Or twice weekly for maintenance of improvement.During day time you may use clindamycin 1% gel Or benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel only as a spot treatment for active acne.I would suggest a gentle cleansing lotion for you e.g cetaphil cleansing lotion, twice daily.You may also visit a dermatologist for a few sessions of chemical peeling. Salicylic acid peel is good for acne whereas glycolic acid peel for post inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) Or acne marks.Regardstake care", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "healthcare_magic", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The increase in color may be due to different factors like sun exposure, poor hygiene,internal diseases,nutritional deficiencies and poor nutrition. Complete body check up should be done to confirm that you do not have any disease or nutritional deficiency. Skinlite cream should be avoided as it contains harmful chemical..hydroquinone. To improve color of the face you avoid sun exposure, it causes tanning effect which ultimately darkens the skin. You apply sun screen gel like sun mask aquagel. You may apply kojic acid,vitamin C and arbutin containing cream on the face at night. And cleanse the face with glycolic acid and kojic acid containing face wash. You may take glutathion,viramin C and nicotininic acid tab orally for long time.

I had 2 slices of bread 8 hours ago. can of chicken soup 6 hours ago and 2 flour tortillas 5 hours ago. \n\n【1】**Answer**: Brief Answer: Need Further evaluation Detailed Answer: Hi Dear, Thanks for your query. Noted your symptoms and medical history of diabetes and High blood pressure. Also noted the history of acid reflux disease. Acid reflux can lead to ulcers in stomach or injury to stomach/esophagus lining. Some times, blood can spurt out from these and will be digested by stomach acid and the blood turns brownish. This could have been the brownish liquid which you threw up. I want to ask you few questions. Do you feel giddy on standing up ? Does your husband think that you are pale in your eyes and face now? Did you open your bowels since then? If yes, what was the colour? Black/dark brown ? and was it difficult to flush away ?? If any of the above is a YES, then please go to a hospital/ER ASAP. If you feel thirsty, please drink cold water. Avoid wine and alcohol completely. Please do not eat further if you are feeling nauseated. With your medical history of diabetes, ( is it Type 1 ?) and since you are taking Humalog and lantus ( i presume it is 3 times humalog and Lantus once), you can not avoid food and insulin for a long time. This is a concern. AVOID ASPIRIN or CLOPIDOGREL as well as all PAIN KILLERS. ( if you are taking steroids for any reason, please stop that as well). IT WOULD BE SAFE IF YOU GO TO A HOSPITAL ER and get evaluated. You need a lying and standing BP check up, Your Haemoglobin level, a stool test to see if there is any blood in that etc. If any of these are suspicious, then you will also need an upper gastro tract ENDOSCOPY. Besides, your diabetes need to be monitored when you are not eating much.

Please advise regards Ahmed \n\n【1】**Answer**: Brief Answer:about thyroid carcinoma follow up;Detailed Answer:Hello and thank you for asking!I have gone through your concern in details. An increase of antithyroglobulin level from 3.8 to 4.6 is not significant.Such small differences can be due to laboratory measurements.As you may know, the target of the absence of the tumor residue is thyroglobulin under 1 with negative antibodies (no matter high how they are when they are still within the normal ranges). The absence of thyroid issue and lymph nodes an ultrasound and a negative scintiscan once a year.So, you should not get worried about the antibodies but your physician will complete the other exams (once a year or occasionally) in order to be sure that everything is under control. Best wishes,Dr.Mirjeta \n\n【2】**Question**: Dear Doctor , thanks a lot for your reply.

Candida infection is a common complication after antibiotic use and it may also complicate anal fissure or don't let it to get heal quickly. This is why I strongly recommend you to discuss with your doctor about doing a stool test for candida and starting oral Nystatin.Anal fissure appart from discomfort and itching sensation doesn't prohibit you from travelling. It usually need 2-3 weeks for anal fissure to be healed (if there's no candida overgrowth infection it will require less).My opinion is that you don't need another treatment, you are already taking the best treatment strategy.

Please help. \n\n【1】**Answer**: Dentist,  Dr. Honey Arora's  Response Hi..Welcome to HEALTHCARE MAGIC..I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns..As per your complain it seems that itching in anus for 3 weeks can be due to causes like:-Poor hygiene maintenance.-Over wiping or cleaning.-Dryness in the anal area.-Pinworm infection.-Yeast infection.-Contact dermatitis or allergic reaction.-Hemorrhoids, anal fissures etc..As it is already 3 weeks you should now consult a Proctologist and get evaluated and a proper diagnosis and investigations like Micorscopic examination of scraping from the itchy areas can help in diagnosis and treatment of underlying cause can relieve the symptoms.As of now you should keep the area clean but avoid vigorous wiping..Wash the area gently with water and a mild moisturiser based soap..You should apply Zinc oxide based ointment or Petroleum jelly over the area..Wear loose fitting and cotton undergarments..You can also apply steroid ointment to relieve itching but do not use for a long duration for more than ten days to two weeks..You should avoid scratching the area to prevent infection..Hope this information helps..Thanks and regards..Dr.Honey Nandwani Arora..", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "healthcare_magic", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It should be prescribed by a dermatologist who knows which condition to start it for and when to stop. Moreover it is used in pigmentary disorders like melasma and not for improving skin tone or pimples. Long term use can cause steroid induced Rosacea, Acne, Thinning of skin, Redness and increased sensitivity to sunlight. It has to be stopped immediately under guidance of dermatologist because once you stop the cream skin is going to become bad and to control such flare ups a dermatologist is required. He will also suggest non steroidal creams and services for regular skin care.Hope this helpedTake care \n\n【2】**Answer**: Dermatologist,  Dr. Neera Kataria's  Response Hi, thanks for your query.Melacare has hydroquinone, tretinoin and momatosone. It is prescribed for hyper pigmentation disorders. Your son is using it for post inflammatory hyper pigmentation which is a sequel of acne.He may use it but for a brief period of 2 weeks as it has moderate potency steroid momatosone which should not be used for a long time as it can cause skin thinning and dependance. .Redness may occur due to tretinoin or hydroquinone. Both can cause sun sensitization so use of sunscreen is a must.It is best to use it under dermatological guidance so that side effects may be managed if they occur and alternative creams can be prescribed and long term use and dependance can be avoided.Hope this solves your query.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "healthcare_magic", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

This can introduce bacteria that can infect your cercalge and cause it to fail. I know there are other ways to masturbate, but anything, even clean hands can have some bacteria. Not only that, orgasm causes uterine contractions which can lead to preterm labor. Doctors generally advise no sexual activity what so ever, not even nipple stimulation. I would say no to masturbating.Be cautious in futureYou are welcome to ask any other query.Best of luckThanks", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "healthcare_magic", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Or if you have to wake up at nights from wheezing frequently or wheezing stops you from exercising, also I would suggest you Seroflo.Hope this will help you.Wish you best of the health.Regards.Dr Parin", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "healthcare_magic", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

He has suggested to do the TMT and Echo. The TMT report showed following words as conclusion \"DOWN SLOPING ST DEPRESSION SEEN IN II,III aVF AND V6. TMT is positive for Inducible Ischemia\". The doctor has suggested to go for ' Angiogram' after seeing the report. But my father has the medical record of having breathing problem due to allergic issues. So we suspect whether he need to go through angiography considering his medical record. Requesting your input regarding the same. Thanks! \n\n【1】**Answer**: Brief Answer:Perfusion scan, and a iodine free XXXXXXX for angiogram if neededDetailed Answer:Hello sir, I am Dr. Mody and I would be addressing your concern. Some basic information is your father diabetic, hypertensive, obese, a smoker and is he on any medication. Secondly what where his symptoms, breathlessness, chest pain or you just visited the doctor for low pulse rate. Also I would be happy if you can upload the ekg Now coming to the future action 1)The tmt report you suggested is considered positive if traditional risk factors are positive, than directly an angiogram is suggested. However when you go for the same, you do tell your doctor about the allergic part, as now there are non iodine containing XXXXXXX which doesn't have the same risk as previously, so he can safely go ahead with angiogram. 2)now if he is symptom free and no traditional risk factors, I would strongly recommend you to go ahead with what is perfusion scan (thallium perfusion scan), if that is normal than no need for angiography. And if it has any perfusion defext we should for sure go for one as to prevent future risk. Again in case senerio 1, we can get a perfusion scan, as many a times if angiogram shows 70-80 lesion, but there is normal perfusion, such cases should be managed medically and angioplasty will do no benefit. Hoping I could help, any further information I would be happy to assist. Dr. Priyank Mody, Lilavati Hospital, XXXXXXX \n\n【2】**Question**: He is a non-smoker and non-diabetic person. Been undergoing regular medication for weasing problem. Apart from the same he was not having any major medical issues.He was not having any symptoms. As he went to a periodic medical check with our family doctor, he found the breath rate was around 61 per minute so suggested to go for the consultation with cardiologist.I am attaching the following reports for your reference.1. TMT Report conclusion - Taken on 04.07.20152. ECHO Report - Taken on 04.07.20153. Lipid profile test - Taken on 31.07.20154. Pulmonary function test report - Taken on 07.03.2014 \n\n【3】**Answer**: Brief Answer:Echo lipids good, tmt it's interpretation so can't comment on sameDetailed Answer:Hello I did go through the reports, Lipids are perfectly ok n rather I would say desirable values for all of us :) 2d echo is normal too, however I would like to point out that it would change only after a silent attack, so the correlation of the blocks in heart with abnormal echo is not as good as TMT, the simple reason it was done at rest Pft is showing some evidence of asthmatic lung disease, the reason for his wheezing. Now the wheezing itself can cause false positive stress test, it means that the test came positive, though there is no underlying heart disease, also considering his age he may have Co existing heart disease, so how do we know it. 1) if it was my patient and facilities were available I would proceed with a thallium perfusion scan and if normal nothing needed and if any problem here than only proceed with angiogram. Also the benefit here is when we know there is a perfusion defect we can proceed with the angiogram and if block is present treat it at the same go because we know objectively that it is significant to cause decreased perfusion. . However if you and your doctor decides to go with angiogram, I would like to reassurance you that it would be safe in context of his wheezing and according to reports and clarification by you even routine XXXXXXX would be ok under proper care. Also I would think that it's a typo error where instead of his respiratory rate, the heart rate would be 61, which is normal at his age. Hopefully I could address your concern.

Depending on the site of infection i.e. SoM, inner ear infection etc. severity may be assessed. Surgical operations also have 100% success in very less no. of patients.Sarivadi vati given orally for long durations, some medicated oils made of herbs are directed to be instilled in the ear depending on infection and extent of damage. Modern ENT science doesn't allow instillation of oily drops but Ayurveda's specially designed ear drops of herbal oils are permitted.So you have the options open if modern drugs are not curing your child.

Your previous normal cardiac tests can confirm this. Is the chest pain triggered by body movements or respiration? This could be indicative for musculo-skeletal pain (as you are taking care of a baby, it is normal to have musculo-skeletal pain related to the physical effort or wrong position during staying or sleeping). Besides, anxiety could also play an important role in your symptomatology. Anyway, if your troubles persist, I would recommend going to the ER for a careful physical exam and some tests: - a resting ECG- a cervico-thoracic spinal column X ray study- some lab blood tests (complete blood count, blood electrolytes, kidney and liver function tests). I would also recommend checking your thyroid hormone levels as a thyroid dysfunction could trigger all this symptomatology.

What is your wife's height and weight?Going by your History, there seems to be nothing serious except your Smoking habit and your anxiety to impregnate your Wife. You can visit any of the pathology labs close to Chembur. You can also consider visiting XXXXXXX labs or Thyrocare Labs at Mumbai or pay a visit to XXXXXXX Hospital and Research Centre to get your Semen Analysis done.At this stage i would not suggest you this test or ask your wife to get examined as you have been planning for kids for just three months. The detailed testing for both of you is called for, if you have been trying for more than a year, so you can just relax.You and your Wife should follow these steps:1.) If you smoke and drink, avoid them.2.) Exercise regularly for 30 to 40 minutes daily and maintain a healthy weight.3.) Both of you should avoid high calorie foods, eat healthy nutritious balanced diet which should include fresh fruits and XXXXXXX leafy vegetables4.) If her periods are regular, get her examined by a Gynecologist to rule out if she has Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) or Thyroid problem as both these conditions reduce fertility.5.)

Yes you have read it right, you are supposed to have alternate day sex between the 10th and 20th day of her cycle.Ans 2.) The sperm reaches the eggs within seconds and there is no specific time range. She can go to restroom, 15 minutes after you have ejaculated inside her.Ans 3.)

Is this true? \n\n【5】**Answer**: Hello XXXXXXX Thank you once again for writing back.For your question, the normal ovulation happens on the 14th day in a 28 day cycle so accordingly you can plan and have unprotected sex on 10th, 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th and 20th day.Don't believe on the information which you get on the Internet they are not genuine, as they don't follow strict medical guidelines most of the time.

If your epiphysis (present at the end of long bones) has fused then growing taller is not possible naturally.You supplement with protein rich food and mean time do lot of stretching exercises (not muscle building) like swimming, cycling etc. This will definately help in growing taller if his epiphysis has not fused. Even proper sleep is required as growth hormone is released more during night. So early morning sleep is required. Hope I answered your question. Wish you good health.

Thank you for your query. If you have type 1 diabetes then likely you have some other autoimmune disorders which occur concomitantly like thyroid disorders, vitiligo of skin, low cortisol levels, celiac disease, reumatic arthritis etc. The symptoms of stiffness and pain in joints during morning hours warns that you should undergo a blood test for TSH, FT4, Serum RA factor to know the reason. And I hope your sugars are really under control (HbA1c less tha 7% and). Very high sugars is one of the reasons for joint pain sometimes and certainly a reason for burning sensation in feet soles. Physio exercises unlikely to help. Please make sure your sugars are fine and then you can consult a good Diabetologist for the burning pain in feet if it's not controlled further with good sugar control. Get back to me with the suggested blood test reports for further guidance.

Should we be concerned - maybe get a 2nd opinion?? \n\n【1】**Answer**: Internal Medicine Specialist,  Dr. omz's  Response hi Treatment options for the control of hypertension in patients of RENAL ARTERY STENOSIS(RAS) with atherosclerotic bilateral renal artery includes both medical and interventional therapy. Interventions aimed at preserving renal function in patients with bilateral renal artery stenosis Antihypertensive drugs — For hypertension control, we recommend an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker , often in combination with diuretic . Chlorthalidone is the preferred thiazide diuretic, but a loop diuretic (eg, furosemide or torsemide), may be required in patients who have chronic kidney disease with a significantly reduced glomerular filtration rate. Long-acting calcium channel blockers and beta blockers are also effective . Interventional therapy — Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with stenting is the preferred nonsurgical intervention. Three randomized trials, all with serious flaws, found no improvement in blood pressure, renal, or cardiovascular outcomes in patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis who were treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stent placement. We agree with the 2005 ACC/AHA guidelines on the management of peripheral artery disease, which recommended percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with stenting for ostial atherosclerotic lesions in patients who have clinical clues suggesting that the renovascular disease is likely to be responsible for hypertension that is not well controlled with optimal medical therapy Based upon the available data, we recommend not performing percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in patients who do not meet these criteria because the likelihood of benefit is small and the risk of procedural complications is relatively high. We agree with the 2005 ACC/AHA guidelines, which recommended surgery in patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis who have clinical indications for revascularization, particularly if they have multiple small renal arteries, early primary branching of the main renal artery, or require aortic reconstruction near the renal arteries for other indications (eg, aneurysm repair or severe aortoiliac occlusive disease) take care \n\n【2】**Answer**: Cardiologist,  Dr. Anantharamakrishnan's  Response Hi friend, Welcome to Health Care Magic I presume - the other stent is related to the renal artery? not in ureter!?

Very suscptible to bad throat. Can you help!Perpetual sneezing. \n\n【1】**Answer**: Brief Answer:Seems that all the symptoms occurring due to Allergic inflammation of noseDetailed Answer:Hello XXXXXXX XXXXXXX thank you for posting your query oh Health Care Magic.Looking at your symptoms, you are probably suffering from Allergic rhinitis (Inflammation of nose due to Allergy). Sneezing, watery nasal discharge are main symptoms of Allergy. Congestion and edema of the nose occurs due to inflammation. This leads to blockage of sinuses with retention of secretions in the sinuses leading to headache. The nasal secretions pass to the throat and irritate the throat leading to inflammation and throat pain.Laboratory tests used in the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis include the following: Allergy skin tests(it would help to find out that to which substances you are Allergic), Total serum IgE, Total blood eosinophil count(IgE and Eosinophil count might be elevated in case of Allergy). It would be advisable that you undergo these tests.Perpetual allergic rhinitis is typically caused by allergens within the home but can also be caused by outdoor allergens that are present year-round.In warmer climates, grass pollen can be present throughout the year. In some climates, individuals may be symptomatic due to trees and grasses in the warmer months and molds and weeds in the winter.Common causes include the faecal matter of the house dust-mite, animal proteins from domestic pets, and industrial dusts and fumes.The management of allergic rhinitis consists of 3 major categories of treatment, (1) environmental control measures and allergen avoidance, (2) pharmacological management, and (3) immunotherapy.Environmental control measures and allergen avoidance involve both the avoidance of known allergens (substances to which you are found allergic on allergy testing) and avoidance of nonspecific, or irritant, triggers.For dust mites, covering the mattress and pillows with impermeable covers helps reduce exposure. Bed linens should be washed every 2 weeks in hot water to kill any mites present. Thorough and efficient vacuum cleaning of carpets and rugs can help. Dust mites thrive when indoor humidity is above 50%, so dehumidification, air conditioning, or both is helpful. Control measures for mold allergy focus on reduction of excessive humidity and removal of standing water.For animal allergy, complete avoidance is the best option.Exposure to smoke, strong perfumes and scents, fumes, rapid changes in temperature, and outdoor pollution can be nonspecific triggers in patients with allergic rhinitis. Consider avoidance of these situations or triggers if they seem to aggravate symptoms.You might find relief by taking following medicines :Steroid Nasal spray like Mometasone-helps against allergy and reduces inflammation,Oral Decongestant like Phenylephrine and Nasal decongestant drops like Xylometazoline-they help to decongest the nose and sinus cavity and helps in nasal blockage (if you are not suffering from Hypertension)Antihistaminic like Levocetirizine-helps against Allergy,Analgesic and Anti-inflammatory like Ibuprofen,Antipyretic like Paracetamol 500mg sos after food, in case of feverAntacid like Rantac 150mg twice daily before food -It helps against the increased acid formation in stomach due to the use of Analgesic andSaline nasal spray-helps to moist the nasal cavity and removal of allergen particles from nose.If you suffer from high grade fever or fever continuous for more than 2 days,pus discharge from nose,etc suggesting of secondary bacterial infection,then you might need to take oral Antibiotics after consulting an Otolaryngologist Doctor.Also do steam inhalation. Do warm saline gargles. Avoid cold food.Immunotherapy: may be considered more strongly with severe disease, poor response to other management options in which the patient is introduced to gradually increasing doses of Allergen to which the patient is known to be sensitive on Allergy testing.Hope this answers your question.I would be happy to answer if you have any follow-up questions.Take care. \n\n【2】**Question**: So if I dont have fever, what's your recommendation in terms of medicines. Which sprays and medicine shouod i take, which the chemist will understand. \n\n【3】**Answer**: Brief Answer:Can take the medicines mentioned in the answer with a Doctor prescription .Detailed Answer:Hi,In that case, you may take following medicines:Steroid nasal spray (like Mometasone-1 puff-50ug two times a day in both the nostrils), Analgesic (like Ibuprofen-200mg-two times a day with Antacid (like Rantac 150 mg-two times a day before food), Antihistaminic(like Levocetirizine 5 mg -once a day at bedtime)Oral Decongestant (like containing Phenylephrine-10 mg -once or twice a day),Nasal Decongestant (Xylometazoline) drops (like Otrivin nasal drops-three drops three times a day not more than 7-10 days) and Saline Nasal spray.

(actually felt like something snapped) since then, Saturday night, i've experience swelling which i've treated w/ ice and general weakness in the area. its also completely discolored, turning to what looks like real bruising. i have a tough time walking, and putting weight on that foot. i'm pretty certain it's not structural, like a bone issue. i've been an athlete all my life so know when i've broken something. seems like a muscle tear or strain, just not sure if i just keep treating w/ pain med and ice that i'm getting anywhere little more info. when i lean back, keeping my legs straight, i feel the most pain, if i bend forward. to the left or right i have no pain. very difficult to stand one the right foot alone. \n\n【1】**Answer**: Brief Answer:Degenerative torn labrumDetailed Answer:Hi thereThanks for the query It appears that you could have arthritis of the hip with degenerative cartilage labrum which can cause the pain. It is best to continue icing, limb elevation, avoid squatting, cross leg sitting, climbing stairs. Do get an MRI of the hip if the pain does not subside in a week to look for Femoroacetabular impingement or degenerative torn labrum. I hope I have answered your query. I will be available to answer your follow up queries. Regards, Dr. Aashish Raghu \n\n【2】**Question**: in my reading and past i think thats correct at least the tear of the labrum. i've started to see a little improvement. how long should i expect to have pain that stops me from my normal activities, such as comfortable walking or even golf? i no longer run but swim for cardio so that wont affect this. if in my walking gate i allow my right leg to go to far back, i fell a lot of discomfort. \n\n【3】**Answer**: Brief Answer:Avoid much hip joint extreme movements, do swimming, do MRI Detailed Answer:Non limb loading activities like swimming and aerobics won't hurt the joint in arthritis. Better to get an MRI to know where we stand in the diagnosis. A key hole arthroscopic survey can be done to repair or remove the torn labrum as seen on the MRI. Pain will subside when you avoid excessive hip joint motion.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "healthcare_magic", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

I never had this before March of this year, and now have had this happen 4 times since then. \n\n【1】**Answer**: Hi XXXXXX, Thanks for writing in. The rash you are describing can be tinea carporis,scabies,contact dermatitis etc. Also I would like to know- Is it scaly? Itching is more in day or more in night time?

PS. In baby: check for any signs of infection, oral thrush or viral disease and make sure to feed 4-6 hours after the dose is taken. \\[but since the dose taken is too low for the drug to enter the breast milk and affect your baby adversely so follow the dosage instructions given by your physician.

PS. In a nutshell, tapering the drug/dose gives the adrenal gland time to return to their normal pattern of secretion, thus under no circumstances, you should stop/start any medicine(s) without first consulting with your attending Physician.

First off, I was a moderate to heavy drinker for roughly 10 years but quit and have not had a drink in more than 3 years. I have felt and feel completely healthy but had a physical earlier this year and total bili was 2.0. Doctor did not recommend a follow up but being a health hypochondriac, I requested a follow up which showed total bili at 2.6. In both cases, all other tests were normal (ALT/AST/Albumin etc) Doctor chalked it up to Gilbert's or my Thalassemia (was diagnosed w/ Thal at a young age and still have it). I requested an abdominal ultrasound and came back with fatty liver diagnosis. Doctor was completely unconcerned and said that I just need to loose weight (gained 30 lbs in last year). A side note (no pun intended) is that since the high bili, I have noticed discomfort in the right side. Generally lower than where I perceive the liver to be but in that relative area. I would note that I have not experienced this in several weeks though since going on a low carb diet. Lastly, I have anxiety issues and have been prescribed clonazepam. When on clonazepam, I generally notice my stool being more firm and lighter in color. When not on clon, it is generally normally color but rather loose which I attribute to gastro withdrawal symptoms. My primary care physician says I have absolutely nothing to worry about so long as a stay on my diet/lose weight and never tough alcohol again. You're general thoughts on this prognosis would be appreciated. \n\n【1】**Answer**: Brief Answer: Bilirubin level not worrisome affected by following factors Detailed Answer: Hi XXXX, I have gone through your medical history carefully and can say as following: 1. You are saying to have done a liver function test where transaminases (TA) resulted normal but bilirubin was slightly elevated. As a former heavy drinker, partially such elevation of bilirubin is addressed to alcohol. Another possible cause is Gilbert's syndrome as your doctor is suggesting. In this case, there is nothing worrisome as long as TA are within normal range. Thalassemia is characterized by erythrocytes destruction which can also contribute to increased bilirubin. Fatty liver is also another factor, but in your case is not worrisome again due to normal TA. 2. You are also reporting to have a discomfort in your right side. This is not related neither to bilirubin nor to liver problems. Most probably related to colon issues. I advise to: - avoid foods high in fat/sugar and carbonated drinks that would cause gas and triggering such discomfort substenquently - avoid using a straw while drinking 3. With regards to clonazepam, as per any other medication, it carries its own side effect by affecting liver. However, this is still not worrisome. The color and consistency of stool depends on many factors including diet (which is very important), physical activity, water intake, and medications. Altogether they will affect stool. In your case, I agree with your doctor: stopping alcohol and switching to a healthy diet can improve you current GI problems. Hope it was of help!

I%E2%80%99m havng afib.called my dr @nite after hours. he says take rx, sotalol, 80mgs bid plus aspirin and come in 2 days if not resolved. am I in danger? suggestions? \n\n【1】**Answer**: Brief Answer:I would explain as follows:Detailed Answer:Hello!Welcome on - Ask a Doctor - service!I understand your concern and would like to explain that your doctor's prescription could be an option of managing atrial fibrillation. Other anti-arrhythmic drugs like Propafenone (pill-in-pocket), Flecaininde, etc. could be used as well.Aspirin should be used as well; although it is not so effective as anticoagulants at preventing cardio-embolic events found in afib patients.Coming to this point, as your doctor advised, if irregular rhythm doesn't resolve in 24 - 48 hours, you should contact your doctor to review your clinical conditions and try alternative medical strategies to manage your rhythm disorder.It is necessary to check your ECG and renal function test while on on Sotalol to prevent potential adverse effects (increased QTC interval on ECG) leading to pro-arrhythmic phenomena.It is necessary to check your QTc interval on ECG; if QTc> 450 ms use of Sotalol is contraindicated.Before starting Sotalol an ECG, BUN and creatinine, blood electrolytes level should be checked.In case you have an actual ECG done, you could upload it here for a direct review and a second professional opinion.Hope to have been helpful to you!In case of any further questions, feel free to ask me again.Kind regards,Dr. Ilir Sharkacardiologist \n\n【2】**Question**: I didn’t have room to write everything before. I had my first afib 7 years ago and this is my third. Sotalol 80 mg bid has worked well and dr. took me off Eliquis first 3 months. My immediate concern is will waiting 2 days be dangerous. This started about 10 hours ago and it’s better than it was. I had a few drinks last night which I rarely do. My guess it will resolve on its own. Do you agree. Will a clot possibly develop in 48 hours presenting potential danger to me. I’ll tell you this. I’ll never drink again. I had 5 last night which is highly unusual. Heart rate is in the low 79s and earlier around 95. Also earlier it would speed up and slow down quickly. Now it’s much more gradual. I feel like I’m coming thru this. What do you think Dr? \n\n【3】**Answer**: Brief Answer:Opinion as follows:Detailed Answer:Hello again!I agree with you that there is a high likelihood the heart rhythm issue will resolve in the next hours and Sotalol will should effective considering the fact it has been in the past.The possibility this new onset afib will develop a dangerous clotis quite seem to be quite low (irrelevant), considering the fact you don't have any prior cardiac structural disorder, no issues of heart failure, no hypertension, diabetes of prior thromboembolic event. In case Afib doesn't resolve in the next few hours, switching to anticoagulation therapy would be an option.As your heart rate is becoming less variable, the probability of conversion to normal sinus rhythm is high.Anyways, it is necessary to check your rhythm repeatedly.Let me know in case of any further questions.Regards,Dr. Iliri \n\n【4】**Question**: fyi. I went to the dr. today to follow up on this. I felt totally normal and when thd dr. listened to my heart he said it sound excellent. the only ofd thing was on my ekg the p wave was minuscule. virtually unseeable. the dr. was skeptical and mentioned the computer very possibly was not picking up thr p wave. so he told me to resume all normal activities inclusing exercuse, no alcohol, minimal caffiene and to comd back in a week to do another ekg. for safety he advised taking eliquis for that week as the absense of thd p wave, if accurate, could inducate afib even though he could hear nothing and was very skeptical about the reading or me being in afib. what are your thoughts Dr? come back in a week for a follow uo ekg and in the meantime to eliquis until then just in case. thoughts dr? \n\n【5】**Answer**: Brief Answer:I would explain as follows:Detailed Answer:Hello again!I am glad to hear that you are actually on normal sinus rhythm. I perdonally would recommend performing an ambulatory ECG 24-48 hour monitoring( Holter ) in order to examine your heart rhythm trends for a prolonged period of time and investigate for the possible presence of episodes of atrial fibrillation, that may not be registered on the resting ECG. This test would also guide on the decision of taking eliquis or not. In clinical practice, after conversion of longstanding Afib, atrial muscle ( that is the upper heart chamber) may remain stunned for 2-3weeks.In such case anti coagulation use is justified during this period to prevent thrombosis complications. But in your case, atrial fibrillation has been present for no more than 48hours and the thrombotic risk is quite low. So, Aspirin 100mg daily would be a reasonable treatment choice. Anyway, if there is no increased risk of bleeding, eliquis will be OK for a week. I remain at your disposal for any further questions whenever you need!Regards, Dr.Iliri \n\n【6】**Question**: Your extremely thorough answers and interest are both appreciated and heartwarming. I sincerely thank you. I actually played 90 minutes of tennis today in 95 degree Florida weather. I am a 4-5 times a week player but I’ll admit to being nervous out there today. Turns out everything was fine. I played well, didn’t run out of breath, got a great sweat and my heart stayed in normal rhythm and only elevated to around 100 bpm. I go in for follow up ekg and consult on Tuesday. My plan is to continue living my life but abstain from alcohol as that is the obvious trigger. Any other hints RE keeping my heart healthy is appreciated. Last email you mentioned a 24/48 hour holter. Just FYI I had that and the echo this past fall. Both we normal. It’s the alcohol. The cause effect relationship is absolutely obvious. One problem I have is I own a very successful business where social drinking is part of the culture. In your opinion would a drink or two once or twice a month be ok? Or do you think once this cycle has started, totally abstaining is the key. God bless you Dr. Sharka. You surely are a great guy. My name is Rich. \n\n【7】**Answer**: Brief Answer:My opinion as follows:Detailed Answer:Dear Rich,Your appreciation means a lot to me!A small amount of alcohol time after time is quite Ok.I would also recommend avoiding also caffeine intake and taking plenty of water in order to stay well hydrated. I would recommend the Holter, because it can help register your heart rate for a prolonged period of time and also help 'catch' atrial fibrillation episodes which can not be registered by a resting ECG.Hope you will find this information helpful!Please let me know in case of further uncertainties!Wishing all the best, Dr.Iliri", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "healthcare_magic", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Parmar's  Response Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for you as follows:1. I usually prescribe my such patients an antihistamine like cetirizine/levocetirizine/fexofenadine for 7-14 days regularly.2. If you have such symptoms frequently, I would also think of allergy and would add montelukast to above suggested antihistamine.3. I would like to know your nose symptoms like nose congestion, running nose, sneezing, etc. If they are present, I would suggest you regular steam inhalation which may help.4. Regular warm saline gargles will also soothe your throat and reduce throat irritation and therefore cough. 5. In general, please avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.6. If you notice that your voice is changed, I would suggest to avoid speaking too much/too loudly and get an advice from speech therapist. This is because I can understand that you are a teacher which needs a lot of use of vocal cords. 7. If you have such complaints frequently, I would suggest you allergy testing for air-borne allergens such as house dust mites, molds, pollens, insect proteins, animal dander, etc. If this is your first episode, I would not think of allergy and hence would not suggest allergy testing.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish you the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "healthcare_magic", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Detailed Answer: Hi XXXXXXX Its nice to hear from you after so long. In RCT there may be calcified canal in some cases,if tooth is asymptomatic & canal is completely calcified then it can be left.But once the root canal is completed you should not go for immediate capping of tooth.Wait for at least 2 months,if it doesn't pain then go for capping.

Thank You \n\n【1】**Answer**: Dentist,  Dr. Honey Arora's  Response Hi..Thanks for the query..It looks like there has been ulceration of the lip mucosa due to injury with the popsicle and due to inflammation it is painful and burning..As you are breastfeeding I would suggest you to apply only topical medication to be on a safer side..You can clean the area with hydrogen peroxide followed by cleaning with antiseptic solution.You can apply numbing gel containing Lidocaine over it so that there is relief in burning..You can apply antiseptic ointment containing Metronidazole or Chlorohexidine over it..Avoid swallowing then and spit out the saliva when you apply them..If there is pain you can take Acetaminophen..Do cool compresses over the area..Hope this helps..Regards.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "healthcare_magic", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

I have a navel piercing which is infected. I have seen my doctor and she prescribed me some anti biotics and she said I should take out the jewellery. But my piecer does not recommend me to remove the navel jewellery for fear that the small bump or abscess under my skin around the jewellery bar will get worse and form an abscess and deep scar tissue. My doctor claims that once a foreign object is out... the infection will heal even if the navel piercing hole has closed and the likelihood of the abscess to get worse is very slim since I am on a course of broad spectrum antibiotics. My doctor also says that with a foreign object in my body.. the infection will be hard to treat and a stronger form of medication will be required. I am torn to whether I should listen to my piercer or doctor. I just don't want the minor abscess or bump under my skin to get worse once I remove the navel jewellery. My health is my first priority. \n\n【1】**Answer**: Brief Answer:Removal of jewellery is recommendedDetailed Answer:Hello,Thank you for writing to us on HCM.Its a common occurrence to have infection and allergic reaction after piercing.I think as advised by your doctor, I too would recommend removal of jewellery(foreign body) for proper healing of the infection.Once foreign object is removed and you complete the course of oral and topical antibiotics, I am pretty sure your condition will resolve.Let me know if you require any more assistance from my side.Thank youDr Hardik Pitroda \n\n【2】**Question**: Thanks you for the fast reply Doctor. Once the jewellery is taken out by my piercer, there will be an open hole in my navel for the moment. Should I cover up the hole with a band aid or clean gauze after cleaning with the antiseptic solution around the piercing and applying topical antibiotic ointment in he piercing wound and should the piercer try to clean out the pus trapped within the piercing? \n\n【3】**Answer**: Brief Answer:Apply antibiotic cream after removal of jewelleryDetailed Answer:Hello,Sorry for late reply.I would suggest that you ask the piercing guy to just remove the jewellery.After removal of jewellery, the wound should be left open and apply good antibiotic like Mupirocin cream thrice a day. This coupled with oral antibiotics will take care of any infection and will heal your wound in few days.Hope you got my point here.Thank youDr Hardik Pitroda \n\n【4】**Question**: Thank you for your reply Doctor. I get the last point you just mentioned. Now the navel jewellery has been removed and the wound is healing. I am taking oral antibiotics and applying topical antibiotics on my wound after cleaning with an antiseptic solution and I would leave the wound exposed. The top wound opening has closed up after a day of the jewellery removal. The cleaning and cream application is done twice a day as per doctors instructions. I just notice that my navel piercing wound is now itchy. I hope it is a good sign of it healing? It is not red and the minor bump under the skin has reduced in size thankfully. Will it also speed up the healing if I did warm sea salt soak on the would with an inverted cup once a day to help the wound dry up? Thank you doctor for your replies. \n\n【5】**Answer**: Brief Answer:Oral antihistaminics to relieve itchDetailed Answer:Hello,Little itching is common sign of healing wounds.Yes you may use sea salt soak for faster healing.In addition take oral antihistamincs like Benadryl to control itching.I am sure you will be fine soon.Thank youDr Hardik Pitroda", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "healthcare_magic", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Mostly a normal anatomical variant.Detailed Answer:Hi,Thank you for your query.1. The bone behind the ear is known as the mastoid part of the temporal bone. 2. The mastoid process develops after the age of 2 years and protrudes out in different sizes in different people and differently at times on both sides of the same person, depending upon the development of an air cell system inside the bone. Also the pull of the main neck muscle also cause this 'sticking' out of the bone.3. This is known as pneumatization of the mastoid bone and it varies from person to person and between both sides of the same person. Various factors are responsible for this.4. If you have no symptoms, ignore this as a normal anatomical variant.5. If you still wish, get an examination from a local ENT Specialist. If the imaging is normal, no further follow-up is necessary.I hope that I have answered your query. If you have any further questions, I will be available to answer them.

It feels like its in the bone . I also feel sick most of the time to the point I throw up and I am tired all the time what do you think is causing this? \n\n【1】**Answer**: Brief Answer: Anemia;Atopy Detailed Answer: Hello and welcome to healthcaremagic I am Dr. Kakkar. I have gone through your query and I have understood it. Your medical history of Anemia is significant, because anemia could be the cause of Tiredness/ lack of Energy as well as itching Pruritus is the initial symptom in number of a systemic disease commonly Thyroid, Diabetes and Iron deficiency anemia. I would suggest that you start with an Iron supplement (if not already) and also get a few lab tests for thyroid (TSH levels) and blood sugar. Another possible reason for itchy legs could be that, may be you are Atopic(prone to dry skin and allergies). Atopics have dry skin and dry skin is itchy People who are atopic/allergic have a low water retentive capacity of the skin, which leads to trans-epidermal water loss from the skin into the atmosphere specially when the weather is cold and dry thereby resulting in a dry itchy skin. Soaps exacerbates the condition further. In such a situation it is advisable to apply a good moisturizer as frequently as possible. Moisturizers hydrate as well as form an occlusive film thereby preventing further loss of moisture from the skin. Moisturizers specially those which contain hygroscopic (attract water from the atmosphere and lock it into the skin) and keratoloytic agents like Ammonium lactate, Urea, Lactic acid and Glycerin and Hyaluronic acid are specially useful in such cases. Moisturizers should be applied as frequently as possible I usually ask my patients to mix a potent topical steroid like mometasone furoate and moisturizer (in equal proportions, 1:1) and apply at least twice daily. Try to avoid using soaps OR use a gentle cleansing body wash. An OTC antihistamine once daily e.g cetrizine or loratadine would help you symptomatically. Once the condition improves with this combination, usually within 2-4 weeks, only moisturizers alone would suffice. I hope you will find this useful Regards take care \n\n【2】**Question**: its not any of these and I have had an iron infusion at the hospital to fix the aniema. we have ruled out period and dry skin and allergies. I just wanted to see if you could put a different spin on this. I have also had a ct scan and my kidneys checked. \n\n【3】**Answer**: Brief Answer: Pruritus of unknown origin Detailed Answer: I would label it as Pruritus of unknown origin. For 'Pruritus of unknown origin', As a treating doctor my First line of treatment would be: -Non-sedating antihistamines e.g Fexofenadine 180mg once daily; Loratadine 10mg once daily. The dose can be safely titrated upwards upto 4 times the recommended dose i.e Fexofenadine XXXXXXX upto 720mg in a day in divided doses and loratadine XXXXXXX upto 40mg in a day in divided doses. If this proves ineffective or insufficient then i would like to add a First generation sedating antihistamines once or twice daily preferably at night e.g Hydroxyzine or Pheniramine or doxepin. This much is usually sufficient in most of the patients but if needed gabapentin can be given in addition to these Or may be Pregabalin can be given in place of gabapentin as it has a better tolerability profile as compared to gabapentin in terms of sedation.

It indicates an internal bleeding anywhere in the reproductive tract. It can be confirmed by the presence of RBCs and WBCs in urine deposit on laboratory investigation. Infection and inflammation of seminal vesicle an accessory reproductive gland also sometimes present with pink color urine after a heavy sex.

Patil's  Response HelloThanks for your query.Based on the facts that you have posted it appears that you have noticed colour of urine being pinkish after having frequent sex over a short period.Normally after sexual intercourse small quantity of semen remains in the urethra attached to urethral mucosa and it is most likely this semen gets mixed with urine when you pass urine after sex giving pink colour to your urine.It is a natural phenomenon and nothing to worry about.Ensure to drink more water before and after sexual intercourse .Dr.Patil.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "healthcare_magic", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Reply may be sent to my email YYYY@YYYY Thanks \n\n【1】**Answer**: Brief Answer:Antibiotic,Sinus flushing,Salt water gargle,DrugsDetailed Answer:Hi thanks for using XXXXXXX I went through the query and attachments and understood your concern.For my patients suffering from allergy along with recurrent pharyngitis for past many years, I usually check for any ENT problem like polyp, DNS or chronic sinusitis. Since you have undergone septiplasty and your nasal patency is normal, the cause for foul smelling post nasal secretion may be due to chronic sinusitis or any pus collection (problem in tonsils or adenoids). For now you can try flushing out sinus with your doctor assistance to remove sinus collection (if any),Concentrated salt water gargle and steam inhalation 3 times a day, take a course of antibiotic like amoxiclav for 3 days with NSAID like Paracetamol three times a day with Odimont LC (You are taking Odimont AL) after consulting your doctor.These measures will prevent current problem. After 3 days you can continue Plain Odimont 10 mg, Mometasone nasal spray (Nasonex) to prevent allergic problem with salt water gargle and steam inhalation every day. If the problem continues even with this measure then get done skin prick test for the allergen and can avoid it or can take sensitization therapy to prevent its reaction.I hope this answered your query and is helpful for you. Feel free to ask if any related query and I will be glad to answer them.If you like my answers kindly rate it, and write a review as well. Wish you a very happy life and good health.Regards \n\n【2】**Question**: Sir Now i am taking warm salt gargle which seems to be effective.I tell brief history of my disease that earlier i have been told allergic rhinitis which is from my childhood.I have tonsil operation in childhood.But later this allergy seems to travel in my mouth.There is small granular like spots in my throat for many year and i have to spit which is some times yellow ,greenish and black sputum in morning.Every morning sputum in mouth comes out which get accumulated in night.This mouth secretion is continuous ,in every half hour i have to clear my mouth by spit.Doctor told this is allergy which have not complete diagnose only can be controlled.Even foul smell comes from mouth and wife always complain this.In polluted and stressful environment this secretion in mouth increases very severely. My concern is that is there any effective remedy against this disease so that i can lead normal life.In office i cant sit more than half hour without spitting secretion accumulated in mouth.This problem is very old more than twenty year old ,WHICH I am carrying on. Doctor has advised immuglobin injection which he advised to administer three in number ,with one in each week. Also advise precuation and home therapy and alternative medicine .Main purpose is relief from this problem. With regards Further i want to add that i am doing nasal irrigation of salt water every morning through which i get relief throughout day otherwise nasal secretion also starts.There is no polyp.But post nasal dripping problem is there.I am sensitive to oily and cold food as it increases throat secretion .Throat is hyper sensitive. With regard XXXX \n\n【3】**Answer**: Brief Answer:Drugs, Evaluation required.Detailed Answer:Hi XXXXXXX Thanks for writing back with detailed history.1. Continue nasal irrigation and warm salt water gargle. You can try betadine gargle every day.2. Since allergic, you can have montelukast every day which will control inflammation due to allergy.3. Mometasone nasal spray (Nasonex) to prevent allergic.4. yellow ,greenish and black sputum: Need to be concerned. Yellow and green suggests bacterial infection. You need anti bacterial for the same. But Black sputum suggests aspergillosis (fungi), you need anti fungal treatment. This need to be controlled then only we can control all other symptoms. Even since you are suffering from 20 years yoy might have tried steroid drugs which may increase the risk of fungus.5. Get done skin prick test to know the allergen causing problem and then based on the result you can try sensitisation test/immunotherapy whic will cure the allergic manifestation. So I advice you to consult your ENT specialist, get done nasal endoscopy to visualise the site of infection (may be fungal), with your doctor advise you may need antibiotic (like Amoxicillin + clavulanic acid) or antifungal (like azoles/terbinafine) treatment. With this get done skin prick test and further treatment based on this.Hope this helps you.Regards", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "healthcare_magic", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

The most common cause of palpitations are premature atrial beats, followed by premature ventricular beats, which can be annoying at times but are not life-threatening. Of course, a sustained arrhythmia of the heart can also give palpitations, but it is less common. The best way to find that out depends on the frequency of the symptoms. If they happen daily, then a werable monitor such as a Holter can help detect abnormalities in the heart rhythm. If more infrequent, then an event monitor can be recommended.

Regarding your concern, I would explain that as far as bicuspid aortic valve isn't associated wt aortic stenosis or significant aortic regurgitation, and he is clinically asymptomatic, surgery would not be an option to consider. The only care to be paid is prophylactic treatment for endocarditis before any invasive procedures in the future, and a periodic follow up by his attending cardiologist (physical exam and repeated cardiac ultrasounds).In general bicuspid aortic valve with time is complicated with aortic stenosis, regurgitation and sometimes aortic root dilation.

All your symptoms like pain from ear to jaw on one side, pain while moving head, pain around eye etc. suggest that you are suffering from sinusitis, i.e. your sinus is congested. As your throat hurts too, it seems that you are suffering from cold. As the sinus is congested with mucus which is fluid like, when you move the head, it moves inside causing pressure in the sinus. I would advise you to use over the counter decongestants to clear the sinuses. In addition, inhalation of hot water vapor and antihistamines such as Levocetrizine 5 mg (Levocet) once a day for 5 days can help. If these over the counter medicines don't help, then you should see an ENT specialist for examination of the sinuses and further treatment.I hope this information helps you.

From the pattern of eruptions you describe,i feel you have Herpes Labialis. This is an infection of the lips, mouth, or gums due to the herpes simplex virus. It causes small, painful blisters commonly called cold sores or fever blisters.They usually appear within 1-3 weeks after you come into contact with the virus. symptoms preceding eruptions include:Itching,burning or tingling of the lips or skin around mouth. Symptoms may go away on their own without treatment in 1 to 2 weeks.Antiviral medicine can be prescribed. It can help reduce pain and make your symptoms go away sooner. Medicines used to treat mouth sores include:Acyclovir,Famciclovir,Valacyclovir.These medicines work best if you take them when you have warning signs of a mouth sore, before any blisters develop. hope this helps..take care! \n\n【2】**Answer**: General & Family Physician,  Dr. Veera Raghava Rao Buddha.'s  Response Hi welcome to Health care magic forum. As you describe the bumps appears to be due to dehydration and secondary infection. When dry lips are not there the infection ceases. as they are dry again it recurs. I advise you to consult a dermatologist for diagnosis and treatment. Other causes could be low fever, gastric irritation, anxiety etc which can cause dry mouth and lips. I advise you to follow some diet recommendations as avoid taking more of spices, chillies, junk foods, and oilyfoods. as these may cause dry mouth.

Reason?", "text": "【0】Was Using Sunbed. Stopped Sunbeds And Started Limiting Sun Exposure Due To Risk Of Skin Cancer. Noticed Purple Circle Around Eyes. Reason?\n**Question**: Question: hi, I am 31, I am phototype III-IV and always have been tanning well - naturally during summer and also using a sunbed in winter (once a month or every 3 weeks). I recently stopped sunbeds and started limiting sun exposure due to risk of skin cancer and premature aging, and now I use fake XXXXXXX I started noticing purple circles under my eyes though that look very unsightly - and I an thinking of using sunbed again. Would this make them look better or make them worse in the long run ? is there any alternative to tanning to make them go away ? Many thanks XXXXXXX \n\n【1】**Answer**: Hi XXXXXXX Welcome to XXXXXXX Thanks for writing your query here. Fake tanning now a days commonly used since it reduces chances of skin cancers and aging. There are many preparations available for fake tans such as lotions, sprays, tanning tablets, bronzres etc.Most of these are safe, but, due caution has to be taken while applying near eyes and mouth. So it is possible that you may have got allergy to XXXXXXX product. Also many XXXXXXX products contain sunscreen but not in adequate amount. So you may have developed photoallergy to XXXXXXX product. Use protective eye wears, apply sunscreen lotion, take oral antioxidants. You can just apply mild steroid like desowen over pigmentation. Also let me know which fake XXXXXXX you are using, and accordingly we can decide whether to continue with it or change it. Thanks. \n\n【2】**Question**: Dear Dr XXXXXXX Yes I was wondering whether the purple circles are due to my natural XXXXXXX getting lighter (and the circles just more noticeable) or whether they are linked to the use of fake XXXXXXX or orher cosmetic products. The product I use is \"everyday mousturiser for face\" made by \"St. Tropez\". It certainly works well on my face but I think the area under my eyes is looking worse (wrinkles more pronounced, sometimes puffiness, creepiness). I thought these were normal signs of aging, so I have also tried a range of other anti-wrinkle products in the last 6months, which I have discontinued now and I just use a regular moisturizer. Would you recommend that I don't use the fake XXXXXXX product under my eyes? Also, I forgot to mention that my circles are not more pigmented that the rest of my face, it seems that there is less pigment and the red/purple veins under the skin are noticeable... \n\n【3】**Answer**: Hi,Thanks for follow up.Skin around eyes is always thin than other parts of body.Since you have applied a lot of anti wrinkle creams around eyes ,skin around your eyes has become more thin like paper and it is showing veins under the skin.Since you have already stopped the products and applying only moisturizer,it will recover in some days.Gently massage your periorbital skin so that congestion of veins is relived.Now regarding application of XXXXXXX products, skin around eye is naturally paler and if you apply XXXXXXX it will look somewhat unnatural so better avoid it and if you want to apply XXXXXXX apply some eye cream first and then your tanning product.But for a while do not apply till your periorbital skin gets back to normal.Thanks.Take care.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "healthcare_magic", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Can Delayed Periods Cause This?\n**Question**: Question: Hi, I am 45 woman, not diabetic, all previous hospital blood tests were normal. I randomly check it with a blood glucose moniter, and am usually below 6 mmol/l. However today when I got up I decided to checkmy blood sugar, and it was 6.8, which is surprising to me. It remained high all day, 2 hours after a meal of 2 chicken and cheese sandwishes, I was at 8.3. What is going on? Last week I checked everything was within normal range. I'm PMSing hard, my periods are late.... can this be the cause of my high numbers today? Should I be concerned? I am scheduled for my annual blood work in a few days, should I wait until my periods are over so I don't get a falsely high result? I also would like to know if the normal blood glucose tests we get in labs produce similar values than we have at home, or higher? Thank you. \n\n【1】**Answer**: Hi,Thanks for posting your query.There is nothing that you actually need to worry about. Random blood glucose levels between 3.9-6.9 mmol/L are considered normal. The reading of 8.3 mmol/L was high as it was 2 hours after a meal. It reflects impaired glucose tolerance and since you are already diabetic and had a heavy meal, this can be justified. However, I would strongly advise you to follow the dietary modification that your physician has recommended for you.You need not wait for your periods to be over to get your lab work done as long as you keep yourself well hydrated by drinking plenty of fluid. The methods used in laboratories are generally more accurate than the ones used by a glucometer that we use at home. However, in general, both tests produce similar results. I suggest you to also get one glycosylated hemoglobin (Hba1c) test done when you visit your lab. This is better than blood sugars alone; indicating how your sugars have been for the last 3 months. It is recommended that this test is done every 3 months in a diabetic patient.I hope I have answered your query. Please accept my answer if you have no more follow up queries. Regards \n\n【2】**Question**: Hello Doctor, As I wrote in the first sentence, I am NOT diabetic. Always had normal glucose tests in the past. The last fasting one was in XXXXXXX 2010, and it came back at 4.9. Like I said, I am under ENORMOUS personnal stress right now, since about a year ago. Can stress elevates my blood sugar readings in the morning, when I'm at a couple of days of having my periods? Like I said, I tested at home about 3 times in the last months, and ll my readings were under 6. I have no clue what's going on, as those number are really strange for me.Thank you. \n\n【3】**Answer**: Hi,I am sorry, I mixed it up. Physiological stress is known to cause Hyperglycemia (or elevated glucose levels) but this occurs in patients who are critically ill, patients who are admitted in the intensive care unit. Many women do report an elevation of blood glucose occurring from three to five days prior to the beginning of their menstrual periods. This occurs due to an increase in estrogen and progesterone levels post ovulation. Blood sugars typically return to normal levels within the first day or two after the period starts.I would suggest that you check your blood glucose levels 2-3 days after your period starts. If the values are still abnormal, you could get fasting blood glucose and post prandial blood glucose estimation (2 hours after eating a meal) done.I hope I have answered your query.

Our chiropractor has told me to do this for my husband daily. \n\n【1】**Answer**: Brief Answer:Anchor, stirrup, Spur , Basket weave, continues..Detailed Answer:Hello,Welcome to XXXXXXX Please follow the following methods to apply for heel lock bandage.PREPARE THE SKIN1.Shaving the area2. Cleaning the area by using a tape remover to remove the body oil.3. Covering any rashes or wound with a non-stick wound pad.1. Joints are normally strapped in their “at rest” position.2. Do not use the limb to pull against when getting the tape off the roll.3. Hold the roll in one hand and pull the tape off with the other hand, then apply gently OR cut off the required number of strips of the correct length before you start applying.Basic Techniques.1. Anchor - provides a firm base to attach the other 38mm or 50mm tapes.2. Stirrup - a vertical “U” piece of tape, supporting either side of the ankle.3. Spur - a horizontal stirrup that holds the ankle in position.4. Basket-weave - Stirrups and spurs in half overlapping layers to build a pattern.5. Locking straps - short circular tapes to cover all exposed skin and lock down the tape job.6. Foam padding - used to fill in hollows, compress swelling and pad sensitive areas.7. Figure of six - to support and reinforce one side of the ankle. Starts as a stirrup and crosses to form a six.8. Interlocking sixes - the over-lapping tapes provide excellent support to one side of the joint.9. Half-Heel Lock - 38 or 25mm rigid tape is applied over thefinished tape job to firmly lock in the ankle joint.10.First Half-Heel Lock - the tape makes a ‘U’ to lock in one side ofthe heel.11. Second Half-Heel Lock - opposite to the first. Supports the otherside and further restricts ankle movement.12. Figure-8 Bandage - used with a compression bandage for RICER.13. Figure-8 - also used with a 75 or 50 mm elastic bandages forstrong support.14. Spica - the thumb Spica is a repeated figure 8 in 25 mm rigid orelastic tape.16. Elastic and Rigid Tape Together - a combination of an ElasticAdhesive Bandage and Rigid Strapping Tape provides optimalsupport.17. Full Heel Lock In 75mm Elastic - another way of over wrapping rigidtape for firm support. It is like two half heel locks without stopping.18. Spiral taping - (white tape) complete the over wrapping technique tocompletely encase the Rigid Tape.Wathch the video and read the pdf file for further use.www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzrYDh6RuxE‎ WWW.WWWW.WW au/wp-content/uploads/Ankle-strapping1.pdf‎Hope this helps.Please reply for further queries.Wishing you good health.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "healthcare_magic", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

What should I do. Swelling has gone down since it the hit. It has been 2 days. \n\n【1】**Answer**: Dentist,  Dr. Honey Arora's  Response Hi..Welcome to HEALTHCARE MAGIC..As per your query painful lump over the shin after being hit by football is due to inflammation and hematoma formation..Due to injury there is rupture to small blood vessels leading to spillage of blood into the soft tissues and along with it there is also release of inflammatory exudate,collection of inflammatory cells and accumulation of dead tissue in the area of injury, all of which leads to redness, swelling and rise in temperature in that area..At times the hematoma gets encapsulated and localized and there is formation of a hard tender and firm lump..No need to worry as it will resolve, althoug it can take from a few days to even months to resolve..You should do alternate warm and cold compresses over the lump.Apply Thrombophob \\[heparin containing\\] gel.Take anti-inflammatory painkiller like Ibuprofen.Elevate the legs while laying down.You cal also apply numbing gel over the sore lump to reduce pain..Hope this information helps..Thanks and regards..Dr.Honey Nandwani Arora.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "healthcare_magic", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

I am a 69 year old male. Two years ago, I was diagnosed with moderate claudication in left leg with mild in right leg, and also had arterial ultrasound to determine if artherosclerosis was wide-spread in my system. Upper body was fine although there was a tiny calcified, echo-dense plaque at the fork of my carotid artery. There was NO ulceration nor stenosis at this site. Nothing in my brain, arms and lower aorta. I had a Doppler of the heart and all was fine. I also had a recent ECG and fine too. My BP at rest is 112-56 (controlled). My LDL is 1.59 mmo1/L or 61 mg. My chol./LDL ratio is 3.1 mmo1/L. My total chol. is 2.85 mmo1/l. My triglycerides are 0.71 mmo1/L. Pulse at rest is between 50-55. I walk 3, 4 kms (2, 3 miles) briskly at least 4 times a week minimum. My diet is Mediterranean and not animal-base except for fish (2 weekly) and chicken maybe once every 2 weeks for about 40 minutes each time. I eat tons of beans, lentils, salads and fruit. I gave up smoking one month ago today! I take baby aspirin, Lipitor (my LDl was at 2.55 mmmo1L last year), COQ10, Omega 3, C, D and other anti-oxidants daily. I have never had high cholesterol. My question is, with a profile that good, can I expect to have a long life (mother lived to 95)? And what should my next steps be to control and manage this? I am married with two cats, and still work out of my home as a linguist. My eGFR is also at 73...is that because of my age? \n\n【1】**Answer**: Brief Answer:eGFR reduced due to your age...Detailed Answer:Hi XXXXXXX 1. If you conduct a healthy lifestyle and healthy diet regimen, you can expect to have a long life. 2. These are 2 main steps toward controlling this: healthy lifestyle and diet regimen. 3. With regards to eGFR, if I was your caring doctor would analyze why this level:- should see the reference range of the labs where you did the blood work- should also evaluate your: urine analysis? blood kidney function tests first. If they are ok, then, it is because of your age. Hope it helped!Dr.Benard \n\n【2】**Question**: My creatinnine level is within normal ranges...but it went up over 6 months and I understand that it can fluctuate, right? But it is still within normal limits. Urine analysis is ok...all negative... I have been feeling tired lately but that is probably due to stopping smoking. Any other comments? what about my artherosclerosis? Can it be reversed with lifestyle and exercise? \n\n【3】**Answer**: Brief Answer:In few cases atherosclerosis may be reverted...Detailed Answer:Hi back,1. Taken all the data provided from you, I can admit that low eGFR is due to your age. 2. Atherosclerosis can be:- prevented- slow down its progression- in few cases it can be revertedwith exercise, healthy lifestyle and diet regimen. Hope it helped!Dr.Benard", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "healthcare_magic", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It seems to be worse when I´m not moving. \n\n【1】**Answer**: Diabetologist,  Dr. Saumya Mittal 's  Response Hi thereI am Dr Mittal.I will try to help you and explain you the condition.First, there is always a possibility of the ulnar nerve entrapment. There might be a problem like tennis elbow. Here the muscle in the elbow is hurt, and the nerve below it may hurt. So if you are lifting heavy weights, there may be a problem and cause pain and tingling and numbness of the arm.Second there is a possibility that the condition is due to the possibility of a radiculopathy. The radiculopathy is due to a pain in the neck. There may not always be a pain in the neck. But the space between the vertebra may have reduced or calcified causing problem in the nerve, There is increased pressure in the nerve tissue causing tingling and numbnessThird there may be some infection or inflammation in the path of the nerves. This may be irritating the nerve causing the symptoms, especially since you have the symptoms when at rest.I am sorry, but a detailed examination may be needed to deifferentiate between these causesI would suggest the following tests1. NCV of the affected arm2. Complete hemogram3. Vitamin B12 and Folate4. X ray cervical spine (MRI is a better test)5. Sugars6. Thyroid testI hope this helps you.

I am a male and I met another man and one thing lead to another. I am new to this type of activity. I was masturbating myself and he was masturbating himself. He touched my testicles a couple of times very briefly (20 seconds) during this activity . He never touched my shaft or head of my penis. I am worried that the hand that he touched my testicles with he may have used to touch himself (I did not feel any fluid from his hand). I am wondering if I put my self at any risk of any STD's. There was no penetration, anal, oral and he never touched the shaft of my penis. I was wondering if he had anything on his hand could it be transfered to me and infect me. I did touch his penis a couple of times but I am sure that I did not touch myself with the hand i touched him with. In short can you get infected with any STD's, herpes etc.. with this type of activity. Neither one of us climaxed. Your advice would be appreciated. \n\n【1】**Answer**: Hello XXXXXXX Thanks for your query.WIth this activity, you do not put yourself at risk of any Sexually transmitted infection at all. Basically there was no \"sexual\" activity between you two. So relax.There is absolutely no chance of you acquiring HIV, syphillis , herpes or any other STI with this level of activity.Just be careful in the future and use a condom.Practising safe sex has many advantages.I hope I have answered your query.Regards, \n\n【2】**Question**: Thank you Doctor. I am worried that what if he had an open sore and I didn't see it and then he touched my genitals.... I am worried that he could be transfered something from his hand to my penis and infect me. Also when I had contact with his penis was that an issue? So you are saying that it is not possible to transfer herpes and syphyllis and other STD's from \"someones penis to someones hand and then back to someone elses penis\"? Genital to hand to genital contact. Just want to make sure. After this response this will be my last question so I thank you for your help. \n\n【3】**Answer**: Hi,Thanks for the follow up.Yes, a trivial contact like that does not transfer STI (sexually transmitted infection).A direct mucosal or breached skin contact is necessary.But theoretically speaking, it may be possible.Though the chances are very very very slim.If you are very anxious, you may get screening tests done ( HIV, Hep B , HepC, Syphilis). Repeat HIV after 6 weeks.This will help alleviate your anxiety.I hope I have answered your query.Thanks", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "healthcare_magic", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Please advice me on what to do. \n\n【1】**Answer**: Brief Answer:Use an OTC topical antibacterial e.g 2% Mupirocin ointmentDetailed Answer:Hello. Welcome back and thank you for writing to us.I have taken note of your query and I have understood it.It should heal by itself.

Avoid it getting rubbed off by your jeans.You may do a light bandage after cleaning with betadine solution and dressing it with a povidone iodine ointment.Grafted skin is devoid of skin appendages like hair follicles, sweat & sebaceous glands.Normally, new epidermis grows over from the appendages to cover the wound quickly.However since grafts are devoid of skin appendages, therefore, wounds may heal slowly.Moreover, a thin graft such as this, is less vascular as compared to surrounding normal skin and this also delays the healing.Regards", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "healthcare_magic", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

To my opinion, you should add other medications to relieve heartburn. If the ECG you did showed some abnormal data (ST and T wave), then, I suggest to: - consult cardiologist - cardiac echo - holter monitoring - stress test These tests would further evaluate the condition of your heart. As your Ct-chest and Xray were unremarkable, then, I suggest to : - consult GI specialist - abdominal ultrasound - fibrogastroscopy. These tests would better evaluate the condition of your acid reflux and stomach issues. If everything would come normal in all the tests, then, I suggest to follow up with psychologist for further assistance to relieve anxiety. All the best!

This did not work as i was getting readings of 165//110 mainly in the middle of the night. MY GP increased it to 5 mg. My BP was still not controlled, i had hiogh readings during day and night. Finaly, after a month, i saw a cardiologist and he started me on 10 mg of Ramipril. During this time my heart was checked- treadmill test and myoview test and i have been told my heart is ok. During the myoview test, whilst i was on a treadmill, my BP increased to 180 so they had to stop the test. The 10 mg of Ramipril (5 in the morning and 5 in the evening) was not working at night. So i went back to the cardiologist and he gave me indapamide, 1.5 mg to take one pill at night. BP was still high,but not that high as before . At night the BP was 148/94 and pulse was 86. On 18 April at 14.12 pm my bp was 134/84 with pulse 109!!! this was at rest. I had to stop the indapamide as i was getting very dizzy, extremely weak and not able to breath (breathing was a bif effort as i had no energy left). I went back to my GP and instead of indapamide they gave me amlodipine 5 mg. On 1st of May 2015 at 5.24 am my bp was 173/110 with pulse 92. I went back to my gp to tell him the BP tablets are not working but he said i need to drink a glass of red wine in the evening to relax. I dont think this is a good idea given the fact that i take olanzapine 2.5 mg for my previous psychotic episode of 5 years ago Last week i went to romania to visit my family and went to see a cardiologist. She replaced ramipril with Telmisartan 80 mg (to be taken in the moring ) and amplodipine was increased to 10 mg (to be taken in the evening). MY BP is now stable even during the night but i do feel very very weak, a little bit dizzy and my pulse is not falling below 90 (even at rest). One our ago my pulse was 108, at rest. I am seeing the cardiologist in romania again tomorrow- she placed a holter machine on me. I am really worried about my pulse now. I have to mention that if i go up the stairs my hearts start bitting very very fast and i can feel it bitting in my throat. Please advise me what to do to decrease my pulse. Do you think the pulse is a reaction of the medication. Before taking the BP tablets my pulse was beteen 70-80. Also, why do i feel so weak? MY sugar level is borderline so i am on diet now- just has been discovered last week. Also, i would like to remind you that i am overweight ( 90 kg and height 1.64 cm). My blood test results were fine, with the exception of vitamin D which is very low. Given my high pulse, is it advisable to exercise? if yes, what kind of exercise is good for me?

Regards XXXXX \n\n【1】**Answer**: Brief Answer: Following advice... Detailed Answer: Hi back XXX, I have gone through your concerns and I can say as following: To my opinion, you should be using nebivolol as it is a third generation beta selective blocker recommended in patients with lungs problems as in your case. Since this is a medication should discuss with your doctor. With such a case at my clinic we begin with a starting dose of 2.5 mg. I also recommend to : - take magnesium supplements - limit carbonated drinks - avoid caffeinated drinks/foods With regards to exercise, Yes, you can safely exercise as it will help improve your cardiac frequency and relieve stress. If you are more physically active, your heart will work better too and keep fit and healthy. Hope it answered to your queries! Dr.Benard \n\n【2】**Question**: Dear Mr. Shedu Thanks a lot for your reply Please let me know if nebivolol is for blood pressure? How about my pulse? What can i do to decrease it? Many thanks Good night XXXX \n\n【3】**Answer**: Brief Answer:Following advice...Detailed Answer:Hi back,Nebivolol will control and stabilize both your heart rate and blood pressure. It has a beta blocker effect that help to control your HR and a vasodilatation effect that help on lowering your BP. This is why I strongly suggest to take Nebivolol, however you should discuss this with your doctor.Wish you health!Dr. Shehu \n\n【4】**Question**: Hi My doctor here in romania prescribed me yesterday Nebivolol (2.5 mg in the morning, 2.5 mg evening) and to increase to 5 mg morning and 5 mg evening if required. The pulse is lower now (and the BP). However, i forgot to ask her if it matters that i take olanzapine 2.5 mg for my 2010 psychotic episode. Many thanks for your brilliant advice Regards XXXXX \n\n【5】**Answer**: Brief Answer: Following advice. Detailed Answer: Hi back XXXXX! You should continue with the prescribed dose of Nebivolol and you shouldn't increase the dose as long as your HR and BP are stabilised.

Dr. Shehu \n\n【6】**Question**: Dear Mr. Shedu I took my blood pressure now. 2 hours after telmisartan and Nebivolol and the BP is 107/72 with pulse 85. Is the 107 reading not too small?

I am worried now that i take too much medication:-) i would like to add that the readings when i woke up were 130/89 and pulse 96 ( last night i took first tablet of Nebivolol) Many thanks XXXX \n\n【7】**Answer**: Brief Answer: Following advice. Detailed Answer: Hi back XXXX! As long as your BP is below 140/90 mmHg and your systolic BP is above 90 mmHg (in your case 107 mmHg) you shouldn't worry about taking to much nebivolol. My advice is to stay kalm and to continue with the prescribed dose of Nebivolol. Wish you health!

What Cure Should Be Done?\n**Question**: Question: Have a look at the first four photograph (first two pdf files). Since my childhood I used to wipe my penis with a cloth very roughly. Even masturbation I used to do using a cloth. This happened every time I went for pee. I lost the reddishness of the inner part. Now I’m unable to know whether I’m having black spots on white skin or white patches on black skin. The inner part became very rough. Apart from that everything is normal. I stopped using a cloth for the last 2 years. I never thought of the consequences. Actually the change came so gradually that I was unable to find it abnormal. To make it sensitive I thought of using some Vaseline like substances. But I read in a blog on net that use of petroleum products may lead to impotency. I never had any sexual relation with anybody. What could be the reason?? Can I get the colour of inner part of my penis back. Is it abnormal?? Any need to visit doctors place?? I’m having fuss like substances inside the skin on my testacles (I have shown in the fifth and sixth photograph i.e., third pdf file). I have highlighted the one in large size. Is there any relation between the above two issues?? Please help me in this regard. If possible for two issues.im very much worried of these. \n\n【1】**Answer**: Hello, Thanks for the detailed description and high quality images.You are suffering from two different problems and I will explain them one by one. 1. The problem with glans penis. Actually in simple words, it can be said that the mucosa of your glans has become like skin. That means, the highly sensitive pink mucous membrane of the glans has become less sensitive skin like due to constant friction. It is totally normal and is body's protective mechanism. The white patches what you see are actually normal regenerating mucosa, the rest black part is the skin like change. Nothing needs to be done, just wait. Slowly the skin like area will again regain its colour. However if you feel pain on the tip of penis or there is ulcer, you must see a dermatologist. Applying a moisturizer like elovera is a good option. 2. The second condition is a bump like lesion on scrotum. This is calcinosis cutis, which means accumulation of calcium under the skin. Even this is a harmless condition. If you want it can be easily removed by excising it. However it is better to leave it as such if it doesn’t grow or cause any problem. Hope I was of some help.

It was performed due to a goiter and pathology showed microscopic cancer. I had my Synthroid adjusted to suppress my TSH and stabilized at 137mcg. A few months ago the specialist I am seeing for chronic Lyme pulled labs and said that I was not converting T3 appropriately. Results| TSH 0.2 Reverse T3 < 5.0 and free T 2.0 (July 2016) I was told to stop Synthroid and put on Liothyronine 25mcg. November 2016 labs were TSH 0.9 and Free T 2.0... My dosage was increased to Liothyronine 30mcg. February labs are - TSH 9.45 and Free T 2.1. I have increased fatigue, mood swings, increased constipation, hair loss, dry skin and an inability to lose weight even though I am trying. (was losing weight until recently) I am due to see the specialist in about 3 weeks. I emailed him and told him I am having symptoms of hypothyroidism-- as above--- as well as concerns about needing TSH suppression. He wrote back and said I have incorrectly interpreted my lab results, that my symptoms are not likely related to elevated TSH and I need no med changes and he will see me at my appointment. I was a RN for 20 years prior to being disabled. I wanted another opinioin on whether I am misinterpreting my labs. I strongly feel I need to be on the Synthroid and have no problem taking the Liothyronine in addition. I was wanting another Physician to interpret. Thank you. \n\n【1】**Answer**: Brief Answer:About hypothyroidism treatment:Detailed Answer:Hello and thank you for asking on HCM!I hae gone carefully through your concern.First i would like to inform you that after 5 years of surgical removal of the thyroid cancer, without recurrences during these years, there is no need to keep TSH level suppressed. Furthermore it has been a micro carcinoma and the risk for recurrences is very low.Secondly, there is no need to check Reverse T3, if you do not have symptoms of hypothyroidism. It is usually recommended to be checked if you have normal thyroid hormones (not hypothyroidism), while on levothyroxine and persisting signs and symptoms of hypothyrodisim.So, i would recommend to restart levothyroxine, keep the TSH at 1 mUi/ml and you may add liothyronine if the symptoms of hypothyroidim persist (even though Ft4 and Ft3 are within the normal ranges).Hope the information will help.Kind regards,Dr.Mirjeta \n\n【2】**Question**: He added the liothyronine due to believing some of my fatigue was related..... Since TSH has gone up fatigue is worse, as well as, other symptoms I mentioned. Would elevated TSH not cause these symptoms? I do plan to go back on the synthroid. Thank you \n\n【3】**Answer**: Brief Answer:High TSH can cause these symptoms:Detailed Answer:Hi again,Yes, in these high levels of TSH, the symptoms of hypothyroidism are expected.So, very probably your treating physician will recommend synthroid again.Best wishes,Dr.Mirjeta", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "healthcare_magic", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Treatment ?\n**Question**: Question: Hello Doctor, I am 24 years old, Indian skin . I have acne problems . I have been using STIEMYCIN for acne and PHARMACLINIX SCAR REPAIREX to treat the scars. I used to have tetralysal 300mg to reduce acne for 10 weeks from february to april 2011. Everything seemed fine and was reducing. But in XXXXXXX my skin started getting dark in the chin area , I thought it would go , but its not , its just increasing and I have a feeling its spreading on my cheeks. By XXXXXXX end I started taking the capsules again because my acne was increasing and still am taking them (10 week course) . Please help me. I am really worried. \n\n【1】**Answer**: Hi XXXXXXX, Thanks for posting your query. Stiemycin is a product that contains erythromycin 2% gel and is used to treat certain types of Acne. Erythromycin belongs to the family of medications known as antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria that cause acne. You may see improvement in your acne after 2 to 3 weeks of using this medication, with full effect after 8 to 10 weeks of treatment. Tetralysal 300 capsules contain the active ingredient lymecycline, which is a type of medicine called a tetracycline antibiotic. Scar Repairex is a silicone-based cream formulated with a unique combination of both powerful anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatory agents that work together to shrink Scars. Both lymecycline and erythromycin can cause photosensitivity and that can cause hyperpigmentation in Indian skin type. So my advise would be to visit a dermatologist to assess the cause of hyperpigmentation. Meanwhile you can use salisylic acid face wash and brevoxyl face wash which contains benzyl peroxide.Benzyl peroxide can be useful in pigmenatation as well as Acne. Maintain a good photoprotection. Use Sunscreen of atleast 30 SPF. As well as use Physical sun protection. TAke lot of vitamin C in diet. A picture of the lesion will be more informative and I would be able to help in predicting the condition if I have a picture. You can mail me the photos to YYYY@YYYY with subject:ATTN Dr Sudarshan. Please do confirm the sending of the photos by writing here, so that I can reply you back at the earliest. Hope you have got answer to your query. Anticipating your response. Regards, \n\n【2】**Question**: Hello Doctor, Thankyou for your reply. I did have a doubt that Stiemycin might be causing this. And now its summer too. But, I have been using Stiemycin since more than a year now. The first time I took lymecycline in January, nothing happened. Then in XXXXXXX first week I started seeing the discoloration, and by XXXXXXX last week I started taking lymecycline again and then the discoloration started spreading more. So would you advice me to stop using both stiemycin abd lymecycline. The facewash I am using now is Nouveau, Exfoliac, its ingredients on label says benzyl salicylate and benzyl alcohol (and many other ingredients too). Is this fine? I have sent you a picture to the email you have provided. Please look carefully into the picture. Thankyou \n\n【3】**Answer**: Hi again, Got the photo .Its not very clear photo to make a impression of what might be cause of the pigmentation.What I can appreciate is dat you got nodulocystic acne and acne scars.I dont want you to stop the treatment given by dermatologist.Just maintain good sunprotection.But make an appointment with him and and discuss this issue with him.Discuss the option of ISOTRETINOIN with him which works wonder in your case.Facewash you are using is fine.But Try to get Brevoxyl face wash.Take care . \n\n【4】**Question**: Hello doctor, Once again thank you for your reply. Its really helping me understand my condition and medications better .Could you now tell me if GLYAHA HQ LOTION , which contains hydroquinone , will help this dark skin to go away or should i continue with Scar repairex ? Or should I apply both these creams simultanelusly, scar repairex on the scars and glyaha lotion on the dark skin?Thankyou \n\n【5】**Answer**: Hi again, Glyaha HQ lotion contains depigmenting agents like HQ 2%,Glycolic acid.You can use it at night time over hyperpigmented areas and scar repairex over scars.Maintain photo protection as Glyaha HQ can cause photosensitivity as well.Wishing you good health.Thanks and regards.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "healthcare_magic", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

She passed away last week. She has smoked meth on and off for about 10-15 years...and in the last year, 4 month after moving into a new residence she had a severe asthma attack and was hospitalized. She has neer had asthma and she continued to have breathing issues though I dont know if she was using at the time when I saw her with labored breathing. She was given inhalers and a nebulizer machine which seemed to help the asthma episodes. She claimed the home she was in had mold and there does seem to be some mold in certain areas though I dont know if it is black mold spores. A couple of weeks ago she collpased and went into cardiac arrest which resulted in brain death. We were told by the people she was with that she was having breathing difficulty and was working herself up just before she went into resp. failure. The Dr. told us she was either having siezures or withdrawl symptoms for the first couple of days during her coma...when the jerking stopped the Dr. claimed it was most likely withdrawls. Does it mean she was smoking meth at the time of her collapse? DId the meth cause her asthma and the asthma attack which caused her to collapse? could it be there was no meth being smoked at the time of her collapse but the labored breathing for a few hours and asthma attack truly caused her collapse? we are trying to figure out what my sister died from...can you help us figure this out? \n\n【1】**Answer**: Addiction Medicine Specialist,  Dr. Dr. Matt Wachsman's  Response Methamphetamine is a harsh stimulant and stresses the heart and vessels. Heart trouble causes fluid to back up into the lung (because a damaged heart doesn't pump blood out of it). The fluid causes the lungs to not work well. ALSO, it causes inflammation all over the lung and often/usually causes wheezing which is often severe (called \"cardiac asthma\").There are a number of possibilities and not being directly there, I cannot absolutely say, but it seems most likely that heart trouble from methamphetamine would explain the situation. \n\n【2】**Answer**: Addiction Medicine Specialist,  Dr. Dr. Matt Wachsman's  Response cannot say in her particular case without having seen her BUT.CARDIAC ASTHMA, is when there is a heart problem which causes the heart to be unable to pump blood out of the lungs. The lungs get moist... accumulated fluid... they move poorly and usually also have inflammation from this which causes wheeze and... a LOT of respiratory distress/RESPIRATORY FAILURE. IN cardiac asthma, there typically is much more respiratory distress (and death) than in asthma from lung disease. Furthermore, ... the curve is different. IN a smoker who's lungs are having trouble there is progression and worsening over years to decades Gradually. In heart problems, they can come on out of the blue.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "healthcare_magic", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

It cleared up after about 2 weeks with no treatment. I have had no other symptoms since. Could this have been syphilis and if so how long does it take for syphilis to start doing permanent damage? \n\n【1】**Answer**: Brief Answer:Painless penile ulcerDetailed Answer:Hello,Welcome to health care magic forum.I understand from your query that you are concerned about a painless ulcer which you had on the penis 9 years back.From your history and description, there is a theoritical possibility of it being \" primary syphilis\". It generally presents with a painless ulcer called as \" primary chancre\" which heals spontaneously.However, if it were to be a primary chancre, you would have got some symptoms of \" secondary syphilis\" within 3- 6 months of the ulcer healing. These symptoms could have been fever, lymph node enlargement, malaise, fatigue, skin rash, oral ulcers, etc which would have prompted you to visit a GP. Even if this stage went undetected, the next stage called \" tertiary stage\" could occur anywhere from 1 year to several years after the ulcer heals. This could cause heart and neurological symptoms.Considering that you are completely asymptomatic after the ulcer healing, I do not think you have syphilis. However, I would suggest you to get a test called TPHA or an ELISA test to rule out the possibility.Hope this helps you.If you have any more queries,i will be glad to answer.Regards,Dr. Johny Chacko", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "healthcare_magic", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

I have went to the doctor and told me they are birthmarks of some sort and I know I was not born with them . \n\n【1】**Answer**: Brief Answer:\"Lichenoid eruption\": eruptions are quite common and nothing to be worreid.Detailed Answer:Hi,Welcome and thanks for posting your query to the forum. I can understand your concern for the purple spots around the shaft of your penis.After reviewing your pictures with best diligence let me reassure you first that these are totally normal kind of spots and eruptions and usual to find such kind of eruptions in our routine practice. These are known as \"Lichenoid eruption\" which is commonly found at this site as well as at any other site of body. To tell you more elaborately: These begin as very small bumps and then can become flatly enlarged. These are formed due to normal wear and tea of the skin and anyone can have these kind of eruptions. As the penile skin is one of the thinnest skin in our body so we perceive these on higher side.It is not at all anything serious and is a simple phenomenon of wear and tear of skin which actually becomes slightly raised due to touching or scratching. This begins as very small bumps and then can become flatly enlarged and gives purplish hue. You can notice multiple other pin point to pin head size papules (raised eruptions) near by the large flat lesion. Lichenoid eruptions do start as flat papule and plaques and to start with, these can have varied colors including light brown color also.For the management part: I generally suggest my patient to leave it as it is and most often no treatment is requited. In some patients which are really worried then I first of all give a topical steroid cream such as Fluticasone cream to be applied for 15 days only and then see the result to shift to milder cream as maintenance. If at all one feels very much anxiousness regarding the condition then can also be removed at once by simple radiofrequency ablation. For the same you can meet a dermatologist and take further guidance regarding the same.The eruptions are quite common to find at this are so remain tension free for any kind of future issues.I hope you must be more than relaxed to know all these simple medical facts.I will be glad to guide you any further for your any sort of queries.\"With good health wishes\"With regards,Dr Sanjay Kumar KanodiaMD- Dermatology & Sexually transmitted diseases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "healthcare_magic", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Help! \n\n【1】**Answer**: Dentist,  Dr. Viraj Ravin Shah's  Response Hello,I can understand your concern. A burned incisive papilla, however bad it has been been burn, should not take up to 3 months to heal. What I suspect here is your front teeth have been damaged due to excessive heat as the coffee must have come in contact with the teeth, too.Our teeth also have blood supply as with any other organ in the body. Excessive heat or injury can damage the nerve and blood vessels supplying the tooth that we cannot see from the outside. Once damaged, the blood supply cannot be regained and the tooth has to go through root canal treatment to eliminate infection and pain you are experiencing. The swelling in the papilla might be due to cyst formation at the end of the root of the front teeth. I would advise you to visit your dentist and got for x-ray of the front teeth along with electric pulp vitality test (EPT). If the teeth are in fact non-vital, you will have to go through root canal treatment. If the teeth are fine regarding its blood and nerve supply, then the dentist can see the incisive papilla region and can advise you regarding that.I hope this information helps you.

That will make your pain come up severely and cause lots of discomfort. Instead slow down gradually. Say supposing you are taking 4 pills daily now. Then taper it. initially take 3. This will make the pain come up mildly, and you might be able to control it and hold on till the next tablet is due. Over a period of time, when you get ok with 3, you can reduce it further. You will find that it is easier at first but difficult to stop. So you might reduce the dose faster initially, but slowly later. And of course if the pain shoots up, and becomes unbearable, you can always take a dose in between. Also, I hope you have been on vitamin D supplememtation. Besides L carnitine is being quite effective in some of my patients. So you might try it. 2 of my patients today are on nothing more than Lcarnitine and are relatively comfortable I hope that helps Bets of luck Dr Mittal", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "healthcare_magic", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Now I have been on minocycline for the last 4 months for acne and i've only just come off of it so i'm unsure if that could be a factor. I usually am pretty good with brushing my teeth twice a day but I have missed a teeth brush every so often but have always done it once a day at least. I have attached a picture of it as well but what could I do to fix this do I have to go to a dentist to get it whitened? Kind Regards, XXXX \n\n【1】**Answer**: Brief Answer:Staining is due to minocyclineDetailed Answer:HiThanks for writing in.You are having yellowish teeth due to minocycline. Prolonged consumption of minocycline results in discoloration of teeth.You need to reduce the dose of minocycline to less than 100 mg a day after consulting your doctor. Simultaneously, take vitamin C sources for better relief. If you want to get rid of this staining then go for bleaching.Consult your dentist for further treatment plan.Hope I answered your query Wishing you good health Kind Regards Dr. Neha Sumra \n\n【2】**Question**: Yeah i'm off it now I was originally on 2x 50mg a day for 4 months and then went down to 1x 50mg a day and now I am off it completely. With the bleaching though how exactly do you do that and isn't there special toothpaste you can buy to whiten your teeth over time? \n\n【3】**Answer**: Brief Answer:Tooth paste will not help u muchDetailed Answer:HiBleaching will make your teeth white but there would be some sensitivity as well.Toothpaste will not be of much use.Kind regards Dr. Neha Sumra", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "healthcare_magic", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

I m 66 and in good health and until I started on these drugs I was always ready to go and very hard. \n\n【1】**Answer**: Ayurveda Specialist,  Dr. Rajesh Choda's  Response You are right in thinking the connection (side effect) of these medicines as ED.People often come with such complaints with such group's medicines but stopping these medicines without treating doctors' advise is no answer.There are medicines available to enhance libido and spermatogenesis to overcome this side effect both in Allopathy and Ayurveda. Former approach is by way of synthetic compounds while latter by way of herbs and natural minerals. Our colleagues in allopathy often discuss with us and seek suggestions for patients' benefits.If I were your treating doctor, I would have advised you to seek Ayurveda's aphrodisiacs and rejuvenators by consulting an Ayurveda doctor for overcoming this problem and enjoy life. These herbs n minerals do not interfere with your current allopathy medicines and also are safe and side-effect less.Hope this answers your query.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "healthcare_magic", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}

Thank you for taking the time to help me with this. I am 29 years old and fearful about developing condylar resorption. I have a double jaw surgery and genioplasty in 2012 to correct \"long face syndrome\". Since then I have developed TMJD symptoms such as popping and clicking, as well as muscle soreness. I have also stopped taking hormonal birth control contraceptive pills. I am afraid that the hormonal changes of discontinuing oral contraceptives and the TMJD symptoms may mean I have developed condylar resorption after my jaw surgery. Can you help me understand whether this is happening or not? Thank you very much. \n\n【1】**Answer**: Brief Answer:Please provide more details.Detailed Answer:Hi..Thanks for the query..Well clicking and popping sensation does not exactly indicate that there is condylar resorption..There can be a number of other symptoms.Please provide following details..1.Is your mouth opening normal as before or is it reducing with time?2.Do you find any changes in facial profile like chin moving backwards or receding?3.Is there any changes in your bite or occlusion?4.Are your front teeth showing any increased gap between upper and lower teeth overtime?Please revert back with answers..Regards. \n\n【2】**Question**: Hi again. I have not noticed any of the change you have listed.Does this mean condylar resorption is not likely for me?Is this something I should look out for? How common is it for women my age with my history of long face syndrome and double jaw surgery? Do I need to be wary of regulating my hormones to avoid it? \n\n【3】**Answer**: Brief Answer:Not necessary to get resorption.Detailed Answer:Hi..Although there are chances of condylar resorption after jaw surgery involving jaw joints but it is not always necessary..If you still doubt you should get a Panoramic x ray done to rule out the exact condition of the jaw joints..Hope this helps..Regards.. \n\n【4】**Question**: Can you look at the report I just uploaded called 0\\_Custom Printout and tell me if these X-rays look normal or if they look like I have condylar resorption? \n\n【5】**Answer**: Brief Answer:Yes condyles are fine.Detailed Answer:Hi..I have viewed the x ray and the condyles are appearing very much fine..Do not worry as there is no resorption seen..Regards.. \n\n【6】**Question**: Thank you so, so, so, so much!!!! \n\n【7】**Answer**: Brief Answer:Please rate the answer.Detailed Answer:Hi..If your query is resolved please give a five star rating and write a positive review as a token of appreciation..Regards..", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "healthcare_magic", "batch_name": "20230816", "version": "version0"}
