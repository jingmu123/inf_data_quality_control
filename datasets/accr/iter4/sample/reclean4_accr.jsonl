A rare entity， it was first proposed by Antonia Garcia Tapia， a Spanish otolaryngologist in 1904， in a bull fighter who had vagal and hypoglossal palsy following neck injury . It classically presents as dysphonia， dysphagia and deviation of tongue. This eponym signifies ipsilateral weakness of larynx and tongue while sparing function of the soft palate . What is also notable is its causal association with orotracheal intubation and unpredictability of occiirrence.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 28-year-oldhomemaker with gradually progressive bilateral blurred vision was diagnosed as Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH) with bilateral transverse sinus stenosis in December. She had CSF opening pressure of 400 mm of water and did not have desirable improvement with medical management. She was planned for venous sinus manometry and stenting. Orotracheal intubation with laryngoscope with Macintosh blade size 3 was done， tube fixed at 22 mm mark and the cuff was inflated at normal pressure. The intubation lasted two and half hours without undue flexion or lateral rotation. Venous sinus manometry showed gradient of 13 mm and 12 mm across narrowing in right and left transverse sinus， respectively . The right internal jugular vein access was taken and balloon angioplasty was done at the level of narrowing bilaterally. However， there was no significant improvement in the pressure gradient. Thereafter， a self-expanding stent (8mmx40 mm) was deployed across the narrowing in right transverse sinus. Pressure gradient post stenting showed significant improvement and good flow was achieved across the stent . After wearing off of anesthesia， patient complained of change in voice with nasal intonation and difficulty in swallowing. There was flattening of the right palatal arch with deviation of uvula to left side， deviation of tongue to right and ipsilateral weakness of the tongue . No other cranial nerve or focal neurological deficits were observed. In view of the preceding stenting procedure， a brain imaging was performed to rule out medullary involvement. MRI brain and MR angiogram were normal. Right sided vocal cord palsy was confirmed by direct laryngoscopy. Patient was put on nasogastric feeds and was given injectable steroids for 5 days followed by oral steroids.

At 30 days after onset， nasal intonation was persistent but patient was able to swallow without difficulty. At 6 months， patient had completely improved.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Tapia syndrome has been noted following procedures like septorhinoplasty， shoulder surgery， cervical spine surgeries and with transient intubations where cardiorespiratory instability required intubation  . Bilateral Tapia syndrome has also been described following orotracheal intubation . The proposed mechanisms following intubation include compression of nerves by pressure of the inflated laryngeal cuff across the lateral laryngeal wall and alternatively stretching of nerves due to undue head movements. Tapia syndrome occurring after an intracranial procedure is unique due to the possible topographical association of intracranial lesions in relation to the procedure. Posterior fossa hemorrhage after stenting due to stent thrombosis has been noted and was ruled out in this case . A similar presentation could be explained by the involvement of the nucleus ambiguous and hypoglossal nucleus or intramedullary fibers of the twelfth cranial nerve which was also excluded by neuroimaging. Another notable finding in our patient was the involvement of soft palate suggesting involvement of the pharyngeal nerve， branch of vagus nerve， which carries the motor impulses to the soft palate. Most of the described cases of Tapia syndrome involved hypoglossal and recurrent laryngeal branch of vagus nerve as compression is believed to occur at the crossing of these two nerves . Therefore， palatal involvement in our patient makes it a triad of pharyngeal， laryngeal and glossal involvement. One possible explanation for this can be the short neck length in our patient (midline neck length- 6cm)； making it more likely that neurapraxia also involved the pharyngeal branch exiting proximally . This rarest entity can therefore be referred to as Triad of Tapia Plus syndrome’. Tapia syndrome has been found to resolve progressively in 6 to 12 months with steroids and dysphagia rehabilitation as in our patient \n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】Tapia syndrome， especially Tapia syndrome plus is a rare unpredictable situation occurring after orotracheal intubation Through this case， the authors would like to emphasize the need for high clinical suspicion by intensivists， neurologists and surgeons spanning all fields of medicine as timely clinical suspicion can help avoid unnecessary investigations.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:52:32", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:52:43", "cost": 10.752}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:49", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:52:43", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:52:32"}

The extension of this was from cervical esophagus to lesser curvature of stomach intramural hematoma.\n\n【2】Case： This very rare event in older women is more common in and can be missed as cardiovascular or emergent disease of esophagus. The most common clinical presentations are severe chest pain， dysphagia or odynophagia and mild hematemesis. The common risk factors are blunt， penetrating or iatrogenic injuries， Valsalva maneuver and antiguagilan medication， in literatures spontaneous cases have also been reported.\n\n【3】Discussion： IEH is a very rare event of esophagus and submucosal esophageal bleeding which can present with acute onset of chest pain， dysphagia or hematemesis and can mimicking some acute cardiopulmonary diseases. These can result in a delayed or even missed diagnosis IHE. Past medical history is very important in such situation. Thus， a high index of suspicion IHE is needed to make the diagnosis and provide the appropriate and best management.\n\n【4】Keywords： Intramural； Hematoma； Esophagus\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Intramural Hematoma of the Esophagus (IHE) is emergency esophageal condition and more common among old people who are taking antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs . Although the incidence of this event is a rare， Today's it is recognized in early stage because of with modern radiological and endoscopic procedure .IHE dived as spontaneous or secondary and iatrogenic procedural as endoscopy or intraesophageal echocardiography. Secondary causes are traumatic problem. foreign body， sever Valsalva maneuver， lifting heavy weight material， huge bulky bolus swallowing， severe vomiting， nasogastric tube， upper gastric endoscopy or ERCP， nasotracheal intubation and transesophageal echocardiogram . Most patients present with at least two of the symptoms in IHE (IHE) usually presents as a sudden and sever onset of a chest or retrosternal pain， and mild hematemesis， and dysphagia or odynophagia. In past medical history ofpatients， there may be a violent retching， vomiting or instrumentation procedure of the esophagus. A history of foreign body swallow rarely may be present . In physical examination there are not any specific findings except tachycardia and pallor in the face of patients. It is very important to distinguish IHE from any cause of acute cardiac pain； anticoagulant therapy may worsen the conditions. If the patients present with dysphagia or odynophagia these symptoms can help to exclude significant cardiac reasons from the IHE . A PA chest X-ray may show pneumomediastinum， pneumothorax， widening of mediastinum and pleural effusion . In acute myocardial infarction， dissection of aorta， and thromboembolism of pulmonary artery. In Acute retrosternal chest pain is a common symptom and this disorder should be ruled out with past medical history， carefully physical examination and appropriate diagnostic tools as chest CT-scan， MRI， endoscopy， troponin， CPK EKG and echocardiogram . The primaryand quicklyinvestigation is CT scan with intravenous contrast because CT-scan available in most clinic and centers and is non-invasive tool. Oral contrast study of the esophagus with barium swallow and CT-scan will show multiple flling defects in the lumen of the esophagus. The CT-scan usually shows a thickening of esophageal wall with compression lumen of esophagus or obliteration of the lumen by a large hematoma. A contrast CT-scan shows the perforation of esophagus， aorta， mediastinal structures and also mediastinitis. Oral contrast imaging indicated when transmural perforation of esophagus suspected . MRI is useful tools for diagnosing of (IHE) . The use of Endoscopy indicated the integrity of the esophagus wall had been intact and not be perforated and can be performed with care. An esophagoscopy usually show a blue color swelling or edema with or without a mucosal tear or lacerations. Endoscopic ultrasound is superior to plain endoscopy. When pneumothorax， pneumomediastinum， or pleural effusion presence imaging strongly show a transmural injury to with the intramuralhematoma ofesophagus .EKG， ChestX-rayand cardiac Labe date should be a performed to exclude other cardiopulmonary and vascular diseases .Treatment of IHE is usually conservative. The initial management is stop oral intake. Intravenous IV therapy， coagulopathy should be correct， and intravenous of proton pump inhibitors should be administration . A serial oral contrast CT scan or barium swallow study is needed for monitoring of clinical progress and condition or resolution of hematoma. The patient is gradually administration oral feeding with water when symptoms resolution. Conservative treatment responds and full recovery in most patients. Hematoma may leakage in the pleural space or rupture into the esophageal lumen in rare cases. When hematoma expand the patient should be managed with protection the airway and hemodynamic and cardiovascular resuscitation. Transarterial angiography and embolization may become necessary for stopping bleeding and hematoma preventions. Surgery usually is indicated for patient who bleeding and hematoma do not respond to conservative therapy and associated with poor outcome .IHE is a benign condition but are very grave. Conservative treatment responds in most patients with fully recover. Prognosis is very good and IHE resolves in 3 to 4 weeks . Herein we want to show our experiences in management of IHE.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 65-vear-old male man referred to our hospital with sever retrosternal， chest pain， dysphagia， and mild hematemesis. Six hours prior to admission， he was lifting a big sack full of rice and developed acute onset dysphagia with retrosternal pain difficulty swallowing food epigastrium tenderness and increase salvia mix with blood. Four hour later， he developed sudden onset sharp retrosternal chest pain associated with mild bright red blood hematemesis in our hospital. Before lifting the sack of rice， He denied having any problem as odynophagia， abdominal pain， nausea， vomiting or fever. In emergency room， his blood pressure was 14/82 mmHg and pulse rate 100 p/m. On physical examination of head and neck， chest and abdomen was normal. Laboratory finding showed hemoglobin12 g/dl， hematocrit 36%， platelets 350，000/uL coagulation profile was normal. BUN was 21 mg/dL with serum creatinine 0.9 mg/dL.\n\n【9】Electrocardiogram (EKG)， CPK-mb and troponin was in normal range. CT-scan of chest with oral and intravenous contrast showed esophageal narrowing at the upper，middle and distalpartofesophagus lumen and also show mural thickening and a soft tissue density in the esophagus which extending to the lesser curvature of stomach due to esophageal hematoma . CT-scan of abdomen with oral and IV contrast showed circumscribed hyperdense structure in the distal esophagus concerning for an intramural esophageal hematoma and extending inferiorly to the proximal portion of stomach . He was withdrawal few days nothing by mouth at first and few days started on IV fluids and pantoprazole， ceftriaxone and clindamycin infusion. With this conservative management， his and in this time his diet was advanced to clear liquid four days after improved of symptoms， he underwent barium swallow. We performed an oral contrast imaging for transmural perforation or Extravasation of oral contrast extraluminally. intravenous and oral contrast showed esophageal luminal narrowing at the distal third with mural thickening and a soft tissue density extending to the gastroesophageal junction due to esophageal hematoma  and an esophagogastroduodenoscopy which showed a blue like discoloration at the distal third of the esophagus and a non-bleeding ulcer at the distal esophagus and proximal stomach and narrowing the lumen of esophagus due to hematoma . Biopsies were not because of recent bleeding and hematoma. He was started on a normal and soft diet with oral pantoprazole 40 mg twice daily， he tolerated well and was discharged home. He did not have any compliant or recurrence of his symptoms.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Intramural hematoma of the esophagus as intramural rupture or intra wall bleeding of esophagus whiteout perforation is a rare condition which collection of blood in the esophagus wall of . A review of literatures which shows the average age of patients is 58.8years and some peak of age are greater or around the 70 years. IHE is slightly more frequent in females’ patients . Our case age was65 vears old and was male. The causes Intramural hematoma of the esophagus are abnormal hemostasis， vomiting， trauma， iatrogenic trauma， coagulation disorders， anticoagulant or antiplatelet drugs and hemostasis disorders . Antiplatelet drug are not the cause of IHE but can aggravating factors and can increase extension of the hematoma . Valsalva maneuver vomiting， sever coughing， sever sneezing， swallowing big compact or bulky bolus foods， or lifting a heavy weight material are others cause of IHE . The mechanism of IHE is a sudden change and increase in intrathoracic and esophageal pressure during swallowing or vomiting . In our case， lifting a heavy weight sack of rice was the cause of the precipitating factor and the located of IHE was in the upper，middle and lower third portion of the esophagus and EGJ . Distal of esophagus in (83%) of cases is commonly the site of injury in IHE. The reason is the absence of striated muscle in this portion and this region is support by some organ such as trachea and heart and by the fiber of the muscularis in the gastroesophageal junction of stomach . The middle third of the esophagus is involved in78% and the proximal third involve in 27%. The mucosal tearing are usually transverse and submucosal hematoma can rupture in the esophageallumen . In our case the upper， middle and lower third of thoracic esophagus and proximal portion of stomach was involved. Other causes of IHE are direct injuries are endoscopic procedure interventions， ingested food and other matter or external injury of the chest wall . Case reports show IHE can present after varix sclerotherapy， esophageal balloon dilatation， pill and foreign body impaction or traffic trauma and accidents . Aortoesophageal fistula is a rare life-threatening cause of IHE . Secondary causes of IHE are foreign body ingestion， esophageal malignancies， corrosive esophagitis and penetrating ulcer due to trauma . In 19% of cases， the cause IHE are unknown and no risk factor is described. Esophageal motility disorder can produce an intramural hematoma . The clinical presentation of patients is chest pain in(84%) of patients， dysphagia or odynophagia in (59%)， with minor hematemesis in (56%) of patients. Ninety percent of patients have only one ofthese symptoms， seventy-nine present have two or more of symptoms and one third have all of symptoms . The chest pain is usually is sudden， severe and retrosternal as our patient had severe chest pain， dysphagia， odynophagia and mild hematemesis， epigastric pain occasional radiating to the back . The hematemesis occurs after rupture of the hematoma through the esophageal mucosa . Clinical finding in some patients show low blood pressure，tenderness of epigastrium or low-grade fever . But in our case we did not find any clinical sign as fever and low blood pressure. The differential diagnosis of IHE includes esophageal disease as Boerhaave，Mallory-Weiss Syndrome (MWS) and motility disorder . A complete transmural rupture of the esophagus in distal portion due to sudden increase of intraesophageal pressure， during sever vomiting or cough， blunttrauma， child birth， straining and weightlifting， intraesophageal pressureincrease . In MVS after vomiting， the patient present with lower thoracic chest pain and subcutaneous emphysema usually in the neck. A longitudinal mucosal tear at the gastroesophageal junction occur in MVS following severe cough， retching or forceful vomiting MVS occur and the usual symptom is hematemesis . The prognosis is good with supportive care and treatment . IHE can also be misdiagnosed with peptic ulcer perforated and acute pancreatitis . Other differential diagnosis are ischemic heart disease， dissection， rupture or dissection of thoracic aorta or pulmonary embolism and pneumothorax . Electrocardiogram， chest X-ray and laboratory tests as CK-MB， troponin， dimer and amylase and lipase can help for diagnosis of cardiovascular respiratory disorder and pancreas . For diagnosis of IHE medical historically， barium or Gastrografin swallow study of esophagus . But today’s， CT-scan of chest or MRI of chest and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy are used. Endoscopic ultrasonography are sometime performed and recommended . Historically， for evaluation of IHE， Barium or Gastrografin swallow was the first choice of radiological imaging . This imaging showing an long segment of tubular filling defect with smooth border or showing the dissection space or the lumen filling with contrast in the esophagus  to days CT-scan of chest is the first rapid and noninvasive radiological investigation of choice and can rule out other thoracic pathologies. CT-scan of chest usually shows symmetric or asymmetric esophageal wall thickening of the esophageal wall . The other imaging for invagination is MRI. MRI show a mass of intermediate signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted image and also shows the extension of the hematoma in several planes and can differentiate esophageal lesions from mediastinal masses or pathologies . Esophagogastroscopy usually shows a large blue or purplish lesion in the posterior portion of esophagus  or sometimes show mucosal erosions， ulcerations or necrosis . Endoscopic ultrasonography can helpful to show underlying intramural orluminal esophageal tumors or vascular lesions . In our case， after roll-out the cardiovascular problem， our performed a CT-scan of the chest and esophagoscopy with carefully that showed the same lesions as described in our cases presentation. Treatment is conservative with no oral food or drink intake， with intravenous fluid and correction of any coagulopathy， then a progressive give the patients fluid and soft diet . Antibiotics are not used routinely， except for rare cases of infection in the submucosal layer . Surgery is contraindicated in IHE except for esophageal perforation in the pleural or mediastinum space， uncontrolled hemorrhage or complicated abscess . If spontaneous resolution do not happen， endoscopic incision of the mucosal layer has been described  prognosis is very good and resolution happen about 2 to3 weeks full recovery happen in (75%)  like in our case. Mortality has been reported after thoracotomy or in very ill whit cardio-pulmonary patients . Recurrent massive bleeding was reported in some case reports and this bleeding managed with arterial embolization . In achalasia recurrence of bleeding was reported . The IHE can be followed by endoscopy or endoscopic ultrasonography .\n\n【12】Conclusion\n\n【13】In conclusion， IEH is a very rare event of esophagus and submucosal esophageal bleeding which can present with acute onset of chest pain， dysphagia or hematemesis and can mimicking some acute cardiopulmonary diseases. These can result in a delayed or even missed diagnosis IHE. Past medical history is very important in such situation. Thus， a high index of suspicion IHE is needed to make the diagnosis and provide the appropriate and best management.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:06:43", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:06:55", "cost": 11.968}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:49", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:06:54", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:06:42"}

Clinical proteomics is the application of proteomics for clinical samples， such as blood， urine， serum and other. Since protein is the basic， fundamental unit of cell functions， its characteristics and pathways， study of clinical proteomics is of practical interest， relevance， and importance. Clinical proteomics is mostly applied in cancer samples and studies on cardiac， COVID-19， and other disease are also on the way， leading to the identification of novel biomarkers and targets， enabling better clinical treatment to the patients. Clinical proteomics also enables personalized/precision medicinebystudyingthe characteristic attributes ofthe patient under concern. Of course， application of proteomics to clinical practice also comes with its challenges on standardization of the sample collection (such as amount， time duration， etc.)， validation of the results， and other. In this mini-review， the various clinical applications of proteomics are discussed， to illustrate the potential of this powerful technique. The challenges and potential future needs are also indicated.\n\n【2】Keywords： Clinical proteomics； Cancer； Biomarker； Mass spectrometry\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Proteomics is the fast， powerful study of the whole proteome (sum of all protein profiles) of a cell， biofluid， tissue， organ or a part of these. The results provide an information-rich landscape of differentially expressed (up and down regulated) proteins and their modulations of two or more samples of interest， under specific conditions . Proteomics could be used to identify Posttranslational Modifications (PTMs)， expression levels， metabolites， metabolic flux， enzymatic activity， targeted biomarkers， discovery analysis， differentiate heterogeneous mixture， serial analysis of patient samples， pharmacokinetics， and therapeutic monitoring of proteins . High throughput LC-MS/MS Proteomics technology has the speed， throughput， robustness， and sensitivity than other technologies . Clinical applications of proteomics are a powerful tool to unravel the molecular mechanisms of clinical samples including blood， serum， urine and tissues of various diseases， such as cancer， cardiovascular disorders， COVID-19，and other. High-throughput molecular spectrometry analysis of human plasma/serum proteomes is emerging as a promising technique for identifying distinct protein profiles in cancer patients. Proteomic patterning of serum was recently developed for the early detection of ovarian cancer . Label-free， quantitative， high throughput Mass Spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics enables system-level analysis of thousands of proteins in complex biological samples . Bioinformatic analysis of the expressed proteins and their known and predicted molecular interactions can be used to determine functional roles of each expressed protein. Modern proteomics provides us opportunity to discover new proteins and pathways involved in the cellular signaling network， as ultimately cells are the basic fundamental building blocks of our bodies. Biological systems have to be explained in terms of the activity， regulation， and modifications of proteins， and the ubiquitous occurrence of PTM. It is immensely useful to identify proteins involved in the diseases and could be used for tailoring the treatment(s). It also offers identification of novel biomarkers and targets due to proteins altered by the disease. Proteomics involves study and analysis of 1000s of proteins at one time， allowing to the specific proteins expressed as a function of diseases cellular functions or interactions . The biomarkers identified as a result of proteomics studies will have higher sensitivity and specificity， due to the multiplexed panels of altered proteins of clinical samples， highly suitable for multifactorial disease， like cancer. Many of these molecules， including essential proteins and most transcription factors among the abundance of proteins， ranging from <50 to>10° molecules per cell， are present at such lowlevels that are not readily detectable by other techniques. The diverse chemical nature of proteins makes the development of globally applicable proteomic assays very challenging . Proteomics enables not only the study of 1000s of proteins， but also their cellular components，such as protein containing complexes， cell parts， organelle， and etc. Gene ontology enrichment of these proteins and their pathways furnish biological processes， molecular functions， and cellular components，subcellular components， that throw light on regulation，transcription， molecular transduction， receptor，translational and transport activities and more. In this review， the various clinical applications of proteomics are discussed， to illustrate the potential of this powerful technique. The challenges and potential future needs are also indicated.\n\n【5】Cancer Applications\n\n【6】Tissue-based proteomic strategies have been applied to the study of many cancer types， including prostate， breast， melanoma， lung， ovarian， and oropharyngeal carcinoma . Tissue global proteomic studies can be further extended to the investigation of PTMs. Yang et al.  studied six primary lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SqCC) and eleven Adenocarcinoma (ADC) tumor tissue samples of non-small cell lung cancer， using MS-proteomics (and glycoproteomics). They identified over 6000 global proteins. The up and down regulated proteins revealed several critical pathways that were activated in SqCC and ADC tumor tissues. Using 96 frozen breast cancer samples of the conventional five types， Bouchalet al.  performed SWATH-MS. Their results indicated over 4，400 proteins， of which， 2，842 had consistent quantification， the majority of which were involved in well-established breast cancer pathways. These were obtained by performing proteomic analysis using an extensive spectral library containing the reference spectra for 28，233 prototypic peptides and their modified variants. Mittal et al.  identified thousands of proteins using the state-of-the-art bioinformatics techniques in their label-free， quantitative， high throughput LC-MS/MS， tandem mass spectroscopy-based proteomics studies of MDA-MB-231， human triple negative breast cancer cells treated with 1200 V/cm， 100 us， 8pulses at 1 HZ and cisplatin， curcumin and turmeric nanoparticle respectively . The curcumin proteomics results indicated the presence of 1，456 proteins， of which 453 proteins were modulated(up/down regulated). These included kinases， heat shock proteins， transcription factors， structural proteins， and metabolic enzymes. Similar results were also obtained in the case of cisplatin and turmeric nanoparticles. These in vitro studies show the promise and potential of future preclinical and clinical studies， leading to every day clinical practices. Protein kinases are critical players in signal transduction pathways， and the dysregulation of these pathways is an intriguing area of study in cancer . Latest MS instruments and phosphopeptide enrichment methods enable the large-scale detection and quantification of thousands of phosphorylation sites. Phosphoproteomic studies in clinical samples allow the identification of aberrantly activated kinases and their downstream substrates， serving as potential therapeutic targets. Many studies have shown important roles in understanding the molecular mechanism of cancers governed by phosphorylation-mediated pathways . Zagorac et al.  performed label-free quantitative analysis of the Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) phosphoproteome and compared relapsed and non-relapsed patients. In total， 34 patient samples were lysed， digested and enriched for phosphopeptides. Label free single shot runs resulted in the detection of more than 10，000 phosphosites， corresponding to 2，643 phosphoproteins. The analysis showed159 phosphosites to have increased phosphorylation status. Thus， proteomics studies are useful to treat TNBC， the unmet need among the various breast cancer subtypes. MS-based proteomics analysis was also used to demonstrate the inter-tumor heterogeneity across different breast cancer subtypes compared to healthy controls， which enhanced the precision and accuracy in discovery and validation of candidate protein markers Protein expression of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) patients using serum auto-antibodies indicated cross-reactivity with proteins from the patient’s tumor . Three proteins-HSP70，peroxidoxin， and Manganese-Superoxide Dismutase(Mn-SOD) were identified to be overexpressed. These could serve as potential markers for HCC. Proteomics analysis of lung cancer patients had shown that Napsin A protein was only expressed in patients with primary lung adenocarcinoma . This has been used as a potential biomarker to differentiate the primary form of lung adenocarcinoma from its metastatic form. Proteomics information is essential to classify the functional subtypes and stages of the breast cancer， to decipher its tumorigenesis mechanisms， c behavior and aggressiveness， to predict recurrence， to assess and reduce the drug resistance， to choose and monitor the most appropriate breast cancer treatment and its efficacy . The office of cancer clinical proteomic research， in the Division of Cancer treatment & Diagnosis of NCI is a national effort to accelerate the understanding of the molecular basis of cancer through the applications of large-scale proteome and genome analysis (Proteogenomics).\n\n【7】COVID-19 Applications\n\n【8】Shen et al.  performed the proteomic (and metabolic) profiling of sera from 46 COVID-19 patients and 53 control individuals， using a machine learning model. The study revealed the characteristic proteins and metabolic changes in the sera of severe COVID-19 patients. They identified molecular changes in the sera of COVID-19 patients， compared to other group， implicating dysregulation of macrophage， platelet degranulation， complement system pathways， and massive metabolic suppression. There were93 proteins with differential expression in severe COVID-19 patient sera. 204 metabolites in COVID-19 patient sera correlate with disease severity and the various pathways analysis highlighted metabolic and immune dysregulation in COVID-19 patients. These could be used as potential blood biomarkers for severity evaluation in the clinics. These molecular changes could be used for therapy development in COVID-19 patients. Demichev et al.  also reported a proteomic survival predictor for COVID-19 patients in intensive care.\n\n【9】Cardiac Application\n\n【10】Proteomics can be a key tool for the prognosis of cardiac allograft rejection . 13 out of 100 overexpressed proteins were identified to have cardiac tissue specificity in post-transplant endomyocardial biopsies. Of those 13， two proteins (alpha-beta-crystallin and tropomyosin) could be measured in patient’s serum presenting cardiac rejection after three months. Thus， the power ofproteomics in the clinic could enable biomarker discovery， useful for future patent treatments. Proteomics enables a more thorough investigation into molecular mechanisms underlying cardiovascular disease， facilitating identification of both quantitative (number of modified proteins) and qualitative (the nature of their modification) details . It helps analyze organ and tissues at the subcellular， and molecular levels have revealed dynamic， complex， and subtle intracellular processes associated with heart and vascular disease.\n\n【11】Human Body Fluid Proteomics\n\n【12】Less or non-invasive body fluids， representative of a tumor or tissue or other， such as blood， urine form suitable samples for proteomics study. In clinics， blood is the most widely used human body fluid in disease diagnosis， prognosis and treatment outcomes . Blood consists of cellular components and theliquid component(plasma). Blood is tested for various plasma proteins via enzymatic assays or antibody-based immunoassays. The vast abundance of 22proteins， constituting 99% of protein content have a dynamic range of mg/mL to pg/mL. This could mask salient， low abundant potential disease biomarker proteins of clinical significance. Advances in MS-based proteomic detection technology and sample preparation have helped to partially overcome these issues.\n\n【13】Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC) are tumor cells， shed from the primary tumor into the circulatory system and can lead to metastasis in different organs， provide a unique source of potential biomarkers. The occurrence of CTCs in blood is very small， only one CTC/mL. Different approaches， including that approved by FDA are used to isolate and detect the epithelial-based CTCs in breast cancer and CRC metastatic studies . Advances in MS-based analysis， especially recent single cell proteomics approaches could potentialy provide proteome-wide insights of these CTCs to identify novel protein markers for their detection and insights into tumour heterogeneity， cancer progression and treatment outcomes. Isolating minute amounts of these cells is a challenging task and all the methods mentioned above come with limitations such as leukocyte crosslinking， which leads to contamination of the target CTC proteome. Recent advancements in moving toward single-cell proteomics will improve coverage of the CTC proteome in future studies.\n\n【14】Urine is another commonly sampled human body fluid， because of its large volume and ease of non-invasive collection . Compared to blood， it has a narrower dynamic range， and is less prone to proteolytic degradation allowing for more stable storage over longer periods of time. Over 6，000 proteins in normal subjects have been identified in urine， using advanced LC-MS instrumentation，leading to the analysis of urinary biomarkers. The challenges associated with urinary proteomics studies include inter-patient variability， as urine protein concentrations depend on kidney filtration and reabsorption performance， which greatly fluctuates within a population. Secondly， intra-patient variability needs further characterization because urinary protein concentrations are affected by the time of day， exercise， diet and age. Leng et al.  studied the urine proteomics of167 healthy individuals and created the reference levels， of over 1，500proteins. They indicate that this study provided a proof-of-principle concept for the use of urine proteome for health monitoring and disease screening using the physiological and pathological changes. More work needs to be performed in this area.\n\n【15】In addition to blood and urine， there are other human body fluids that could potentially be used for biomarker discovery. Lassman et al.  identified two biomarkers， SME1-1， and SME-2 from the cerebrospinal fluid from post-mortem diagnosed Alzheimer’s disease. Some of these non-conventional fluid samples are rich sources of organ-specific proteins due to their close proximity， but need invasive sample collection， and hence they may not be as applicable for routine clinical practices， such as early cancer detection or longitudinal monitoring of cancer progression-yet.\n\n【16】Summary\n\n【17】Effective and economical applications of proteomics for clinical practice could help patients all over the world， immensely. Cancer biomarkers have transformed current practices in the oncology clinic. Mass spectrometry has the potential that enables increasingly comprehensive insights into changes of the proteome to advance clinical medicine. Label-free， quantitative， high throughput， tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomic studies in multi-centers， with standardized protocols， with high specificity and selectivity of proteins enable identification of novel pathways and biomarkers that enhance the quality of patient treatment that are affordable and efficacious， in cancer and other diseases. Design， development， standardization， and validation of clinical-friendly assays that take into account of the heterogeneity and other complexities involved in the tumors and other diseases could address the global challenges of engineering better biomarkers， and hence better medicines and treatments", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:52:16", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:52:30", "cost": 14.086}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:49", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:52:30", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:52:16"}

The perioperative and postoperative outcomes were included.\n\n【3】Results： The average operation and hospital stay time was 45 min and 7 days respectively. Range of Motion (ROM)，Knee Society Scores (KSS) and Lysholm scores was related to a greater increase. No patients have nonunion， infection and revision. The results showed that miniature plate internal fixation was related to greater decreases in incidence of complications and increases in postoperative Range of Motion (ROM)， and Knee Society Score (KSS) function and Lysholm scores.\n\n【4】Conclusion： In this study， miniature plate internal fixation technology for the treatment of patella fracture has the advantages of simple operation， rapid recovery， and better perioperative and postoperative outcomes.\n\n【5】Keywords： Patella Fracture； Miniature plate internal fixation； Soft tissue irritation；Radiological； Reoperations\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Patella fractures are common， accounting for 1% of skeletal injuries . In the presence of significant fracture displacement and articular incongruity， open reduction and internal fixation is the standard of method to restore quadriceps function and prevent osteoarthritis. Classically， the fixation technique for patella fixation utilizes axial K-wires in combination with tension banding for reinforcement . As a result ofutilizing K-wires or metallic implants， patients commonly complain of soft tissue irritation in the knee. Most of patients subsequently require secondary procedures for implant removal to provide symptomatic relief .\n\n【8】Some reports suggest that circular ligation and suture can be used， but wire banding cannot effectively close the proximal articular surface of patella， and debris can easily enter the articular cavity . At the same time， wire fixation will affect the distribution of blood vessels near the patella. Although it has good short-term effect， there are many potential adverse effects in the long run. Patella fracture managed by fixation with K-wires or metal implants often cause local soft tissue irritation and necessitate implant removal. An alternative is to utilize miniature plate internal fixation methods. We have adopted miniature plate internal fixation in the management of patella fracture. Here， we report the results of the fixation techniques.\n\n【9】Materials and Methods\n\n【10】Patient demographics\n\n【11】We retrospectively reviewed our database， which was collected prospectively. From January 2019to January 2020， 11 patients with patella fracture. The clinical data of 11 patients with regular follow-up were obtained， with 7 males and 14 females. The inclusion criterion was a single avulsion fracture of patella， the time of injury was less than 3 weeks， all patients had complete imaging examination of the knee joint， and they were 34C1-3 according to OTA/AO classification. The exclusion criteria included combined tibial plateau fractures， fractures around the knee joint， comminuted fracture， pathological fracture， and combined severe vascular and nerve injuries. Traffic accidents were the major mechanism of injury， accounting for 6 (55%) of 11 cases， along with 5 cases of fall injury(45%) .\n\n【12】Table 1： Summary of patients.\n\n| Knee  | Sex  | Age (year)  | Joh  | Injury  | OTAIAO classification  | Operation  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | M  | 55  | Manual worker  | Traffic accident  | 34C1-3  | Primary  |\n| 2  | F  | 59  | Housewite  | Traffic accident  | 34C1-3  | Primary  |\n| 3  | M  | 61  | Manual worker  | Traffic accident  | 34C1-3  | Primary  |\n| 4  | M  | 58  | Manual worker  | Fall  | 34C1-3  | Primary  |\n| 5  | M  | 59  | Farmer  | Traffic accident  | 34C1-3  | Primary  |\n| 6  | F  | 64  | Housewife  | Fall  | 34C1-3  | Primary  |\n| 7  | F  | 61  | Housewife  | Fall  | 34C1-3  | Primary  |\n| 8  | M  | 56  | Manual worker  | Fall  | 34C1-3  | Primary  |\n| 9  | M  | 59  | Farmer  | Traffic accident  | 34C1-3  | Primary  |\n| 10  | M  | 58  | Farmer  | Fall  | 34C1-3  | Primary  |\n| 11  | F  | 59  | Housewife  | Traffic accident  | 34C1-3  | Primary  |\n\n【14】M： Male； F： Female\n\n【15】Detemmination of fixation method\n\n【16】Decision in regard to fixation method of the fractured patella was determined intraoperatively bythe surgeon based on its configuration. Fractures were managed with miniature plate internal fixation， and those considered being stability to prevent anterior displacement of fracture fragments. Transverse and comminuted intraarticular fractures were treated by miniature plate internal fixation.\n\n【17】Surgical technique\n\n【18】Patient assessment\n\n【19】The patients provided a standard history and underwent physical examination that consisted of measurement of the knee range of motion by a single surgeon before surgery； at 3，6， and 12 months after surgery； and yearly thereafter. We assessed all patients preoperatively by using the scoring systems of the KSS， Knee Society Score (KSS， a100-point scoring system)， and Lysholm Score (a 100-point scoring system). We reassessed the patients at the time of the final follow-up. The average time to final follow-up was 14 months (range， 12 to16 months). We believe that the variability of the follow-up period did not affect the current result， because the clinical results did not change after 1 years postoperatively.\n\n【20】We performed all procedures using general anesthesia with patient in the supine position， used tourniquet and anterior median incision， exposed the broken end of the fracture， reduction the fracture， cover the plate on the bone surface， drill， sounding and screw in the screws. Ensure that the fracture are covered and firmly fixed by plates and screws . If necessary， Kirschner wire and cannulated screw shall be used to strengthen the fixation. C-arm fluoroscopy， the positions of plates， screws and patellar articular surface are satisfactory， and the knee joint is moved passively during the operation without abnormal loosening. Limb was fixed with plaster at 0 degree of extension.\n\n【21】Postoperative care and follow-up\n\n【22】Radiography and magnetic resonance imaging\n\n【23】We obtained preoperative and follow-up radiographs in all patients. X-ray and CT scan was performed . Radiography was performed by a single surgeon before surgery； at 3， 6， and 12months after surgery； and yearly thereafter， and this study used the final data.\n\n【24】Postoperative radiographs were taken the day after surgery. Patients were given a plaster as protection postoperatively. In general，0 to 90 degrees of flexion in-brace was allowed for the first 2 weeks postoperatively and allowed to weight bear. Patients were given their first follow-up appointment at 2 weeks postoperatively for wound inspection， then they were followed up every 4 to 6 weeks to monitor for functional return and clinical/radiological fracture union .\n\n【25】Outcomes measures\n\n【26】The primary outcomes of this study were the reoperation rates for the fixation methods and the prevalence of symptomatic hardware causing soft tissue irritation. Secondary outcomes included surgical complications (fixation failure/displacement， implant breakage/dislodgement， nonunion， infection)， radiological parameters， and knee function.\n\n【27】Statistical analysis\n\n【28】We compared the scores， range of motion before surgery with the values at final follow-up using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs test. We used the Mann-Whitney U test. A significant difference was defined as P<0.05.\n\n【29】Results\n\n【30】Clinical results\n\n【31】The average preoperative scores were 42.5 points by KSS (range：35 to 55 points)， and 40.5 points by Lysholm (36.5 to 42.5 points). Average clinical outcome scores all improved significantly after surgery at the final follow-up (14 months， range： 12 to 16) months after surgery； KSS 88.2 points； Lysholm， 91.5 points (P<0.0.05) . All manual workers and farmers returned to the same jobs. The knee active range of motion improved significantly after surgery at the final follow-up (P<0.05). Range of motion and strength were measured at 3，6，and 12 months and yearly thereafter. However，there was no significant change beyond 1 year after surgery. There were no surgical complications such as neural injury， infection， or suture anchor problems in this series. Also we did not see any complications with the harvest site.\n\n【32】Overall， no patients received reoperations after initial fracture fixation . All the patients can kneel in the follow-up 8 weeks. No case happened implant-related soft tissue irritation， with analysis identifying that soft tissue irritation was specifically reduced in miniature plate internal fixation. No implant removal was requested for all cases. Patients were asymptomatic in the knee. No one patient was noted to have miniature plate internal fixation dislodgement upon follow-up X-rays. All patients receiving miniature plate internal fixation demonstrated no fracture displacement. All patients had nonunion and implant breakage. There were no cases of infection among our patient population.\n\n【33】Radiological and functional outcomes\n\n【34】During the follow-up period， there was no bone displacement， miniature plate internal fixation loosening and ligament rupture. All patients receiving metal fixation， demonstrated no exist patella baja. During the follow-up period， all radiological analysis showed no reduction in patella height .\n\n【35】Discussion\n\n【36】Fractures of patella are mostly caused by direct violence， or are more common in patients with osteoporosis . Kirschner wire tension band technique is the most commonly used method for open reduction and internal fixation of patellar fracture . The use of Kirschner wire tension band leads to soft tissue stimulation. It is necessary to remove the internal fixation. The failure of internal fixation， wire slip， postoperative pain and revision are not rare in clinical research . The thickness of the miniature plate used in the operation was 1mm， and the diameter of the screw was 2.0 mm and 2.7 mm. Miniature plates and screws can cover the patella to form a three-dimensional fixation. In terms of length， they cover the upper and lower patella. In terms of depth， attention should be paid to protecting the cartilage surface of the patella during fixation to prevent screws from entering the joint .\n\n【37】Table 2： Summary of patients'knee functional scores.\n\n| Knee  | KSS function (scores)  |  | Lysholm (scores)  |  | ROM (degree)  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Knee  | Preoperative  | Postoperative  | Preoperative  | Postoperative  | Preoperative  | Postoperative  |\n| 1  | 35  | 90  | 39.5  | 92.5  | 0-35  | 0-125  |\n| 2  | 40  | 85  | 40.5  | 91.5  | 0-45  | 0-125  |\n| 3  | 35  | 85  | 36.5  | 92.5  | 0-35  | 0-115  |\n| 4  | 45  | 90  | 40.5  | 91.5  | 0-40  | 0-120  |\n| 5  | 50  | 90  | 41.5  | 93.5  | 0-45  | 0-125  |\n| 6  | 40  | 90  | 39.5  | 92.5  | 0-40  | 0-130  |\n| 7  | 45  | 90  | 42.5  | 93.5  | 0-45  | 0-120  |\n| 8  | 40  | 85  | 37.5  | 90.5  | 0-40  | 0-120  |\n| 9  | 35  | 90  | 41.5  | 91.5  | 0-45  | 0-125  |\n| 10  | 40  | 90  | 40.5  | 90.5  | 0-40  | 0-125  |\n| 11  | 45  | 85  | 39.5  | 91.5  | 0-45  | 0-120  |\n\n【39】ROM： Range of Motion； KSS： Knee Society Score\n\n| Knee  | FWB (weeks)  | Nonunion  | Any infection  | Revision  | Implant removal  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | 11  | NO  | NO  | NO  | NO  |\n| 2  | 12  | NO  | NO  | NO  | NO  |\n| 3  | 11  | NO  | NO  | NO  | NO  |\n| 4  | 13  | NO  | NO  | NO  | NO  |\n| 5  | 10.5  | NO  | NO  | NO  | NO  |\n| 6  | 11  | NO  | NO  | NO  | NO  |\n| 7  | 11.5  | NO  | NO  | NO  | NO  |\n| 8  | 12  | NO  | NO  | NO  | NO  |\n| 9  | 11  | NO  | NO  | NO  | NO  |\n| 10  | 12  | NO  | NO  | NO  | NO  |\n| 11  | 11.5  | NO  | NO  | NO  | NO  |\n\n【41】As for the reason why the miniature steel plate plays a strong role in fixation， the author believes that the force on the patella and the patella-femoral joint in the process of extension and flexion is equal to the resultant force of quadriceps femoris force and patellar ligament . In the process of flexion， the force will increase with the increase of flexion angle， and the corresponding contact area of patellar joint will also increase. As the supporting point of the lever in the process of patella flexion， the force arm is very small， so the bending force of patella internal fixation in the process of patella flexion will not be too large， and the miniature steel plate can bear this force . The miniature plate is placed in front ofthe patella， and the screw is fixed in the sagittal position， which can gather the fracture blocks together. This kind of fixation cannot be fixed by Kirschner wire tension band. In addition， for severe comminuted fractures， due to the small volume of the plate and firm fixation， complications such as soft tissue stimulation caused by internal fixation such as tension band can be avoided .\n\n【42】Compared with Kirschner wire tension band， the use of miniature plate internal fixation technology has the following advantages：  less trauma， shorter operation time， convenient use of instruments and fixtures；  miniature plate internal fixation have good biocompatibility， which has little impact on the anatomical structure of the knee joint；  It is conducive to the early recovery of the function of the patients after operation. No necessary second operation is needed to remove the implant. The small scar of the incision can meet the needs of the patients for the cosmetology of the incision.\n\n【43】Conclusion\n\n【44】In this study， miniature plate internal fixation technology for the treatment of patellar fracture has the advantages of simple operation， reliable fixation， restoring patellar anatomical shape， early functional exercise to achieve rapid recovery， good healing effect， reliable internal fixation and fewer complications.\n\n【45】Limitations\n\n【46】The follow-up time of all patients in this study is short， and there is still a lack of further research on large samples， especially on biomechanics. At present， the treatment of patellar fracture with miniature plate internal fixation has been carried out for a relatively short time， and the number of cases is relatively small. There are also shortcomings in this study， such as small sample size and insufficient follow-up time， especially on biomechanics， which may lead to deviations in the evaluation of curative effect. Further expansion of sample size and long-term follow-up are needed to confirm this.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:44:15", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:44:49", "cost": 34.396}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:49", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:44:49", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:44:14"}

After recovery， she developed polyuria， polydipsia， polyphagia， and weight loss. Her blood glucose level was 17.5 mmol/l， and fasting C-peptide was significantly reduced. Blood ketones， urine ketones， serum anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies， and anti-insulinoma associated antigen-2 antibodies were positive， and she was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

It is the second coronavirus to cause a major outbreak in humans， following the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003， with an 82% genetic similarity between the two viruses . While the accelerated development and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines have significantly reduced the incidence and mortality rates， the number of newly diagnosed Type 1 Diabetes (T1DM) cases has increased during the COVID-19pandemic . However， there are relatively few reports on children developing T1DM after COVID-19 infection. This article reports on a case of newly diagnosed T1DM with ketosis in an8-year-and-6-month-old girl after recovering from COVID-19 infection. It discusses the correlation between T1DM and CoVID-19 infection and analyzes how the immune and inflammatory responses triggered by COVID-19 infection may act as a trigger for the onset of diabetes.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】The patient， an 8-year-6-month-old girl， was admitted to the hospital on March 124， 2023 due to\"polyuria，polydipsia， and polyphagia with weight loss for over 2 months\". She had been experiencing polyuria for over 2 months， urinating 3 to 4 times during the day and 2 to 4 times during the night. She also had increased thirst， drinking approximately 1 liter of water per day， and an increased appetite， leading to a weight loss of 10 kg in the past 2 months. She did not have any headaches， dizziness， abdominal pain， diarrhea， coma， or excessive sleepiness. She sought medical attention at a local hospital where her blood glucose was measured at 17.5 mmol/L. She was admitted to our hospital for further diagnosis and treatment for diabetes.\n\n【7】The patient had a history of COVID-19 infection， confirmed by positive COVID-19 RNA test results after presenting with fever andcough on December. She was prescribed antipyretics， and her fever returned to normal on the third day oftreatment. She was also prescribed cough syrup， which improved her cough and sputum production. Her chest X-ray and blood glucose tests were not completed during this period. The patient had received two doses ofthe COVID-19vaccine： The first dose (Sinovac) on November 274，2021， and the second dose (Sinovac) on December 28h， 2021.\n\n【8】Personal history： The patient is a G1P1 full-term cesarean section with a birth weight of 3.5 kg.\n\n【9】Family history： Both parents are healthy， but the patient's grandmother has had type 2 diabetes for 5 years and is able to control her blood sugar with insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents. On admission， the patient was 144 cm tall and weighed 32.5 kg. The patient was alert， with no obvious dry lips， elastic skin， and no sunken eye sockets. There were no abnormalities found in the examination of the cardiovascular， respiratory， or nervous systems.\n\n【10】Auxiliary examination： Arterial blood gas and lactate： Lactate 1.0mmol/L； pH 7.33； pCO， 35.1 mmHg； pO2 82.4 mmHg； bicarbonate concentration 17.9 mmol/L； actual base excess -6.8 mmol/L； anion gap 26.39. Blood glucose 17.4 mmol/l； serum B-hydroxybutyrate：5.470 (0.27) mmol/L. Glycosylated hemoglobin A1c 15.1%(4.2%). Fasting C-peptide 0.21 (0.19) ng/mL； fasting insulin 6.1(2.8) mIU/L. Serum anti-GAD antibody assay： >280.00 IU/ml； anti-islet cellantibodyassay：36.50 COI. Liver and kidney electrolytes：potassium 4.29 mmol/L， sodium 133 mmol/L， chloride 93 mmol/L， COVID-19 serum IgG antibody positive， COVID-19 serum IgM antibody negative. Urine routine： Urine glucose 4+  mmol/L； urine ketone 3+(7.4) mmol/L； urine protein and red blood cell count negative. Urine microalbumin assay normal. Thyroid function test， immunoglobulin IgG， IgM， IgA assay， cortisol assay (8AM)， adrenocorticotropic hormone assay (8AM)， and insulin-like growth factor assay all normal. Bilateral kidney ultrasound： Right kidney cyst(0.8 cm x0.6 cm).\n\n【11】The diagnosis of type 1 diabetes with ketosis is definite in the child.\n\n【12】After admission， the patient was put under electrocardiogram monitoring and blood sugar monitoring. Immediately， 500 ml of normal saline was administered for fluid replacement. When blood sugar levels gradually decreased， a basal insulin pump dose and a high dose of subcutaneous injection before three meals were given. After correcting the ketosis and stabilizing blood sugar levels， the treatment was changed to a high dose of insulin injection before three meals and a long-acting insulin injection before bedtime. Diabetes education was provided， and blood sugarlevels before meals fluctuated between5 mmol/l to 7 mmol/l， and after meals fluctuated between 7 mmol/l to 10 mmol/l. The patient was discharged after achieving stable blood sugar levels. A follow-up visits half a month after discharge showed good blood sugar control in the patient.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】During the COVID-19 pandemic， there has been an increase in the number of newly diagnosed cases of Type 1 Diabetes (T1DM). According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States， adolescents under the age of 18 who contract COVID-19 are 2.6 times more likely to develop new-onset T1DM within 30 days compared to their peers . Studies have also shown that the risk of being diagnosed with diabetes within 1to 5 months after a COVID-19 diagnosis is nearly twice as high as in healthy individuals ， and a follow-up study of up to one year on 180，000 COVID-19 recovered patients found a 40% increased risk of developing new-onset diabetes . This article explores the correlation between type 1 diabetes and COVID-19 infection and emphasizes that the immune and inflammatory responses after coronavirus infection may serve as triggering factors for the onset of new diabetes.\n\n【15】T cells mediate organ-specific immune damage， which is an important factor in type 1 diabetes. Selective autoimmune destruction of beta cells leads to a lack of insulin secretion and disease. The etiology may be due to the interaction of genetic susceptibility factors and environmental factors resulting in immune dysregulation. Loss of immune tolerance in pancreatic beta cells leads to immune attack， which triggers autoimmune diabetes . Genetic susceptibility factors include human leukocyte antigen， variable tandem repeat sequences in insulin genes， and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigens Environmental factors such as viral infections， dietary components， and chemical toxins， etc. Viral infections may act as the initiating factor of pancreatic beta cell autoimmune attack . Currently， human viruses that are generally believed to be associated with type1 diabetes include Coxsackie B virus， rubella virus， mumps virus， cytomegalovirus， EB virus， varicella-zoster virus， retroviruses， and rotaviruses， etc.\n\n【16】There is a bidirectional relationship between COVID-19 and diabetes . On one hand， diabetes is an important risk factor for severe COVID-19 and an independent predictor of poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients. On the other hand， COVID-19 can induce and exacerbate diabetes， with an increased number of new cases of type1 diabetes observed in COVID-19 patients. In addition to directly inducing diabetes， COVID-19 infection can also lead to Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) and Hyperglycemic Hyperosmolar State (HHS) in diabetic patients， worsening their condition. This suggests that both direct and indirect factors caused by COVID-19 infection play important roles in the development of diabetes .\n\n【17】The SARS-CoV-2 virus has three structural proteins outside its envelope， namely Spike (S) protein， Envelope (E) protein， and Membrane (M) protein， with S protein being the key factor that mediates the virus's infection of target cells. The S protein is a homotrimer， and its extracellular domain can be divided into two subunits based on their functions， namely S1 and S2. The S1 subunit is mainly responsible for recognizing and binding to the receptor Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) . ACE2 is a key enzyme in the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS). It catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin II to angiotensin . ACE2was initially reported to be expressed on the surface of respiratory epithelial cells，but subsequent studies found that it is highly expressed in other tissues， such as the intestine， kidney， cardiovascular system， and pancreas， including the surface of pancreatic islet cells . It is the entry point for the SARS-CoV-2 virus， and its invasion of respiratory epithelial cells and other target cells involves binding with ACE-2. Increased expression of ACE2 facilitates more effective cell binding and entry. The possible implications of these interactions are twofold. Firstly， SARS-CoV-2 entering pancreatic beta cells directly induces a cytopathic effect leading to beta cell damage and the occurrence of diabetes. By binding with the specific receptor on the surface of beta cells， the virus invades and replicates within the cells， causing an increase in membrane permeability and impairing the function of beta cells to synthesize insulin . Secondly， it induces cell lysis and directly destroys pancreatic beta cells. These two factors maylead to the deterioration of pancreatic beta cell function and the onset of diabetes. The coronavirus-mediated damage to pancreatic beta cells does not seem to be a new phenomenon， as evidenced by the experience of the previous SARS coronavirus outbreak .\n\n【18】The immune mechanism plays an important role in the development of type 1 diabetes. Cells infected with the novel coronavirus undergo apoptosisor necrosis，triggering an inflammatory responsecharacterized by the activation of proinflammatory cytokines or chemokines， which leads to the recruitment of inflammatory cells. CD4+T helper type 1 (Th1) cells regulate antigen presentation and immune responses to intracellular pathogens (such as coronaviruses) by interfering with Interferon-Gamma (IFN-y) production. Th17 cells induce the recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages by producing Interleukin-17 (IL-17)， IL-21， and IL-22. Novel coronavirus infection results in the apoptosis of circulating immune cells，leading to a reduction in lymphocytes (CD3+， CD4+， and CD8+T cells) and the secretion oflarge amounts of inflammatory cytokines， which is called a \"cytokine storm\". In fact， the circulating levels of cytokines (such as IL-6 and TNF-a) involved in the cytokine storm syndrome are elevated and may cause excessive inflammation in novel coronavirus infection， leading to multiple organ failure，loss of immune tolerance of pancreatic B-cells， and ultimately triggering autoimmune diabetes. It can be said that immune-mediated type 1diabetes is caused by selective autoimmune destruction of pancreatic B-cells， leading to insulin secretion deficiency. The inflammatory cytokine IL-6 can also directly act on pancreatic cells， not only impairing the function of insulin secretion by pancreatic B-cells but also inducing their apoptosis. Therefore， in addition to the pancreatic and insulin damage caused by direct novel coronavirus infection， the critical inflammatory cytokine IL-6 induced by novel coronavirus infection can also cause or exacerbate diabetes by reducing insulin release and enhancing insulin resistance in peripheral tissues .\n\n【19】In addition， the inflammatory cells triggered by the new coronavirus infection not only infiltrate the lungs and cause lung damage and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)， but also affect skeletal muscle and liver function. These two organs are responsible for insulin-mediated glucose uptake and gluconeogenesis， and inflammatory-induced functional impairments may lead to hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia .\n\n【20】In summary， COVID-19 infection may act as an initiating factor for autoimmune beta-cell damage， causing direct or indirect injury to pancreatic cells and loss of insulin secretion capacity after entering the cells through the ACE-2 receptor. The virus-mediated release of chemokines and cytokines from immune reactions can affect pancreatic cells， causing loss of immune tolerance and inducing the occurrence of autoimmune diabetes. Immune reactions may further impair the ability of the liver， muscles， and other peripheral organs to uptake glucose， thereby further causing or exacerbating diabetes. This also reminds us to strengthen the prevention of COVID-19， especially to pay attention to diabetes symptoms in children infected with COVID-19， including thirst， increased urination， weight loss， nausea， vomiting， and lethargy， and to timely receive blood glucose testing to detect diabetes in a timely manner.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:06:18", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:06:42", "cost": 24.269}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:49", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:06:42", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:06:17"}

Colonic volvulus is the third most common cause of large bowel obstruction worldwide. Hirschsprung's Disease (HD)， is a rare congenital colonic disorder. However， it can present in adulthood and can have particularly high risk of obstetric complications to both the mother and the fetus with main complication being refractory chronic constipation. Literature review detected6 articles reporting the clinical manifestations and the management of patients with refractory chronic constipation in pregnancy of9 cases.\n\n【2】Case： In this article， a complicated case of a 36 weeks parous lady，G3P2 with megacolon is presented. The consequences and delivery outcomes， of chronic constipation during pregnancy， due to chronic volvulus of an already dilated colon， on top of enteric atony due to partial HD， are discussed.\n\n【3】Conclusion： Preventive dietary measures， laxatives and frequent antenatal care may probably reduce the risk of complicated megacolon， caesarian section and premature delivery. Chronic constipation during reproductive age should merit further clinical attention during antenatal care， as well as multi-disciplinary approach in the management and treatment of these patients.\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Megacolon refers to hugecolon dilatation due to fecal compaction as a result ofbowel dysfunction without any mechanical obstruction . Many congenital and acquired diseases characterized by innervation defect and/or transmural inflammation of the colon， lead to severe reduced peristalsis， chronic constipation and fecal impaction. Acquired conditions such as inflammatory disease， as well as neurological， systemic， metabolic diseases and medication may lead to megacolon . Hirschsprung’s Disease (HD) in pregnancy is frequently reported to also cause colon dilatation， negatively affecting maternal health and pregnancy outcomes.\n\n【6】HD is a rare disease with an estimated prevalence of 1：5000 live births and belongs in the family of intestinal innervation defects， also known as dysganglionosis . Intestinal innervation defects can be divided into a) Genetic type (Hirschsprung’s disease， Segmental aganglionosis of colon)， b) Hypogenetic type (an isolated hypoganglionosis)， c) Dysgenetic type (intestinal neuronal dysplasia causing a variable degree of intestinal dysfunction and colon fecal impaction).\n\n【7】The diagnosis of HD is histological， whereas lack of ganglion cells in the area of the Auerbach plexus and Meissner plexus in the distal section of the large intestine is pathognomonic. The pathogenesis of HD is not fully understood. It is assumed that during embryonic development 4 to12 week of gestation， due to migration failure of the primary neural cells results to aganglionic colon . Another hypothesis suggests that microenvironment changes cause abnormal differentiation， degeneration of ganglion cells and premature cell necrosis resulting to defective peristalsis partly or along the whole large intestine .\n\n【8】A very short segment has been reported isolated in the anal canal just above the pectinate line to the rarest and most severe clinical form of HD which is total colonic aganglionosis， observed in 5% of patients. The most common form occurs in the distal part of the sigmoid colon and rectum found in 75% to 80% of cases. In 10% of cases a more severe form of long aganglionic segment is observed extending from the rectum， sigmoid colon， and colon up to the splenic flexure . Clinical symptoms appear in 70% to 90% during their first days oflife and absence of meconium after birth raises the suspicion of HD . Up to 80% of infants demonstrate defecation and dietary problems， delayed physical development， significant flatulence， and emesis. Other children are asymptomatic until late childhood. Chronic constipation， malnutrition， and physical development delay require colonoscopy and biopsy to rule out HD. Occasionally HD can cause acute enteritis and severe diarrheas with a 30% fatality rate .\n\n【9】During pregnancy， high and prolonged progesterone levels impair smooth muscle tone， causing in many women constipation， urine retention and varicose veins . In addition， around 20 weeks of gestation， as uterus expands and compresses the bowel， constipation may become a significant antenataltreatment problem . Additionally， laxative medications， and manual fecal disimpaction， are avoided in 2nd and 3rd trimester to avoid premature contractions being induced . Consequently， the combinations of a pre-existing condition like HD， mechanical compression by the pregnant uterus as well as the hormonal effects on the intestinal tract，pose a high-risk to chronic constipation in pregnant women.\n\n【10】Case Presentation\n\n【11】A 25 years old lady， gravid 3， para 2， with 2 previous vaginal deliveries presented at our outpatient clinic at 34 weeks complaining of a progressive abdominal enlargement， discreet from the gravid uterus that has been growing since the third month ofher pregnancy. Strangely，the patient reported， complete absence of bowel movements since early secondtrimester， with occasional flatus every few days and unintentional loss of 5 kg during the last 3 months ofher pregnancy.\n\n【12】The patient reported similar progressive abdominal distention， along with constipation in her previous two pregnancies. However， in the current pregnancy the abdominal enlargement had been significantly more remarkable and with complete absence of bowel movements since， 18 weeks of gestation. Her bowel movements were compromised during both previous pregnancies， where she became constipated and had a single motion per week， despite using multiple laxatives. The patient's past medical history was insignificant except from a potential congenital bowel problem suspected in infancy for which investigations were refused. During adulthood the patient reports dependence on laxatives to maintain one or two bowel motions per week.\n\n【13】During her 3d pregnancy， she rarely attended antenatal care where laxatives were recommended until fetal maturity. Finally， when her condition continued to deteriorate， she attended our hospital. Her vital signs were within normal limits， but she looked very weak and cachectic. Her weight was 47 Kg， and BMI was 17.6 kg/m. Abdominal examination revealed a large abdominal mass， measuring45 cm craniocaudally and 18 cm across， rising on the right side of the abdomen from the symphysis pubis， up to the xiphisternum .\n\n【14】The gravid uterus was palpated at 36 weeks fundallevel， displaced by the mass to the left abdominal side. The mass was rather mobile， mildly tender， of a semi-solid consistency， which was compressible onfinger pressure.AbdominalIexamination Was otherwise unremarkable.Vaginal examination revealed1 a hard， smooth， rounded mass filling the pelvis， but that was not the fetal head， which was high in the abdomen and pushed to the left side. The cervix was soft， closed，long， retracted behind the symphysis pubis and deviating to the left side. Rectal digital examination revealed an empty rectum， with no palpable masses or lesions. Pelvic-abdominal ultrasound scanning revealed a single viable fetus， with biometry corresponding to menstrual age. It also revealed marked distension of the bowel， with an oblong shaped hard lesion all over the abdominal and pelvic cavities， likely markedly augmented colonic distension， for further investigation. MRI of the abdomen and pelvis revealed marked dilatation of the large intestine till the sigmoid colon， where there is a large impacted fecal matter .\n\n【15】The patient was conservatively managed at our institution，hoping to push her closer to fetal maturity， as long as maternal and fetal wellbeing allowed. She was given steroids for fetal lung maturity at36 weeks， and was scheduled for delivery at 37 weeks. Digital vaginal examination revealed she was not a candidate for vaginal delivery， as the fetal head was totally pushed aside out of the maternal pelvis by the distended colonic mass. The decision for caesarean delivery was made. During the c-section an extended abdominal midline incision revealed the huge colon was almost completely occupying the abdominal cavity and was remarkably bigger than the uterus， which was bent to the left side. Inevitably the gravid uterus was pulled extra-abdominally to gain good exposure of the lower segment and a healthy， 2，500 gm baby was delivered. Once the uterine wound was sutured and the uterus contracted， we could diagnose the hugely dilated and bizarrely elongated sigmoid colon， which was twisted 34turns around its mesosigmoid . The diagnosis of chronic sigmoid volvulus was then made.\n\n【16】Combined milking of the sigmoid， abdominally and per rectal digital fecal disimpaction， failed. Colon damage and loss of function was evident due to prolonged ischemia after atony and extreme distention， accompanied by a very thin wall and dark color of the viscera . Sigmoidectomy and temporarycolostomy followed and 2 intra-peritoneal drains were left in the pelvis. The abdominal wound was closed in lavers of anatomical order.\n\n【17】The postoperative course of the patient was good， and she was kept Nil-Per-Os until the colostomy was functional within 2 days. Her vital signs were stable and the wound clean. The only remarkable finding was a moderate edema of the colostomy stoma， due to hypoalbuminemia (2.5 gm/dL)， attributed to her malnourished preoperative state. This was corrected by human albumin infusion， with a resultant reabsorption of the edema. The patient and her newborn were discharged from the hospital 2 weeks later， in a good health. Reversal of the colostomy was performed 3 months post-operatively， without complications.\n\n【18】The removed huge sigmoid colon， measured 107 cm， in length， and 27 cm in width， and containing 6，800 gm of fecal matter (Figure 4). We are not aware of any such massive dimensions of a sigmoid colon being reported in literature.\n\n【19】Histopathological examination ofthe resected colon revealed full thickness colonic wall tissue with few scattered lymphoid follicles in mucosa and submucosa along with prominent nerve trunks between circular and longitudinal layers of the muscularis propria. Ganglion cells could not be identified in submucosa or muscularis propria. Ganglion cells could not be identified in the resection margin of the narrow end. However， few ganglion cells were seen in the resection margin of the wide end. This was consistent with the diagnosis ofhypoganglionosis with a-ganglionic distal end， picture of Hirschsprung's disease .\n\n【20】Discussion\n\n【21】In this article， a complicated case of pregnancy with megacolon is presented. The consequences of chronic constipation due to chronic volvulus of an already dilated colon， on top of enteric atony due to partial HD， during pregnancy and delivery outcomes are discussed.\n\n【22】The management options of the case were thoroughly discussed amongthe multidisciplinaryteampriortosurgery. Midlinelaparotomy was decided to expose both the uterine lower segment and the hugely dilated colon. Once the fetus was delivered by cesarean section and the uterine wound was closed， the sigmoid in torsion was untwisted. Trial of closed drainage of the sigmoid failed. Very hard， pasty fecal matter was delivered， at a slow rate because of its hard consistency. The evidence of prolonged severe ischemia was prominent. The decision of sigmoidectomy was based on the clinical diagnosis of the complete loss of function of the colon based on the following： a) the very thin wall and dark color of the colon b) the extreme compaction of the mass due to long-standing extreme dilatation and，c) doubt that the colonic tissue can withstand the trauma of squeezing. The distended colon was resected and exteriorized for colostomy which was previously reported in literature to be successful .\n\n【23】On reviewing the literature， most of the cases were pregnant women， in whom warning symptoms of severe and refractory constipation appeared between 16 and 28 weeks of gestation. Among the 9 pregnant women who had megacolon after chronic constipation， 2 had a history of ulcerative colitis and the other 7 had history of colonic innervation defect. Most of the patients (6/9) had vaginal delivery by forceps or vacuum mainly due to dystocia， and the rest had a cesarean section. Colectomy and temporal ileostomy were performed in 3 out of the 9 women. Most of the patients had been using unsuccessfully， oral volume expanders and laxatives to facilitate defecation .\n\n【24】Chronic constipation resulting in megacolon has been described in the literature in patients with inflammatory bowel disease， and Hirschsprung’s disease. The peak incidence of most of these diseases coincides with childbearing age. When patients have been managed by colectomy， then infertility can be a problem mainly due to abdominal adhesions .\n\n【25】In case of Hirschsprung’s Disease (HD)， the pathological condition leadingto0megacolonisCdifferent.Thelackof parasympathetic ganglion cells in submucosal and mesenteric plexus of part of colon causes functional obstruction and colonic dilation proximal to affected segment. The colon innervations defect and decreased peristalsis deteriorate by the pregnancy high progesterone levels and facilitates fecal compaction. Chronic and refractory to medication constipation seems to lead to chronic colon inflammation and extreme distention， increasing the risk of toxic megacolon. The obstetrical complications such as intra uterine growth retardation and preterm labor are anticipated once the colon is over distended and nutrients absorption is compromised.\n\n【26】The timing and type of delivery depends upon the gestational age， fetus weight， maternal health condition， degree of feces impaction and birth canal obstruction. Once gestation is close to term earlier delivery due to maternal discomfort and malnutrition， inducing vaginal delivery due to imminent complete fecal compaction might be indicated. Vaginal delivery should be the preferential delivery option for maternal and neonatal advantages. Elective cesarean section due to severe or complete colon impaction is obligatory once obstructed labor or malnourished parturient are diagnosed. Manual disimpaction is an alternative，however with a risk of failure and fetal bradycardia during the process due to induced persistent uterine contraction.\n\n【27】Conclusion\n\n【28】To conclude， unavoidably， clinicians as wellIas specialist gynecologists and general surgeons will at some point have to deal with one of these conditions and not unlikely a combination of them simultaneously. Due to the anatomical locations involved， specialist knowledge and cross discipline collaboration is vital. The management of HD during pregnancy should include more frequent multi-disciplinary prenatal care with special attention to bowel motions and development of complications. Early laxative treatment in combination with special nutrition might prevent impaction of feces and prevent megacolon， prolonging pregnancy to term， and avoiding and dystocia. Frequent ultrasound and estimated fetal weight can reassure fetal condition and pregnancy outcome. High-water intake， enemas and laxatives are the major conservative preventive measures. Delivery planning should be based on inputs by obstetricians， colorectal surgeons， anesthesiologists and neonatologists to ensure the best outcomes for both the mother and baby.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:46:29", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:46:51", "cost": 21.56}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:49", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:46:51", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:46:29"}

It can be associated with nasal obstruction and regional lymph node involvement. Histologic presentation may mimic classic Hodgkin lymphoma when large， atypical cells with irregular nuclear contours， prominent nucleoli， and bi-/multi-nucleation resembling Reed-Sternberg cells are present in conjunction with positive CD30 immunohistochemical stain. Although reduced expression of B cell markers such as PAX5 is typical in classic Hodgkin lymphoma， a completely negative stain， as in our patient， is rare. This discrepancy along with the clinical presentation of predominant lymph node enlargement significantly contributed to the initial erroneous diagnosis of classic Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\n【2】Case Report： Herein we describe a case of a 33-year-old Hispanic male with newly diagnosed Extranodal Natural Killer-/T-Cell Lymphoma (ENTKL)， nasal type. His initial diagnosis of classic Hodgkin lymphoma rendered on a cervical lymph node biopsy was amended upon subsequent discovery of classic diagnostic findings ofENTKL on microscopic evaluation of specimens excised to treat nasal obstruction interfering with chemotherapy.\n\n【3】Conclusion： This case emphasizes the need to further investigate medical history and evaluate symptoms on a multi systemic level when eliciting differential diagnoses in suspected lymphoma patients. A more comprehensive approach can increase diagnostic accuracy when deceiving histologic findings are present. Diagnostic accuracy is essential for treatment effectiveness and for its potential to improve disease progression and patient outcomes.\n\n【4】Keywords： Extranodal natural killer-/t-cell lymphoma； Nasal type； Classic Hodgkin lymphoma； PAX5\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Extranodal Natural Killer/T-Cell Lymphoma (ENTKL) can present in the upper aerodigestive tract with patients suffering from obstruction， epistaxis， and midline destructive lesions. Although regional lymph node involvement is not uncommon， primary involvement oflymph nodes is rare and usuallylacks angiodestruction and necrosis. The absence of these classically diagnostic findings can present a challenge when neoplastic lymphocytes with deceiving morphology are present. Herein we describe a case of a 33-year-old Hispanic male who presented with a neck mass. Classic Hodgkin lymphoma was initially rendered on a cervical lymph node biopsy， and the patient was treated with systemic chemotherapy. Two months later， the patient underwent septoplasty with turbinate reduction for nasal obstruction and inflammation， which interfered with corona virus testing necessary for hospital admission prior to cancer treatment. Subsequent evaluation of resected surgical specimens revealed a diagnosis of extranodal natural killer/T-celllymphoma， nasal type\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】The patient is a 33-year-old Hispanic male who presented to otolaryngology with a large， progressively enlarging left neck mass underneath the sternocleidomastoid. The patient first noticed the mass one year prior. Review of systems was positive for epistaxis and nasal congestion but negative for fever， chills， sweats， or weight loss. Pertinent physical exam findings included a large conglomeration of the left supraclavicular and parotid lymph nodes， in addition to shotty right cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy. There was no inguinal adenopathy. The patient reported a past history of recurrent bilateral tonsillitis and light smoking. Family history was significant for a brother with cancer of unspecified type. Computed tomography of the neck was significant for extensive left cervical lymphadenopathy.\n\n【9】The patient subsequently underwent incisional cervical lymph node biopsy， but the extensive mass was not completely excised due to significant potential for neurovascular complication. Lymphoma workup， including flow cytometry， was initiated. Tissue sections showed a lymph node effaced by a diffuse proliferation of many histiocytes and small lymphocytes with intermixed plasma cells and rare granulocytic cells. Scattered large， atypical lymphocytes with irregular nuclear contours， prominent eosinophilic nucleoli， andoccasional bi-/multi-nucleation resembling Reed-Sternberg cells were present . No nodules or bands of collagen fibrosis were seen but mummified cells and a pseudo granulomatous appearance were noted. Giemsa and acid fast bacilli special stains were negative for fungal or mycobacterial organisms， respectively. Immunohistochemistry showed positivity for CD30  and MUM-1 but negative stains for PAX5 ， CD20， CD79a and CD15. In situ hybridization results were positive for Epstein-Barr virus. Flow cytometric analysis showed no evidence of a monoclonal B-cell or phenotypically abnormal T-cell population. Classic Hodgkin lymphoma， mixed cellularity type was diagnosed and treatment with AAVD (brentuximab vedotin，doxorubicin， vinblastine，dacarbazine) was initiated. Computed Positron Emission Tomography (PET)prior to therapy demonstrated extensive cervical lymphadenopathy， left worse than right， with multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules， left hilar lymph nodes and soft tissue thickening of the left nasal mucosa.\n\n【10】Four months after initial presentation， the patient underwent septoplasty with turbinate reduction to treat progressively worsening nasal obstruction and inflammation aggravated via COVID swabs necessary for hospital admission prior to chemotherapy. Resected specimens oftheleft nasal septum，inferiorturbinateandethmoid sinus were negative for acid fast bacilli and fungal organisms. Examination ofhematoxylin and eosin stain morphology demonstrated respiratory epithelium with extensive necrosis and ulceration accompanied by a diffuse， vaguely nodular and angiocentric atypicallymphoid infiltrate with evidence of angioinvasion and angiodestruction . The mucosal glands appeared to have evidence of clear-cell change. The atypical infiltrate was composed of a mixture of predominantly small and medium-sized atypical lymphocytes and a few intermixed larger cells. No Reed-Sternberg or Hodgkin-like cells were identified， and there was no significant increase in eosinophils. The atypical cells had irregular nuclear contours， dispersed to vesicular chromatin， predominantly inconspicuous but variably prominent nucleoli and a moderate amount of clear cytoplasm. A few scattered mitotic figures were seen. Interestingly， no large CD30+ Reed-Sternberg-like cells were present.\n\n【11】Following microscopicexamination， immunohistochemical stains were performed to evaluate the lymphoid infiltrate more accurately. Large， atypical lymphocytes were positive for CD2 (Figure 5)， CD56， CD7 (diminished)， and cytotoxic markers granzyme B and TIA-1. Possible staining for CD3 and CD5 was present but difficult to differentiate from background normal T cells. Epstein Barr virus chromogenic in situ hybridization was notably positive. Although the presence of possible CD3 and CD5 expression raised the possibility of a cytotoxic T-cell lineage， a natural killer cell lineage was favored due to negative T-cell clonality testing.\n\n【12】The initial lymph node specimen was subsequently re-evaluated with a panel of natural killer and T-cell Immunohistochemistry markers， including CD2  and results showed a similar phenotype to the paranasal specimens. The morphologic and immunophenotypic findings supported the diagnosis of extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma， nasal type. Therefore， the patient’s diagnosis was subsequently amended to extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma and treatment with P-GELOX (pegaspargase， gemcitabine and oxaliplatin) was initiated.\n\n【13】Six months later， follow-up PET scan status-post treatment showed recurrent left cervical lymphadenopathy， enlargement of the porta hepatis lymph nodes， and positivity in the right proximal femur. The patient was not a candidate for transplant and palliative radiation therapy to the right femur was recommended to minimize fracture risk while systemic therapy options were determined.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】The misleading finding， which prompted the initial diagnosis of classic Hodgkin lymphoma in the initial cervical lymph node biopsy， was the presence of scattered large， CD30-positive， Reed-Sternberg like atypicallymphocytes with irregular nuclear contours， prominent eosinophilic nucleoli， and occasional bi-/multi-nucleation. Classic Hodgkin lymphoma is a monoclonal B cell lymphoid neoplasm composed of Hodgkin large cells with single nuclei and prominent nucleoli) and Reed-Sternberg (large cells with binucleated and very prominent nucleoli) lymphocytes in a variable inflammatory background.\n\n【16】The majority of classic Hodgkin lymphoma cases show positivity for CD30 and reduced expression of most B-cell antigens such as CD20， CD79a and PAX5 in atypical lymphocytes. In contrast， immunohistochemical evaluation of this patient’s cervical lymph node was positive for CD30 but completely negative for CD20，CD79a， and PAX5 in atypical lymphocytes. Complete absence of PAX5 in Hodgkin cells is rare； however， cases have been documented . This fact， combined with the misleading Hodgkin-like morphology of neoplastic cells， were the key components that supported the erroneous initial diagnosis of classic Hodgkin lymphoma. Although Epstein-Barr virus infection is present in up to 40% of cases ， it is of minimal diagnostic value due to presence in multiple different etiologies. Classic Hodgkin lymphoma typicaly presents in the cervical or mediastinal lymph nodes and has a favorable prognosis in early-stage disease.\n\n【17】Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma is a predominantly extranodal lymphoma of either natural killer or T-cell lineage. Its common location in the paranasal sinuses prompted further workup as a potential diagnosis in this case. Additional immunohistochemical stains of both the original lymph node and paranasal sections supported the amended diagnosis by demonstrating positivity for CD2 and CD56 in large， atypical cells. Although CD30 is positive in50% to 70% of cases ， the patient's paranasal resection specimens lacked the large CD30+ Hodgkin-like cells. This interesting finding was possibly attributed to recentlyadministered brentuximab vedotin therapy for the initial diagnosis of classic Hodgkin lymphoma. Classic features of extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma include Epstein-Barr virus infection， necrosis， cytotoxic immunophenotype and angioinvasion. Its cytological presentation is very broad with cells often having irregularly folded nuclei that may be elongated. Chromatin is granular and large cells may have vesicular nuclei. There is moderate pale to clear cytoplasm and mitotic figures are easily found. A heavy admixture of small lymphocytes，plasma cells， histiocytes and eosinophils can mimic an inflammatory process. Extensive pseudoepitheliomatoushyperplasia offtthe overlying epithelium can result in mass formation， as evidenced in this patient’s nasal obstruction. Prognosis is historically poor； although， outcomes have improved with intense chemotherapy and radiotherapy.\n\n【18】The Prognostic Index of Natural Killer Lymphoma may be useful to predict survival in patients treated with non-anthracycline-based chemotherapy. It was developed via a retrospective analysis of 527patients and identified adverse prognostic factors including age >60years， stage III or IV disease， distant lymph node involvement，non-nasal type disease， and detection of Epstein Barr virus via reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction . It has been argued that using the Ann Arbor lymphoma staging system is in effective for this diagnosis due to consistently poor survival in patients classified as early stage and studies demonstrating worse outcomes for extranasal tumors . As a response， a proposal for a new staging system that classifies tumors via their proximity to the nasal cavity and nasopharynx was created by the Chinese Southwest Oncology Group and Asia Lymphoma Study Group (CA system) and published in.\n\n【19】The atypical presentation of this case emphasizes the need to further investigate medical history and symptoms on a multisystemic level when eliciting differential diagnoses in suspected lymphoma patients. It demonstrates the responsibility for pathologists to conduct additional comprehensive workup of seemingly unrelated anatomic sites when deceiving histologic findings are present and ancillary studies are inconclusive. The importance for oncologists and surgeons to continuously monitor for treatment effectiveness and residual disease is also represented. These tasks are essentialto increase the diagnostic accuracy necessary for optimal patient outcomes， particularly when multiple etiologies are within consideration.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:42:31", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:43:09", "cost": 38.826}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:49", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:43:10", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:42:30"}

Previous studies have shown a substantial and increasing burden of GBS infections among nonpregnant adults， particularly older adults and those with underlying medical conditions. Although GBS meningitis is frequently rapidly progressive with a high fatality rate， it can be difficult to diagnose. We present a 77-year-old male who was highly suspected of bacterial meningitis with negative Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) cultures. GBS meningitis was diagnosed by positive result from metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing (mNGS) of CSF. The patient made a rapid clinical improvement， likely attributable to the fact that empiric antibiotic treatment was started soon after his admission， which provided the broad coverage and included non-resistant GBS coverage.\n\n【2】Background\n\n【3】Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in neonates and infants， but is rarely the cause in adults. It usually affecting elderly patients and those with serious underlying disease， such as diabetics， cirrhosis， history of stroke， cancer， decubitus ulcer， and neurogenic bladder . It is important to recognize and appropriately treat GBS meningitis， especially in the population greater than 65 years old due to its mortality rate approaching 56%， which is double the mortality of other types of bacterial meningitis . Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) findings may not show evidence of infection early in GBS meningitis， and CSF culture may be negative due to the small number of bacteria and antimicrobial treatment before sample collection.\n\n【4】Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology makes it possible to analyze large amounts of nucleic acid sequence data contained in samples in a single assay. Therefore，untargeted metagenomic NGS (mNGS) of clinical samples has been applied for the comprehensive diagnosis of infections， including viruses， bacteria， fungi， and parasites. It performs well in identifying rare， novel， difficult-to-detect and co-infected pathogens directly from clinical samples and presents great potential in resistance prediction by sequencing the antibiotic resistance genes， providing new diagnostic evidence that can be used to guide treatment options and improve antibiotic stewardship. Many physicians recognized mNGS as a last resort method to address clinical infection problems .\n\n【5】Here， we report a case of a 77-year-old male with a medical history of surgical excision of rectal carcinoma 14 years ago that had GBS meningitis revealed through mNGS. Initially he was started on broad spectrum antibiotics. After positive result from mNGS analysis of CSF was reported， antibiotic targeted for GBS infection was added. This case illustrates the importance of including mNGS analysis in diagnosis the specific pathogen causing the meningitis.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 77-year-old male presented to the Emergency Department (ED) of the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University with a 7-day fever history to 39.5℃ and unconsciousness. He underwent surgical treatment and chemotherapy for rectal carcinoma 14 years ago. On ED arrival， he presented with epilepsy for two minutes and was transferred to Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Due to his constellation of symptoms and physical exam findings， meningitis was initially suspected. Initial blood examination showed leukocytosis (18.89×10°/L with 92% neutrophils)， a C-Reactive Protein (CRP) level elevation of 303.98 mg/L， and an increased Procalcitonin (PCT) level of 36.3ng/ml. A lumbar puncture examination of the CSF showed pleocytosis (1600×10/L with 70%\n\n| Table 1： Lab test results.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Day of admission  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | 9  | 12  | 13  | 16  | 18  |\n| CRP (0-10 mg/L)  | 303.98  | 243.54  | 172.93  | 100.15  | 96.79  | 63.37  | 45.89  | 21.66  | 76.49  | 50.35  | 15.69  |  |\n| WBC (4-10x10°/L)  | 18.89  | 13.12  | 8.11  | 4.55  | 4.81  | 6.54  | 5.97  | 6.34  | 6.43  | 4.69  | 3.31  | 7  |\n| Neutrophil (0.46%-0.75%)  | 0.92  | 0.927  | 0.871  | 0.804  | 0.769  | 0.846  | 0.775  | 0.747  | 0.781  | 0.716  | 0.696  |  |\n| PCT (.05 ng/ml)  | 36.3  | 19.4  | 11.2  | 6.68  | 3.57  | 2.08  | 1.38  | 0.69  | 0.26  |  | 0.11  | /  |\n| Protein of CSF (120-600 mg/L)  | 1830  |  |  | 2392.8  |  |  |  |  | 1101.5  |  |  | 743  |\n| WBC of CSF (0-10×10P/L)  | 1600  |  |  | 387  |  |  |  |  | 25  |  |  | 2  |\n| mNGS of CSF  |  |  |  | GBS  |  |  |  |  | GBS  |  |  | Negative  |\n| Antibiotics  | Meropenem (2g，q8h)  |  |  |  |  | Meropenem (2g，q8h)+Linezolid (0.6g，q12h)  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n【9】polymorphonuclear cells)， and an increased protein level of 1830mg/L. This initial lab analysis confirmed our suspicion of bacterial meningitis. He was initially administered intravenous Meropenem(2g， q8h) for bacterial meningitis until further analysis was completed. On day 2 of admission， the patient started to have improvement in his inflammatory indicators， and continued to improve in the coming days . On day 4 of admission， his vital signs normalized， and lumbar puncture was performed again to guide treatment (to diagnose the specific strain causing the bacterial meningitis and to target antibiotic therapy accordingly). The CSF analysis showed improvements as well . CSF cultures were negative (showed no growth for 14 days)， while mNGS returned positive for GBS from his CSF on day 6 of admission. Treatment was altered accordingly. In addition to Meropenem， intravenous Linezolid (0.6 g，q12h) was added to target antibiotic therapy for GBS. On day ten， the patient was transferred out of the ICU to the general medical floor. He received a total of 3 weeks of antimicrobial treatment and showed clinical improvement. He was discharged after confirmation of a continued normal temperature， no abnormalities on physical examination， and improved lab test results. At the time of discharge， the patient had not reported any hearing loss\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Group B Streptococcus (GBS) or Streptococcus agalactiae is known as one of the leading etiological agents of neonatal sepsis following maternally derived infection during pregnancy.\n\n【12】Previous analysis shows that the incidence of invasive GBS infection among nonpregnant adults continues to rise， roughly tripling between 1990 and 2016 (from 3.6 to 10.9 cases per 100，000)\n\n【13】Given the severity of invasive GBS (94.6% of cases were hospitalized， 27.3% of cases required intensive care unit admission， and 5.6% of cases were fatal in 2016)， this rise represents a clinical and public health concern. There are no current strategies to prevent invasive GBS disease in adults. Reports of adult meningitis secondary to GBS remain rare， with an estimated incidence of 0.15 cases per100，000 . The majority of reported cases outside the peripartum period have been in elderly patients or those with chronic illness such as diabetes， cancer，pregnancy， acute renal or hepatic failure . Bacterial meningitis can be difficult to diagnose. Less than 50% of adult patients who later test positive for the infection present with the classic triad of fever， neck stiffness and altered mental state . The mostcommon organisms causing bacterial meningitis varydepending on the age of the patient. For our purposes， the most common organisms (and their Attack Rate (AR) per 10，000 individuals) for our patient's age range include Streptococcus pneumoniae (AR： 1.5)，\n\n【14】Listeria monocytogenes (AR： 0.5)， Haemophilus influenzae (AR： 0.2)， GBS (AR：0.2)and Neisseria meningitidis (AR： 0.1) . It is important for physicians who suspect bacterial meningitis to assess the risk factors of the patient，not only in terms of the condition itself but also for which organism it could be. It is also critical that patients with suspected meningitis， especially in the elderly population， are initiated on recommended empiric antibiotic therapy based on their age and co-morbidities. A lumbar puncture should be routinely performed to diagnose the specific strain causing the bacterial meningitis and to target antibiotic therapy accordingly Clinically， GBS meningitis is indistinguishable from meningitis caused by other pyogenic bacteria， with an acute onset and a high incidence of neurological dysfunction. However， GBS meningitis is frequently rapidly progressive with a higher proportion of patients with GBS presenting within 24 h of the onset of symptoms than those with other forms of bacterial meningitis . In addition， the case fatality rate associated with GBS meningitis is considerably higher than that associated with meningococcal meningitis， at around 25%. Although rare， GBS should be a part of a patient’s differential when initiating antibiotics in adults with chronic illnesses. Our patient did present with risk factors for GBS meningitis， including his age as well as having a medical history of rectal carcinoma. A lumbar puncture was performed and broad-spectrum antibiotics were started after bacterial meningitis was suspected. Several lumbar punctures were performed to diagnose the specific strain causing the bacterial meningitis and to guide antibiotic therapy. After mNGS of CSF reported positive for GBS， targeted antibiotic was added. This case illustrates the importance of including GBS in the differential of chronically ill patients， especially those with concern for meningitis. mNGS is increasingly being applied in clinical laboratories for unbiased culture-independent diagnosis. mNGS analysis of CSF is advantageous for diagnosing meningitis in patients with negative CSF cultures. According to a study by Wilson et al. ， mNGS identified pathogens in CSF from 13 (22%) of 58 patients with meningitis/encephalitis that were not identified by conventional clinical testing. PCR is also used as a molecular diagnostic method and has advantages， in terms of sensitivity， for diagnosing meningitis in patients with negative CSF culture . mNGS appears to be more suitable as a diagnostic procedure， because it does not rely on the pre-selection of targeted pathogens， but rather is able to detect many potential infectious agents in a single assay. In our patient， GBS meningitis was diagnosed by mNGS analysis. mNGS analysis is expected to become a standard diagnostic test for CSF samples， replacing conventional diagnostic procedures.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:38:53", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:39:04", "cost": 11.157}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:49", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:39:04", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:38:52"}

This case demonstrates for the first time antibodies detection of this virus in different bats species which is important for our understanding of PRV ecology， evolution and mechanism of cross-species transmission. These findings support the hypothesis that bats could act as an intermediate or natural host for interspecies transmission of certain paramyxoviruses.\n\n【2】Keywords： Porcine orthorubulavirus； Bats； Epidemiology； Inter-species transmission\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Over the past years， a number of zoonotic and vector-borne viral diseases have emerged in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific，with fruitbats as a wildlife reservoir. Bats havebeen implicated in numerous new emerging infectious diseases， through its role as reservoirs for viruses with the ability to occasionally cross species barriers . One family of viruses with a particularly strong link to bats is Paramyxoviridae . Bats seem to be an ancient reservoir of many paramyxovirus taxa， and it is possible to find a variety of paramyxovirus lineages in most bat families. In America， retrospective analyses have shown the presence of two different paramyxoviruses from the genus orthorubulavirus. One of them is Mapuera Virus (MapV) found in bats and the other is Porcine orthorubulavirus (PRV) found in pigs . Recently PRV was renamed Porcine orthorubulavirus-La Piedad Michoacan Mexico Virus (LPMV-PRV) . This virus was actually known as La Piedad， Michoacan Virus (LPMV) and emerged spontaneously in pigs in Mexico in the early 1980s . Veterinarians reported an outbreak of a new type of encephalitis (named blue eye disease， BED) among piglets on swine farms around the city of La Piedad， in the Mexican state of Michoacan. The clinical signs were characterized by neurological disorders in newborn piglets  and neurological and respiratory disease in suckling and growing pigs ， with or without corneal opacity . In adult pigs， clinical signs are mainly associated with reproductive failure . BED remains endemic in central and western-central parts of Mexico where there is a dense population of pigs. The disease has been serologically diagnosed in at least 16 states of Mexico， but has not yet been reported in other countries . Since the first recognized outbreak in 1980， sporadic outbreaks of BED have continued to occur and the specific source of many of these outbreaks remains unknown. Genetic analysis has led to that PRV is classified within the genus orthorubulavirus and shows closest genetic relationship to the Mapuera virus (MapV， genus Rubulavirus) isolated from bats . As fruit bats are considered to be the natural host of， not only MapV， but also of other related paramyxoviruses (Hendra Virus (HeV) and Nipah， (NiV)， genus Henipavirus)， MapV and Tioman Virus (TioPV)， genus Rubulavirus) TioV) ， it has been suggested that bats could harbor the origin of the PRV responsible for the BED outbreak in pigs . Thus， there are many unanswered questions\n\n【5】Table 1： The number of specimens (perlocation) collected of each species of bat.\n\n| o Family  | Species  | Cave1  | Cave2  | No. of specimens  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| Mormoopidae  | Pteronotus parnellii (Insectivorous)  | 9  | 0  | 9  |\n| Molossidae  | Tadarida brasiliensis (Insectivorous)  | 2  | 0  | 2  |\n| Phyllostomidae  | Artibeus hirsutus (Frugivorous)  | 0  | 15  | 15  |\n|  | Artibeus jamaicensis (Frugivorous)  | 4  | 0  | 4  |\n|  | Stumira filium (Frugivorous)  |  | 1  | 1  |\n|  | Glossophaga soricina (Nectarivorous)  |  | 5  | 5  |\n|  | Macrotus waterhousif (Insectivorous)  | 0  | 1  | 1  |\n|  | Desmodus rotundus (hematophagous)  | 2  | 1  | 3  |\n| Emballonuridae  | Balantiopteryx plicata (Insectivorous)  | 2  | 0  | 2  |\n| Total  |  | 19  | 23  | 42  |\n\n【7】Bat location： N. 18 42 32.4\"W 9914 14.1\" 1004 MASL (cave 1)； N. 1846 14.33\"W 98 537155.95\"1403 MASL (cave 2)\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】Objectives\n\n【10】Study aimed to determine the antibodies presence of PRV in Mexican bats using a serological approach.\n\n【11】Discuss the approach about that PRV could be circulating in bat populations.\n\n【12】Materialand Methods\n\n【13】Bats were collected under the SEMARNAT DGVS permit FAUT-0211 following the guidelines of the Animal Care and Ethical Committee of Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Disciplinarias en Microbiologia Animal， INIFAP， Mexico City. The specimens were deposited at Coleccion de Mamiferos del Centro de Investigacion en Biodiversidad y Conservacion， Universidad Autonoma del Estado de Morelos. Atotal of 42 bats were caught from 2 different refuges/caves. The refuges were selected in a pig fattening area where spontaneous outbreaks of BED had occurred (central zone of Mexico). The specimen was classified by experts of Centro de Investigacion en Biodiversidad y Conservacion. In order to determine their immune state， the bats were placed under light anesthesia， bled to death， and a necropsy was conducted to collect serum and brain samples for serological analysis and PCR respectively . Serum samples were tested by serum-virus neutralizing analysis in cell culture (VN) and Immunoperoxidase Monolayer Assay (IPMA) to PRV. All tests were performed by standard protocols . PCR products were sequencing and phylogenetic analysis was performed compared with viral sequences reported at the Gene bank of the Paramyxoviridae family.\n\n【14】A total of 42 bats， belonging to eight different species ， were sampled from two different refuges located in the Mexican state of Morelos of the Central part of Mexico. The refuges were selected in a pig fattening area where spontaneous outbreaks of BED had occurred. Neutralizing antibodies against PRV were detected in 7serum samples with titers ranging between 1：20 to 1：1280. IPMA confirmed the presence of antibodies against PRV in all of the VN positive bat serum， as well as showed positive result for 8 additional bat serum samples with titers ranging from 1：10 to 1：40 serum dilutions. IPMA positive samples were characterized by the presence ofa fewirregular structures stained red in the cytoplasm， representing inclusion-like bodies . Serum from the controls were positive and negative respectively . Additionally， 6 out of 15 serological positive samples showed PCR positive result within the Paramyxoviridae family； Avulavirus-Rubulavirus genus . Only a single sequence of 268 positions (access number MT636875) was correct assembly and the alignment results showed a nucleotide identity of 90.87% to PRV， 71.64% to MapV， 75.46% to Parainfluenza virus 5， 72.31% to Mumps virus，73.58% to Batparamyxovirus，73.56%to Tuhoko virus 2 and 72.37% to Menangle virus. The phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequence confirmed that the sequence is closest related to LPMV-PRV as they grouped together on a separate clade .\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】In recent years， several novel members of the Paramyxoviridae family have emerged infecting both humans and/or domesticated animals. Bats have been implicated in numerous of these newemerging infectious diseases as they have been shown to harbor a great diversity of paramyxoviruses .

One of them is Mapuera virus， that was isolated from the salivary glands of a yellow-shouldered bat(Sturnira lilium) captured in the tropical rainforest of Brazil in 1979 and the other is a Porcine rubulavirus (PRV) that was isolated from pigs and that was shown to be the causative agent behind several disease outbreaks in pigs in the early 1980's . Molecular studies of PRV suggest that PRV has existed as a separated species for a long time in nature and that it could have been transmitted from a natural wildlife reservoir to domesticated pigs . More recent studies of these two viruses， comparing the completed genome sequence and the genome organization， indicates that PRV is more closely related to MapV than to other members of the subfamily Rubulavirinae suggesting that PRV may， possibly， also been originated from bat. In addition， a serological analysis in 108 non-hematophagous bats from the Central Pacific coast of Mexico， showed the presence of antibodies against PRV in insectivorous bat (Rhogeessa parvula major). However， due to as a single bat was seropositive； the authors suggest that a bat in the surveyed localities does not play a role in the epidemiology of PRV. Thus， in this study serological analysis showed seropositivity in 15/42 of the investigated serum samples. The percentage of seropositive bats was high compared to the study from 2004 where only 1 of 108 bats was seropositive . However， the sampling in this study was done at a location in a central zone of Mexico where spontaneous outbreaks of BED occurred； which could explain the differences observed. Also all bats， in this study， were trapped in two caves containing a dense bat population of mixed species. This close coexistence may play an important role in spreading the virus in this particular bat population by allowing easier transmission between immune and naive individuals and between different species through certain behaviors， such as mutual grooming and biting during mating . Thus the presence of anti-PRV antibodies in the bat specimens， suggests that PRV is indeed circulating in bat populations. However， we cannot rule out that this is a related virus with cross-reactivity to PRV.In addition， some seropositive bat samples were PCR negative， it could be speculated that these individuals could carry the virus in other organs not tested in this study. The phylogenetic analysis of the unique aligned sequence， grouped together with PRV-LPMV， suggesting that they could belong to the same species of the porcine orthorubulavirus.\n\n【20】Conclusion\n\n【21】These findings provide serological evidence that bats could act as an intermediate or natural host of PRV. However， future studies are required to investigate the infection in bats， to determine the exact role of bats in PRV epidemiology， the tropism and the behavior of the virus in nature. Also further genetic analysis could be valuable to understand the evolution of the virus.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:36:10", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:36:38", "cost": 28.173}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:49", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:36:38", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:36:09"}

It's almost exclusive site of occurrence is the eyelid but it has also been reported primarily in other sites， such as the parotid region. It is one of the most dangerous tumors， due to masquerading as inflammatory conditions， such as blepharoconjunctivitis， superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis or chalazion. It may also be misdiagnosed as other malignancies， while the incidence of metastasis is high-about 41%.\n\n【2】In our article we report a rare case of a recurrent sebaceous gland carcinoma of the eyelid with metastasis to the parotid gland and the regional lymph nodes In the review ofthe literature， diagnosis， treatment and the prognosis ofthis rare entity are described.\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Sebaceous cell carcinoma is a cutaneous aggressive tumor arising from the sebaceous glands. It is considered as the third most common eyelid malignancy after basal and squamous cell carcinomas. It's almost exclusive site of occurrence is the eyelid but it has also been reported primarily in other sites， such as the parotid region. Among western population it accounts for <1 to 5， 5%， while in Asians it can be observed at about 31% to 39% .\n\n【5】Sebaceous cells are predominantly present in meibomian glands of the tarsal plate， sebaceous glands of ocular adnexa (gland of Zeis)， sebaceous glands embedded in caruncle， brow and associated hair follicles of lid skin. The most common site of occurrence is the upper eyelid.\n\n【6】It has been reported as the great masquerader， due to its resemblance to other benign or malignant lesions. In the differential diagnosis chalazion， blepharitis， conjunctivitis， basal cell carcinoma， squamous cell carcinoma， leukoplakia， ocular pemphigoid and carcinoma in-situ must be concerned We report a case of a parotid metastasis originating from a carcinoma of the upper eyelid， diagnosed as sebaceous cell carcinoma. Diagnosis and treatment of this entity are described.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】An 80-year-old Caucasian woman presented in our clinic with a firm， painless， slowly enlarging mass at her right parotid area with normal overlying skin. The patient had no regional palpable neck nodes. She also presented with a diffused eyelid， thickening in the upper right eyelid， painful in pulpation.\n\n【9】In her medical history she mentioned type I diabetes under medication. The patient had no history of tobacco or alcohol use. In her surgical history， she mentioned excision of a mass of the right lower eyelid four years ago， diagnosed as a squamous cell carcinoma of the skin of the eyelid， and which had been excised in whole， with histologically free margins ofexcision and depth invasion4 mm. The patient had taken no supplementary treatment for that tumor. Due to that history， the mass of the right parotid was considered to be a metastasis from the SCC of the eyelid.\n\n【10】The CT scans  and MRI of head and neck  indicated a compact mass in the right parotid gland， with dimensions about 36 mm x20 mm. The regional lymph nodes were depicted normal.\n\n【11】Full staging wasperformedpreoperatively， in cluding radiographic control of the chest and ultrasound of the upper abdomen that revealed no distant metastasis.\n\n【12】Ophthalmic examination was also performed. Her visual acuity in the right eye was 1/10 in the central position and 2/10 peripherally， without diplopia， proptosis， and displacement of eye ball or limitation of extra-ocular movements. There was also extended conjunctival filtration. The left eye suffered from an operable senile nuclear cataract.\n\n【13】Under general anesthesia， a supraomohyoid selective neck dissection was performed， followed by a radical parotidectomy with sacrifice of the facial nerve and exenteration of the right eye ball. The periorbital muscles were left intact for potential prosthetic reconstruction and the deficit was closured with regional flaps The histopathologic evaluation of the lesions revised the previous diagnosis of a squamous cell carcinoma and stated a diagnosis of a sebaceous gland carcinoma. This infiltrated the upper and the lower eyelid， either in situ  or invading the underlying stroma， showing well and poorly differentiated areas  and demonstrated a pagetoid spread to the bulbar conjunctiva . The excision was undertaken in histologically healthy margins. The lesion in the parotid gland proved to be a metastasis of the sebaceous gland carcinoma， demonstrating necrotic areas . An intraparotid lymph node， as well as a lymph node of level II in the neck dissection， among the total of 10 lymph nodes that had been dissected， were positive for metastasis of the above carcinoma.\n\n【14】The patient underwent further radiotherapy and is under regular follow-up in the external unit of our clinic . There is no recurrence so far.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Sebaceous carcinoma， Sebaceous GlanddCarcinoma (SGC)， sebaceous cell carcinoma and meibomian gland carcinoma are all terms used in the literature to malignant neoplasm of sebaceous origin. Sebaceous carcinoma is traditionaly classified into two groups： tumor arising from the ocular adnexa in the periocular area and those arising in the extraocular sites， which commonly involve the head and neck region， the parotid and submandibular glands， the external auditory canal，the trunk and laryngeal or pharyngeal cavities.\n\n【17】It is considered to be the third most common eyelid malignancy-after basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma-representing 1% to5.5% of all eyelid tumors. However， it is one of the most dangerous tumors， due to masquerading as inflammatory conditions， such as blepharoconjunctivitis， superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis or chalazion. It may also be misdiagnosed as other malignancies. The result is delayed diagnosis or wrong treatment .\n\n【18】In addition to its variable clinical appearance， a variable histologic appearance may also occur. As a result， delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis following biopsy is not uncommon. Evelid sebaceous gland carcinoma has a characteristic intraepithelial growth pattern， resulting from a pagetoid spread or a full-thickness replacement of the surface epithelium. The tumor may demonstrate well， moderately or poorly differentiated areas. The histologic examination may reveal a papillary or lobular growth pattern of neoplastic cells with evident sebaceous differentiation， or highly atypical neoplastic cells with prominent nuclear pleomorphism. Areas of necrosis and fibrosis are commonly found. The spread of the tumor in the form of infiltrating lobules， nests and cords is characteristic， perineural invasion is observed in about 20% of tumors， whereas vascular invasion is extremely infrequent .\n\n【19】The treatment of SGCs is adequate surgical excision with wide surgical margins and fresh frozen section controls. When the tumor diffuses the eyelid，orbital exenteration is required. Radical or selective neck dissection should be performed， to evaluate lymph node metastasis. Adjunctive radiotherapy or chemotherapy are necessary， depending on the stage of the tumor at the time of presentation， or when the surgical margins are diffused .\n\n【20】In our case， the patient presented with a parotid gland metastasis. Given her history of a surgical excision of a squamous cell carcinoma of the lower eyelid 4 years ago， the parotid gland tumor was thought to be a metastatic SCC. Unfortunately， we had no chance to histologically reexamine the previous tumor， in order to clarify the incidence of misdiagnosis. In the histological examination of the present tumor in the eyelids， the characteristic features of a sebaceous gland carcinoma were observed. Furthermore， the tumor in the parotid gland demonstrated the same features， and was proven to be a metastasis of the above carcinoma， while metastases in two regional lymph nodes were also noticed. In the literature，there are only 3 cases reported with metastasis to the parotid gland， while the tumor most commonly metastasizes to the lymph nodes SGCs have a high incidence of recurrence. Recurrence is a major problem and can be at the same site or at a different location. It is difficult to say whether it is a true recurrence or instead a new tumor， due to the multicentric nature of SCG. Well- differentiated tumors have a better prognostic outcome in compare to the poorly differentiated. Confirmation of pagetoid spread is another bad prognostic factor. Other adverse prognostic features include the involvement of both upper and lower eyelid， tumor size more than10 mm， orbital extension and infiltration of blood vessels and/or lympatics .\n\n【21】Metastasis can occur by continuous growth， lympatic spread or hematogenous spread. The most common sites of continuous growth is the orbit， the periaucular area and the parotid gland， as well as the regional lymph nodes of level I and II. Rarer is distant metastasis to the lung， pleura， liver， brain， pericardium， lips， ethmoid sinus and skull. The overall mortality rate is 5% to 10%， while in cases of metastasis the rate may go up to 25% and up to 41% in cases where the duration of symptoms lasts more than six months .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:42:05", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:42:20", "cost": 14.801}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:49", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:42:20", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:42:04"}

It is a chronic suppurative infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues that affects the lower limbs in more than 80% of cases . The etiologic agents of mycetoma are aerobic and anaerobic bacteria(actinomycetoma) and fungi (eumycetoma). Mycetoma is characterized by a triad of tumor-like swelling， multiple sinus formation， and a grain-containing discharge . Mycetoma was added to the World Health Organization list of NTDs in 2016 ， but getting basic data on its epidemiology is still a big challenge. Sudan is the only country to have a national mycetoma control program worldwide ， while for many other countries no strategies can be devised because of a lack of data. Part of the problem is that mycetoma is not a notifiable disease， and therefore no surveillance and routine data registration systems exist. Even though Ethiopia is in the so-called“mycetoma belt)， and patients of Ethiopian origin have been reported in Israeli and Sudanese case series ， mycetoma is rarely reported from Ethiopia . The Ethiopian NTD program desperately needs data to formulate a mycetoma control strategy. We would like to present a patient with poorly responsive mycetoma who was later diagnosed with a squamous cell carcinoma at Boru Meda General Hospital， Amhara region， Ethiopia.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 43 years old male patient self-presented at the dermatology out-patient department at Boru Meda General Hospital since three years before. He is a farmer living in a rural area called Worebabo where nearly 53 km away from Boru Meda Hospital， cultivating fruits and “Chat\"in the vicinity. He presented with swollen bilateral lower legs covered with dry and crusted plaques， with severe scarring and pus draining areas. He reports that it had started， seven years before as a solitary， painless， firm nodule， which started draining pus and hard pea-sized matter. He had difficulty recalling the color of the lesion (pussy， bloody tingled， black etc). Then through time multiple small lesions appeared with increasing pussy discharge， with some lesions coalescing into each other. There was swelling in both lower limbs and some limitation involvement. When the lesions become aggressive and multiple， the patient had gone to the local health institution and received an unspecified oral medication， with no improvement. He then visited multiple-local traditional healers where he received unknown topical mixtures to applied and liquor to be drunken， with no improvement in the improvement of the lesions， discharge， and size. But as the time gone and the lesion progresses to the shin， it become extensive and the patient felt difficulty of walking due to pain. He presented at Boru Meda in 2018， where he started to be diagnosed using Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) with Potassium Hydroxide (KOH) examination， X-ray and clinical evaluation. Then the result was reviled inconclusive cytological examination and recommends biopsy (FNAC)， no fungal elements seen (KOH)， chronic osteomylities (X-ray) around the ankle area. He was diagnosed as having mycetoma. He started on the ketoconazol(200 mg) and cotrimoxazole (960 mg po BID) after doing baseline investigations.On review after nine months of treatment he was found to have no improvement and maybe possibly some worsening in his condition. Treatment was changed from ketoconazoleto itraconazole(200 mg daily) with co-trimoxazole for the next 9 months (3 cycles). At 18 months post-initiation of unsuccessful treatment， the patient wanted for referral to get a second opinion at another hospital， where he was diagnosed with mycetoma and referred back to Boru Meda Hospital. With the poor response to anti-fungal and anti-bacterial treatment， a biopsy and FNA was requested. The pathologist reported“Multiple globular granuloma with epithelial cells and inflammatory mixed squamouse cells” multiple grains and squamous cell carcinoma. The patient has now been transferred for better treatment like chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy at the national referral centre to ALERT.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Mycetoma are chronic granulomatous infections of the dermal and subcutaneous tissues causedby filamentous aerobicand anaerobic bacteria (actinomycetoma)， or true fungi (eumycetoma)， and which can be diagnosed using a combination of different diagnostic methods . But in poor resource countries like Ethiopia， mycetoma can be diagnosed clinically with the presence of a symptomatic triad： A subcutaneous mass (tumefaction)， draining sinuses and the presence of grain containing discharge. The most specific diagnostic tool is the examination of the grains discharged from sinuses. Both spontaneous drainage and manually expressed material from sinus should be carefully examined macro and microscopically to visualize the grains. The samples can be obtained from any open sinus or by deep surgical biopsy. Mycological and bacteriological examinations are very important for the correct diagnosis. Over 30 species have been identified as causative agents of mycetoma， but the grains of many of these agents have overlapping morphological characteristics， therefore， cultures are needed to properly identify the causative agent. Mycetoma is mainly found in young adults， with cases having been report in children and elderly. In most countries， males are more often infected than females. One of the risk factor for mycetoma is thorn injuries due to bare foot and being farmers whose daily activities are associated with cultivating vegetable. In countries like Ethiopia，85% of the population is a farmer who used bare foot for their daily practices . Treatment of mycetoma depends on acorrect diagnosis. It is important to define the fungal or bacterial etiology because the treatments are different. Mycetoma cannot be cured without active treatment. It requires antibiotics (for actinomycetoma) or oral anti-fungals (for eumycetomas) for weeks， months or years. Damage to subcutaneous tissues (muscle，bones， joints or tendons) often persists， so local surgery (including amputation) and physiotherapy may be required . Moreover， mycetoma with the cure rate which takes at least 6 months even using a combination of anti-fungal and systemic antibiotics. (Antibiotics and antifungals effective in the treatment of mycetoma are included in the WHO model list ofessential medicines， but the long duration of treatment  and monitoring means they may be prohibitively expensive). Even though mycetoma is present， diagnosed， treated and had a regular follow up in the department of dermatovenereology unit in Ethiopia like ALERT， and other respective regional dermatology clinics， they are not reported to the respective NTD departments due to inconclusiveness of deep fungal infections in the Health Management Information System (HMIS). With few dermatologists in Ethiopia， deep fungal infections are under diagnosed and un-reported to the Ministry of Health and/or the World Health Organization， even though it is listed as a NTD. Many mis-diagnosed mycetoma patient develop sever chronic wounds which put them at risk of carcinomas， such as squamouse cell carcinoma. Mycetoma is quite common in the lower extremities where wound healing is slow. With the long delay in diagnosis or the unavailability of treatment， mycetoma infections may develop into a chronic wound with osteomylities. Thus， chronic ulcer is one of the sources of squamous cell carcinoma. Any chronic wound which may be of fungal， bacterial or viral etiology may be treated with the respective medication and routine nursing care. A non-healing ulcer should warrant further investigation to determine the presence of an underlying or super-imposed condition is unable to have marked improvement for long standing period， one should suspect the presence and absence of overlying disease condition like cancer， superimposed undiagnosed disease condition and other. Therefore， presence and absence of clinical improvement could be one of the sign of cancer imposed mycetoma.\n\n【11】Conclusion\n\n【12】Mycetoma is present in Ethiopia but due to many reasons it is under-diagnosed and not reported and when diagnosed it is often diagnosed late making treatment complicated and increasing the risk of disability， loss of income and social stigma. In all chronic ulcers and wounds not responding to treatment， malignant changes should be suspected. This case emphasizes the importance of biopsy and cultures as fungal infection and squamouse cell carcinoma is often have similar， non-specific clinical appearances.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:39:10", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:39:15", "cost": 4.289}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:49", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:39:15", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:39:10"}

Drugs approved for the treatment of PAH target three main pathways participating in the pulmonary endothelial function： The endothelin pathway， which is overexpressed in PAH， as well as the prostacyclin and Nitric Oxide (NO) pathways which are under-expressed . Initial oral combination therapy with an Endothelin Receptor Antagonist (ERA) and a Phosphodiesterase 5Inhibitor(PDE5i) or a soluble Guanylate Cyclase(sGC) stimulator such as riociguat is recommen ded in treatment naive， low or intermediate PAH patients . If/when low risk is not achieved； addition of prostanoids is recommended .\n\n【2】There is limited evidence on the effectiveness of switching between drugs targeting different molecules in the same of pathway. The open-label， multicentre，uncontrolled study RESPITE shows that PAH patients in World Health Organization functional class (WHO-FC) III， with inadequate response to PDE5i treatment， might respond to treatment using riociguat . The open label Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) REPLACE that enrolled PAH patients receiving maintenance therapy with PDE5i with or without ERA recently demonstrated that transition to riociguat from PDE5i treatment is associated with a significant likelihood of clinical improvement . We report two PAH cases with different pulmonary hemodynamic profile， who improved clinically and hemodynamically after transitioning from PDE5i to riociguat.\n\n【3】Case Series\n\n【4】Case 1\n\n【5】A 32 years old female， who went for follow-ups for ten years in our Pulmonary Hypertension(PH) clinic in a tertiary hospital， because of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)-associated PAH. She was on sequential triple combination therapy including an ERA， sildenafil 20 mg TID and subcutaneous treprostinil at a final dose of 76 ng/kg/min. The combination of immunosuppressant's alongside PAH treatment resulted in patient's clinical and hemodynamic improvement consistent with low risk status， that was sustained for 5 years. However，on a routine Right Heart Catheterization(RHC)， there was a decrease of Cardiac Output (CO) and Stroke Volume Index (SVI)， whereas there was an increase in Pulmonary Vascular Resistance (PVR) . The patient presented in WHO FC-II， with NT-proBNP value of 106 pg/ml and Reveal Risk Score (RRS) 4. Transition from sildenafil to riociguat was decided. The patient underwent a one-day PDE5i free period and then received riociguat at a dose of 1 mg TID， with gradual increase by 0.5 mg increments in 14 days， up to 2.5 mg TID. RHC performed one month later， showed normalization of all pulmonary hemodynamic values and an increase in SVI ， while her WHO-FC improved to I. Moreover， echocardiography showed improved TAPSE (pre-riociguat： 1.8， after riociguat：2)， while a cardiac MRI also revealed a satisfactory RV function (Ejection Fraction (EF)： 80%， SVI： 42 ml/m， CO： 6 L/min， CI： 3.7 L/min/m， Right Ventricular End-Diastolic Volume (RVEDVi)： 53.42 ml/m). There were no reported adverse events.\n\n【6】Case 2\n\n【7】Patient 2 is a 50 year old female， suffering from Idiopathic PAH(IPAH)， who routinely went for follow-ups in the same PH clinic during the last 15 years. She was on triple combination therapy with an ERA， sildenafil and subcutaneous treprostinil that was progressively increased to 60 ng/kg/min. Although she presented in WHO-FC II-late， the patient’s NT-proBNP value was 945 pg/ml and cardiopulmonary exercise test revealed a peak O. consumption of12 ml/kg/min， which was consistent with an intermediate risk status， despite RRS of 5. A recent increase of treprostinil dose did not improve the patient’s hemodynamic parameters . Transition from sildenafil to riociguat， adjusted up to 2.5 mg TID， was decided RHC was performed one month after riociguat administration demonstrated significant improvement ofpulmonaryhemodynamics， while NT-proBNP value decreased to 634 pg/ml  and WHO-FC slightly improved to II-early. Echocardiography also showed improved TAPSE， consistent with improved RV function. There were no reported adverse events.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Riociguat is a sGC stimulator with mechanism of action under NO pathway. NO activates sGC， leading to the production of cyclic Guanosine Monophosphate (cGMP) in vascular smooth muscle cells， while PDE5 degrades cGMP. Inhibition of PDE5 results in the increase of intracellular cGMP， promoting vasodilatory and Table 1： Clinical， laboratory and hemodynamic data of patients.\n\n|  | Pre-riociguat  | Post-riociguat  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Patient 1  |  |  |\n| WHO-FC  |  | 1  |\n| NT-ProBNP (pg/ml)  | 106  | 68  |\n| RRS  | 4  | 4  |\n| 6MWD (m)  | 450  | 455  |\n| RAP (mmHg)  | 3  | 3  |\n| PAP (S/D/M) (mmHg)  | 47/19/28.3  | 24/12/16  |\n| CO/CI (L/min)/CI(L/min/m2)  | 3.7/2  | 5.8/2.6  |\n| PVR (WU)  | 6.3  | 2.2  |\n| SVI(ml/m2)  | 34.2  | 40.2  |\n| Patient 2  |  |  |\n| WHO-FC  | I-ate  | ll-early  |\n| NT-proBNP (pg/ml)  | 945  | 634  |\n| RRS  | 5  | 5  |\n| 6MWD (m)  | 552  | 565  |\n| RAP (mmHg)  | 8  | 8  |\n| PA (S/D/M)(mmHg)  | 86/40/55  | 79/33/48  |\n| CO (L/min)/CI (L/min/m²)  | 5/2.7  | 5.5/3  |\n| PVR (WU)  | 9.2  | 6.9  |\n| SVI(ml/m²)  | 41.2  | 42  |\n\n【11】NT-Pro BNP： N Terminal-Pro B-type Natriuretic Peptide； WHO-FC： World Health Organization Functional Class； RRS： REVEAL Risk Score； 6MWD： 6 Minute Walking Distance； RAP： Right Atrial Pressure； PAP (S/D/M)： Pulmonary Artery Pressure (Systolic/Diastolic/Mean)； CO： Cardiac Output； CI： Cardiac Index； PVR：Pulmonary Vascular Resistance； WU： Wood Units； SVI： Stroke Volume Index antiproliferative effects in the pulmonary circulation . However， in PAH the effectiveness of PDE5i might be impaired， due to decrease NO synthesis. The direct stimulation of sGC by riociguat， leads to a vasodilatory effect， independently of the bioavailability of NO . Therefore， there is a physiological rational of transitioning from PDE5i to riociguat in PAH patients with unsatisfactory response.\n\n【12】In the RESPITE study， PAH patients in WHO-FC III who received PDE5i and/or ERA were prospectively enrolled. Switching from PDE5i to riociguat resulted in improvement of hemodynamic parameters， cardiac biomarkers and WHO-FC . The respective post hoc analysis showed that subjects had lower NT-proBNP values and RRS . The subsequent REPLACE study， evaluated the transition from PDE5i to riociguat in PAH patients in WHO-FC III and intermediate risk， who received PDE5i and with or without ERA demonstrated a significant probability of clinical improvement .\n\n【13】There are several case studies and retrospective analyses providing data on transition to riociguat. Davey et al. retrospectively identified the hemodynamic benefit of switching from PDE5i to riociguat in 12 PAH patients receiving combination therapy (ERA and/or prostacyclin analogues) . Another retrospective analysis of 31patients who underwent PDE5i transition to riociguat was performed， demonstrated hemodynamic and clinical improvement . Similar results were observed in three patients with Connective Tissue Disease (CTD)-associated PAH . Kuroda et al. also described significant decrease of PVR in 7 patients suffering from PAH or chronic thromboembolic PH， under dual or triple combination therapy who transitioned from PDE5i to riociguat .\n\n【14】We reported two cases of PAH； the first patient suffered from SLE-associated PAH and the second suffered from idiopathic PAH， who demonstrated favorable results transitioning from sildenafil to riociguat. Both patients were in triple combination therapy that included high doses of subcutaneous prostanoid. The first patient was considered as low risk， despite the presence of CTD， decreased CO and decreased SVI . The second patient was considered as intermediate risk and experienced recenthemodynamic deterioration. The goal of switching to riociguat was to improve the hemodynamic parameters， by optimizing the NO pathway. Indeed， hemodynamic status was normalized in patient #1， while significant hemodynamic improvement was achieved in patient #2. However our patients differed from those enrolled in RESPITE and REPLACE studies  as they were in triple combination therapy. Moreover we reported additional pulmonary hemodynamic parameters that were not provided in the latter study. Our results indicated that optimizing the NO pathway treatment in patients with eitherlow (#1) or high (#2) pulmonary hemodynamic derangement， results in improvements of hemodynamic profles， even under high subcutaneous prostanoid doses.\n\n【15】The alternative treatment would be switching from subcutaneous treprostinil to intravenous epoprostenol， which is a more invasive approach. In some of the retrospective analyses and case studies of PDE5i transition to riociguat， several patients were on triple combination therapy . However， the improvement of hemodynamic status is not as remarkable as the improvement in our patients. In addition， to our knowledge， patient#1 is the first reported case， where normalization of mildly impaired pulmonary hemodynamic profiles was achieved under triple combination therapy.\n\n【16】Conclusion\n\n【17】Possible candidates for switching from PDE5i to riociguat might be patients without high risk parameters， who have not achieved a low risk profile and are not rapidly deteriorating . Our patients fulfilled those characteristics， and more importantly， they were already on triple combination therapy. More trials are required in order to define whether transition between PAH therapies targeting the same pathway will be a goal-oriented strategy and to a priori identify potential responders with an impaired NO signaling. The role of this strategic option in intermediate risk patients is going to be defined in the next PH treatment guidelines.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:48:50", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:49:03", "cost": 12.488}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:49", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:49:02", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:48:50"}

We present the case of a 51-year-old male with a history oftinnitus and vertigo. He underwent an MRI which showed a 0.8 cm right cavernous lesion compatible with meningioma. In view of the findings of right parasellar meningioma， it was decided to follow up the lesion with MRI， which remained stable for ten years. However， in the last control study there was evidence of minimal growth of the lesion， currently measuring 1 cm， with a hypointense signal in T1 and hyperintense in T2 with intense enhancement after gadolinium administration. Neither the dural tail seen in the baseline study nor the mass effect was clearly seen， so the differential diagnosis of hemangioma vs. meningioma was considered. A brain scintigraphy with autologous red blood cells labeled with Tc-99m(mTc]Tc-RBC) was performed， which showed a right parasellar focal deposit in the early phase that progressively increased in the late phase of the study， showing a characteristic pattern of hemangioma.

Their preoperative diagnosis is generally difficult because they are rare lesions that are misdiagnosed as meningiomas (most frequent lesion in the cavernous sinus) on Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)，being essential their differential diagnosis prior to biopsy or surgery， because extracerebral cavernous sinus CH is often complicated by incomplete excision and/or hemorrhage with a high morbidity and mortality rate .\n\n【5】Brain scintigraphy with autologous red blood cells labeled with Tc-99m(mTc]Tc-RBC) (an intravascular radiotracer) has been widely used in nuclear medicine mainly for the evaluation of the cardiovascular system， detection of gastrointestinal bleeding and has also been found to be specific for the diagnosis of CH of the liver， thus， due to this high specificity it has been used for the diagnosis ofhemangiomas in other locations such as intracranial .\n\n【6】The pattern of absence of vascularization of the lesion in the vascular phase that increases in intensity with time suggests hemangioma， so when this lesion is suspected， a late phase should be performed to demonstrate the true blood content of the lesion. This finding is explained by the low perfusion and large blood volume of cavernous hemangiomas .\n\n【7】A 51-year-old male with a history of tinnitus and vertigo. MRI showed a 0.8 cm right cavernous lesion， hypointense in T1 sequence，hyperintense in T2 sequence and with intense enhancement after gadolinium administration， which was associated with a dural tail compatible with the diagnosis of meningioma. In view of the findings of right parasellar meningioma， it was decided to follow up the lesion with MRI， which remained stable for ten years. However， in the last control study there was evidence of minimal growth of the lesion， currently measuring 1 cm， with a hypointense signal in T1 and hyperintense in T2 with intense enhancement after gadolinium administration. Neither the dural tail seen in the baseline study nor the mass effect was clearly visible， so the differential diagnosis ofhemangioma vs. meningioma was considered.\n\n【8】It was decided to perform a brain scintigraphy with autologous red blood cells labeled with Tc-99m([mTc]Tc-RBC) and dynamic imaging was performed immediately after administration of the radiotracer (angiogammagraphic phase)， a static and early image at 30 min (early phase) and a SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) at 2 h after radiotracer administration(late phase) showing that the radiotracer in the angiogammagraphic phase was distributed in the brain in a physiological manner without showing areas of increased vascularization. In the early phase， a right parasellar focal deposit was observed， which progressively increased in the late phase of the study， showing a characteristic hemangioma pattern .\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Given the findings of a lesion with hypointense signal in T1sequence and marked hyperintense in T2 and intense enhancement after administering gadolinium that does not compress the internal carotid lumen in the MRI combined with an increase in radiotracer deposition in the late phases of the mTc]Tc-RBC scan， the patient was diagnosed with CH. Given the significant morbidity and mortality found in the surgery of patients with cavernous sinus hemangiomas， the patient is treated conservatively and therefore， there is no histological confirmation of the nature of this lesion.\n\n【11】The differential diagnosis of hemangioma with meningioma with MRI is characterized by the fact that the hyperintense signal in T2is more intense in hemangioma than in meningioma， moreover， hemangioma does not produce mass effect nor does it associate dural tail， while meningioma produces mass effect compressing the adjacent vascular structures and generally associates dural tail. On mTc]Tc-RBC scintigraphy， hemangioma shows a progressive increase of radiotracer in the lesion that is better evidenced in the late phases， whereas meningioma does not show uptake but a photopenic area consistent with replacement or compression of the cavernous sinus affected by the tumor .\n\n【12】Conclusion\n\n【13】The prospective diagnosis by combined use of MRI and brain scintigraphy with [Tc]Tc-RBC of the brain is potentially beneficial for the differential diagnosis between hemangioma and cavernous lal sinus meningioma.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:41:32", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:41:42", "cost": 9.551}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:49", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:41:41", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:41:31"}

The patients were assigned into two groups： 1) control group who received 4-week home-based daily exercise program and 2) intervention group (weighted kyphorthosis) who performed exercises and wore weighted kyphorthosis for one hour twice a day.

It affects around 55% of the population over the age of 50 years in the United States . Among common clinical consequences are back pain ， hyperkyphosis， limitations of physical functioning and impaired health-related quality of life in osteoporotic patients . It is characterized by low bone mass and micro-architectural changes of bone tissue， leading to increase in fracture risk . Vertebral fractures can occur in spinal osteoporosis and constitute a major public health burden. The incidence of spine fracture can be as high as 20% in postmenopausal women . The weakness of paraspinal extensor muscles in osteoporosis accompanied by repetitive vertebral micro fracture results in hyperkyphosis， in osteoporoticpatients . Changes in spinal alignment would displace the Center Of Pressure (COP) closer to the limit of stability，thereby making it easier to lose balance， with consequent falls in elderly women with osteoporosis . This postural changes and vertebral fractures can impose physical stress on vertebral bodies leading to acute and chronic back pain. Furthermore， osteoporosis is associated with deficits of gait and balance， all together resulting in an increased risk of falls . Falls among the elderly， especially for those with osteoporosis， are associated with high morbidity and mortality and are responsible for hip fracture and are the sixth cause of death among elderly There are studies indicating that almost one third of falls followed by detrimental consequences are preventable . Apart from environmental modifications and pharmaceutical and physical rehabilitative measures including muscle reeducation and resistance exercises leading to improvements in static and dynamic posture and balance training are among most precious preventive strategies for reducing the risk of falls and subsequent fractures .\n\n【8】Assessment of postural control and stability in osteoporotic patients through posturography is a promising and sensitive measurement approach for early detection or pre clinical changes in the postural control system .\n\n【9】Previous studies have shown that wearing a spinal orthosis such as osteomed， spinomed and weighted kyphorthosis result in improvements of posture and back extensor strength. Weighted kyphorthosis [WKO] is among the most known orthosis in osteoporotic patients. In 2005， Sinaki indicated the positive effects of WKO together with spinal proprioceptive extension exercise on balance， gait， and risk of fall assessed by computerized dynamic posturography .\n\n【10】In our previous work ，wearing WKO accompanied by back extensor strengthening exercises lead to significant improvement in functional balance tests including Functional Reach (FR) and Time up and Go(TUG) tests in WKO group compared to exercise group.\n\n【11】The purpose of the present study is to assess the effects of wearing WKO together with spinal exercises on balance via performing computerized dynamic balance tests including Sit to Stand， Walk Across and LOS， by Neurocom tests in women with osteoporosis. These tests， performed by Neurocom device， are dynamic and much more functional and similar to daily activities compared to clinical balance tests used in our previous work. Considering these facts， they can better evaluate the risk of falling in the elderly.\n\n【12】Case Presentation\n\n【13】This study was conducted between during 2013 in Shahid Modarres hospital， Tehran， Iran. The protocol of this clinical trial was approved by Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences， Human Ethics Research Committee. This study was designed as randomized clinical trial.\n\n【14】Patients voluntarily referredtoOPphysical medicineand rehabilitation clinic were entered the study. Patients were screened initially by an expert physiatrist to determine whether they met the inclusion criteria.\n\n【15】Inclusion criteria were as follows： Women with osteoporosis diagnosed based on low bone mineral densitometry at spine(T-score of <-2.5)， aged between 50-75 years old， thoracic kyphosis angle between 35-55 degree (Cobb's angle of thoracic kyphosis was calculated from lateral radiograph of spine).\n\n【16】The patients with the following criteria were excluded from the study：\n\n【17】Thee presence of secondary osteoporosis due to metabolic diseases (such thyroid disease， etc) evaluated by clinical laboratory tests， the presence of neuromuscular disorders， vertebral fracture in last 6 months， history of spinal or lower limb surgical interventions including arthroplasty， vertebroplasty or discectomy.\n\n【18】Serum level of Ca， P， alkaline phosphatase， 25 HO vitD3， thyroid function tests， Renal function tests， parathyroid hormone were evaluated in osteoporotic patients. The patients with low level of vitamin D and secondary causes of osteoporosis were treated appropriately but excluded from this study.\n\n【19】Patients who met the above mentioned criteria were assigned to two groups (orthosis (intervention) and control groups). At the same clinic， like intervention group， matched controls of comparable age and weight and height were enrolled in the study as control group.\n\n【20】Randomization and Patients'Enrollment\n\n【21】Simple random sampling was used for this study. All patients included in the study received a number then by using random number table they were allocated to two groups (Control and intervention groups).\n\n【22】Equal allocation between groups was performed. Hence， the patients were classified randomly in control and intervention groups. Random allocation sequence， who enrolled patients to interventions were performed by one physician.\n\n【23】Blinding\n\n【24】The assessors supervised and performed NeuroCom balance tests， as well as the statistician were blinded to the group assignment.\n\n【25】Patients in both groups received medications including 1000mg calcium carbonate and 400 IU vitamin E daily and sodium alendronate 70 mg weekly.\n\n【26】Patients in both groups were also instructed to have 30 minutes of daily walking.\n\n【27】All Patients were followed via telephone calls to home to get sure that they were sticking to the exercises correctly as prescribed for them.\n\n【28】Control group： No orthosis was prescribed for this group； but patients were taught to perform daily back extensor strengthening exercises at home according to professor Sinaki program in Mayo clinic  as follows： 1. In supine position， the patient flexes the knees and then abducts and adducts the shoulders while the elbows are extended and upper limbs are in contact with the floor.\n\n【29】2. In the supine position， the patient flexes the knees and put hands over the head. By contracting abdominal muscles the patient tries to draw the low back to the floor and keep this position for10seconds.\n\n【30】3. In the prone position， the patient puts a pillow under the lower abdomen and gently raises the head and shoulders from the floor as much as possible and keeps this position for 10 seconds.\n\n【31】4. The patient sits on a chair and puts the hands behind the head. Then he/she moves the elbows behind the head while inhaling. The patient will do the opposite while exhaling.\n\n【32】5. Sitting on a chair， the patient flexes the elbows while keeping the arms near to the trunk and then moves the arms back to reduce thoracic kyphosis.\n\n【33】All of the exercise programs were taught by an experienced physical therapist. Also， an illustrated pamphlet describing each exercise was presented to each participant. A paper with a table was given to each patient and she was asked to specify every day if she would do the exercises and bring it on follow up visits. The patients were called by a physical therapist every week to assess exercise performance and associated problems. After 4 weeks， patients were called to return to hospital for re-evaluations.\n\n【34】Intervention group (Orthosis group)\n\n【35】Patients in this group were taught to perform the same home exercises as control group.\n\n【36】Weighted kyphorthosis was also administered for the patients in this group.\n\n【37】Weighted kyphorthosis (WKO)\n\n【38】Weighted kypho-orthosis is an especially designed orthosis (made by Cybernetics Company) with a harness and a 2-pound pouch， which centers its weight on the posterior of the spine at T10 to L4.\n\n【39】The patients were guided to place the weighted kyphosis orthosis over the thoracic spine and adjust the straps such that the bottom of the pouch is located at the waistline.\n\n【40】Patients were instructed to wear the device when ambulating for one hour a day (30 minutes at the morning and the evening) for 4weeks. During this 4 week， patients were followed by telephone calls to assure that they were using the orthosis correctly.\n\n【41】An experienced orthotist instructed the patient regarding the proper usage of orthosis.\n\n【42】Measures\n\n【43】Dual X-ray absorptiometery (DXA) was used for measuring bone mineral density of spine or hip. All patients were referred to one imaging center for bone mineral densitometry. Then DXA scan was carried out using the Hologic QDR-4500 machine (Hologic， Waltham， MA) to determine BMD values of the femur and lumbar vertebrae. TheaccuracyofaDXA，a monthlycalibration measurement， according to the manufacturer's instructions， was performed.\n\n【44】Precision was defined as the reproducibility and the ability of densitometric systems to detect changes in BMD over time. Precision error of the machine and the technologist kept below 1 % in the center we referred our patients for bone densitometry.\n\n【45】The cobb's angle of kyphosis was calculated from perpendicular lines drawn on a standard thoracic spine radiograph (lateral view)：a line extends through the superior endplate of the vertebral body， marking the beginning of the thoracic curve and the inferior endplate of the vertebral body， marking the end of the thoracic curve.\n\n【46】An experienced radiologist ruled out osteoporotic fractures via assessing associated X-rays.\n\n【47】Dynamic balance tests： The NeuroCom Equitest Long Force Plate(NeuroCom International， Clackamas， Oregon) was used to assess the participants’ performance on functional tasks. The Long Force Plate was used to objectively evaluate balance and postural stability under dynamic tests . The Sit to Stand， Walk Across， Step/Quick Turn and Limits of stability were selected from the Functional Limitation Assessment Battery due to their ability to target functional characteristics pertaining to lower body strength， flexibility， and balance. These areas of interest were chosen due to their impact on independent Function. All participants performed each task three times and the mean score was used in the analyses.\n\n【48】Subjects were allowed one practice trial for familiarization with the procedure ofthe test.\n\n【49】Testing Protocols\n\n【50】Before starting protocol， each participant received a verbal explanation of the protocols.\n\n【51】Sit to stand test (STS)： During the measurements subjects were positioned on the platform facing the monitor with barefoot. The starting position before each trial was standardized by placing knees at 90 degree flexion by adjusting foot placement.\n\n【52】Subjects were instructed to stand up as quickly as possible when start sign appeared on the monitor. They were not allowed to use arms or hands to push off their legs or the seated surface. Subjects were asked to remain stationary until the test was completed (<5 sec after they rose).\n\n【53】The parameters ofthis test are as follows：\n\n【54】a. Weight transfer (in seconds)： time elapsed until the moment of rising， b. Rising index (percentage of the body weight)： is the percentage of weight bearing (% body weight)， which is the ratio of the amount of weight borne on both legs to the patient’s total body weight during the rising phase.( Amount of force exerted on the platform during the rising phase)， c. Center of gravity (COG) sway velocity (in degrees per second)：postural sway velocity during upright posture， d. Left/right weight symmetry (percentage of body weight)：symmetry of the body weight distribution on the lower extremities during the rising phase.\n\n【55】Walk Across (WA)： -Participants were positioned in front of a force plate and were instructed to “Go，\"via an audible prompt. Three gait cycles were completed across the force plate， while outcome measures included Step Width (lateral distance in centimeter)， Step Length (longitudinal distance in centimeters)， and Step Speed(velocity in centimeters/second)\n\n【56】Step/quick turn (SQT)： The patient is instructed to take two forward steps on command， and then quickly turn 180° to either the left or right and return to the starting point.\n\n【57】Limits of stability (LOS)： The NeuroCom LOS test required participants to transfer their COG， while standing on stable force plates， toward 8 targets in a sequential clockwise direction spaced at45° intervals around the body's COG， as represented on a computer monitor. Before testing， subjects were informed that the on-screen COG cursor (i.e.， visual biofeedback) moved in response to the movements of their body COG.\n\n【58】During the test， subjects were required to stand with their arms by their sides and to maintain their feet in the standardized foot position. A reference grid superimposed on the force plate allowed for careful monitoring ofthe feet during the testing procedures. They were instructed to keep their body in a straight line， using their ankle joints at the primary axis of motion and to move toward each target as directly and quickly as possible.\n\n【59】Outcomes include： reaction time， sway velocity， directional control， endpoint excursion and maximum excursion. Endpoint excursion and maximum excursion are calculated as percentages of the subject’s theoretical 100% limit of stability that is a function of their height.\n\n【60】The test was repeated three times and the average values of the measurements were documented\n\n【61】Data analysis： SPSS-18 was used for data analysis. Kolmogorov-smirnov was used for testing normality of variable distribution. Independent T-test and Man whitney tests were conducted to determineifthere was a statistically significant change in demographic characteristics between the two groups and improvement in balance tests after therapy. Wilcoxon-signed rank test was conducted to determine the significant change in balance tests within each group after therapy.\n\n【62】Table 1： Demographic characteristics including age， height， weight and body mass indices compared between two groups.\n\n| Demographic characteristic  | Group  | mean±sd  | P-value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Height(m)  | Control  | 1.51±4.25  | 0.64  |\n| Height(m)  | Intervention  | 1.5±4.62  | 0.64  |\n| Weight(kg)  | Control  | 62±4.62  | 0.63  |\n| Weight(kg)  | Intervention  | 67±5  | 0.63  |\n| Agefyear)  | Intervention  | 62±5  | 0.36  |\n| Agefyear)  | Control  | 66±6  | 0.36  |\n| BMI(Kg/m²)  | Intervention  | 27.1±1.8  | 0.75  |\n| BMI(Kg/m²)  | Control  | 29.6±1.8  | 0.75  |\n\n【64】SD： Standard deviation； Intervention Group； Brace and exercise； Control group； exercise only\n\n【65】Ethics： The patients were enrolled after providing informed consent as approved by the institutional review board of Shahid Beheshti Medical University.

One patient in each control and intervention group didn't perform exercises regularly. Their results excluded from final analysis Patient's satisfaction： All patients completed the study were satisfied with the treatment (both orthosis and exercises).\n\n【85】Adverse events： No adverse events were noticed during the study. Secondary discussion\n\n【86】Based on the results of the present study， improvement in balance was noticed in patients with osteoporosis after wearing weighted kyphorthosis for 4 weeks. According to walk across test， speed improvement was noticed in both groups with no significant between group differences. Right turn time decreased significantly only in WKO group. Two parameters of LOS including the mean of End Point Excursion and Maximal Excursion increased significantly in WKO but not in control group.\n\n【87】Improvement in the above mentioned parameters can be translated as better postural stability in intervention group. Postural stability has been defined as the ability to control the body's COG within a given base of support. The understanding of postural stability control (i.e.， balance) is essential for performing activities of daily Living and decrease in fall rate .\n\n【88】In practice， the actual LOS of a person may be defined as the distance the patient is willing and able to move without losing balance and taking a step . As with the Functional Reach (FR) test， the LOS test has been shown to provide reliable scores that are predictive of fall risk .In our previous work  WKOlead to improvement in FR. In essence， LOS should measure similar components of balance as FR. However， Wallmann reports that there is no significant relationship between FR measures and anterior displacement on the LOS test .\n\n【89】Decrements in dynamic postural control have been attributed to both age and pathologic changes in parameters associated with movements of the COG. Compared with healthy older adults， osteoporotic patients exhibit smaller voluntary COG excursions， reach maximal lean more slowly， and exhibit less postural control once they have reached maximum lean .\n\n【90】The LOS test provides spatial and temporal measures (e.g.， movement velocity， maximum excursion， directional control) of COG movements as a person volitionally leans to various positions in space . LOS test measures one aspect of balance utilized in daily life， and is a measure of improvement in balance resulting from rehabilitation. Considering the high efficiency of LOS test in early identification of falls in elderly， high reliability of its parameters， high test-retest reliability while measured by NeuroCom and its ease of execution， it is popular and confident in global measures of balance Previous studies suggestedthatposturalcontrol1：among individuals with osteoporosis is different from general elderly population. Individuals with osteoporosis are more likely to present higher sway velocities and greater maximum shift of the COG .\n\n【91】Azadinia  evaluated the effects of two spinal orthoses on balance in the elderly with thoracic Kyphosis. Patients were allocated to two groups (Spinomed orthosis and the posture-training support groups). In both groups， significant changes were observed in the studied balance parameters. Authors concluded that both interventions may improve balance in the elderly in a similar manner.\n\n【92】The ability to transfer from sit to stand (STS) is another most commonly performed tasks of daily living. Accurate control of COG position is critical in controlling the rise movement， as well as to maintain postural stability. Ideally， COG sway velocity during the rise should be minimal. Increased sway velocity can be caused by weak trunk extension or inability to keep the COG movement to a minimum in the elderly. However in our study， no significant change was noticed in this balance parameter.\n\n【93】In normal aging， step length and speed decreased， turn time increased substantially with aging.\n\n【94】Slow gait speed is associated with falls in aged people. Therapeutic exercises to improve gait speed and step length in osteoporotic elderly can reduce the risk of fall . In our study， step speed improved in both control and intervention group which can be contributed to extension exercises administered for patients in both groups.\n\n【95】In the present study， another balance parameter changed in intervention group was right turn time. The ability to make a rapid turn in walking is very crucial and sensitive to dynamic balance problems .\n\n【96】There are few studies evaluating the beneficial impacts of spinal orthosis on gait balance .\n\n【97】In 2005， Sinaki  conducted a study to determine the outcome of intervention with a spinal weighted kypho-orthosis (WKO) and a spinal proprioceptive extension exercise dynamic (SPEED) program on the risk of fall in osteoporotic patients. After 4 week ofintervention， balance， gait， and risk of falls assessed by computerized dynamic posturography improved significantly with SPEED program.\n\n【98】The role ofexercise in the treatment of osteoporosis is to improve axial stability through improvement of muscle strength and axial posture.\n\n【99】In our study， wearing WKO lead to improvement in turn quick test， mean of excursion and end point excursion. WKO promotes improvement in posture and increased back extensor strength by two mechanisms： first， the device produces a posterior force below the inferior angle of scapula and reduces anterior compressive forces exerted on the kyphotic spine . Second， application of the WKO increases a patient's perception of spinal joint position， which plays an important role in static and dynamic posture. It creates a preprioceptive input and enhances the patient's ability to sense the position of the spine . WKO also promotes muscle re-education and decreases painful contractions of the erector spine muscles in kyphosis .\n\n【100】Besides WKO， there are some studies investigating other types of spinal orthoses in osteoporosis. A trial was conducted in 2012evaluating the influence of ThamertOsteo-med spinal orthosis on gait and physical functioning in osteoporotic women. At a 6-month follow up， the study demonstrated that wearing a spinal orthosis reduced double support time associated with improvement on gait stability . Pfeifer et al.  evaluated the efficacy of two spinal orthoses in patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Wearing the orthosis Spinomed in that study was associated with increase in back extensor and abdominal flexor strength， decrease in the angle of kyphosis and body sway， also decrease in average pain .\n\n【101】In all above mentioned studies， spinal orthosis had positive effects on postural balance which is in agreement with the results of our studies indicating improvement in LOS， step quick turn and speed in WKO group.\n\n【102】In conclusion， applying WKO together with back extensor strengthening exercises in women with osteoporosis leads to improvement in dymamic balance tests evaluated by NeuroCom which can be translated to decreased risk of fall in real life in this population.\n\n【103】The limitations of our study were the relatively small number of cases included and short term follow ups evaluations. Absence of a control group receiving no intervention was another limitation ofthis study； however， due to ethical considerations we had to consider the least routine interventions including exercise and medications for all patients.\n\n【104】We encourage more randomized controlled clinical trials with larger sample size evaluating the effect of WKO on risk of fall in long term via applying clinical functional and para clinical tests in the elderly with osteoporosis. Future studies can also consider power calculation to determine adequate sample size that yielded improved power and effect size which was lacking in the present study.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:25:09", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:31:00", "cost": 350.401}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:49", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:31:00", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:25:09"}

Lung CT showed right atelectasis and right pleural effusion. The cause remains to be investigated. Enlarged lymph nodes in mediastinum. Thoracocentesis was performed after thoracic color Doppler ultrasound localization， and a large amount of turbid， milky white pleural effusion with foul odor was drained， and specimens were taken for examination. Pleural Effusion analysis showed： Milky white and turbid， positive in Levantine’s test， total cell count： 28400 × 10/L， WBC count： 22400×10/L， percentage of mononuclear cells： 0.10， percentage of multinucleated cells： 0.90； total protein： 4.5 G/L， chloride： 97.2 mmol/L， Glucose： 0.5 mmol/L， LDH： 3955.0 U/L， ADA： 202.9 U/L； CEA in pleural effusion was200.870 ng/L； Pleural fluid anaerobic bacteria culture： Streptococcus constellatus， sensitive tLcOcefotaxime， linezolid，levofloxacin， meropenem， penicillin， tetracycline and vancomycin， not applicable to amoxicillin， moxifloxacin and teicoplanin， resistant to clindamycin and erythromycin. At this point， the patient was definitely diagnosed as： Streptococcus constellatus empyema on the left. Penicillin sodium(3.2 MIU，ivgtt， q8h) combined with ornidazole (500 mg， ivgtt， Qd) was given for anti-infection treatment. At the same time， improved thoracoscopy and pleural lavage (sodium bicarbonate 200 ml +normal saline 200 ml， Qd) were given. The patient's temperature showed a downward trend， and returned to normal after 3 days. Lung CT was reexamined after 7 days， and it was significantly better than before . The patient was discharged with oral antibiotics for Discussion\n\n【11】Streptococcus corstellatus viridians group，a specieessCof Streptococcus angina (also known as Streptococcus miller). In the same genus are Streptococcus angina and Streptococcus intermedia . There are two subspecies of Streptococcus constellatus， StreptocoCCUS constellatus and angina. The Streptococcus constellatus is a gram- positive coccus which is arranged in double chains or short chains， it can form gray-white， needle-sized， convex， round， smooth and moist colonies with neat edges and obvious B-hemolytic rings on blood plates . The bacteria are widely distributed in nature， such as human body surface， oral cavity and intestinal tract. It is usually Or an opportunistic pathogen， and the low immunity of the body often causes suppurative infection . Claridge et al.  analyzed 118 cases of Streptococcus constellatus determined by 16s rRNA gene testing， and found that compared with Streptococcus angina， Streptococcus constellatus and Streptococcus intermediawere more likely to form deep purulent lesions. Empyema， liver abscess， septicemia， odontogenic abscess， intrauterine pyogenic infection， pyogenic spondylitis， neck abscess， necrotizing mediastinitis， and even brain abscess caused by Streptococcus constellatus have been reported. There are few reports of empyema caused by Streptococcus constellatus at home and abroad . Wang Xueqiao et al.  analyzed the characteristics of pathogenic bacteria in 339 cases of adult thoracic infection. It was concluded that gram-negative bacteria were the main pathogens of thoracic infection， and only 12.4% (17/137) of them were caused by gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus constellatus. One case of Streptococcus constellatus empyema was confirmed by bacterial culture of pleural effusion， and two cases of Streptococcus constellatus empyema reported by Li Pei et al. and Jiang Yinling et al.  had cough， expectoration and chest pain as the main symptoms. Chest CT showed pleural effusion. Comparative analysis， the patient reported in this article， after admission， detailed medical history， physical examination and complete examination， mainly manifested as chest pain， low breath sounds on the right empyema side of chest auscultation， and obvious pleural effusion on B-mode ultrasound and CT. The effusion drained by thoracocentesis was turbid brown， similar to milk tea， with severe odor. Empyema is a suppurative infection of the thoracic cavity. The treatment of empyema is mainly to thoroughly wash and drain the pus， promote the lung tissue to expand as soon as possible， and actively search for pathogens， carry out drug sensitivity tests， and select sensitive and effective antibiotics according to the sensitivity of pathogens to drugs. This article reports that the patient underwent ultrasound localization and thoracic puncture drainage in time after admission. And after consummation thoracoscopy， flushes the abscess cavity unceasingly， on the onehand alleviates the clinical sign and symptom，on the other hand can retain the specimen to send in time. Yang Chunling et al. have conducted antimicrobial susceptibility tests on 30 strains of Streptococcus constellatus. The Susceptibility rates to ampicillin， cefazolin， cefuroxime， cefaclor， cefotaxime， ceftriaxone， cefepime， meropenem， panipenem， vancomycin， levofloxacin and ofloxacin were 100%， clindamycin 83.3%(25/30) and erythromycin 90.0%(27/30). Chloramphenicol 93.3%(28/30). Wu Hongqiao et al.  also analyzed the clinical infection characteristics and drug resistance of 146 strains of Streptococcus， and showed that the sensitivity rate of Streptococcus constellatus to erythromycin and clindamycin was low， both <20.0%， but it was sensitive to many other antibiotics. Accordingly， penicillins and their derivatives can be preferentially selected for the treatment of empyema caused by Streptococcus constellatus， andthe conventional dosage can be used for 6 to 8 weeks. Or until the abscess cavity and inflammation in the chest disappear with only a small amount of residual fibrosis. The patient reported in this article was sensitive to the empirically selected levofloxacin at the time of admission， but the patient's temperature was not well controlled before thoracentesis and drainage， and was changed to the same sensitive penicillin's + ornidazole after empyema drainage and washing (the patient’s pleural effusion was turbid with severe odor. Do not rule out anaerobic infection， so combined use of ornidazole(anti-infection)， combined treatment achieved good results. It can be seen that timely drainage of pleural effusion can relieve the symptoms of patients and control infection.\n\n【12】In addition， Noguchi et al.  analyzedtheclinical characteristics of patients with respiratory system infection caused by Streptococcus angina， and concluded that Streptococcus constellatus respiratory system infection is common in men， most of them have underlying diseases， the typical manifestation is pleural effusion， and half of the pleural effusion is empyema after further examination. The patient reported in this paper is a middle-aged man without underlying diseases. After admission， there was no obvious abnormality in the relevant examinations (HIV， TP， hepatitis， thyroid function， etc.). For the occurrence of empyema caused by Streptococcus constellatus infection， it was considered that the patient ate less recently， lacked exercise and had low immunity. It was suggested that the patient should pay attention to oral hygiene in daily life， quit smoking and drinking， eat high-quality protein diet， and strengthen exercise and exercise. Enhance immunity and seek medical treatment in time.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:56:39", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:57:13", "cost": 33.58}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:49", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:57:13", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:56:39"}

According to the different therapies， they were divided into two groups： Whole Lung Lavage (WLL) group and Xuefu Zhuyu Decoction (XFZYD) group. The results of multiple clinical tests and examination were used as data sources.\n\n【3】Results： Compared with the standard baseline of CT， the percentage of affected lung parenchyma in WLL group and XFZYD group were 69.28±10.25 and 67.55±8.44， respectively. Both groups decreased gradually over time， reaching the lowest at the 24h month， but XFZYD group was significantly lower than the WLL group since the 3 month after baseline. The improvements of the Partial Alveolar-arterial Oxygen gradient (P(A-a)O，) and the Partial arterial pressure of Oxygen (PaO，) were consistent with the reduction of the affected lung on CT images. In XFZYD group， the forced vital capacity (FVC) % and carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) % were markedly improved after 3-month treatment. The contents of Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH)， Carcino Embryonic Antigen (CEA) and Neuron Specific Enolase (NSE) in serum were significantly decreasing in the two different treatment groups. Serum Total Cholesterol (TC) in the XFZYD group gradually decreased over time， reaching the lowest value at 24 months， while serum High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C) had the opposite trend. There was no difference of Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) and Triglyceride (TG) between the WLL and XFZYD group， and Alanine Amino Transferase (ALT) and Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) of XFZYD group maintained at normallevels.\n\n【4】Conclusion： XFZYD might be an effective and safe method for the treatment ofaPAP， and it can ameliorate the symptom ofaPAP and reduce the level of serum cholesterol.\n\n【5】Keywords： Autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis； Whole lung lavage； Xuefu Zhuyu decoction； Therapy\n\n【6】Abbreviations\n\n【7】PAP： Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis； aPAP： autoimmune PAP； PT： Patients； XFZYD： Xuefu Zhuyu Decoction； TCM： Traditional Chinese Medicine； GM-CSF： Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor； WLL： Whole Lung Lavage； DSS： Disease Severity Score； PaO。 Partial Pressure of Oxygen in arterial blood； P(A-a) O。 Partial Alveolar-arterial Oxygen gradient； ECG：Electrocardiogram； SaO。 Arterial Oxygen Saturation； ALT： Alanine Amino Transferase； AST：Aspartate Aminotransferase； LDH： Lactate Dehydrogenase； CEA： Carcino Embryonic Antigen； NSE： Neuron Specific Enolase； FVC： Forced Vital Capacity； DLCO： Carbon Monoxide Diffusing Capacity； CT： Computed Tomography； HRCT： High-Resolution Computed Tomography； TG：Total Triglyceride； TC： Total Cholesterol； HDL-C： High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol； LDL-C：Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol\n\n【8】Introduction\n\n【9】Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis (PAP) is a rare clinical syndrome and enigmatic disorder， which is characterized by abnormal accumulation of surfactant in the alveoli and variable natural history. According to statistics， the annual incidence and prevalence of PAP are 0.36 and 3.70 cases per million populations， respectively. It is difficult for any individual medical clinic or rehabilitation center to accumulate the important experience with this disease； thus， the single cases reports or small case series account for more than75% of all described PAP cases . The disclosed data shows that autoimmune PAP (aPAP) is the major type and it accounts for over90 percent of all PAPpatients . For aPAP patients， the main clinical manifestations are alveolar proteinosis， alveolar lipoproteinosis and alveolar phospholipidosis. The precipitated surfactants are composed of polar lipids (80%)， neutral lipids (10%) and protein composition(10%). In addition， the cholesterol content of macrophages in the alveoli will be significantly increased while the phospholipids be slightly increased， resulting in an increase in the ratio of cholesterol to phospholipids in lung surfactants along with causing the course of the symptom to be more serious . Therefore， reducing the cholesterol level of alveoli might be a useful strategy to improve treatment effect of the autoimmune alveolar proteinosis. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has a long history and has formed its own unique theoretical system . Within the framework of TCM theory， aPAP is recognized by Qi stagnation and Blood stasis syndrome，and TCM practitioners always prescribe prescriptions using herbal medicines and acupuncture according to its specific syndromes. Xuefu Zhuyu Decoction (XFZYD) belongs to the Chinese Herbal Medicine (CHM) drugs and it has the function of promoting Qi and Blood circulation and relieving the symptoms of Qi stagnation and Blood stasis ， which has obtained the certification approved by the China Food and Drug Administration in 2002. The components of XFZYD include 11 kinds of plant-extracts， as follows： Peach kernel (Taoren)， Angelica sinensis (Oliv.)， Diels (Danggui)， Ligusticumi chuanxiong Hort. (Chuanxiong)， Carthamus tinctorius L. (Honghua)， Paeonia lactiflora Pall. (Chishao)， Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch. (Di huang)， Citrus aurantium L. (Zhiqiao)， Bupleurum chinense DC. (Chaihu)， Platycodon grandiflorum (Jacq.) A. DC. (Jiegeng)， Achyranthes bidentata Bl. (Niuxi)， and Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. (Gancao).The modern pharmacological study indicates XFZYD can lower blood lipid  and improve hemorheology and microcirculation . Besides，XFZYD also can be used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases . According to our clinical experience， we found that aPAP patients reflected an alleviated dyspnea and a better lung characteristic in CT images after taking XFZYD for one month. Herein， we followed up the patients condition， conducted the observation for one year in this study， and compared the clinical indexes of these patients that adopted the Whole Lung Lavage (WLL) treatment and XFZYD treatment.\n\n【10】Methods\n\n【11】Patient selection\n\n【12】This study involved 12 aPAP patients that were collected from the inpatient of the Department of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine of the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University， from January 2012 to February 2018. All patients were diagnosed by transbronchial lung biopsy and had positive results for GM-CSF auto antibodies (>5 ug/mL). According to the different treatment， the 12patients were randomly divided into two groups： Whole Lung Lavage group (WLL) group and Xuefu Zhuyu Decoction (XFZYD) group. Patients would get a mark based on the Disease Severity Score (DSS) for PAP definition by Inoue et al.  and were divided into different grades， details were shown in Table 1. The grades were as follows：Grade 1， PaO，≥ 70 mmHg without respiratory symptoms； Grade 2， PaO， ≥ 70 mmHg with respiratory symptoms； Grade 3， 60 mmHg≤PaO，<70 mmHg； Grade 4， 50 mmHg≤ PaO，<60 mmHg； and Grade5，PaO<50 mmHg.\n\n【13】Whole lung lavage\n\n【14】WLL was conducted by a double-lumen endobronchial tube under general anesthesia. Lavage was initially performed in the relatively severe lungs. Patients were in a lateral position with ventilated lung up and lavage lung down. Before operation， the ventilated lung underwent a lung ventilation tolerance test， the pure oxygen was ventilated for at least 20 min to wash out nitrogen in lung and raise oxygen storage. Then， 500 mL 37°℃ saline was injected in lavage lung and drained 200 mL to 250 mL by gravity， and repeated lavage until drainage fluid was clear. The total lavage volume ranged from 9 to 15 liters， with an average of 12.8 ± 0.36 liters/lung. The lavage time maintained between 90 min to 150 min. The blood pressure， pulse， Electrocardiogram (ECG)，arterial Oxygen Saturation(SaO，)， peak airway pressure， and artery blood gas analysis were monitored during the entire surgery. If SaO， was under 90% during lavage， positive pressure ventilation was given until SaO， was higher than 92% and then lavage is continued. Afterwards， according to the range of pulmonary rales， lavage fluid recovery rate， blood oxygen saturation and partial pressure oxygen， the furosemide 20 mg to 40mg and added dexamethasone 5 mg to 10 mg through vein injection and bilateral lung ventilation giving positive end expiratory pressure(6 cmH，O) for 20 min to 1 h. Thereafter， the patient was taken off the ventilator， removed the tracheal intubation， and changed to nasal catheter for oxygen. Then we performed lavage again for the next lung with an interval of one week.\n\n【15】Preparation of Xuefu Zhuyu decoction\n\n【16】The TCM doctors designed dialectical treatment to these patients. They added up or wiped out some crude herbs to XFZYD based on each patient's pathogenetic conditions， the patient's prescription is shown in the Table 1. The crude herbs in the decoction were purchased from Tong Ren Tang Pharmacy in Qingdao (Shandong， China). The TCM mixture was heated with 1 liter of water at high temperature until boiling， and then gently heated until there was about 300 mL of the liquid. The patients took it once a day， 30 min before meal.\n\n【17】Laboratory test\n\n【18】The automatic chemical analyzer (HITACHI 7600P， FUJI-FILM Wako Pure Chemical Corporation， Japan) was used to measure the levels of serum Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)， Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) and blood lipids， according to the manufacturer’s instructions of commercial kits. Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) was measured with an automatic chemical analyzer (HITACHI 7600P， BeijinggLeadmanBiochemical Co.， Ltd.，(China). CarcinoembryonicAntigen (CEA) and Neuron-Specific Enolase (NSE) were detected by an automatic electrochemiluminescence immunoassay analyzer (Roche Cobas E602， Roche Diagnostics， Germany). An automatic analyzer (GEM Premier 4000， Werfen Life Group， Spain) is used to analyze the arterial blood gas of the PAP patients when the patients breathed indoor air. The German Master Screen Body (Jaeger Company， Bad Wildungen， Hessen， Germany) was used to measure the pulmonary function on PAP patients， including FVC% Pred and Carbon Monoxide Diffusing Capacity (DLCO)% Pred. Philips 40 brilliance Computer Tomography (CT) was used to conduct the conventional chest CT and the chest High-Resolution CT (HRCT).\n\n【19】Statistical analysis\n\n【20】All results were expressed as mean ± SD. Clinical indexes of the2 groups were analyzed through repeated measurement analysis of variance. The Fisher's exact test or Chi-square test was used to evaluate proportions for variables between the WLL group and XFZYD group. The P value of <0.05 was considered as statistically different. All data analysis was performed using SPSS version 22.0 (SPSS， Inc， Chicago， IL)， while figures was made by Graph Pad Prism 7.0.\n\n【21】Results\n\n【22】Clinical characteristics\n\n【23】Clinical characteristics of the aPAP patients are listed in Table 2. The average age of patients in the WLL group was 46.8±8.10 years， while the average age of patients in the XFZYD group was 44.6±6.50years (t=0.4996，P=0.6308). The proportion of men in the WLL group was 80%， while the proportion of men in the XFZYD group was 75%(P>0.9999). The results of the analysis of the course of disease showed that the WLL group and XFZYD group were 6.2±3.11 months and5.6±4.18 months，respectively (t=0.08575， P=0.9338). There was no significant difference in DSS scores between the WLL group and the XFZYD group， but there were two smokers and one patient with a history of exposure to pneumoconiosis in the WLL group， one smoker and one patient with a history of exposure to pneumoconiosis in the XFZYD group. All patients in two groups had the main symptoms of breathing difficulties. The histological staining images showed that the alveoli were filled with homogeneous red protein-like substances in both groups . In the WLL group， milk-like liquid was drained out during operation . One-third of patients received the second whole lung lavage at the 8 and 12 months. For the XFZYD group， the average medication time of XFZYD group was9.5±3 months.\n\n【24】CT analysis\n\n【25】We performed CT examinations at 1， 3， 6， 12 and 24 months after lavage or medication . At baseline examination， both groups showed diffuse ground-glass shadows and thickening of interlobular septa in the CT images. After totallung lavage， four of the six patients gradually improved their CT images over time， and the other 2 patients got worse 6 months after surgery， and finally received a second operation at 8and 12 months. The percentage ofaffectedlung parenchyma in the upper right lobe bronchial layer was estimated by Image J software . The results showed that CT percentages ofthe affectedlung parenchyma in the WLL group and XFZYD group were 69.28 ±10.26% and 67.55±8.44%，respectively. With the time passing， both groups had gradually decreased and reached the lowest values at 24 months： 27.32±13.06% and 7.27±3.04%， respectively. The XFZYD group was significantlylower than the WLL group after 3months . These data indicate that XFZYD is more effective in improving the symptoms of aPAP patients.\n\n【26】Arterial blood gas analysis and pulmonary function\n\n【27】The results of arterial blood gas showed that PaO， of WLL group increased gradually with time and reached 70 ± 7.61 mmHg at 24months. Interestingly， the XFZYD group was significantly higher than the WLL group after 3 months . The P(A-a) O， decreased significantly in the WLL and XFZYD groups during the 24-month follow-up compared to baseline， and the P(A-a)O， of XFZYD group was significantly lower than that of WLL group at the3 months and later . The results of lung function indicated that FVC of WLL group was slightly higher than baseline at each time point after operation， but the difference was not significant.凶After 3-month treatment， the XFZYD group showed improved effects in FVC% Pred (P=0.0109)and DLCO% Pred (P=0.046) than baseline， especially in 6， 12 and 24 months (P=0.0001， 0.0002) compared with baseline . The change trend of DLCO% Pred was similar to FVC% Pred， and the XFZYD group was markedly higher than the WLL group at the same time point .\n\n【28】Serum markers\n\n【29】There was no significant difference in LDH level between the WLL group and the XFZYD group， which was 366.67 ±29.68 U/L and 369.33±25.70U/L， respectively. The LDH was significantlylower than the baseline during follow-up in the WLL group and XFZYD group . Tumor markers were also included in the comparison of the two groups. The results indicated that CEA and NSE was significantly decreased in WLL groups during the 24months (P<0.0001)， and the XFZYD group was markedly better than the WLL group .\n\n【30】The content of ALT and AST and serum lipids\n\n【31】The ALT， AST and serum lipids were monitored to evaluate the side effects of XFZYD and the results of ALT or AST were shown in Table 3 and Figure 4d， 4e. The results showed that there was no increase in ALT or AST in patients in the both groups. In our previous study， we found that patients with PAP have elevated blood lipids by the statin therapy. The serum Total Cholesterol (TC) of the WLL group and the XFZYD group were increased to 5.85±0.50mmol/L and 5.99±0.60 mmol/L in the level of baseline， respectively. group and XFZYD group.\n\n【32】Table 1： The prescription of aPAP patients in XFZYD group.\n\n|  |  | Dosage (g)  | PT1  | PT2  | PT3  | PT4  | PT5  | PT6  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| XuefuZhuyu Decaction  | Prunus persica (L.)

After treatment for 3months， the High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (HDL-C) in the XFZYD group was higher than the WLL group ， but there was no difference between the two groups regarding the LDL-C concentration .\n\n【39】Discussion\n\n【40】The Whole Lung Lavage (WLL) has always been considered the standard of treatment of PAP over the past decades， but it also has many adverse reactions such as infection， maturation， pleural cavity， pleural effusion， hypoxic discharge and even death . Recently， Ilaria Campo completed a global survey of pearl total lung lavage and found that among approximately 368 PAP patients， PAP patients received 2.5± 1.5 WLL surgeries within five years， of which 10%required more than 5 surgeries . In our study， 2 of 6 patients received the second full course of lavage at the 8 and 12 months because of the worsening course. But the patients in XFZYD group (e)AST remained in normal range after medication.\n\n【41】Table 3： Comparison of clinical indexes between the two groups.\n\n| Type  | Time  |  | Group  |  | Time Group  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Type  | F  | P  | F  | P  | F  | P  |\n| Affected lung (%)  | 136.63  | 0  | 18.28  | 0.008  | 6.49  | 0.001  |\n| PaO，  | 57.92  | 0  | 7.64  | 0.04  | 4.08  | 0.008  |\n| P(A-a)O，  | 63.34  | 0  | 131.81  | 0  | 4.35  | 0.005  |\n| FVC  | 9.61  | 0.008  | 12.51  | 0.017  | 23.64  | 0  |\n| DLCO  | 52.25  | 0  | 7.29  | 0.043  | 2.79  | 0.054  |\n| LDH  | 53.91  |  | 114.7  | 0  | 8.42  | 0.006  |\n| NSE  | 127.01  | 0  | 48.3  | 0.001  | 1.31  | 0.299  |\n| CEA  | 130.79  |  | 22.89  | 0.005  | 3.76  | 0.019  |\n| ALT  | 1.87  | 0.155  | 0.21  | 0.663  | 1.92  | 0.147  |\n| AST  | 1.46  | 0.25  | 0.12  | 0.743  | 0.5  | 0.737  |\n| TC  | 58.02  | 0  | 43.38  | 0.001  | 7.18  | 0.014  |\n| TG  | 61.42  |  | 2.586  | 0.169  | 0.9  | 0.497  |\n| HDL  | 21.52  |  | 14.447  | 0.013  | 3.55  | 0.015  |\n| LDL  | 3.6  | 0.014  | 2.664  | 0.164  | 2.36  | 0.07  |\n\n【43】showed good symptoms. In general， the level of P(A-a)O，decreasing at least 10 mmHg was defined that the treatment would be clinically effective . In this study， the level of P(A-a)O， in the WLL group decreased 16.15 mmHg， while P(A-a)O， was decreased 26.36 mmHg in the XFZYD group. Interestingly， P(A-a)O， in the XFZYD group eventually returned to normal levels. Similarly，PaO。FVC% Pred and DLCO% Pred in the XFZYD group were tightlyhigher than that in the WLL group. In this study， we also used Image J software to estimate the effectiveness of the lungs and found that the XFZYD group is also more useful than the WLL group. All these data verify that XFZYD is more effective than WLL in the treatment of aPAP. LDH is a specific-marker for the evaluation of the PAP severity. According to previous reports， elevated LDH levels are associated with P(A-a)O。DLCO%Pred and FVC% Pred . In our study， the LDH concentration dropped significantly after WLL operation and had continuously maintained at a low level for 24 months. Study showed that CEA is negatively correlated with DLCO% Pred . Our study also measured the changing concentrations of CEA and NSE； the results indicated that both of CEA and NSF were apparently decreased after WLL or XFZYD treatment. In addition， the reduction of CEA and NSE in the XFZYD group was more pronounced than that in the WLL group from the third month. Therefore， we concluded that the XFZYD group can eliminate markers， including tumor markers and LDH， better than the WLL group. Study showed that the free cholesterol in fluid of bronchoalveolar lavage ofaPAP would increase about 60-fold and cholesterol esters also improve 24-fold . It is generally believed that the change of cholesterol is connected to the HDL-C concentration in blood . According to our present study， the XFZYD could reduce cholesterol levels (especially TC)， which could act the same treatment effect with the baking simvastatin . Corresponding， the level of HDL had increased significantly， which was the product of cholesterol decomposition. Therefore， we assumed that XFZYD could improve the therapeutic effect by promoting the degradation of alveolar cholesterol into HDL. Bedsides， other biochemical indexes including ALT level and AST level would maintain at a normal level， suggesting XFZYD with the favorable bio safety. In summary， XFZYD might be an effective strategy for the treatment of aPAP patients based on existing clinical data. But it requires more samples and more detailed pathological studies to explain the possible mechanism of XFZYD that was involved in this recovery process.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:40:46", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:41:14", "cost": 27.498}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:49", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:41:14", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:40:46"}

This review presents a case of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy， associated with use of Lenvatinib therapy for thyroid cancer. It discusses the necessary interventions and treatment are needed to successfully resolve the complications that occur. This case illustrates the importance of close monitoring of patients under TKI therapy in order to identify early signs of congestive heart failure or myocardium damage.\n\n【2】Keywords： Lenvatinib； Takotsubo syndrome； Thyroid cancer； Myocardial dysfunction\n\n【3】Abbreviations\n\n【4】VEGF： Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor； TKI： Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor； TC： Thyroid Cancer； WHO： World Health Organization； ESMO： European Society for Medical Oncologys RUSSCO： Russian Society of Clinical Oncology； VEGFR-TKIs： Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors； MTKIs： Multitarget Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors； CT：Computed Tomography； ECG： Electrocardiographic； LVEF： Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction； CMR： Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging； NT-proBNP： N-Terminal Prohormone of Brain Natriuretic Peptide； TS： Takotsubo Syndrome； ACEi： Angiotensin-Converting-Enzyme inhibitors Thyroid Cancer (TC) is the most common detectable forms of malignant neoplasms. According to WHO database， 586，202 new cases of TC were detected worldwide in 2020 that resulted in，43，646 deaths from this disease. TC is more prevalent in Asian countries that counts for 59.7% of all world annual cases . The incidence of TC in Russian Federation is 183，495 cases for 2020，1，205 cases per 100，000 population with mortality of 0.6% . The targeted therapy with Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) inhibitors as the treatment for unresectable locally advanced or metastatic papillary or follicular TC which is radioiodine resistant according to European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO)， National comprehensive cancer Network Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN) and Russian Society of Clinical Oncology (RUSSCO) guidelines. Moreover， Anti-VEGF therapy， is an effective method of treating a large number of solid tumors， including lung cancer， epithelial ovarian cancer， colorectal cancer and breast cancer . VEGF receptors have an extracellular portion consisting of 7 immunoglobulin-like domains， a single transmembrane spanning region， and an intracellular portion containing a split tyrosine-kinase domain . Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (VEGFR-TKIs) offer patients potential new treatment. Presently， four multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitors(comprising sorafenib， Lenvatinib， vandetanib， and cabozantinib) (MTKIs) are licensed as critical therapeutic options for the treatment of thyroid cancer， and have improved survival of patients in clinical trials and real-world studies . Thus， TKI are potent antitumor agents. However， their use have been associated with cardiotoxic events. TKI can cause hypertension ， venous thromboembolism ， myocardial dysfunction in 3% to 15% of patients and heart failure in 1% to 10% of patients . The case of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy following， using one of the VEGF-TKI drugs -Lenvatinib， in TC patient is presented.\n\n【5】Clinical Case\n\n【6】A 45-year-old female patient， with pT3N0M0 I TC. The disease was detected in 2008， afterward the right hemithyroidectomy was done， with following hormone replacement therapy. Follicular cancer was founded/In 2011- disease recurrence in the postoperative scar was revealed. The post-operative scar excision was performed， followed by thyroidectomy， radio-iodotherapy with the following suppressive hormonettherapy prescription. BBy histological examination recurrence of follicular cancer was founded in the removed thyroid gland.In 2019，11 years after the debut of TC， metastatic lung cancer was elicited.

In scintigraphy with iodine radioisotope， radiopharmaceutical accumulation wasn't detected. With the aim of tumor morphological verification， a marginal thoracoscopic resection of the lower left lung lobe was performed. As a result of the analysis， the clinical case was regarded as a progression of radioresistant thyroid cancer. Due to patient decision the start of treatment was delayed to October 2020. By CT scan just before treatment September 29h， 2020. Target lision：1.

The tolerability of the drug was satisfying. During the first year of medication， a 3d degree single episode intestinal toxicity was noted. Due to the ineffectiveness of dosage reduction， a temporary withdrawal of the drug was undertaken for 3 weeks. After elimination of intestinal toxicity， the drug was resumed at a reduced dose of 20mg/day. Subsequently， episodes of increased blood pressure at 145mmHg to 150 mmHg were observed， and consequently losartan wa prescribed at a 50 mg/day， the effect was positive. Every 2 to 3 months， thepatientunderwentan echocardiographic and Electrocardiographic(ECG) examination. T-wave inversion on ECG were noted In August2021 during regular screening  accompanying decreased control of arterial hypertension. Echocardiography revealed moderate hypokinesia of the apical segment of the interventricular septum， the apical anterolateral segment of the left ventricle with a slight decrease in Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) up to 52% (previous LVEF from 06. 2021 was 62%). Increase in NT-proBNP up to 680.0pg/ml was measured with normal troponin level. The patient denies any symptoms of chest pain or exercise intolerance. The existing changes occurred in the time window between the first days of June and the end of August 2021. Due to the low pre-test probability of coronary artery disease CT coronaryangiography was performed and excluded coronary artery disease or coronary anomalies . Cardiac Magnetic Resonance imaging (CMR) was performed with no late gadolinium enhancement patterns or myocardial edema . The Takotsubo Syndrome (TS) was mentioned as the cause. However， the patient denies physical or emotional stress during that period. Lenvatinib was the possible cause of T'S. However， the patient experienced TS during the timeframe of almost 2 months taking the drug and the drug benefit for cancer progression in her case was unquestionable. Thus， we decided to start cardioprotective treatment without withholding Lenvatinib. Treatment with ACEi fosinopril， beta-blocker metoprolol succinate， torasemide and amlodipine was initiated and resulted in good blood pressure control. A complete restoration of the kinetics of the left ventricle was revealed pursuant to the serial echocardiography and ECG within a month.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Takotsubo syndrome is a rare cardiotoxicity manifestation in Lenvatinib treating. The pathogenesis of stress cardiomyopathy is unclear， but animal studies demonstrate， that catecholamine surges during periods of physical or emotional stress can deteriorate cardiac dysfunction， either by causing vasoconstriction of the coronary vascular network， or by direct cytotoxic effects on cardiomyocytes. It was suggested takotsubo syndrome may develop due to catecholamine surges and stress associated with the process of undergoing treatment for malignant neoplasms. Furthermore， for some VEGF antagonists， such as pazopanib， it is possible to increase the response to catecholamines in some organs by modulating the effects of nitric oxide and catecholamines， while VEGF antagonists reduce the level of nitric oxide . Now，numerous studies describe cardiomyopathy development and myocardial dysfunction related to VEGF antagonist intake， although in some studies there was no mention of patients who had any Takotsubo syndrome specific signs.In one ofthese studies，when using Lenvatinib，cardiovascular damage was described in 7% of patients， compared with 2% in the placebo group in the third stage of the clinical trial. However， in this study there is no observations of takotsubo syndrome development. In 2018， Young Kwang Chae presented in their article a similar clinical case of a patient with thyroid cancer， who received targeted therapy with Lenvatinib， due to the medication acute cardiac insufficiency (Takotsubo syndrome) and Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome developed， because of that Lenvatinib was withdrew. The patient ultimately died under hospice-care one week later . In our case Lenvatinib treatment was continued together with ACEi and beta-blockers that resulted in compete resolution of TS.\n\n【9】Conclusion\n\n【10】Targeted therapy with VEGF antagonists is a highly effective method of treating advanced thyroid cancer. This drug therapy is relatively safe. The presented clinical observation describes the cardiotoxic development of takotsubo syndrome with reverse restoration of cardiac function in association with ACEI and beta-blocker therapy intake without Lenvatinib withdrawal.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:13:52", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:14:02", "cost": 9.953}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:49", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:02", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:13:52"}

Complications usually arise due to mechanical problems of the device and are traditionally investigated， nevertheless， other chest pain etiologies should be considered， as data regarding late complications like angina， are scarce and insufficient. We present the case of a 70 year-old woman with a closed ASD and coronary microvascular disease diagnosed during follow-up with gated Positron Emission Tomography(PET). Late complications associated with Amplatzer occluder devices are generally derived from a mechanical impairment of the device per se. The case presented opens the door for further research questions regarding microvascular complications arising from occluding devices.\n\n【2】Keywords： Atrial septal disease； Congenital heart disease； Amplatzer septal occlude； Angina； Chest pain； Microvascular disease\n\n【3】Learning Objectives\n\n【4】To understand the benefits of percutaneous approach versus a traditional surgical closure of atrial septal defects.\n\n【5】To properly assess chest pain during follow-up after an atrial septal defect closure.\n\n【6】To consider microvascular coronary disease as a common cause of angina in aged patients with diabetes and hypertension.\n\n【7】History ofPresentation\n\n【8】A 70-year-old woman presented to our Nuclear Cardiology Department for myocardial perfusion evaluation due to occasional chest pain from two months of onset and functional dyspnea class deterioration (NYHAII-III). She has a medical history of an ASD corrected four years ago with an Amplatzer device； Systemic Arterial Hypertension (SAH) and diabetes mellitus type II (DM II). She denied previous episodes of syncope of minimal effort dyspnea (NYHA III).\n\n【9】Physical Examination\n\n【10】Vital signs presented a heart rate of 75 bpm， a blood pressure of 114/78 mmHg， a respiratory rate of 15 rpm and an oxygen saturation of 93%. She did not present ankle edema， orthopnea or other clinical signs ofheart failure. Thoracic auscultation was unremarkable.\n\n【11】Differential Diagnosis\n\n【12】In adult patients with a corrected ASD， angina may present due to mechanical or functional alterations of the device. First， we aimed to rule out cardiac erosion or perforation， due to the high mortality it confers. Nevertheless， coronary artery disease ought to be considered in a patient this age and with a history of SAH and DM II.\n\n【13】Investigations\n\n【14】The patient had a resting ECG at admission with a sinus rhythm， heart rate of 75 bpm， QRS axis at 0°， and an ST depression in V6； without further relevant findings. A PET study with N13-Ammonia was performed revealing adequate perfusion in most segments ， only mild ischemia in the apex region， and a Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) reduction of 7% at stress. Afterward， coronary calcium score was calculated at 29.8 (CAC-RDS1)， with calcium mainly in the Left Anterior Descending (LAD) artery and Right Coronary Artery (RCA). Moreover， extra coronary calcium was observed， notably in the thoracic aorta (1029.8U) and the aortic valve (60.5 U). Coronary angiotomography revealed the presence of atheromatous lesions in the epicardial coronary arteries， one in the midsegment of the LAD artery， with a non-significant obstruction of 25% to 49% and two lesions in the union of the proximal and vertical segments of the RCA， both with an estimated obstruction of 25% to 49%. Additionally， the Amplatzer device was adequately observed in the interauricular septum . However， coronary blood flow quantification by PET demonstrated reduced myocardial blood flows and impaired myocardial flow reserve in all territories， with a global myocardial flow reserve of 1.57 . Thus， the patient was diagnosed with coronary microvascular disease， also known as microvascular angina.\n\n【15】Management\n\n【16】The patient was discharged with aspirin 100 mg qd， atorvastatin 60 mg daily and losartan 50 mg qd.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】Atrial Septal Defects (ASD) represent the most common Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) in adults， with a prevalence of 1 in every 1，500 live births， accounting for approximately 7% of all CHD.\n\n【19】Numerous adults are asymptomatic ； nonetheless， most patients will eventually develop symptoms ， such as exercise intolerance ， palpitations， and a soft systolic crescendo-decrescendo outflow tract murmur with a fixed split in S2 .\n\n【20】In the last decades， the percutaneous closure approach has gained popularity due to several advantages in comparison to the traditional surgical approach， such as the avoidance of a cardiopulmonary bypass， shorter hospitalization time， lower incidence of post-procedural complications and a lower cost . This has resulted in the manufacture of several devices， of which the Amplatzer Septal Occluder (ASO) is the most commonly used .\n\n【21】The percutaneous approach has a post-procedural complication risk of 7.2%， approximately a third of postoperative complications risk (24%) . Device thrombosis and cardiac erosion are the most important late complications， whereas atrial arrhythmias remain the most prevalent .\n\n【22】In the appearance of chest pain during follow-up after a transcatheter ASD closure， one of the main objectives is to discard cardiac erosion， which occurs with an incidence of 0.1% and is commonly related to a deficient aortic rim. Dibardino et al. demonstrated that cardiac erosion/perforation/rupture was the second most common adverse event (22.9%)， only after device embolization (51%). The importance of this phenomenon relies on a relatively high mortality， being the most frequent lethal complication.\n\n【23】Another uncommon cause of angina in patients with CHD is due to the compression of the left coronary artery between a dilated pulmonary artery and the aorta， in the context of Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). This phenomenon occurs in 5% to 10% of patients with CHD .\n\n【24】In this report， we describe the case of a patient who presented with angina 4 years after the percutaneous closure of an ASD. Device malposition was excluded through echocardiography. The absence of significant atheromatous plaques in the coronary arteries and a diminished coronary flow reserve at 1.57 pointed to the diagnosis of Coronary Microvascular Disease (CMD) related to an abnormality in microcirculation， thus resulting in an inadequate vasodilatory response and a deficient augmentation of blood flow by the microvasculature in response to stress . The prognostic significance of this association is still unclear. Hereupon， the consideration of CMD must be taken into account when evaluating patients with similar clinical characteristics.\n\n【25】Follow-up\n\n【26】The patient is yet to present at our clinic for a follow-up appointment.\n\n【27】Conclusion\n\n【28】Percutaneous closure of an ASD is a safe and effective procedure， reducing the burden of the traditional surgical approach. Despite its widespread acceptance， few data regarding the complications during follow-up are available. The presence of chest pain after the implantation of an ASO device has traditionally merited the characteristic finding of microvascular disease. investigation of the device.\n\n【29】Embolization and cardiac erosion. Nevertheless， it is important to consider additional causes， such as coronary microvascular disease， which has gained the attention of cardiologists in recent decades.

A 20 cases of renal failure patients of both sexes (9 females' and 11 males) (age range 23 to 71 years) were selected. Serum creatinine before and after the treatment were reported. Also， estimated Glomerular Filtration Rates (eGFR) were calculated.\n\n【3】Results： Mean serum creatinine levels after herbal treatment for all selected cases were decreased by(2.8±1.4) as compared to mean serum creatinine levels before the treatment (3.9±1.8). The majority of patients have been transmitted from advanced stages of CKD to lower stages based on eGFR.\n\n【4】Conclusion： The use of herbal and alternative therapies in CKD lead to a decrease of serum creatinine levels and to transition patients from advanced stages to another lower； which means that treatments enhance kidney function and decrease deterioration.\n\n【5】Keywords： Kidney function； Corn silk； Shatavari root； Boswellia； Gum olibanum； Royal jelly\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) still described as one of the leading public health issues globally， and it is characterized by progressive loss of kidney function . The nature of CKD is complex and progression will lead to the End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) which is critical in management. In addition， CKD is often asymptomatic until the disease reaches advanced stages； also patients in that stage already have one or more disease complications . Therefore， it is critical to implement a measurable successful strategy that can be taken for prevention and management of the disease before the progression to ESRD.\n\nUntil now， there are no specific therapies to treat CKD. Treatments used are mainly dialysis or kidney transplantation， and are used for symptomatic and replacing kidney function . Consequently， they must be done routinely， costly， and are not dissolve the problem. Therefore， alternative therapies are used to inhibit the progression of CKD； provide several effective therapeutic approaches to address the diverse pathologic conditions related to CKD， as it safe and not expensive|4.5.\n\n【9】Traditional and alternative medications comprise a variety of therapeutic approaches， including food habits and the use of herbs and minerals； additionally it may vary among countries . These approaches based on medicinal plants to forestall the need for hemodialysis， to reduce the adverse consequences of dialysis treatments ， and to beneficially relieve some of the associated symptoms of CKD comorbidities； such as muscle cramps， fatigue， depression and uremic bruising . The diuretic properties of these herbal medicines are useful for patients on hemodialysis and for pre-dialysis patients by stimulating their kidney function and delaying the need for dialysis .\n\n【10】The most common mechanism for herbal treatment is antioxidant defense system， as they are rich sources of antioxidants . Also， oxidative stress is the causative factor for a CKD\n\n【11】. Furthermore， herbs have anti-inflammatory effects ， diuresis， immunomodulation， reductionin proteinuria and stimulation of renal repair mechanisms in CKD patients . In the Middle East， many herbs were used to manage kidney diseases； specially kidney function， stones and inflammation such as corn silk(Zea mays L. Hair)， Paronychia arabica (paronychia)， Frankincense (Gum olibanum)， Asparagus racemosus roots and Royal Jelly.\n\n【12】Corn silk (Stigma maydisor Zea mays L. Hair) has been used for a long time as a treatment remedy for several illnesses and is vital as an alternative natural-based therapy . It has been used as a traditional medicine in China， Turkey， United States and France. Also， it has been used for the treatment of various Genito-urinary problems such as cystitis， edema， kidney stones， diuretic， prostate disorder and urinary infections . It soothes and relaxes the bladder and urinary tubules， hence increasing urine secretion and reducing irritation .\n\n【13】The Boswellia species (Frankincense) are trees located in India， Ethiopia， Somalia， and the Arabian Peninsula， and they producea gum better resin called Olibanum， which possesses anti-inflammatory， anti-arthritic， and analgesic properties . Boswellic acids are the major constituents on the Olibanum gum resin and there have anti-cancer and anti-ulcerous activities . Also， Rao et al. found that Boswel liaserrata has a protective effect against long-term diabetic complications specially kidney failure .\n\n【14】In addition， Gum olibanum has been used in Arabic medicine for acute renal failure and normalizes systolic and diastolic BP and heart rate. Moreover， it protects against renal failure progression， involves in antioxidant and/or anti-inflammatory activity， and it is using in drinking water normalizes plasma concentrations of urea and creatinine .\n\n【15】Furthermore， Asparagaceae family that has been known as an antioxidant， reducer blood lipid， anti-diabetic， antifungal， anti-hypertension and anti-carcinogenic medication in traditional medicine . Also， Asparagus may be effective to maintain renal normal function in diabetic patients . The root of Asparagus oficinalis is more diuretic than its shoot and it helps flush out the kidneys and help in the prevention ofthe formation of kidney stones. Asparagus racemosus root extract has a protective effect in renal injury in rats .\n\n【16】Royal Jelly (RJ) is also considered to have anti-inflammatory effects due to its possible antiradical and ant oxidative effects. It can have positive effects on both the prevention of urolithiasis and possible inflammation during the existing urolithiasis and support the medical treatment . RJ may be used in combination with cisplatin in chemotherapy to decrease cisplatin-induced oxidative stress parameters and decrease the injury of kidneys and liver . Also， pretreatment with RJ significantly reduced blood urea nitrogen， kidney malondi-aldehyde， creatinine， glomerular diameter and leukocyte infiltration ， and it may be effective to protect the kidney against I/R injury .\n\n【17】This study was conducted to investigate the effect of the treatment of a herbal mixture (which is composed of corn silk (Stigma maydis)， Paronychia arabica (paronychia)，Frankincense (Gum olibanum) and Asparagus racemosus roots (shatavari)) accompanied with Royal Jelly capsules on renal function assessed by serum creatinine level.\n\n【18】Cases Interpretation\n\n【19】This retrospective case series study was conducted by reference to computer patients files between 2015 and 2018 in Herbal Dynasty Medical Center，Amman，Jordan. A 20 cases of renal failure patients of both sexes (9 females'and 11 males) (age range 23 to 71 years) were selected. Serum creatinine before and after the treatment were reported. The consent of all patients attending the center is taken to use their medical results in scientific research. The study has been approved by Department of Clinical Nutrition and Dietetics Faculty of Science Philadelphia University， Amman， Jordan.\n\n【20】The selected treatment was traditional herbal mixture produced as tea bags (Approved by FDA Jordan). It was composed of corn silk (Stigma maydis)； Paronychia Arabica (paronychia)， Frankincense(Gum olibanum) and Asparagus racemosus roots (Shatavari) in equal amounts， each bag contains 3 g of herbal mixture. Herbal mixture was prescribed for patients by physicians with a specific dose of two tea bags daily soaking in a 150 ml cup of boiling water for 10min， half an hour before meals， with a RJ capsules (one capsule 1000mg daily before half an hour before meal) for 2 months. Patients were recommended to complete life-long treatment to be more comprehensive and creatinine to be normal.\n\n【21】Patients came to the clinic trying to avoid reaching the hemodialysis phase， and were followed up every two weeks； changes in creatinine levels were monitored. Under the supervision of doctors at the center. Moreover， an important recommendation was made during the treatment period regarding the diet； based on National Institute of Health (NIH)： NIDDK.\n\n【22】After the two-month deadline expires， patients whose kidneys function was not improved and there was no or bad response to the treatment， they were given the choice to continue the treatment or re rn to a nephrologist and start dialysis.\n\n【23】Data were analyzed using Microsoft office Excel (Windows 10). Means ± SD were calculated. Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate(eGFR) was calculated based on the following formula： eGFR=186×(Creatinine/88.4)1.154x(Age)0.203x(0.742 iffemale)×(1.210 if black). Then， patients were classifieds to different stages of renal failure(before and after) with reference to National Kidney Foundation， as followed： stage 1 CKD： eGFR 90 or Greater； stage 2 CKD： eGFR between 60 and 89；stage 3A CKD： eGFR between45 and 59； stage 3B CKD： eGFR between 30 and 44； stage 4 CKD： eGFR between 15 and29 and stage 5 CKD： eGFR Less than 15.\n\n【24】Results and Discussion\n\n【25】The mean age of the selected sample was 52.8 years as shown in Table 1. Serum creatinine levels after herbaltreatment for all selected cases were decreased by (2.8±1.4) as compared to creatinine levels before the treatment (3.9±1.8). The mean decrease of creatinine levels for all cases was 1.1±0.9 .\n\n【26】As shown in Table 2， 14 from 20 of participants were transitioned from advanced stage to another lower based on eGFR.\n\n【27】Due to the lack of treatment in conventional medical system for CKD， many patients turn to the complementary and alternative medicine， to help manage their disease and 1F prevent disease deterioration. Several herbals and alternative choices have been used worldwide. In Arab region they are using curcumin， black seed， Royal Jelly， corn silk (Stigma maydis)， Paronychia Arabica (paronychia)， Frankincense (Gum olibanum) and Asparagus racemosus roots (Shatavari).\n\n【28】Current study reported that selected herbal mixture accompanied\n\n【29】Table 1： The change in serum creatinine levels before/after herbal treatment\n\n| Cases  | Sex  | Age (years)  | Serum Creatinine before(mg/dL)  | Serum Creatinine after (mg/dL)  | The decrease of creatinine level  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | F  | 57  | 3.5  | 1.3  | 2.2  |\n| 2  | F  | 58  | 2.8  | 1.8  | 1.0  |\n| 3  | F  | 62  | 4.2  | 3.1.  |  |\n| 4  | F  | 49  | 4.8  |  | kidney1.Urol Nurs. 2005，25：.  |\n| 5  | F  | 23  | 6.9  | 5.2  | 1.7  |\n| 6  | F  | 60  | 3.8  | 3.2  | 0.6  |\n| 7  | F  | 42  | 2.3  | 1.9  | 0.4  |\n| 8  | F  | 47  | 6.4  | 4.5  | 1.9  |\n| 9  | F  | 56  | 1.7  | 1.3  | 0.4  |\n| 10  | M  | 71  | 7.0  | 4.0  | 3.0  |\n| 11  | M  | 47  | 3.2  | 2.9  | 0.3  |\n| 12  | M  | 50  | 1.4  | 1.0  | 0.4  |\n| 13  | M  | 40  | 6.3  | 6.0  | 0.3  |\n| 14  | M  | 53  | 6.4  | 4.0  | 2.4  |\n| 15  | M  | 55  | 1.5  | 1.2  | 0.3  |\n| 16  | M  | 52  | 3.8  | 2.3  | 1.5  |\n| 17  | M  | 63  | 4.1  | 3.4  | 0.7  |\n| 18  | M  | 42  | 3.8  | 3.6  | 0.2  |\n| 19  | M  | 62  | 1.8  | 1.5  | 0.3  |\n| 20  | M  | 67  | 3.0  | 2.2  | 0.8  |\n| Mean±SD  |  | 52.8±11.0  | 3.9±1.8  | 2.8±1.4  | 1.1±0.9  |\n\n【31】M： Male；F： Female； SD： Standard Deviation with Royal Jelly lead to an efficient decrease of serum creatinine levels in renal failure patients， and it may protect kidneys and enhance their function. However， the literature provides evidence for the role of natural whole products rather than single antioxidants or their combinations in preventing or managing kidney diseases .\n\n【32】In line with the current findings， several studies approved the role of RJ in protecting kidneys， decrease injury， decrease oxidative stress and decrease creatinine levels . Additionally， many herbs were used alone or in combination with other herbs as alternative solution for CKD， including the herbal mixture that was used in the current study. In details， Corn silk (Stigma maydis or Zea mays L. Hair) has been used for the treatment of various Genito-urinary problems such as cystitis， edema， kidney stones， diuretic， prostate disorder and urinary infections . Also， it has been found to sooth and relax the bladder and urinary tubules， increasing urine secretion and reducing irritation . While the Boswellia species(Frankincense) possesses anti-inflammatory， anti-arthritic， anti-cancer and analgesic properties ， Rao et al. found that Boswel liaserrata has a protective effect against kidney failure .\n\n【33】Moreover， Ali et al. found that Gum olibanum has protected kidneys against renal failure progression， involved in antioxidant and/OI anti-inflammatory activity， and it normalized plasma concentrations of urea and creatinine . Dehghan-Shahrezaand et al. approved that Asparagus may be effective to maintain renal normal function in diabetic patients . Also， the root of Asparagus officinalis/or racemosus was proved as diuretic and it help flushing out the kidneys and in the prevention of kidney stones formation， additionally it has a protective effect in renal injury in rats .\n\n【34】Table 2： The change in eGFR and CKD classification before/after alternative\n\n| Cases  | Sex  | Age (years)  | GFR before the treatment (ml/ min/m  | GFR after the treatment (ml/min/m+  | CKD stage changes  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | F  | 57  | 14  | 45  | 5 to 3A  |\n| 2  | F  | 58  | 18  | 31  | 4 to 3B  |\n| .3Effects  | Fot he  | 62  | 11  | 16  | 5 to 4  |\n| 4  | F  | 49  | 10  | 34  | 5 to 3B  |\n| 5  | F  | 23  | 8  | 11  | 5 to 5  |\n| 6  | F  | 60  | 13  | 16  | 5 to 4  |\n| 7  | F  | 42  | 25  | 31  | 4 to 3B  |\n| 8  | F  | 47  | 7  | 11  | 5 to 5  |\n| 9  | F  | 56  | 33  | 45  | 3B to 3A  |\n| 10  | M  | 71  | 8  | 16  | 5 to 4  |\n| 11  | M  | 47  | 22  | 25  | 4 to 4  |\n| 12  | M  | 50  | 57  | 84  | 3A to 2  |\n| 13  | M  | 40  | 11  | 11  | 5 to 5  |\n| 14  | M  | 53  | 10  | 17  | 5 to 4  |\n| 15  | M  | 55  | 52  | 67  | 3A to 2  |\n| 16  | M  | 52  | 18  | 32  | 4 to 3B  |\n| 17  | M  | 63  | 16  | 20  | 4 to 4  |\n| 18  | M  | 42  | 19  | 20  | 4 to 4  |\n| 19  | M  | 62  | 41  | 50  | 3B to 3A  |\n| 20  | M  | 67  | 22  | 32  | 4 to 3B  |\n\n【36】M： Male； F： Female： SD： Standard Deviation， eGFR： Glomerular Filtration Rate； CKD： Chronic Kidney Disease\n\n【37】Conclusion\n\n【38】The use of herbal and alternative therapies in CKD leads to a good result.

The proper diagnosis is likely to be missed if attention is concentrated only on the granulomas. Though diagnosis is possible through Hand E stains，accurate identification ofthe characteristic morphological features of this fungus is essential for proper diagnosis and treatment. Contrary to the usually held view， in this patient， unusuallylarge number of fungal elements with varying morphology is noticed in Hand E sections.\n\n【2】Keywords： Sporothrix； Fungal granuloma； Microabscesses\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Sporothrix schenckii is a rare dimorphic fungus； transmitted by direct inoculation as in gardeners handling rose plants， or farmers hauling hay etc or veterinarians treating pet animals . It starts as a small indurated lesion which ulcerated later and becomes discolored with extensive crusting and boils. Though reported also as disseminated disease， systemic involvement is rare. If extensive， due to much destruction locally it mimics a tumour as in the case under discussion . As it is likely to be mistaken clinically and pathologically， for many varied lesions with granulomatous features， it is imperative to diagnose it accurately and treat it effectively by simple means.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】The complaint for which this 35yr old woman sought consultation was for discolored nodular swelling of skin over the medial aspect of her left leg. According to her， it was chronic and slowly increasing in size， on examination， the margins are ill defined and the swelling was surrounded by oedematous discolored skin.\n\n【7】When it was excised surgically it measured 2.5 cm ×3.0 cm x2.0 cm in dimension. The lesion was soft， the upper margin was well defined while lower margin was deep seated and extended into underlying fat. The entire dermis was replaced by nodules of granulomas： many of which were coalascent. Necrotic abscesses were seen more deeply. Giant cells； a dominating feature in these nodules are large in size； larger than those seen in giant cell tumors. Epithelioid aggregates were区minimal. They were encircled by diffuse infiltrates of chronic inflammatory cells including many eosinophils. In the abscesses， as well as in giant cells numerous rounded spores， 2 u to 5 p in size could be seen； many of which exhibiting also budding forms or tear drop forms. Fractured asteroid bodies were noticed in a diffuse manner. Microabscesses were distributed as a part of granuloma or separately； Spores could be identified well in Hand E sections unusually and are confirmed by G.M.S. fungal stains.\n\n【8】The first clue as to the nature of this tumour is its granulomatous nature； mixed with microabscesses occurring as part of granulomas or separately as abscesses with necrosis. According to Laura Lamps  granulomatous inflammation can be divided into； (a) epithelioid granulomas with or without necrosis. (b) lipogranulomas， (c) microgranulomas， (d) fibrin ring granulomas as in Q fever (e) foamy macrophagic aggregated as in whipples (f) granulomas with prominent suppurative inflammation，(g) stelate abscesses associated with Palisading granulomas. It is obvious that in this patient the granulomas belong to (f) category as listed above and as emphasized by Chandler fulfilling all the essential features encountered in this fungal lesion . There is no lymphatic spread as in 25% of reported cases5 G.M.S fungal stain confirms the diagnosis； as it reveals the round or oval yeast forms， 2 to 4 microns in size， or budding or tear drop or cigar shaped features of this fungus better. They are localized usually in giant cells or extracellular. Mycelial forms are not seen in tissues； they are present only in culture. The extensive nature of the granulomas with abscesses involving even subcutancous fat may be related to lack of immunological resistance.

Liver transplantation is indicated in the hepatic multifocal and bilobar forms. In this article， we report the case of a 63-year old man who was diagnosed with Hepatic Epithelioid Hemangioendothelioma (HEHE) and treated by liver transplantation. However， the patient presented a rapid recurrence within 3 months.\n\n【2】Keywords： Liver； Recurrence； Hepatic epithelioid hemangioendothelioma； Transplantation\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】HEHE is a rare vascular neoplasm of intermediate malignant potential . It occurs in lung， spleen，brain，stomach and mostly in liver. Its incidence is very low. That is why there is no consensual therapeutic approach. Indeed， therapeutic options may include chemo or radiotherapy but also surgery. Liver transplantation can be indicated for unresectable cases with acceptable disease free survival . However， some cases of recurrent hepatic HEHE after liver transplantation have been reported in the literature. In this issue， we present a case of rapid recurrent HEHE in a 63-year-old man who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 63-year-old man with history of insulin-dependent diabetes was admitted with a 2-months history of right upper quadrant pain and 10 kg weight loss. On admission， physical examination was normal except tenderness in the right upper quadrant abdominal and hepatomegaly. Blood investigations revealed normal liver function. Abdominal ultrasound exam showed various round lesions all along theliver. An abdominal computed tomography scan was done and showed multiples lesions with low density and involving all the liver. These lesions are suggestive of liver metastases.\n\n【7】Fibroscopy of the stomach and colonoscopy were performed in search of the primary tumor. They were normal. Percutaneous liver biopsy was， therefore， done and the histology and immunohistochemistry concluded to HEHE. The diffusion of lesions classified this tumor as unresectable. The patient was transplanted with liver graft from cadaveric donor. A cross section of the explanted liver revealed poorly limited white area inside the liver parenchyma . Histologic examination showed wide infiltration by epithelioid cells that express endothelial markers as CD31 and CD34. These results confirmed the diagnostic of HEHE.\n\n【8】The post-operative period was uneventful. He was maintained on Tacrolimus with no evidence ofrejection. He presented 3 months later with abdominal pain and jaundice. Abdominal computed tomography showed multiple hepatic lesions with low attenuation .\n\n【9】Therefore， the biopsy was repeated and confirmed the recurrence of HEHE. He was started on palliative chemotherapy.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】HEHE is a rare tumor of vascular origin individualized in 1982 by Weiss and Enziger . Its incidence is less than 1 in 1 million . The epithelioid hemangioendothelioma occurs frequently in the liver， but can also touch other organs such as lungs，bones，brain，heart or retroperitoneum . It can be asymptomatic. However， the patient may present， as in our case， nonspecific pain in the right upper quadrant ofthe abdomen. Other symptoms as jaundice and hepatosplenomegaly may be found. In biology， there is no specific marker. Radiologically，HEHE appears as hypodense multifocal nodules on computed tomography. Differential diagnosis is that ofliver metastases.\n\n【12】Microscopically， the lesions have many similarities with hepatic hemangioma or angiosarcoma with a proliferation of neoplastic cells of appearance epithelioid， most often along sinusoids. Endothelial specific markers such as CD34， CD31， vimentin and factor VIII-related antigen are often present . Evolution without treatment is unpredictable and life expectancy can be long. Both therapeutic possibilities are hepatectomy and liver transplantation. Unique lesion can be treated by radical resection， with regular monitoring in order to ensure there is no recurrence in the remaining liver parenchyma. However， lesions may be multifocal and bilobar， as in our patient case. Liver transplant is， therefore， indicated . Liver may be from cadaveric donor or， rarely， from living donor (only 6 cases from living donor liver transplantation for HEHE are reported in the literature. Recurrence of HEHE after transplantation is possible and some cases were reported in the literature. Several factors are associated with this recurrence， such as the large tumor burden . Indeed， Among 110 patients undergoing liver transplantation for HEHE between 1987 and 2005， The United Network for Organ Sharing reported 12 patients who died of recurrent HEHE within 5 years.\n\n【13】The average time of recurrence is 49 months. The longest recurrence reported is up to 12 years after Liver transplantation  and the shortest recurrence is 3 months . Our case， therefore， is among the shortest recurrence of HEHE. There is no consensual treatment for recurrent HEHE. Palliative chemotherapy with agents targeted against vascular endothelial growth factor such as thalidomide is reported in the literature.\n\n【14】Conclusion\n\n【15】Recurrence of HEHE after liver transplantation is exceptional and unpredictable. All cases of recurrence should be reported and published in order to establish risk factors as well as the suitable management of these recurrent cases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:21:01", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:21:39", "cost": 38.145}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:49", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:21:39", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:21:01"}

Peripheral neuropathy is also commonly seen in clinical practice which may be also due to alcohol intake， long standing uncontrolled diabetes. In extremities numbness and sclerosis occur.\n\n【16】The most common and symptoms of GB syndrome are the weakness of the limbs associated with areflexia. One of the subtypes of the GB syndrome is Miller Fisher syndrome. It is a rarer variant of GB syndrome and usually presents with at least two of the following features： Ataxia， areflexia， and ophthalmoplegia. This disorder is treated by the immunoglobulin and plasma exchange. It is heterogeneous autoimmune disease. Autoantibodies are present against various antigens in peripheral nerves. The Miller Fisher Syndrome is commonly associated with the involvement of the lower cranial and facial nerves and does not usually involve motor weakness of limbs.

The common peroneal nerve is a peripheral nerve that arises from the sciatic nerve. Foot drop is the result of peroneal nerve palsy. This is commonly seen due to injury to the nerve at the level of the fibular neck. The mechanism of injury may be due to compression of the nerve from prolonged lying or direct injury.\n\n【2】Though rare， foot drop can be a manifestation of central nervous system pathology.

Presentation can vary from mild paresthesia and dysesthesia to debilitating pain often leading to dose reduction， delay or discontinuation of therapy. In clinical practice， a majority of these patients present with sensory symptoms. Motor and autonomic symptoms are less frequent and usually milder .\n\n【6】The common peroneal nerve is a peripheral nerve that arises from the sciatic nerve. Its branches provide motor innervation to the muscles responsible for dorsiflexion and eversion as well as sensory innervation of the skin over the upper lateral third of the foot. Foot drop is the result of peroneal nerve palsy. This is commonly seen due to injury to the nerve at the level of the fibular neck . The mechanism of injury may be due to compression of the nerve from prolonged lying or direct injury. Severe weight loss has also been hypothesized as a cause of peroneal nerve injury .\n\n【7】Though rare， foot drop can be a manifestation of central nervous system pathology . Cerebrovascular accidents and space occupying lesions involving the brain  or the spine  causing foot drop have been reported. Other rare causes include multiple sclerosis， hemorrhagic contusion from gunshot wound ， head trauma， neurocysticercosis  and brain abscess. Due to the involvement of the upper motor neurons of the parasagittal motor cortex， these patients tend to present with spastic foot drop， usually associated with other neurological signs such as hyperreflexia， clonus and a positive Babinski reflex . There are few mentions in the literature of foot drop related to neurotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. The motor neurons are protected from many chemotherapy drugs by the blood brain barrier， and therefore the likely mechanism of chemotherapy associated foot drop is byaxonal damage to the long peripheral motor neurons of the common perineal nerve.\n\n【8】Here we describe five cases of chemotherapy associated isolated peroneal nerve paresis resulting in foot drop after several cycles with platinum and/or taxanes. We postulate that chemotherapeutic agents contributed to peroneal nerve palsy in all the five cases. In all of these cases， no other plausible explanation was found for the foot drop. No clinically significant weight loss was reported in 4 out of the 5 cases and CNS disease was ruled out with imaging in 4 of the 5 cases. All patients who continued follow up showed complete recovery of motor function on discontinuation of offending agents and supportive treatment. To our knowledge， platinum and taxane induced isolated common peroneal neuropathy has not been widely reported.\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\n【10】A 49 year old female with no past medical history presented with long standing hematochezia in April， 2017. On colonoscopy she was found to have a moderately differentiated rectal adenocarcinoma， Microsatellite Stable (MSS)， KRAS mutated. Staging work up revealed a T3N0 tumor with no evidence of metastatic disease. She was started on neoadjuvant therapy with capecitabine 1000 mg/m²and concurrent radiation therapy for 5 weeks with no significant side effects. This was followed by low anterior resection with pathologic staging of the tumor： T3N1cM0. Adjuvant CAPOX (Capecitabine1000 mg/m，Oxaliplatin 130 mg/mevery 21 Day cycle) was initiated. After 4 cycles， Oxaliplatin was discontinued due to progressive sensory neuropathy and debilitating grade 3 motor neuropathy of the peroneal nerves resulting in foot drop on the left. Motor strength of the left ankle dorsiflexion was 3/5 and rest of the motor exam was normal with 5/5 strength. MRI of the Lumbosacral spine did not show any acute findings. Over the next 4 months since discontinuing oxaliplatin， her left ankle dorsiflexion motor strength improved to5/5.\n\n【11】An 85 year old male with a history of right sided colon cancer(T3N0M0) in 2010 treated with hemicolectomy and no adjuvant therapy presented with an elevated CEA of 205 ng/ml(Normal：0.0 ng/ml to 3.0 ng/ml) in 2016. This prompted investigation with imaging which showed colon cancer recurrence in the liver. He underwent segment 5，6 and 7 hepatic resection with pathology showing moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of colonic origin， MSS， KRAS mutated. This was followed by adjuvant FOLFOX(Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m， Leucovorin 400 mg/m， Fluorouracil 400mg/m， Fluorouracil 2400 mg/m²). After completing 5 cycles of chemotherapy he was admitted to the hospital with acute onset diarrhea，weakness and an episode of syncope associated with left foot pain and weakness. On exam， he was found to have a left sided foot drop with a motor strength of 3/5 in the L ankle dorsiflexors. Patient then completed remaining chemotherapy without oxaliplatin and with 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin. Patient initiated physical therapy and wore a brace. Over the next 6 months his left sided foot drop resolved.\n\n【12】A 54 year old male presented in March， 2017 with early satiety which prompted an Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). He was found to have a mass in the lesser curvature of the stomach with pathology showing signet ring cell carcinoma of the stomach； MSS. Imaging showed metastatic disease with peritoneal carcinomatosis. He received palliative chemotherapywith FOLFOX for three months， and underwent repeat imaging with progression of disease. He was at this time switched to combination paclitaxel with ramucirumab. Patient received seven cycles of paclitaxel (80 mg/m， Day of a 28 day cycle) when he was noted to have developed foot drop with a dorsiflexion motor strength of 3/5 bilaterally. Paclitaxel was discontinued and he underwent vigorous physical therapy with improvement in motor strength of the lower extremities over 4months.\n\n【13】A 77 year old man renal dysfunction presented in April， 2016with hemoptysis and dysphagia. An EGD revealed an obstructing mass in mid-esophagus 21 cm to 25 cm from incisors. He underwent endoscopic ultrasounds with esophageal stenting showing a T3N1tumor with pathology consistent with poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. PET/CT imaging showed hypermetabolic mediastinal nodes and hypermetabolic boney lesions in the thoracic spine， ribs and the scapula. He was started on single agent palliative paclitaxelat80 mg/m²(Day 1，8，15 of a 28 day cycle). He tolerated it well and carboplatin was added on cycle 3， following which he developed acute onset bilateral foot drop with a 3/5 motor strength of the dorsiflexion. Imaging of the spine did not show any space occupying lesion. The condition was so debilitating that he could not walk and was admitted to the hospital followed by rehab where he began to regain dorsiflexion strength upon discontinuation of the chemotherapy. However， his overall performance status was declining. He eventually completed external beam radiation therapy to the esophageal mass and was transitioned to hospice per his wishes.\n\n【14】A 75 year old man presented in October， 2018 with new onset severe dyspepsia associated with weight loss. EGD showed an ulcer of the gastric antrum and pathology was consistent with moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Staging scans showed mass extending into the serosa with no evidence of lymph node involvement. He was started on perioperative FLOT (Docetaxel 50 mg/m， Oxaliplatin85 mg/m’， Fluorouracil 2600 mg/m’every 14 Day Cycle) which he tolerated well. After completing 4 cycles， patient underwent distal gastrectomy with Billroth II reconstruction with partial resection of left lobe of liver due to local extension. Pathologically the tumor was staged as a T4bN0 moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma， MSS， HER2 negative with positive liver margin. He completed 4 more cycles of FLOT followed by chemoradiotherapy with Capecitabine1000 mg/m’in June 2018. Towards the end of his treatment， he was noted to have lost 25 lbs. of weight over 2 months. He developed L sided foot drop in June 2018 after completing treatment， with a motor strength of 3/5 associated with bilateral lower extremity numbness and tingling. His weakness showed gradual improvement with physical therapy over the next 2 months since discontinuing chemotherapy.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】The incidence of anti-cancer drug associated neurotoxicity remains unclear due to several confounding factors such as preexisting diabetes and nutritional deficiencies but estimated to be 52% to68% . Chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity tends to be dose dependent， cumulative and reversible though it may be persistent in a substantial proportion of patients. Taxanes and vinca alkaloids cause neurotoxicity by causing axonal damage (Axonopathy) to the large myelinated motor fibers whereas platinum accumulates in the dorsal root ganglion resulting in neuropathy. Motor nerves have the capacity for re-innervation of the muscle fibers， reflected clinically in the recovery of the patients'strength and function . Although peroneal nerve palsy incidence is not well described for many of the neurotoxic chemotherapy agents， a large body of literature confirms increased risk of neurotoxicity with increasing exposure to the neurotoxic drugs. Among the platinum compounds， Oxaliplatin is most commonly associated with neuropathy seen in 85% to 100%of the patients . Cold induced dysesthesia is the characteristic complaint seen in these patients and it tends to resolve within a few weeks to up to 3 months of discontinuation of therapy or may become permanent . The high incidence of CIPN in patients treated with Oxaliplatin is reflected in the results of the MOSAIC trial. A total of 2246 patients who had undergone curative resection for stage II or III colon cancer were randomized to receive FL alone or in combination with oxaliplatin for six months. During treatment，92% of patients on FOLFOX were noted to have neuropathy of any degree versus only 16% on the 5FU arm. At one month follow up， the prevalence of neuropathy in the FOLFOX group was down to 62%and further down to 41% at 6 months. At one year follow up， only 30%of these patients had persistent neuropathy. With increasing dose， this peripheral neuropathy can progress to more severe symptoms including continuous dysesthesia， burning， muscle cramping and jaw stiffness .\n\n【17】In 2017， the IDEA collaboration published a preplanned， pooled analysis of 6 clinical trials with over 12，800 patients， conducted concurrently to evaluate the non-inferiority of adjuvant therapy with either FOLFOX or CAPOX administered for 3 months， as compared with 6 months with the primary end point of DFS at 3 years. Though the study failed to meet its primary endpoint in its overall population， it did show that a shorter duration of adjuvant therapy was associated with significantly lower rates of neurotoxicity (16.6% with FOLFOX and 14.2% with CAPOX)than alonger duration (47.7% with FOLFOX and 44.9% with CAPOX)，independent of the chemotherapy regimen. This study illustrates the cumulative nature of CIPN with oxaliplatin.\n\n【18】IncontrastttOoxaliplatin， another platinum1compound cisplatin causes painful paresthesia or numbness in a stocking-glove distribution in 28% to 100% of patients . These symptoms last up to 6 months or longer and may become permanent. In one\n\n【19】Table 1： Summary of five patients presenting with foot drop secondary to treatment with platinum or taxane based chemotherapy.\n\n| Patient  | Age/Sex  | Diagnosis andStage  | Chemotherapy Regimen  | No. ofCyclesBeforeOnset  | Cumulative OnsetDose  | Treatment：Discontinuation Of Offending Agent Plus  | Resolution  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | 49/F  | Rectal AdenoT3N1cM0  | Neoadjuvant Capecitabine 1000 mg/m²+RT， Adjuvant Capecitabine 1000 mg/m²+ Oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 every 21 Day cycle  | 4  | Oxaliplatin 520mg/m²  | Physical Therapy  | 4 months  |\n| 2  | 85/M  | Colon AdenoTxNxM1  | mFOLFOX6 (Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m²+Leucovorin 400 mg/ m²+ Fluorouracil 400 mg/m² + Fluorouracil 2400 mg/m²)every 14 Day cycle.  | 5  | Oxaliplatin 425mg/m²  | Physical Therapy  | 6 months  |\n| 3  | 54/M  | Gastric- Signet ringTxNxM1  | FOLFOX for 6 cycles(Dose unknown) with POD，switched to Ramucirumab 8mg/kg+ Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2(Day 1，8， 15 of 28 day cycle)  | 7  | Paclitaxel 1680mg/m²  | Physical Therapy  | 4 months  |\n| 4  | 77/M  | Esophageal SCCT3N1M1  | Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2(Day1，8，15 of 28 day cycle)，Carboplatin AUC 6 added tocycle 3  | 3  | Paclitaxel 560 mg/m2  | N/A  | N/A  |\n| 5  | 75/M  | Gastric AdenoT4bNOM1  | Perioperative FLOT Docetaxel 50 mg/m²+Oxaliplatin 85 mg/m²+ Fluorouracil 2600 mg/m²every 14 Day Cycle) followedby Capecitabine 1000 mg/ m² +RT  | 8  | Oxaliplatin 685mg/m²  | Physical Therapy  | 2 months  |\n\n【21】Adeno： Adenocarcinoma； POD： Progression of Disease RT： Radiation Therapy； SCC： Squamous Cell Carcinoma retrospective study ，30% of patients continued to have worsening of symptoms after discontinuation of cisplatin. In another study，20% ofpatients continued tohave neuropathy 5 years after completing cisplatin based chemotherapy for testicular cancer. Carboplatin induced neuropathy is similar in presentation to cisplatin but usually milder. It is seen in 6% to 42% patients .\n\n【22】The taxanes also cause neuropathy clinically similar to cisplatin induced neuropathic symptoms. Paclitaxel is more neurotoxic and causes CIPN in 57% to 83% of patients， whereas docetaxel in 11%to64% . In 50% to 60% of patients， symptoms tend to resolve within3 months with or without residual symptoms . Nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-PTX) is a commonly used taxane in the treatment of breast cancer. Severalphases II/III randomized trials have reported a higher incidence of CIPN on nab-PTX compared to paclitaxel and docetaxel with an estimated incidence of 75% . CIPN associated with nab-PTX usually resolved rapidly within 3weeks to a month. Cabazitaxel， a relatively newer taxane used in the treatment of hormone refractory prostate cancer has been shows to be less neurotoxic compared to docetaxel with an incidence of11% to 12%.Other agents known to cause neuropathy include vinca alkaloids， Bortezomib，IMIDs and Ixabepilone.\n\n【23】Several cases of foot drop have been reported in the pediatric population after treatment with vincristine for acute lymphoblastic leukemia  with an estimated incidence of 5% to 10%. A single case of capecitabine associated foot drop has also been described. To our knowledge foot drop as a manifestation of peripheral neuropathy has been under reported in patients treated with platinum and taxane compounds.\n\n【24】Among the five patients presented in this series， patients 3.4 and3.5  were treated with both a platinum and a taxane and it is therefore difficult to implicate one agent as the cause of foot drop. Literature suggests a cumulative dose of 100 mg/m’ to 300 mg/m²of paclitaxel and 75 mg/m to 100 mg/m’ of docetaxel prior to onset of CIPN， whereas Oxaliplatin can cause CIPN at any dose， though it tends to be more persistent at a cumulative dose of 750 mg/m丫to800 mg/m. The cumulative onset dose for cisplatin is 300 mg/m²and800 mg/m² to 1600 mg/m’ for carboplatin . In the five patients presented ， the cumulative dose prior to developing foot drop was： Oxaliplatin 425 mg/m to 685 mg/m²， Paclitaxel 560 mg/m²to 1680 mg/m， Carboplatin 335 mg/m\" and Docetaxel 400 mg/m. Time to resolution of symptoms after discontinuation of neurotoxic chemotherapy ranged from 2 months to 6 months . Four of the five patients had CNS imaging to rule out other causes of peroneal nerve palsy. As clinicians become more aware of foot drop as a complication of neurotoxic chemotherapy and with the absence of other symptoms， perhaps there will be less need to perform expensive imaging tests in the work up of this chemotherapy adverse effect.\n\n【25】Treatments of chemotherapyinduced foot drop include decreasing dose and frequency of offending agent and at times， discontinuation may be necessary. The phase 3 MRC COIN trials  compared intermittent versus continuous oxaliplatin and 5FU combination chemotherapy for first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. Though it failed to show non-inferiority， it did show that grade 3or worse peripheral neuropathy was more frequent on continuous than on intermittent treatment (27% vs. 5%). An ankle-foot orthosis splint stabilizes the ankle in stance and helps clear toes in the swing， therefore preventing injury on ambulation and should be used until active movement has recovered . As described in the cases above， patients tend to recover full motor function on discontinuation of causative chemotherapeutic agent. Physical rehabilitation under the supervision of a physical therapist to include passive and active range of motion and muscle strengthening is also recommended to hasten recovery.\n\n【26】No study has specifically looked at pharmacotherapy for the treatment of motor neurotoxicity. In patients with associated sensory symptoms，atrial of duloxetine maybea reasonableoption. Duloxetine has been shown in a randomized， double-blind， placebo-controlled crossover trial of 231 patients to result in a greater reduction in pain compared to placebo among patients with painful chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy with a modest benefit . Two studies demonstrated safety and modest efficacy of venlafaxine for the management of CIPN secondary to taxanes and platinum . Other agents with mild-moderate activity for chemotherapy induced neuropathy symptoms include gabapentin， pregabalin， nortriptyline， desipramine . It is unclear if these agents will expedite the recovery of peroneal nerve palsy. None of these agents were used to treat the five patients in this series. In our opinion，pharmacotherapy should be reserved for patients in whom foot drop does not improve with supportive measures.\n\n【27】Currently there are1oo established therapies to prevent development of chemotherapy induced neuropathy. A total of 42randomized controlled trials have evaluated the efficacy of various pharmacological agents in the prevention of CIPN. These studies included anticonvulsants， antidepressants，vitamins，Iminerals， and other chemoprotectants. None of these agents are currently recommended for prevention of CIPN due to the paucity of high quality evidence . The only successful strategy to date has been to decrease the cumulative dose and duration of the offending chemotherapy as was seen on the IDEA trial  whenever oncologically indicated.\n\n【28】Conclusion\n\n【29】Foot drop is an underreported complication of taxane and platinum based chemotherapy. The motor neurons are protected by the blood brain barrier， and therefore the likely mechanism of foot drop is by axonal damage to the long peripheral motor neurons of the common perineal nerve. Treatment of foot drop includes discontinuation of the offending agent， ankle orthosis/brace to provide foot support as well as physical therapy. No effective strategies have been shown to prevent development of CIPN. Duloxetine or venlafaxine may be used in patients with associated neuropathic pain symptoms， though their efficacy in treating motor neuropathy remains to be evaluated in further studies. Clinicians should be aware of foot drop as a potential neurotoxic complication of platinum and taxane classes of chemotherapeutic agents. Further studies to prevent the development of chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity are warranted.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:35:04", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:37:10", "cost": 126.624}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:49", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:37:10", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:35:03"}

It is commonly found incidentally during surgery. We report a case who presented with acute appendicitis. We found secondary omental torsion with simultaneous acute appendicitis intraoperatively and proceeded with appendicectomy and partial omentectomy. Ultrasonography and Computed Tomography can detect omental torsion preoperatively and is beneficial especially when patients have vague presentations. Hence， imaging can assist in planning of surgical treatment options.\n\n【2】Keywords： Omental torsion； Acute appendicitis； Acute abdomen； Appendicectomy\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Omental torsion was first described by Eitel et al.  in 1899. It is a rare cause of acute abdomen which mimics other commoner diagnoses and is commonly found intraoperatively. Omental torsion can be divided into primary， without any intra-abdominal pathology， or secondary torsion which happens alongside with other pre-existing conditions .\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】We present a case of secondary omental torsion due to underlying acute appendicitis. This is a49 years old gentleman with no underlying illness， who presented with 3 days history of right iliac fossa pain. He did not have anorexia， nausea or vomiting and was afebrile. Physical examination revealed tenderness over right iliac fossa at Mc Burney's point with rebound tenderness. His white blood cell was 12.4 x10/L， urinalysis was normal and KUB radiograph did not show any stones. Alvarado score was 6/10. A diagnosis of acute appendicitis was made and we planned for open appendicectomy via Lanz’s incision. Intra-operatively， we found torsion ofthe right omentum (1080degree) which was gangrenous . The distal omentum was adhered to the appendix which was inflamed. We performed appendicectomy and partial omentectomy. He recovered well post-operatively and was discharged the next day. Histopathology examination confirmed the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Omental torsion is a rare cause ofacute abdomen which is difficult to diagnose. It usually occurs between the third to fifth decade and more commonly affects male compared to female with ratio of 2：1 . Primary omental torsion is unipolar where the proximal omentum is fixed and the other parts remain free . In contrast， secondary omental torsion has both fixed proximal and distal omentum hence termed bipolar . The causes of secondary omental torsion are cysts， tumours， hernias， adhesions or intra-abdominal inflammations as in this case . Omental torsions usually involved the distal right epiploic artery because the right side of the omentum is longer and thus more mobile and susceptible to torsion .\n\n【9】Clinical presentation of omental torsion is non-specific and depends on the causes and severity. The main symptom is sudden， localized right abdominal pain which intensify gradually . Therefore， it is often misdiagnosed as appendicitis， cholecystitis， Meckel's diverticulitis， salpingitis or torsion ovarian cyst . However， omental torsion is less associated with nausea， vomiting or anorexia as in our patient and the blood parameters are usually normal . In late presentation， patients can have peritonitis and raised septic parameters due to omental gangrene . That is why it is often found incidentally during surgery for acute abdomen.\n\n【10】Imaging is helpful in narrowing the differential diagnoses especially in equivocal cases. Ultrasonography may show a combination of hyperechoic，non-compressible mass withhypoechoic rim or a complex mass and intraperitoneal free fluid . Computed Tomography (CT) scan will be more specific. Findings include a well circumscribed or oval fatty mass with heterogeneous attenuation， containing strands of twisted blood vessels whirling around a central rod， the “whirl sign”.\n\n【11】In this case， no imaging was done as the patient was treated as acute appendicitis. However， he did not have typical symptoms of acute appendicitis such as migratory right iliac fossa pain， anorexia， nausea or vomiting. Nevertheless， his tenderness was at Mc Burney's point and rebound tenderness was present. He also had leukocytosis with neutrophils shifted to the left. Thesetotaled up to Alvarado score of six with possible diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Subsequently， we proceeded with surgery.\n\n【12】Surgical intervention with resection of non-viable omentum and correction of secondary pathology is the mainstay of treatment for omental torsion . However， if diagnosis is confirmed with CT scan， there is a role for laparoscopic approach and even conservative management with antibiotics and analgesia， where the omentum will undergo regression . Hence， imaging should be considered especially in patients who presented with right sided abdominal pain and vague symptoms or signs to make a clear diagnosis. We suggest that patients with right iliac fossa pain suspected of having acute appendicitis with Alvarado score below seven should have an imaging done to narrow down the diagnosis. If it showed omental torsion， then surgery can be planned properly such as type of open surgery incision， laparoscopic approach options and surgical instruments needed. Thus， imaging is certainly beneficial as surgeons can plan properly prior to surgery and patients can benefit from the advantages oflaparoscopic approach or smaller open surgical incision which has less morbidity. When radiological modality is not readily available， diagnostic laparoscopy will naturally be beneficial in the diagnosis and resection of omental torsion in the same setting.\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】Being a rare entity of acute abdomen， omental torsion is difficult to diagnose as it mimics other common pathologies. Hence， the diagnosis of omental torsion should always be considered when treating acute abdomen especially with non-specific right abdominal pain presentation. Further imaging such as abdominal CT scan or ultrasonography should be done in suspicious acute appendicitis with Alvarado score of below seven. Imaging can assist in treatment decision making and surgical planning preoperatively in omental torsion.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:11:01", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:12:19", "cost": 77.89}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:49", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:12:20", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:11:01"}

It is described as presence of gas within the kidney parenchyma and surrounding tissues. This rare condition is usually seen in diabetic women or immunocompromised patients. In this report， we describe four cases of emphysematous pyelonephritis， all of whom were managed by broad spectrum antibiotics and drainage. Our cases were in different clinical stages of the disease and all of them were discharged after two to three weeks without need for a major surgery to treat emphysematous pyelonephritis. Patients with kidney stone were referred to an endourologist for percutaneous nephrolithotomy after hospital discharge. We managed these four cases conservatively with aggressive medical treatment including good and rapid control of dehydration， high blood glucose level (in diabetic cases)， and hypoxia， sepsis， and kidney failure. All patients had a good treatment outcome. Thus， we believe that in most patients conservative therapy can replace nephrectomy to treat emphysematous pyelonephritis.\n\n【2】Keywords： Emphysematous pyelonephritis； Computed tomography； Percutaneous intervention\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Emphysematous Pyelonephritis (EPN) is a severe infection in which there is presence of gas within collecting system， kidney parenchyma or perinephric tissue . This condition is seen in diabetic women and immunocompromised people . Presence of urinary tract obstruction or urinary stone can be another predisposing factor . In this condition， urine culture is generally positive and the most common isolated organism is Escherichia coli .\n\n【5】It has different presentations from severe pyelonephritis to septic shock . Plain abdominal X-ray often shows mottled gas shadows over the affected kidney . Ultrasound imaging can show the obstruction， but it is less sensitive than Computed Tomography (CT) scan at showing kidney gas. So EPN’s standard diagnosis is abdominal CT scan， since it can show the presence of gas along with the width of kidney parenchymal demolition . The most famous staging model for EPN is demonstrated in Table 1 . In this report， we describe four cases of EPN in different clinical stages of the disease that were treated in our center in Kerman city， Iran .\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】Case 1\n\n【8】A 20 years old Afghan woman without any history of diabetic mellitus referred to our center. She had been suffering from right flank pain， fever and chills， nausea， vomiting， dysuria and hematuria for one week. She had a history of natural vaginal delivery 20 days before her referral with an uncomplicated pregnancy， but the baby had died. Physical examination confirmed that she was an ill appearing， dehydrated patient with 39°C temperature， 22 times per minute respiration rate， blood pressure of 90/60 mmHgand a pulse rate of 114 per minute. Her cardiac， respiratory and neurological examinations were normal. Her right costovertebral angle was tender. There was no organomegalies and her vaginal examination result was also normal.\n\n【9】Primary laboratory evaluation included complete blood count (hemoglobin 10.9 gr/dl， total leukocyte count 15300/cumm)， kidney function (blood urea 28， serum creatine 1 mg/dl)， random blood glucose (129 Mg/dl)， the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein (125 and above)， urinary analysis (many white blood cells and bacteria). Urine culture revealed Escherichia coli. Ultrasound imaging revealed an enlarged hydronephrotic right kidney with decrease of parenchymal echo and multiple posterior shadows suggesting the presence of a kidney stone. Ipsilateral ureter and the opposite kidney were also normal.\n\n【10】Table 1： Staging of emphysemataus pyelonephritis.\n\n| Class 1  | Gas was confined to the collecting system  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Class 2  | Gas was only confined to the kidney parenchyma  |\n| Class 3A  | Perinephric extension of gas or abscess  |\n| Class 3B  | Extension of gas beyand the Gerota fascia  |\n| Class 4  | Bilateral EPN or EPN in one kidnev  |\n\n【12】CT scan  showed moderate to severe hydronephrosis， multiple stones in the right pelvicalyceal system and a small amount of gas in the kidney parenchyma. Dimercaptosuccinic Acid (DMSA) scan showed non-homogenous cortical activity with decrease of parenchymal function in the right kidney and moderate decrease of parenchymal function in the left kidney (right kidney function 57.4%， left kidney function 42.6%).\n\n【13】So， we diagnosed that she had EPN. A nephrostomy tube was placed on her pelvicalyceal system for right kidney drainage. Intravenous fluid in the form of normal saline and empiric intravenous antibiotic in form of ceftriaxone， metronidazole and amikacin were administered to her. Because of persistent fever， hypotension and worsening kidney function， the antibiotic spectrum was broadened inthe form of imipenem/cilastatin (teina)， ciprofloxacin and vancomycin. Her leukocyte count decreased to 2，700/cumm and her fever was permanent after 15 days. Then intravenous granulocyte-colony stimulating factor was administrated and leukocyte count increased immediately. Her clinical condition began improving after20 days of treatment and abdominal CT scan revealed complete disappearance of EPN. Subsequently， administering parenteral antibiotic was stopped. She was discharge with oral antibiotics. She was referred to an endourologist for percutaneous nephrolithotripsy after one month.\n\n【14】Case 2\n\n【15】A 45 years old woman referred to our hospital. She had been suffering from low grade fevers and left flank pain for two weeks before referring to us. She was a known case of diabetic mellitus that was under treatment with oral medication. She had a previous history of open surgery because of a Staghorn stone of left kidney 10 years before her referral. She was ill looking， agitated and febrile at38.5°C. Her respiratory rate was 18 times per minute， heart rate 120bpm and blood pressure 130/90 mmHg.On systemic examination， her left kidney angle was tender. Severe swelling， erythema， and warm skin were noticeable in this side. Her cardiovascular and respiratory examination results were normal.\n\n【16】Primary laboratory evaluation included complete blood count(hemoglobin 9.5 g/dl， total leukocyte count 7，800/Cumm)， kidney function test (blood urea 25 mg/dl and serum creatinine 0.8 mg/dl)， random blood glucose (291 mg/dl)， arterial blood gas analysis (pH7.53， SaO， 83 %， PCO， 30 mmHg， PO， 41 mmHg and HCO， 25.1meq/l) and urinary analysis (many white blood cells， 6-8 red blood cells， few bacteria). Urine culture revealed Escherichia coli. Her blood culture was negative and liver enzyme and function tests were normal.\n\n【17】Ultrasound imaging showed left enlarged hydronephrotic kidney with normal parenchymal echo and multiple large kidney stones (Staghorn stone). Non-contrast abdominal CT scan  at her admission revealed gas in her left pelvicalyceal system and parenchyma， suggesting EPN. A subcutaneous collection size of 77mm x 45 mm was reported at costovertebral angle in both CT scan and ultrasound imaging. Her right kidney was normal. DMSA scan showed mild decrease of parenchymal function in left kidney (right kidney function 60%，left kidney function 40%).\n\n【18】It was diagnosed that she had EPN. She was managed with intravenous fluid in form of normal saline and insulin infusion to achieve euglycemia. Intravenous antibiotics， including ceftriaxone and metronidazole， were administered and amikacin was added to maintain appropriate gram negative coverage. Nephrostomy tube was placed on pelvicalyceal system for left kidney drainage and subcutaneous collection was drained percutaneously that included500 cc turbid liquid like pus.\n\n【19】After 48 hrs， urine culture was positive for gram negative rods Escherichia coli that were sensitive to ciprofloxacin and imipenem. So， intravenous antibiotics changed to imipenem and ciprofloxacin.\n\n【20】Her temperature on the 6h day was 37.5°C and she had better clinical conditions. Her blood sugar was controlled with insulin administration. Abdominal CT scan on the 104 day revealed significant improvement in the size and extent of EPN and subcutaneous gas collection. The patient made a remarkable recovery after two weeks. She started to use oral antibiotics (levofloxacin and metronidazole) and her parenteral antibiotic were stopped. She was discharged at the end of three weeks with an administration of oral antibiotics， oral diet and two dosages of premixed insulin. She was referred to an endourologist for percutaneous nephrolithotripsy after one month.\n\n【21】Case 3\n\n【22】She was a non-diabetic 67 years old woman who referred to our center with fever， chills and bilateral flank pain. She had been suffering for more than 10 days. She looked ill and dehydrated with38.7°C temperature， 22 times per minute respiratory rate， 80/50mmHg blood pressure and 112 times per minute pulse rate. Herinitial laboratory evaluation included complete blood count (hemoglobin11.4 g/dl， total leukocyte count 9200/Cumm)， kidney function test(blood urea 90 mg/dl and serum creatinine 4 mg/dl)， random blood glucose (100 mg/dl) and urinary analysis (many white blood cells， 20-25 red blood cells， many bacteria). Her blood culture was negative (U/C Escherichia coli).\n\n【23】Table 2： Demagraphic and clinical characteristics of aur patients.\n\n| Kidney Side  | Class  | Other Features  | Intervention  | Outcome  | Kidney Function (%)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Right  | 2  | Kidney stone， hydronephrosis， diabetes mellitus  | Antibiotics， control ofdiabetes， nephrostomy  | Recovered  | Right 57%； Left 43%  |\n| Left  | 3A  | Kidney stone， hydronepnhrosis， perinephric collection， diabetesmellitus  | Antibiotics， control ofdiabetes， drainage ofabscess， nephrostomy  | Recovered  | Right 60%； Left 40%  |\n| Both  | 4  | Kidney stone， hydronephrosis  | Antibiotics  | Recovered  |  |\n| Transplanted kidney  | 1  | Kidney transplantation  | Antibiotics  | Recovered  |  |\n\n【25】She underwent abdominal and pelvic CT scan  without contrast. There was gas in her right kidney parenchyma， plus one small bubble of gas in her left kidney. She stayed in the hospital. Her urine output was about four liters immediately after insertion of Foley catheter. Intravenous antibiotic therapy with imipenem (500 mg stat and 250 twice daily) and ciprofloxacin (400 mg stat and 200 mg twice daily) was administered. She was chosen for nephrostomy. However， due to the improvement of symptoms and imaging evidence after antibiotic therapy， it was unnecessary and not done. In the course of treatment her creatinine fell from 4 to 1.7.\n\n【26】Severe uterine prolapse was detected in her vaginal exam and she was referred for hysterectomy to improve obstructive urinary symptoms.\n\n【27】Case 4\n\n【28】A 71 years old woman referred to our hospital with chills， fever， and right flank area pain. She had been suffering for five days before admission. There were no symptoms of dysuria and frequency. She had a history of diabetes and hypertension eight years before her referral to us. Also， she had done kidney transplantation due to kidney failure five years before her referral.\n\n【29】She had a low grade fever (37.8°C)，140/90 mmHg blood pressure，68 bpm heart rate and 16 times per minute respiratory rate. The patient was good looking and her systematic physical examination result was completely normal. Initial laboratory evaluation included complete blood count (hemoglobin 11.4 mg/dl， total leukocyte count 3800/Cumm)， kidney function test (blood urea 47 mg/dl and serum creatinine 1.44 mg/dl)， random blood glucose (198 mg/dl)， and urinary analysis (many white blood cells， red blood cells， and bacteria). Her blood culture was negative and urine culture revealed Escherichia coli.\n\n【30】Ultrasound imaging showed moderate hydronephrosis of the transplanted kidney but there were no gas collection. CT scan  demonstrated a small amount of gas formation in her pelvicalyceal system but the kidney parenchyma was completely intact. She was treated with antibiotics (imipenem and vancomycin) and Foley catheter insertion alone.\n\n【31】Discussion\n\n【32】EPN is apotentiallylifethreatening condition which was explained by Kelly and MacCallum in 1898 . It has an unclear pathogenesis but the gas producing bacteria， urinary tract obstruction， kidney stones， diabetes mellitus， insufficient tissue perfusion， alcohol and substance abuse， and neuropathic bladders are its risk factors .\n\n【33】Many EPN patients have diabetes mellitus . Some others have urinary tract obstruction and kidney stone with or without diabetes mellitus. In our study， case 1 had multiple enlarged kidney stones in her right kidney and case 2 had Staghorn kidney stones in her left kidney. Case 3 had a lower urinary tract obstruction. There was a history ofhydronephrosis and hydroureter ofright (case 1)， left (case 2) or bilateral (case 3) kidneys. A patient had a previous history of kidney transplantation as a predisposing factor of EPN .\n\n【34】We managed our four EPN cases conservatively with aggressive medical treatment containing good and rapid control of dehydration， glucose (diabetic cases)， hypoxia， sepsis and kidney failure， acid base balance， and minimally invasive surgical intervention if needed. The patients had favorable outcomes.\n\n【35】Conclusion\n\n【36】We believe that in most patients conservative therapy can be used instead of nephrectomy to treat emphysematous pyelonephritis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:09:22", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:09:42", "cost": 20.455}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:49", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:09:42", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:09:21"}

The sound is described as a painless loud bang， an explosion， or a bomb . It is classified as a type of parasomnia in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) 3 edition and its pathophysiology is still unclear . Armstrong-Jones first described it in 1920 . Pearce coined the term exploding head syndrome in 1989 in a paper in which he described 40 patients with EHS \n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】We report this 60 years old lady known to have hypertension and dyslipidemia who presented complaining of poor quality of sleep for 2 years. Her sleep schedule was suggestive of a total sleep time of 7 h per night with usually a regular sleep-wake schedule. Her sleep environment and habits of sleep were not suggestive of anything to cause sleep disruption. She had history of snoring but no symptoms of restless leg syndrome or insomnia. She has no excessive daytime sleepiness (Epworth sleepiness scale was 4/24) and no symptoms to suggest an underlying neurological， psychiatric or medical disorders.\n\n【6】She reports episodes of waking up at night with a loud sound in her head， which she could not describe. The best description she was able to provide was “a loud sound as if blood is gushing through my head\". It lasts for minutes and resolves spontaneously. It causes frequent awakenings at night and sometimes she could not go to sleep. It was causing significant distress.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Exploding Head Syndrome (EHS) is characterized by the perception of a sudden loud noise in the head as the patient is falling asleep or awakening from sleep . The sound is described as a painless loud bang， an explosion， or a bomb exploding but can be a less alarming sound . Occasionally； it is accompanied by the sensation of a flash of light.\n\n【9】Although these attacks themselves are usually not painful， it is reported that EHS attacks may precede migraine as auras. EHS is classified as a type of parasomnia in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD) 3 edition and its pathophysiology is still unclear . It was first described by Armstrong-Jones in 1920. The term exploding head syndrome was coined by Pearce in 1989 in a paper in which he described 40 patients with EHS . It is thought to be a migrainous phenomenon . There have been different descriptions of the noise which include the sound of an explosion， gunshot， door slamming， roar， waves crashingagainst rocks， loud voices， a ringing noise， a terrific bang on a tin tray， or the sound of an electrical buzzing. In some cases， an instant flash of what is perceived as video ‘static is reported both audibly and visually for a fraction of a second . It arises from the transition between different sleep stages and disappears completely when awake， although it may recur on further sleep attempts . There is no actual dW headache or persistent pain， but some patients may experience a brief， mild jab-like sensation.\n\n【10】Although EHS has been reported in patients as young as 10 years， the age of onset is usually after age 50 and the condition has a slight female preponderance. The attacks occur with variable frequency for a few weeks or months. Attacks can be one-time events or can recur with attacks increasing or decreasing over time， sometimes with no incidents over long periods of time . The cause of EHS is unknown；however some possibilities include a sudden movement of a middle ear component or the Eustachian tube， or a brief temporal lobe complex partial seizure . It may be related to emotional tenseness， as some patients report a stressful life situation in periods when attacks were intense and frequent . There have been reports that the events might occur during stage N1 and N2 and maybe proceeded by respiratory events 4.\n\n【11】It is thought to be a benign phenomenon and reassurance is usually needed. Pharmacological options include calcium channel blockers like nifedipine  or flunarizine ， topiramate  and clomipramine. All have been found to be effective in reducing the frequency or resolution of the EHS symptoms.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 15:08:33", "endTime": "2024/09/20 15:11:59", "cost": 205.827}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:49", "update_time": "2024-09-19 23:11:59", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 23:08:33"}

About 2/3 of patients with solitary bone plasmacytoma will develop multiple myeloma at some point in life.

Like other vertebral masses， solitary plasmacytomas give rise to spinal cord compression， which causes irritative symptoms and deficits. With this case， our objective was to report a rare case of solitary plasmacytoma intraosseous with neurological manifestations neurological for medullary compression.\n\n【2】Keywords： Plasmacytoma； Monoclonal gammopathy； Medullary compression\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Plasma cell neoplasia may present as an isolated lesion (plasmacytoma) or multiple lesions(multiple myeloma) and is characterized by irreversible proliferation of a plasmocyte clone producing a monoclonal immunoglobulin . Solitary plasmacytoma is a relatively uncommon tumor that， unlike multiple myeloma， has a single proliferative clone of monoclonal plasma cells. It may be extraosseous or intraosseous. Extramedullary plasmacytoma can be found in the airways， oral cavity， gastroenterology， lymphatic system， spleen， vagina， pancreas， parotid gland， thyroid， testis， or breast. The most common site of solitary plasmacytoma is in the spine (50% of cases) . We report here a case of solitary spinal plasmacytoma with disabling neurological manifestations in which the diagnosis was made with blood electrophoresis correlated with bone biopsy and imaging.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 65-year-old woman admitted to the inpatient care facility for 4 months with sudden onset low back pain after physical exertion， with worsening low back pain from right lower limb radiating pain accompanied by paresthesia and disabling gait that improves with the supine position. On neurological examination， she was sensitive， attentive， oriented in time and space. Grade 4 muscle strength in the lower limbs and normal in the upper limbs. Deep and normal upper limb reflexes in lower limbs. Deep hypoesthesia with S1 level. Impaired balance and motor coordination in upper limbs， normal motor coordination in upper limbs， and cranial nerve semiology， including fundus without abnormalities. No stiff neck or other signs of meningeal irritation. During the course of the exams， he underwent a sacred lumbar spine CT scan that revealed “an aggressive behavioral lesion occupying soft tissue space eroding S1s body， extending to the left， with 71 mm x 44 mm largest lateral by longitudinal diameter 40 mm larger anterior-posterior diameter， extending to the anterior epidural space， with compression of the sacred roots in the sacred canal associated with partial collapse of the vertebral body S1， related to said osteolytic lesion”. By presenting signs of spinal cord compression due to aggressive single behavior injury， he initiates therapy with dexamethasone 12 mg IV at an initial dose， followed by 4 mg 8/8 h.\n\n【7】There were no abnormalities to be highlighted in the laboratory； notably， anemia and changes in renal or ionic function were absent. In the course of inpatient analysis， protein electrophoresis revealed an IgG Kappa monoconal gammopathy (Kappa Chains 906.2 mg/L) confirmed by immunofixation. The patient underwent bone biopsy and a myelogram that confirmed the presence ofsolid， reticular pattern neoplasia consisting of CD138 and CD56 positive monotonic small cells. In the study of immunoglobulin light chains， the restriction of kappa chains resulted in morphological findings compatible with plasmacytoma. In view of this result， he initiated antalgic radiotherapy(8 sessions of 50 cGy) to improve the motor and sensory deficit due to spinal cord compression associated with bortezomib 2.1 mg SC. A regular two-year follow-up showed the constant absence of neurological signs and symptoms and alaboratory response.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】A solitary bone plasmacytoma is rare tumor， representing 3% to 7% of myelomas. Its differential anterior-posterior diameter， extending to the anterior epidural space (A/B)， with compression of the sacred roots in the sacred canal associated with partial collapse of the vertebral body S1， related to said osteolytic lesion (C). diagnosis is mainly made with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma . No more than 5% of patients with plasmacytoma have a solitary bone plasmacytoma. This diagnosis requires criteria ranging from a single area of bone destruction by a plasma cell clone， such as bone marrow with no evidence of plasma cell proliferation， normal findings of other bone sites， the absence of anemia， hypercalcemia， or renal dysfunction attributed to myeloma . About 2/3 of patients with solitary bone plasmacytoma will develop multiple myeloma at some point in life， at different times of progression， and may occur even long after plasmacytoma treatment .\n\n【10】The initial age ranges from 33 to 70 years， with an average of46， lower than that of multiple myeloma (59 years). According to published evidence， 2% to 10% of multiple myeloma cases show the typical clinical signs and symptoms of solitary plasmacytoma， and some authors believe that solitary myeloma is simply the first location of a progressing plasma cellular neoplasm， natural for the spread， and then for multiple myeloma. Although the clinical course of multiple myeloma is usually rapid and fatal， patients with plasmacytoma may have a 10-year survival rate of 68%， despite possible disease progression . The following criteria must be met for the diagnosis of solitary plasmacytoma： 1. Presence of a solitary bone tumor.\n\n【11】2. Biopsy showing plasma cell histology.\n\n【12】3. Absence of myeloma cells on bone marrow examination.\n\n【13】4. Absence of anemia， hypercalcemia or renal impairment.\n\n【14】5. Absence of monoclonal component or low monoclonal component in serum electrophoresis， and 6. Normal1immunoglobulin levelsafter surgical Or radiotherapy treatment . The diagnosis of solitary myeloma cannot be made with absolute certainty， as it must be distinguished from multiple occult myelomas and must be confirmed by foll ow-up. Solitary spinal plasmacytomas are usually found in the thoracic and lumbar spines and， more rarely， at cervical levels. Like other vertebral masses， solitary plasmacytomas give rise to spinal cord compression， which causes irritative symptoms and deficits. Irritative symptoms are pain (root， if nuclear and vertebral) and paresthesias； deficits are motor (due to a peripheral neuron or pyramidal tract injury) and， more rarely， sensory.\n\n【15】The clinical case presented here begins with symptoms of a relapsing-remitting course that worsened with a disabling neurological symptom progression associated with somatic pain. It manifested by low back pain that was refractory to medical treatment， perhaps due to the slow growth of the neoplastic mass and compensatory characteristics of the spinal cord at the lumbar level.

Deep veinthrombosis， pulmonary embolism and cerebrovascular thromboembolism represent the most frequent clinical manifestations while adrenal vessels are very rarely involved.\n\n【2】Here we describe the case of a young male with primary APS who developed acute adrenal failure due to bilateral hemorrhage and we underline that full anticoagulation is the therapy of choice in patients with bleeding and high thrombophilic profile\n\n【3】Case Presentation\n\n【4】A 23 year old man (Kg 80) with primary antiphospholipid syndrome and a past history of pulmonary embolism was admitted to the Emergency Department due to severe chest and flank pain in the right side. He had been treated with warfarin for five years， and then warfarin was interrupted and replaced with enoxaparin 120 mg die for a dental extraction. After the extraction the patient stopped enoxaparin and the day after he should have resumed warfarin，but in the afternoon he felt ill and went to the Hospital. He didn't understand that he should have taken enoxaparin and warfarin together for some days.\n\n【5】At admission a thorax CT scan was negative for pulmonary embolism and an abdomen ultrasound showed a mild edema of the perirenal right fat. Due to the severe pain， a CT scan of the abdomen was performed and the enlargement of the right adrenal gland with signs of recent bleeding was evident .\n\n【6】Enoxaparin was stopped and pain relieftherapy with opiates was started.\n\n【7】Four days later hypotension (100/70 mmHg)， hypoglycemia (70 mmHg) and severe pain in the left side appeared and a drop in the hemoglobin levels was noted (from 14 g/dl to 12.5 g/dl). A second CT scan showed a new onset adrenal hemorrhage in the left side ， so enoxaparin therapy- 160 mg die- was immediately restarted. Laboratory investigations confirmed the presence of lupus anticoagulant and high titres of IgG anticardiolipin antibodies (1375 U/ml) and IgG anti beta 2 glycoprotein I (6100U/ml). C3 and C4 levels were normal and test for antinuclear antibodies was negative. Blood cultures and procalcitonin resulted negative as well. After three days from resumption of anticoagulants， CT scan was repeated and the bilateral adrenal gland enlargement appeared unchanged.\n\n【8】After the first hemorrhage cortisol level was 7.4 microgram/dl (n.v. 4.3 ug/dl to 22.4 ug/dl)， but dropped to 1 microgram/dl after the second bleeding despite the beginning of cortone acetate therapy. In the following days abdominal pain disappeared and the patient felt progressively better without other signs of adrenal failure. He was discharge with cortone acetate and warfarin and he was advised to keep INR between 2.5 and 3.5.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】The most common causes of primary adrenal failure is the autoimmune destruction of the glands， infections， especially tuberculosis in the past， metastatic cancer， adrenal hemorrhage， infarct and medications. Conditions associated with hypercoagulation rarely cause adrenal failure and， in particular， the APS accounts for <0.5% of Addison disease. On the other hand adrenal failure represents the most common endocrinologic manifestation of APS， is more common in males(55%) and appears as the first manifestation of APS in 36% of cases. APS is considered if at least one clinical criteria， arterial and/or veinthrombosis and pregnancy morbidity， and at least one of the laboratory criteria， such as the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) on two or more occasions at least 12 weeks apart， are fulfilled . aPL are directed against phospholipid-binding proteins and those included in the classification criteria of APS are Lupus Anticoagulant (LAC)， anticardiolipin antibodies (IgG or IgM) and anti-beta 2-glycoprotein I antibodies(IgG or IgM).\n\n【11】APS can be an isolated disorder (primary APS) or can be accompanied by other autoimmune diseases， especially systemic lupus erythematosus (secondary APS) .\n\n【12】The majority of post-mortem studies indicate that the most frequent pathogenetic mechanism of bleeding is a thrombosis-mediated adrenal venous occlusion with subsequent edema of the gland， secondary obstruction of the arterial supply and hemorrhagic infarction . Adrenal gland has a particular vascular anatomy with a high flow arterial network and a single vein for drainage， so this feature may predispone to venous thrombosis and secondary bleeding.\n\n【13】More rarely histopathology reports demonstrated spontaneous adrenal hemorrhage without vessel thrombosis， especially in patients undergoing surgery or are receiving anticoagulation .\n\n【14】In the case described here the first bleeding occurred the day after the patient had stopped enoxaparin. Even if not in full dosage， we initially suspected a spontaneous bleeding， maybe due to a minor trauma， and we stopped enoxaparin also taking into account that there weren't thrombi in other sites.\n\n【15】But when the bleeding of the contralateral adrenal gland was evident in the second TC scan， we thought that the underlying mechanism of bleeding was another， thrombosis-related， and were started enoxaparin at full dosage.\n\n【16】Pain improvement and a CT scan after few days confirmed that therapy was right.\n\n【17】There wasn’t enough time to organize an arteriography or a biopsy to confirm the suspect of thrombosis-related bleeding because the patient was ill and the other gland had been already damaged. So， despite some doubts raised from the CT images were started enoxaparin 160 mg die. We didn’t think to an immune-mediated adrenalitis because ANA was negative and the patients didn't present signs and/or symptoms of autoimmune diseases different from APS.\n\n【18】In conclusion， even if very rarely， APS can cause adrenal failure due to bilateral thrombosis-related hemorrhage and， despite the evidence of bleeding， just clinical suspicion makes anticoagulants the therapy of choice in patients with so high thrombophilic profile.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:10:28", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:11:56", "cost": 87.953}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:49", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:11:55", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:10:27"}

A year later， the patient underwent Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) and biological mitral valve implantation due to multivessel coronary disease accompanied by severe mitral regurgitation. In both patients， Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE) showed massive thrombosis in the left atrium.\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Poland\n\n【6】Left Atrial Appendage Closure (LAAC) is a widely used method of preventing stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation who are contraindicated in anticoagulation therapy . Thrombotic events following LAAC are relatively rare. According to recent studies， Device-Related Thrombosis (DRT) is estimated to account for 1.6% to 16%. A similar situation applies to DRT after percutaneous closure of the Atrial Septal Defect (ASD). According to recent Meta-analyzes， DRT is estimated at1% . In the study below， we present two clinical cases of patients after valvular intervention and percutaneous implantation of an additional device into the left atrium.\n\n【7】The first patient is a 68-year-old male， admitted to the Department of Cardiology due to NSTEMI. The patient's medical history includes myocardial infarction with ST segment elevation3 years ago， treated with coronary angioplasty with Drug Eluting Stent implantation (DES). Additionally， the patient suffered from paroxysmal atrial fibrillation， type 2 diabetes， hypertension， obesity and ulcerative colitis. Due to the presence of significant primary mitral regurgitation， the patient underwent biological mitral prosthesis implantation 3 years ago. One year after cardiac surgery， due to the presence of contraindications to the use of anticoagulants (recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding of unknown etiology)， the patient had left atrial appendage closure using the Amplatzer occluder. The coronary angiography showed a multivessel disease. The TTE showed elevated gradients through the mitral bioprosthesis (PG max 30 mmHg， PG mean 14 mmHg). Additional echostructure was visualized， suggesting the presence of a thrombus in the left atrium. Transesophageal Echocardiogram (TEE) confirmed the presence of a massive thrombus with the largest thickness of 30 mm attached to the implanted occluder.PG mean was assessed at 13 mmHg with normal mobility of the bioprosthesis cusps. Additional parameters such as： EOA (Effective Orifice Area)-1.6cm andEOAi-0.75cm/m'prompted us to suspect Prosthesis-Patient Mismatch(PPM) Figure.\n\n【8】The second patient is an 80-year-old man with a medical history of permanent atrial fibrillation， hypertension， bladder cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Eight years ago， the patient underwent percutaneous closure of ASD II with the Amplatzer occluder. A year later， the patient underwent CABG due to multivessel coronary disease， during which a biological mitral valve was implanted due to severe secondary mitral regurgitation. Patient on chronic warfarin therapy with labile International Normalized Ratio (INR) values due to poor adherence. Currently， the patient has been admitted to the Department of Cardiology due to exacerbation of chronic heart failure. TTE showed a reduced ejection fraction up to 30% and the presence of akinesia of the interventricular septum and the anteroseptal wall. Gradients through the mitral prosthesis were proper. The presence of a massive thrombus in the left atrium was visualized. A massive thrombus \"papered up\" the wall of the left atrium it was mainly related to the occluder. There was also a thrombus in the left atrium appendage. Additional views showed the presence of a leak around the occlude Figures.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Echocardiographic control in patients with biological mitral valve and percutaneous occluder is not currently standardized. The reported cases of massive left atrial thrombosis in patients with mitral bioprosthesis and percutaneous occluder are still missing. It seems rational for patients with risk factors for thrombosis， the presence of biological valve prosthesis， and a percutaneous occluder to undergo routine TTE annually. However， this requires further researches and standardized guidelines. There is still an unanswered question whether patients with implanted biological valve prostheses should be candidates for occluder implantation? The need for research also applies to anticoagulant therapy. Should Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anti-Coagulation Agents (NOACs) be always used， or should Vitamin K Antagonists (VKAs) be used in the case of a patient suspected of PPM?\n\n【11】Conclusion\n\n【12】Late device-related thrombosis is very rare. The same applies to patients with a biological mitral prosthesis. In the cases described above， a thrombotic complication was found several years after the cardiac surgery. The common element of these patients was the presence of percutaneous occluders implanted into the left atrium. In both cases， the major mass of the thrombus was on the occluder. Is it a coincidence or is the presence of valve prosthesis and an additional device in the left atrium a \"thrombogenic duo\"?", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:45:07", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:45:16", "cost": 9.22}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:49", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:45:16", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:45:06"}

We present a case of a flare of proctitis due to primary herpes simplex 2 infection. We then outline the most common causes of proctitis， particularly infectious proctitis， highlighting the importance of obtaining a detailed sexual history in all patients with a flare of inflammatory bowel disease. Finally， we discuss the considerations and challenges of balancing immunomodulation and antiviral therapy in a viral flare of inflammatory bowel disease.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 24-year-old man presented with four days of intermittent fevers>38C and frequent bloody diarrhoea. This was on a background of a five-year diagnosis of Ulcerative Colitis (UC) with known moderate rectosigmoid involvement， initially treated with oral and Per Rectal (PR) mesalazine， which he had subsequently self-ceased.\n\n【4】A month prior to presentation， he developed PR bleeding and mucous stools. Outpatient colonoscopy revealed mildly active chronic proctitis. He was treated with a course of prednisolone and recommenced mesalazine. After initial partial improvement his symptoms worsened.\n\n【5】Blood tests demonstrated elevated C-Reactive Peptide (CRP) (peak of 82.2 mg/L) and abnormal liver enzymes (bilirubin 9， ALT 123， AST 63， GGT 125， ALP 63) but normal leukocyte count. Abdominal X-ray was unremarkable. Blood， urine and faecal cultures were negative. Flexible sigmoidoscopy detected severe Mayo 3 colitis in the distal 5 cm of the rectum only， with a dusky appearance and deep ulceration with mucopurulent exudate nottypical ofUC . Subsequent computed tomography scan excluded perforation and ischaemia.\n\n【6】He was empirically treated with intravenous ceftriaxone， metronidazole and hydrocortisone. Azathioprine was commenced after several days. Whilst his temperatures defervesced and CRP improved，he had ongoing symptoms， prompting consideration of alternative diagnoses. Subsequent questioning revealed an episode of unprotected receptive anal sex with a male a fortnight prior to the flare. Testing for sexual transmitted infections returned positive results for Herpes Simplex Virus 2 (HSV2) both on polymerase chain reaction testing of the biopsy and on serology (IgM and IgG positive). HIV testing was negative. Valaciclovir was commenced on day 7 and the patient’s condition improved. Salvage therapy with infliximab was started four days later due to persistent rectal pain and PR bleeding. HSV immunostaining requested retrospectively on biopsies from time of initial diagnosis was negative. Review of biopsies confirmed chronic architectural changes consistent with UC. Thus a diagnosis of flare of UC due to primary HSV2 infection was made. After treatment with induction infliximab and a six-week course of antivirals， repeat colonoscopy revealed significant improvement， with Mayo 1 disease in the distal 2 cm of rectum， and essentially normal histology . This， in conjunction with marked clinical improvement， allowed de-escalation of therapy to azathioprine and mesalazine.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Common aetiologies of proctitis include inflammatory bowel disease， infections， and ischaemia； additionally， diversion colitis and radiation-associated proctitis have also been described . Although clinicians often focus on enteric pathogens， infections can be sexually or non-sexually transmitted， and there has been a resurgence of the former in the setting of unprotected anorectal intercourse. This is especially prevalent in men who have sex with men， but is increasingly also seen in the heterosexual population. The commonest cause of infectious proctitis is gonorrhoea， followed by chlamydia， herpes， and syphilis. Enteric pathogens such as Campylobacter， Shigella， Salmonella， Giardia， and Entamoeba histolytica are also implicated in proctocolit is and can be transmitted by oro-anal sex .\n\n【9】HSV infection may bee contracted d through oro-anal OI anoreceptiveintercourse . Infections are predominantly due to HSV2 (13% of rectal HSV infections are caused by HSV1) . It is characterized by small， typically multiple， vesicular lesions involving the perianal skin and anal canal， which may extend into the rectum. Lesions develop 1 to 3 weeks post exposure， ulcerate， crust and heal after two weeks . Symptoms include anal pain， tenesmus and constipation， and systemic features such as fever and inguinal lymphadenopathy . Other manifestations such as urinary symptoms， sacral paraesthesias and impotence may present acutely. The virus becomes latent once antibody production occurs. Most episodes of HSV proctitis are primary infections although latent virus can be reactivated， resulting in recurrent， usually milder， episodes. Diagnosis is most sensitive with PCR assays. Endoscopically HSV procitits is typified by the presence of ulcers， vesicles， and mucopurulent exudates . Treatment entails 7 days to 10 days of antiviral therapy with aciclovir or valaciclovir，howeverlonger courses of suppressive therapy may be necessary in immunocompromised patients.\n\n【10】Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Clostridium difficile are well- recognized pathogens causing flares of colitis in inflammatory bowel disease. Immunomodulation is sometimes increased in addition to antiviral/antibiotic therapy to control inflammation， although this remains consensus-based due to a paucity of literature . It has been suggested that anti-tumour necrosis (TNF) therapy such as infliximab may reduce replication/reactivation in CMV-associated flares. Although not described in other case reports of HSV proctitis， these principles were applied to our case where symptoms were refractory to antivirals alone， with excellent clinical response to infliximab.\n\n【11】The key lesson from this case is that even when encountering what appear to be straightforward diagnoses， clinicians must consider a broad range of differentials and take comprehensive histories to target appropriate investigations and ensure optimal patient care. Additionally， flares of inflammatory bowel disease due to viral infection present a unique challenge in terms of balancing immunosuppression and inflammation with immunomodulators.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:39:19", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:39:26", "cost": 6.574}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:49", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:39:25", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:39:18"}

Several papers on interventional radiology (IVR) for SMA thrombosis have been written. When a quick diagnosis is made relative to the time of on set， flow recovery is expected following IVR for SMA thrombosis without intestinal resection. This case involved IVR used for thrombo-aspiration and thrombolysis of a male， 100 years of age， who had SMA thrombosis with almost completely obstructed blood flow. First， by using thrombo-aspiration for the occluded artery， blood flow was somewhat recovered. Second， continuous thrombolysis was performed for three days. The patient reported that he was having stomach pains after SMA flow recovered. After aspiration of the thrombus， a dose of urokinase (240，000U/10cc) was administered. During arterial infusion， urokinase (240，000U) was administered for between two to three days. The sheath was withdrawn on the fourth day. Anti-coagulation was maintained for 160 seconds during arterial infusion therapy. The patient was discharged after 24 days.\n\n【2】Keywords： SMA thrombosis； Thrombolysis； Thrombo-aspiratior\n\n【3】Case Presentation\n\n【4】100 years-old male 148cm 42.9kg\n\n【5】Past history： rt. renal tumor (renal cell carcinoma) T2N1M0 thyroid cancer post operation\n\n【6】Family history： not particular\n\n【7】Present illness： nausea， vomiting， stomach pain after lunch\n\n【8】Emergency department visit\n\n【9】BT 36.5℃ BP 150/57mmHgpulse67/mins at O2 97%(room air)\n\n【10】Abdominal findings： flat+elastic hard slightly tenderness on whole abdomen； rebound tenderness \n\n【11】Many reports have indicated that thrombo-aspiration1is a useful technique for SMA thrombosis. Use of a guiding sheath protects the SMA from damage during repeated aspiration. It is important that peripheral flow of the SMA is secured. Use PTA (percutaneous trans-luminal angioplasty) as a last resort， because the width ofthe catheter used during the PTA procedure will push thrombosis to peripheral vessels， thus preventing the possibility of thrombolysis. With early detection of thrombosis， blood flow will recover under continuous thrombolysis.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Several important features in this case indicated the use of IVR for SMA thrombosis. First， the time from pathogenesis to the start of IVR was brief， and IVR was begun as soon as possible. It cannot be stated that SMA flow was recovered iftime from diagnosis to the start of IVR is taken into consideration， because intestinal resection was done. In this case， we decided to use IVR for SMA thrombosis. Given the patient’s age， the option of no treatment was also considered. Second point was included for IVR treatment. In my experiences， SMA flow had recovered using continuous arterial infusion under slight peripheral flow when recovered； flow was obtained faster. For this reason， if SMA thrombosis involves complete obstruction， peripheral artery flow is maintained from other arterial flow. In the case of the 100-year-old male， after removing the thrombosis from SMA center， slight flow from the center to the peripheral artery was obtained. Continuous arterial infusion of urokinase would be promising for SMA flow recovery. In this case， it was confirmed that the peripheral flowed from the other artery.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 15:32:38", "endTime": "2024/09/20 15:37:11", "cost": 272.422}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:48", "update_time": "2024-09-19 23:37:11", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 23:32:38"}

Several vaccines have been approved for emergency use for the prevention of COVID-19. Vaccination is being promoted with priority given to older people and adults at risk of severe COVID-19. However， immunological adverse events of COVID-19 vaccines have not been fully investigated.BNT162b2 is a nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccine that encodes the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein . We report a case of atypical unilateral optic neuritis after receiving BNT162b2 mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\n【10】An 86-year-old man complained of blurred vision and decreased visual acuity in the right eye8 days after receiving the second BNT162b2mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine， and visited a local eye clinic. Since the patient was also aware of pain with eye movement， he was referred to our hospital on suspicion of optic neuritis. He had a history of arrhythmia. At presentation， the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 20/200 in the Right Eye (OD) and 20/20 in the Left Eye (OS)， and Intraocular Pressure (IOP) was 14 mmHg OD and 15 mmHg OS. Critical Flicker Frequency(CFF) was 16 Hz OD and 47 Hz OS. Examination of the right eye showed Relative Afferent Pupillary Defect (RAPD) and cecocentral scotoma. Fundus examination and Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) revealed optic disc swelling and apparent thickening of the retinal nerve fiber layer around the optic disc in the right eye. However， fluorescein angiography showed only hyperfluorescence of the right optic disc， and no findings such as papillary deficiency and choroidal delay that would suggest ischemic optic neuropathy. Alternatively， laboratory tests including Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and C-Reactive Protein(CRP) showed no abnormal values. Anti-Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein (MOG)antibody or anti-Aquaporin 4 (AQP4) antibody test was also negative. Intracranial MRI indicated neither contrast-enhanced effect of gadolinium on the optic nerve nor abnormalities such as demyelinating lesions. Since neither idiopathic optic neuritis nor ischemic optic neuropathy could be diagnosed， we considered the side effects of BNT162b2 mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine. Since slight reduction of optic disc swelling in the right eye was observed on SD-OCT during a week， the patient was followed-up without any medication. One month later， optic disc swelling and the difference between right and left thickening of the retinal nerve fiber layer around the optic disc were completely resolved， and BCVA recovered to 20/100 OD. However， no further improvement was obtained. There was no inflammation in the left eye during these events.\n\n【11】Discussion and Conclusion\n\n【12】The risk ofdeveloping CNS demyelinating diseases including optic neuritis after vaccination has been reported to be 0.1% . Regarding COVID-19vaccination，aciiteddisseminated1encephalomyelitis and acute transverse myelitis have been reported . Leber reported a case of acute thyroiditis and binocular optic neuritis after COVID-19 vaccination . Hence， it is possible that optic neuritis in this case may be induced by BNT162b2mRNA-based COVID-19vaccination. In this case， although there were eye movement pain and cecocentral scotoma suggestive of optic neuritis， either increase in CRP or ESR on laboratory tests， demyelinating lesion on MRI， or positive of anti-MOG antibodies or anti-AQP4 antibodies were not observed， which was atypical for optic neuritis. The mechanism by which vaccines cause optic neuropathy has not been elucidated，but molecular mimicry of viral proteins and immunological involvement of adjuvants have been suggested . As such， inflammation based on the immune responses induced by COVID-19 vaccines may occur in any ocular region. In fact， onset of several types of uveitis following BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccination has been reported . Although further accumulation of cases is required to examine the conceivable relationship and mechanism， optic neuritis reported here mayhave been induced byBNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19vaccination. Further caution should be taken as vaccination， including the use of other types of COVID-19 vaccines， will become more widespread worldwide in the future.\n\n【13】In conclusion， we encountered a case of unilateral atypical optic neuritis occurring after the second BNT162b2 mRNA-based COVID-19vaccination. Warning should be given to ophthalmologists and physicians about the risk ofatypical optic neuritis after COVID-19vaccination.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:51:07", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:51:17", "cost": 10.776}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:48", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:51:18", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:51:07"}

Women have more time between onset of symptoms and presentation and are less likely to undergo diagnostic tests such as EKGand troponins， especially younger women. The presentation can be similar between men and women； over 80% of both report chest pain when presenting with acute coronary syndrome.\n\n【2】Obiective of the Study： The aim of our work is to assess the differences between the two sexes； the cardiovascular risk profile， management of acute care and secondary prevention as well as in-hospital and 1-year mortality.\n\n【3】Methods： We recruited 346 patients， the mean age 63.4±12.7 years are admitted for ACS (179(51.7%) STEMI， 120 (34.7%)NSTEM and 47 (13.6%) unstable angina)， we evaluated the clinical characteristics，electrical， biological，therapeutic as well as the risk scores and the intra-hospital and1-year mortality according to the sex of all the patients hospitalized for an ACS.\n\n【4】Results： We have 100 (28.9%) women and 246 (71.1%) men， a ratio of 2.46， men with ACS are older than women (66.34±12.3 vs. 62.13±12.7；p<0.01)， 17% women and 23.6% men are under55 years old， there are more hypertensive women (80% vs. 39.2%，p<0.01)， with a ratio of 1.6， there are more women with diabetes (65% vs. 47.9%， p<0.01) with a ratio of 1.4， There is no significant difference between the two sexes in terms of frequency of dyslipidemia (p=0.06)， 85% of women are menopausal， at the ECG the involvement in women is more extensive (number of leads affected>6 in 76% vs. 64.2%， p=0.04)， Renal involvement is more significant in women (p=0.02)， there is a Statistically significant difference in mortality at 1 year between women and men (17% vs. 7.3%； p=0.01).\n\n【5】Conclusion： Women hospitalized for ACS have more cardiovascular risk factors than men and cardiovascular mortality at 1 year remains higher in women， this observed difference is mainly linked to the disparity in the quality of care and the results in patients with ACS.\n\n【6】Keywords： Female； Clinical profile； Acute coronary syndrome； Long-term mortality\n\n【7】Introduction\n\n【8】Traditionally， cardiovascular diseases (coronary artery disease， arterial disease， and stroke) and more particularly coronary disease are considered to be diseases mainly affecting men， women being considered \"protected\". However， statistics from the World Health Organization show that cardiovascular mortality is higher in women than in men. Cardiovascular disease is even the leading cause of death in women， ahead of the more frequently cited breast cancer . But if we look at the incidence of cardiovascular disease in large epidemiological studies such as Framingham for example， for all age groups (between 45 and 95 years)， the incidence is higher in men than in women. This brings us to the first paradox. In Algeria， ischemic heart disease is the leading cause of death with 36% according to the latest 2016 World Health Organization data .\n\n【9】Materials and Methods\n\n【10】Study population\n\n【11】Single-center， cross-sectional， prospective， cohort-type observational study carried out in patients hospitalized for ACS in the cardiology intensive care unit of the internal medicine department of the University Hospital of Douera， the inclusion criteria are： Any patient over 18years admitted for an SCA； including ACS with elevation of the ST segment， ACS without elevation of the ST segment (MI without Q wave and unstable angina)，the non-inclusion criteria are： Patients under palliative care with neoplastic pathology whose life expectancy is lower at six months，patients with severe chronic respiratory failure oxygen dependent， ACS occurring within 48 h after a therapeutic intervention (angioplasty or coronary bypass) or other cardiac surgery and pregnant women. Follow-up of all patients for 1 year.\n\n【12】Results\n\n【13】Characteristics of the study population\n\n【14】Represented by Table 1， the male population with acute coronary syndrome represents 71.1% of the overall population， the average age is higher in men (66.3±12.3 years vs. 62.1±12.7 years，p<0.01)，there is more STEMI in men (58.1% vs. 36%， p<0.01)， more diabetics in women (47.9% vs. 65%，p<0.01)， more tobacco users (82.9% vs. 5%， p<0.01)， more hypertensive in women (80% vs. 49.2%， p<0.01)， the BMI is higher in women (28.7±5.6 vs. 26.1 ±4.1 kg/m， p<0.01)， more metabolic syndrome in women (80% vs. 47.2%，p<0.01)，renal function is lower in the female population (65.3±33.1 ml/min/m²vs.74.6±31.5 ml/min/m’，p<0.01)， pharmacological fibrinolysis is used less in women (18% vs. 30.1%，p=0.02) and there is more angioplasty in men (32.9% vs. 20 %，p=0.02)， on the other hand no significant difference concerning coronary arterybypass grafting， cardiovascular inheritance，dyslipidemia in both groups.\n\n【15】There are more women with a very high CRUSADE score(40% vs.9.3%， p<0.01)， on the other hand no statistically significant difference for the intra-hospital GRACE Score and at 6 months and the TIMI score. Between the two sexes.\n\n【16】After one year of follow-up， there is more mortality in the female group (17% vs. 7.3%， p=0.01)， more cardiovascular events (64%Table 1： Clinical characteristics of the study population. vs. 51.2%， p=0.04)， more heart failure (37% vs. 17， p<0.01)， more severe bleeding (13 vs. 5.7， p=0.03) no statistical difference between the two sexes concerning ischemic recurrence and the number of rehospitalization after one year of follow-up .\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】In this single-center study， women hospitalized for ACS have more comorbidities with more diabetes， hypertension， metabolic syndrome in accordance with previous studies there are more men in our study corresponding to the data from the ACCESS study， mortality after one year is greater in the female population， previous studies have shown that the differences between the sexes in early mortality after ACS are largely explained by these clinical differences during presentation ， Previous studies have reported early excess mortality after STEMI in younger women and detected an interaction between sex and age . Our study found that women presented to the hospital for ACS treatment 1.2 h later than men.\n\n【19】This delayed presentation has been associated with an increased risk of death and recurrent events in patients with ACS. This prolonged delay in hospital presentation in women compared to men can be attributed to misinterpretation of symptoms，lack of awareness and barriers to accessing care .\n\n【20】Women are lesslikelyy to receivereperfusion therapy(thrombolysis， ATL) on arrival than men. These disparities in acute treatment also contributed to the difference in death rates between men and women.\n\n【21】A meta-analysis that investigated gender differences in mortality in patients treated with primary ATL concluded that increased mortality in women was likely confounded by differences in baseline cardiovascular risk factors and profiles. Clinics addressing gender disparities in evidence-based treatment may improve outcomes for patients with STEMI .\n\n| Population  | ACS male (n=246)  | SCA female (n=100)  | P(value)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Middle age (years)  | 66.34±12.3  | 62.13±12.7  | <0.01  |\n| STEMI  | 143(58.1)  | 36   | <0.01  |\n| NSTEMI  | 73(29.7)  | 47  | <0.01  |\n| Unstable angina  | 30(12.2)  | 17  | 0.31  |\n| Average BMI (Kg/m2)  | 26.1±4.1  | 28.7±5.6  | <0.01  |\n| TT moyen (Cm)  | 94.6±11.5  | 97.6±12.5  | 0.03  |\n| Tobacco  | 204(82.9)  | 5  | <0.01  |\n| Dyslipidemia  | 85(35.6)  | 46  | 0.06  |\n| Diabetes  | 118(47.9)  | 65   | <0.01  |\n| Hypertension  | 121(49.2)  | 80   | <0.01  |\n| Metabolic syndrome  | 116(47.2)  | 80   | <0.01  |\n| Killip≥2  | 47(19.1)  | 27   | 0.13  |\n| Pain -medical contact delay >6h  | 128   | 65   | 0.03  |\n| Number of ECG leads reached >6  | 158(64.2)  | 76  | 0.04  |\n| LVEF simpson  | 48±9.4  | 42±3.6  | 0.5  |\n| Creatinine clearance  | 74.6±31.5  | 65.3±33.1  | 0.02  |\n| Thrombolysis  | 74(30.1)  | 18  | 0.02  |\n| ATL  | 81(32.9)  | 20   | 0.02  |\n| CABG  | 36(14.6)  | 10  | 0.32  |\n| GRACE score intra-H high  | 106(43.1)  | 55   | 0.06  |\n| GRACE score 6 months high  | 102(41.5)  | 51  | 0.13  |\n| STIMI score high  | 39(15.6)  | 24   | 0.1  |\n| CRUSADE score very high  | 23(9.3)  | 40   | <0.01  |\n|  |  |  |  |\n\n【23】Conclusion\n\n【24】The present study evaluated gender differences in hospital management and outcome of patients with ACS. Women with ACS had a higher unadjusted risk of death than men. Women were less likely to receive acute reperfusion therapy than men. However， the reasons for these differences based on gender in the clinical management of ACS remain largely unknown. Gender differences in quality of care mortality and cardiovascular events after one year of follow-up underscore the need for further investigation and a specially targeted quality improvement program to reduce or even eliminate disparities in care.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:13:58", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:14:27", "cost": 28.419}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:48", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:26", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:13:57"}

The patient recovered without any sequala. HSV-1 meningitis is exceptional but could be more frequently observed linked to the epidemiological changes in HSV infections.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Herpes Simplex Viruses (HSV) is known to invade the Central Neural System (CNS). HSV type 1 usually moves via the trigeminal and/or olfactory ganglia to the CNS， where it replicates， and causing life-threatening encephalitis . HSV type 2 spreads from the sacral ganglia and is responsible for benign， spontaneously resolved but often recurrent， Mollaret’s meningitis .\n\n【4】This report describes the case of an immunocompetent 11 year-old boy admitted in emergency to the Toulouse University Pediatric Hospital in November 2019 suffering from a fever， pulsatile frontal headache，neck stiffness，phono-photophobia， nausea and vomiting. The fever，headache and vomiting appeared ten days earlier in a context of a herpes-like gingivostomatitis.\n\n【5】Physical examination confirmed the pyrexia and meningitis with no focal neurological deficit or symptoms of encephalitis. He had no rash or vesicular eruption. The admission cranial computed tomography scan was normal.\n\n【6】Examination of the Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) revealed pleocytosis (548 cells/pl， 100%lymphocytes) and increased protein (2.7 N). CSF gram staining was negative as were cultures. Multiplex PCR targeting CNS bacterial， viral and fungal pathogens (n=14) (Film Array Meningitis/Encephalitis panel - BioFire Diagnostics， BioMerieux， France) was positive for HSV-1. This was confirmed with a specific in-house molecular system for detecting HSV-1 and 2 genomes . The serum/blood C-reactive protein and white blood cell count were normal. Tests for HSV-1 and HSV-2 genomes were negative； that for anti-HSV-1 IgG was positive and that for anti-HSV-2 IgG was negative (Liaison XL HSV-1 and HSV-2 Type Specific IgG-DiaSorin， Italy). At one month a control test for anti-HSV-1 IgG showed a four-fold increase in antibody titer. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging at diagnosis gave normal patterns.\n\n【7】The patient was given intravenous acyclovir (500 mg/m’every 8 h) for 2 weeks. He completely recovered and was discharged without any sequela. The detailed medical history， clinical manifestations and their evolution， anti-HSV-1-IgG kinetic suggest that the gingivostomatitis reflected a pauci-symptomatic HSV-1 primary infection. The virus probably migrated via the neurons to the CNS at the same time as the gingivostomatitis but needed 10 days to produce meningitis.\n\n【8】This case is one of exceptionally pure HSV-1 meningitis， with no clinical or radiological signs of encephalitis. HSV-1 has never， to our knowledge， been associated with such a syndrome， unlike enteroviruses  and HSV-2 ， which can both result in viral meningitis.

For patients with chronic and progressive liver damage， ALGS should be taken into consideration.

ALGS is caused by mutations in or deletions of either the JAGGED1 (JAG1) or NOTCH2 gene . Traditionally， the diagnosis of ALGS is based on a combination of the presence of intrahepatic bile duct paucity on liver biopsy with at least three of the major clinical features including liver disease (cholestasis)，congenital heart defects， vertebral abnormalities， ocular anomalies and characteristic facial features . However， this may cause misdiagnose with atypical or mild ALGS. Here we reported a 12-year-old male patient presented by recurrent transaminase elevation and hepatosplenomegaly over 11 years. There were no jaundice and other system disorders. Liver biopsy showed the patient had liver fibrosis but not the paucity of intrahepatic bile duct. The genome sequencing demonstrated a heterozygous mutation of JAG1 gene. The patient was finally diagnosed as ALGS. The availability of molecular testing led to the diagnosis of ALGS precisely.\n\n【6】Patient Information\n\n【7】A 12-year-old male patient was charged into hospital with chief complaint about recurrent transaminase elevation and hepatosplenomegaly over 11 years， which was the third time of his hospitalization. 11 years ago， the patient was found anorexia， abdominal distention， and mass on the left upper abdominal. There weren’t obvious jaundice， fever， vomits and clay stool. The patient’s liver function showed a mild elevation of transaminase while the CT scanning showed hepatosplenomegaly accompanied with loss of normal ratio of hepatic lobes. The patient also received gastroscopy examination which indicated mild esophageal varix. Finally， the patient was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis. His parents rejected further treatment and only treated with Chinese herbal medicine (no details of the herbal medicine). 5 years ago， the patient admitted to hospital again with poor appetite and pale complexion. Likewise， the patient didn't have other symptoms.\n\n【8】The liver function still presented with a mild transaminase elevation. The patient received liver biopsy this time which showed swelling， ballooning degeneration of hepatocyte， focal necrosis and lymphocyte infiltration around portal tract. Neither fibrous hyperplasia nor bile ducts paucity were found. The patient was treated with injected reduced glutathione for a week and then changed into oral formula. The patient's liver function fluctuated continuously afterward and hospitalized for the third time.\n\n【9】The patient was G2P2 and the birth weight is 3.8 Kg. The patient had delayed clearance of jaundice which lasted nearly 6 months after birth. There was neither growth nor mental retardation of the patient. The patient had an elder brother who was health.\n\n【10】Clinical Findings\n\n【11】The patient had peculiar facial features with prominent forehead， bulbous nose， and pointed chin (supplementary data 1). There were no jaundice， pedal edema， purpura， spider nevi， cardiac murmur and lung rale. Abdomen examination revealed enlargement of liver and spleen. The liver was firm in texture and the span was 4.5 cm along the right mid-clavicular line while the spleen was 4 cm below the left costal margin with firm texture.\n\n【12】Diagnostic Assessment\n\n【13】There was slight elevation of liver transaminase， other blood\n\n【14】Table 1： The laboratory parameters of patient's liver function on different time\n\n| Table 1： The laboratory parameters of patient's liver function on different time point.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Time pointItem  | 20/07/05  | 22/07/05  | 8/11/12  | 31/05/16  | 07/07/16  | Normalreterence range  |\n| TB(umol/L)  | 8.6  | 10.7  | 19.1  | 22.3  | 19.4  | 1.8-21  |\n| DB(umol/L)  | 5.6  | 7.0  | 4.1  | 5.7  | 6.2  |.7  |\n| ALB(g/L)  | 47  | 41.7  | 45.1  | 45.8  | 43.9  | 38-52  |\n| ALT(U/L)  | 40.6  | 121  | 130  | 177.8  | 113  | 0-40  |\n| AST(U/L)  | 97.7  | 212  | 98.6  | 91.6  | 81  | 0-45  |\n| AKP(U/L)  | 440.2  | 448.2  | 304  | 328  | 400  | 100-360  |\n| GGT(U/L)  | 222.4  | 346.2  | 175  | 263.5  | 277  | 0-25  |\n| LDH(U/L)  | 452  | 345  | 242.4  | 243.3  | 256  | 100-300  |\n| BA(mmol/L)  | N/A  | N/A  | N/A  | 43.8  | 30.5  | 0-15  |\n\n【16】Abbreviations： TB： Total Bilirubin DB： Direct Bilirubin； ALB： Albumin； ALT： Alanine Aminotran； AST： Aspartate Aminotransferase： AKP： Alkaline Phosphatase， GGT： y-GlutamylTranspeptidase， LDH： Lactate Dehydrogenase， BA： Bile Acid tests including Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP)， ceruloplasmin， cholesterol， and triglyceride level， coagulation function test， blood ammonia， Tandem mass spectrometry were normal. The HBsAg， anti-HCV， and autoantibody were all negative. CT scan indicated loss of normal ratio among liver lobes， with lessening of right lobe and enlargement of left and caudate lobe . The portal vein was on the upper limit. Other Imaging examinations including chest X-ray and cardiac ultrasonic were normal. Liver biopsy demonstrated less swelling ballooning degeneration， focal necrosis of liver cells， however， there was mild proliferation of collagen and bile canaliculus around portal areas. The gene analysis found the boy had a heterozygous mutation of JAG1 gene on exon12 with the deletion of cytosine on p1563-1564， which caused frame shift mutation.\n\n【17】Therapeutic Intervention\n\n【18】The patients were diagnosed with Alagille Syndrome (ALGS) and treated with ursodeoxycholic acid and fat soluble vitamins. The patient was asked to follow-up regularly.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】In this case， hepatic disorder  and facial feature were two main manifestations of the patient. No positive found on other systems. There wasn’t obvious jaundice except for prolonged neonatal jaundice. Liver biopsies didn't show paucity of bile ducts， there was mild proliferation of bile canaliculus around portal areas instead. This result indicated that the liver histology of ALGS could be varied. Some patients may not present as paucity of bile duct in histology. In fact， it has been realized that a liver biopsy is no longer considered mandatoryto make a diagnosis of ALGS，and the presence of cholestasis is acceptable to fulfill this criterion. The y-Glutamyl transpeptidase and bile acid level of the patient were kept abnormal， which demonstrated the patients had chronic cholestasis. Except for that， the latest liver biopsy showed fibroplasias， which was not obvious before. This revealed that the liver damage was continuously progressing even if the symptom and liver function not further aggravated. We excluded other chronic liver diseases including Neonatal Intrahepatic Cholestasis caused by Citrin Deficiency(NICCD)， Glycogen storage disease， Wilson’s disease， Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis III (PFIC-III) and Autoimmune liver disease through blood test， imaging examination， and gene test. We also did the gene test of the patient's parents since the patient is diagnosed. The result proved that his parents didn't carry the same mutation. The patient had a de novo mutation. Supportive treatment is the main therapy for live damage caused by alagille syndrome. Ursodeoxycholic acid is recommended for cholestasis. It has been reported that liver transplantation for ALGS has an 80% 5-year sur-vival rate， and results in some catch-up growth in 90% of affected individuals .\n\n【21】Conclusions\n\n【22】Alagille syndrome has complicated clinical manifestations varies from sub-clinical to multisystem disorders. For patients with chronic and progressive liver damage in his early life， ALGS should be taken into consideration. Molecular diagnosis is particularly useful for patients with atypical or mild Alagille syndrome who do not meet classic diagnostic criteria.\n\n【23】Informed Consent\n\n【24】Written informed consent was obtained from the patient's legal guardians for publication of this case report and any accompanying images.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:43:40", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:43:57", "cost": 17.565}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:48", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:43:57", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:43:39"}

Bloodtests： whiteblood cells 13.88×10/L，neutrophils 11.65×10/L，neutrophil percentage 83.9%， liver， kidney function， virus four， coagulation， troponin， D2 aggregates， amylase， CRP were not significantly abnormal.\n\n【5】A difficult decision\n\n【6】A decision was made on the spot by the admitting physician to arrange an emergency Multidisciplinary Team Consultation (MDT) due to the patient's age， multiple underlying diseases， and long duration of perforation and how to proceed with treatment. The gastroenterology department advised that the patient had poor underlying conditions， long-term oral hormones， and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs NSAIDs， that surgery required open implants and a second operation， and that there was a risk of prolonged non-healing wounds and bleeding； the anesthesiology department consulted and advised that the patient had many underlying diseases and poor general condition， but there was no contraindication to anesthesia for emergency surgery； the gastroenterology department advised as the patient had been perforated for a long time， signs of peritonitis were obvious， intestinal pellucidness was poor， and there are risks a large amount of intestinal fecal fluids had already entered the peritoneal cavity， even if the endoscopic repair could be completed， surgical intervention might still be required and the best time for surgery might be delayed. Ultimately， the family chose endoscopic treatment in combination with the patient’s comprehensive condition.\n\n【7】Surgical procedure\n\n【8】After a comprehensive anesthetic risk assessment by the anesthesiologist， the surgeon performed a perforated needle laparotomy (No.9 needle) as shown in Figure 2A while the endoscopist performed an endoscopic perforation repair with the assistance of a CO2 air pump， using a gastroscope to enter the straight b junction， a perforated wound of about 2 cm in diameter was seen， which was closed with a harmonious clamp ladder and finally closed with a large nylon string suture at the root， which took28 min. Postoperatively， he was treated with symptomatic treatment such as water fasting， acid suppression， gastric protection， Imipenem and cilastatin sodium for injection (TIENAM) anti-infection， and rehydration. The treatment procedure is shown in the Figures 2B，2C and 3A-3D.\n\n| A B Figure 1： A) Massive pneumoperitoneum. B) Bronchiectasis. C) Pulmonary infection in the abdominal cavity.  |\n| --- |\n\n【10】Day 1 postoperation\n\n【11】The patient's symptoms of peritonitis were exacerbated， with persistent severe abdominal pain，no anal exhaustion，and defecation. On Physical examination： The patient had a clear consciousness， and was mentally distressed， with a melancholic facial expression； thoracic respiration，lung auscultation revealed coarse breath sounds in lungs， large wet rales and rales were perceived； the abdomen was bulging， with muscle tension， refusal to press， pressure pain and rebound pain. The patient's blood count showed a CRP of 282.7 mg/L， calcitonin of 6.87 ng/ml， WBC of 15.38×10/L， neutrophils of 13.68 ×10/L， and neutrophil percentage of 88.9%. The patient's lung infection was aggravated， and the gastrointestinal surgery consultation suggested an exploratory laparotomy. Due to a long time of perforation and aggravation of peritonitis， the risk of surgery was greater than before. A follow-up CT scan showed that the gas in the abdominal cavity was less than before with peritoneal fluid. Symptomatic treatment such as anti-infection and rehydration was continued .\n\n【12】Day 2 post-operation/post-surgery\n\n【13】The patient's abdominal distension was less improved than before， but she still did not have defecation， abdominal pain was better than before， and abdominal signs did not change significantly compared with yesterday. The follow-up blood routine and biochemical indicators showed： CRP： 273 mg/L， calcitonin gene： 3.73 ng/ml，blood WBC 14.49×10/L， neutrophils 12.60×10/L，neutrophil percentage87%.\n\n【14】The patient's abdominal distension was significantly improved on the third day after the operation， and a small amount of anal discharge was observed. The cough and sputum symptoms were better than before， and the related in dexes showed： CRP： 21.95 mg/L， Calcitonin gene： 0.83 ng/ml， WBC 8.41×10/L； neutrophils 5.41 ×10/L，neutrophil percentage 64.44%.\n\n【15】On the 11hh postoperative day， a repeat CT  showed that the signs of pneumonia were better than before， and an encapsulated fluid was formed at the perforation site in the abdominal cavity. The indicators were normal and he was discharged. One month after discharge， a repeat CT  showed that the pelvic fluid was absorbed and the titanium clip was dislodged.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】Medical/Nosocomial intestinal perforation (Enterobrosis) is the most severe and rare complication of colonoscopy and treatment， and statistics have shown that the incidence of perforation related to colonoscopy and treatment is about 0.06% to 0.8%， while the statistics of this endoscopy center in the last 3 years， about 7，000patients were examined by colonoscopy， and perforation occurred in3 cases， with a perforation rate of 0.043%， among which 1 case was an obstetrical and gynecological patient. The patient was intended for myomectomy and developed abdominal pain after colonoscopy， which was not taken seriously by the physician on duty and was relieved by the administration of intramuscular pain medication，and on the second day， a large amount of exudate from the intestinal cavity was found by opening the abdomen and perforation of the intestinal wall was observed， and intraoperative gastrointestinal surgery was performed to flush the abdomen and create a fistula， which was returned six months later. A. case of violent access to the mirror lens during colonoscopy led to perforation and immediate harmonious clamping of the trauma， but an abdominal abscess was still formed after the patient's operation， and after several multidisciplinary consultations， abdominal puncture to extract pus and Imipenem and cilastatin sodium for injection (TIENAM) anti-infection， the patient was hospitalized for 2 months and barely discharged with disputes.\n\n【18】The third case was a patient with epigastric pain after consuming food nearly 24 h after intestinal polypectomy， which was persistently aggravated， but considering the patients past long-term alcohol consumption and history of duodenal ulcer， symptomatic treatment was given to protect the gastric， but the effect was not good. 40 h later， an abdominal CT scan showed transverse colon perforation， which was closed by endoscopic harmonious clamps and nylon ropes， and the abdominal pain was relieved on the third postoperative day and safely discharged a week later. Combined with this perforated patient， summarizing the causes of endoscopic perforation in the above four cases， all three cases of female perforation were presented bycolonoscopy， and all of them were over 60 years old and combined with other underlying diseases， and there are data indicating  that age ≥60 years， female， low BMI (Body Mass Index)， combined with other underlying diseases， long-term oral anticoagulant drugs， and history of laparotomy are the independent risk factors for colonoscopy perforation. The skill and composure of endoscopy technologists  are also important factors to avoid perforation. Skilled practitioners avoid brutal or slippery scopes when performing intestinal access through rotation， especiallythrough the rectosigmoid junction or spleen area. However， when it comes to climbing， a lack of patience and emotional susceptibility to external influences make it more likely that medical perforation will occur.\n\n【19】The treatment of perforation caused by colonoscopy and treatment includes conservative treatment， endoscopic repair， and surgical procedures . However， with the development of endoscopic techniques， more and more perforations are healed by endoscopic treatment ， and relevant statistics show that their success rate can reach 60% to 90% . However， its success rate is related to many factors， such as the degree of bowel cleanliness， time to detect the perforation， size of the perforation， etc. Some studies have shown that when the diameter of the perforation is >1.5 cm is the only factor for the failure of endoscopic treatment. Regarding endoscopic perforation， some other scholars  suggested that persistent fever， elevated neutrophils， and severe abdominal pain within 24 h after endoscopic perforation treatment are indicative of endoscopic treatment failure and require surgical intervention. Some scholars believe that endoscopic perforation repair can be performed after confirming the perforation time <24 h ， but our group reported a case of perforated intestinal polyp diagnosed nearly 40h and successfully performed the endoscopic repair. Also， Xian-lin et al.  reported a case of perforation in the book of intestinal polyps and successful repairwith endoscopic ligation， but its perforation time was short. In contrast， Wang Heng et al.  summarized 17 cases of intestinal perforation in 13 years， of which only 1 case had perforation during polypectomy and was immediately treated with endoscopic titanium clip suture， 1 case of small cecum perforation was treated conservatively and improved， and the other 15 cases were referred for surgical treatment. This showed that only a small percentage of intestinal perforations could be repaired endoscopically.\n\n【20】The patient in this case was an elderly female with multiple underlying diseases， accompanied by hypertension， atrial fibrillation， bronchodilation，2and long-term11ulseOInon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs， intermittent oral hormonal drugs， and had been referred to our hospital for nearly 4 h from a lower township hospital with an average degree of intestinal cleanliness， and the multidisciplinary consultation concluded that the prognosis was extremely poor， and even death might occur， regardless of surgical or endoscopic surgery. Although the patient eventually underwent endoscopic repair， the patient's peritonitis signs did not abate on the second and third postoperative days and inflammatory indicators were all at high levels. Surgery was still recommended after another surgical consultation， but a repeat CT showed a decrease in free gas in the abdominal cavity，so the patient's family was informed of the risks and decided to continue conservative treatment. Eventually， on day 4abdominal symptoms resolved， inflammatory indicators decreased， and the anus was able to vent and defecate. The success of this endoscopic repair of an intestinal perforation nearly 2 cm in diameter also refreshes the precedent of successful endoscopic repair for elderly patients with perforations >1.5 cm in diameter and multiple underlying diseases and provides a clinical reference for clinicians to perform more complex procedures in the future. However， it is also a reminder for endoscopists that gastrointestinal endoscopy and treatment are risky， and it is important to strictly assess the patients physical condition before the examination， as well as to avoid slipping and violent pushing of the mirror， and to properly retreat the mirror tor observation when an advancing view cannot be seen.\n\n【21】As people shealth awarenessincreases，gastrointestinal en doscopy screening， and minimally invasive awareness increase， and an increasing number of patients may choose endoscopy examination and treatment， which requires endoscopy awareness to practice the basic skills in order to reduce or even avoid serious complications.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【8】", "content": "【0】Abstract\n\n【1】This study reported a case of perforation of the junction of the rectum and sigmoid colon with a perforated surface diameter of about 2 cm due to improper operation of general colonoscopy， and the patient came to our hospital 4 h after perforation， with a history of underlying diseases such as bronchiectasis， atrial fibrillation， hypertension， and long-term intermittent administration of oral hormones and Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) etc. The patient was finally resuscitated with multidisciplinary assistance by surgical laparotomy and deflation， and the anesthesiology department performed under anesthesia for high-risk groups and under CO2air pump-assisted endoscopic perforation repair was performed， and one case was successfully resuscitated to avoid a surgical operation， and the patient was successfully discharged from the hospital.\n\n【2】Keywords： Colonoscopy； Intestinal perforation； Endoscopic repai\n\n【3】Case Presentation\n\n【4】A 74-year-old female patient was admitted to the hospital with chief complaint of \"Abdominal pain and distension for the past 4 h\".

In this paper， one case of cerebral infarction in the left basal ganglia region with isolated manifestation of acute behavioral and cognitive impairment was reported， in an attempt to help clinicians better understand this type of acute cerebral infarction.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Because of the presence of the basal nuclei in the basal ganglia region， including the internal capsule and many nuclei involved in motor functions， clinicians often interpret cerebral infarction in this region simply as \"the triad of hemiplegia， hemianesthesia， and hemianopia”or “involuntary limb movements\" and then locate it accordingly . However， the non-motor symptoms such as mental and behavioral abnormalities， cognitive decline， atypical aphasia， and hemispatial neglect that can be caused by lesions in this region are not sufficiently emphasized and evaluated. In this report； we aimed to discuss a case of cerebral infarction in the left basal ganglia region with isolated manifestation ofacute behavioral and cognitive impairment.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】The patient is an 81-year-old female. She was admitted to the hospital on March 26h，2020 due to “sudden unresponsiveness with reduced speech for two days\". Two days ago， after breakfast， the patient was found by her family to be apathetic and less responsive to the outside world than when waking up in the morning， she showed a significant decrease in speech and lack of words when asked by her family， but no obvious difficulty in understanding language. In the following two days， the patient continued to have these symptoms without relief and often sat for hours without active speech or activity， so she was sent to our hospital by her family. During the course of the disease， the patient had no gibberish， choking and coughing with water，limb weakness， or urinary and fecal incontinence. Personal history： History of hypertension for 3 years， with blood pressure reaching up to 180/110 mmHg. She used to take 2.5 mg of levamlodipine benzoate tablets orally at bedtime for antihypertensive treatment， but blood pressure control was not monitored. Neurological examination： Clear consciousness， apathetic expression， unresponsiveness， reduced speech，relevant but inaccurate answers to questions， MMSE score of 17， MoCA score of 12. Pupils equal， round， and reactive to light，3 mm in diameter. Normal eye movement in all directions with no nystagmus. Symmetrical nasolabial folds. Angle of the mouth not deviated when the teeth were shown. Normal pharyngeal reflex. Tongue centered when stuck out. Cervical tenderness.Meningeal irritation sign . Normal muscle tone and muscle strength of all four limbs. Mild paralysis test in both upper and lower limbs . No hemihypalgesia. Bilateral tendon reflexes symmetrical， no pathological signs induced. Lack of coordination in finger-to-nose test and heel-knee-shin test. Difficulty in standing sign with closed eyes . Slow pace but normal gait when walking. Auxiliary examination： No abnormalities in routine blood test， electrolytes， liver function， kidney function， blood glucose， blood lipids， blood sedimentation， homocysteine， ultrasensitive C-reactive protein， tumor markers， thyroid function， complete set of autoimmune antibodies， and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. ECG： Sinus rhythm， heart rate of 70 beats/min， normal ECG. Chest CT scan and abdominal ultrasound showed no unusual findings. Lumbar puncture showed intracranial pressure of 160 mmH2O. The routine， biochemical and viral nucleic acid tests of cerebrospinal fluid were normal. Cranial MRI scan showed acute ischemic changes in the lenticular nucleus of the left basal ganglia， and further MRA did not reveal significant stenosis of the internal carotid artery and vertebrobasilar system. Diagnosis： 1. Cerebral infarction (acute stage， in the left basal ganglia region)； 2. Hypertensive disease (grade 3， very high risk)， with most likely TOAST classification of small-vessel occlusion. After admission， the patient was given antiplatelet， blood pressure monitoring， statin therapy， and cognitive rehabilitation. Two weeks later， the patient's mental status improved， spontaneous speech and active activities increased significantly， and the MMSE and MoCA retests recovered to 24 and 21 points. Ability to independently care for herself in daily life.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】In clinical practice， mental and behavioral abnormalities and cognitive impairment due to organic focal lesions are often located in the frontal lobe， thalamus， medial temporal lobe， and hippocampus. In the present case， the patient had a sudden onset and a clear previous history of hypertension， so it was easily misdiagnosed as acute cerebrovascular disease in these areas based on her clinical presentation. However， acute cerebral infarction in the left basal ganglia region was later confirmed by cranial MRI.\n\n【8】Previous studies have reported few cases of acute unilateral infarction in the basal ganglia region manifested with behavioral and cognitive abnormalities but completely persevered motor functions， and most cases were acute ischemic lesions in the unilaterallenticular nucleus， predominantly on the left side. Reiji Koide et al.  reported a case of infarction of the left globus pallidus with behavioral abnormalities as the only manifestation in 2013. They also suggested that compared with Multi-Infarct Dementia (MID)， which is more common in clinical practice， the cognitive decline caused by cerebral infarction of the left globus pallidus belongs to Strategic Infarct Dementia (SID). They also believed that the pathogenesis of such infarcts is mostly penetrating lesions of the middle cerebral artery， with good prognosis. That is， the behavioral and cognitive impairment are often partially or completely recovered after timely intervention. Giroud et al.， on the other hand， divided the infarcts in the lenticular nucleus into two different clinical syndromes according to the anatomical regions： Putamen infarction， which is characterized by dystonia and cognitive decline， and globus pallidus infarction， which is characterized by mental and behavioral abnormalities and cognitive impairment. They also concluded that the globus pallidus infarction result in mental and behavioral abnormalities， usually manifesting as apathy and unresponsiveness， whereas the range of cognitive impairment is mainly associated with attention，short-term memory， and executive function. Su Hyun Kim et al.  analyzed and explained the behavioral and cognitive impairment alone caused by infarction of the left globus pallidus： Since the function of the cortical projections to different regions of the globus pallidus is relatively independent， the disruption between the frontal cortex and the ventral circuit ofthe globus pallidus may be the mechanism by which a frontal lobe syndrome is produced. In addition， the frontopontine bundle of the anterior limb of the internal capsule is damaged by compression due to infarction of the anterior part of the globus pallidus， thus affecting frontal lobe function， which has also been speculated to be a mechanism of the condition. In addition to behavioral and cognitive impairment， a case of motor aphasia alone due to the lenticular nucleus infarction has been reported in China. The author suggested that the lenticular nucleus is also directly involved in the regulation and output of speech functions . The present case showed mental symptomssuch as apathyandunresponsiveness，reduced spontaneous speech，and normal comprehension after the onset of the disease. The cognitive function assessment showed impaired attention， memory， and executive function， and imaging examination confirmed that the ventral lesions of the left globus pallidus， among other features， were basically consistent with the above report.\n\n【9】In conclusion， the possibility of infarction in the basal ganglia region， especially in the globus pallidus of the dominant hemisphere， should be considered in patients with sudden onset of mental and behavioral abnormalities and cognitive impairment， in order to avoid missing the best time window for treatment. Meanwhile， neuropsychological assessment should also be carefully performed for cerebral infarction in the lenticular nucleus to avoid missing the possible behavioral and cognitive impairment， and timely targeted treatment and rehabilitation should be provided to achieve early return to normal life.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:53:01", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:56:27", "cost": 206.127}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:48", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:56:27", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:53:01"}

Luxturna is a major medical advance since it is the first gene therapy to be granted approval by FDA that targets on a single gene. Approval of Luxturna may provide new prospects for curing various intractable and life-threatening rare diseases. As indicated by the former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb， FDA can see a bright future of gene therapy， through which many dreaded， usually terminal medical problems may be solved， and now it is a critical time for the development of this novel form oftreatment. As a result， FDA has been devoted to establishing an integrated， appropriate policy framework to encourage and administrate gene therapy research. FDA will also gradually promulgate a series of disease-specific guidance papers to demonstrate the clinical development and detailed approval process of investigational gene therapy products to discuss some critical and creative thinking that might be helpful to evaluate the efficacy of GT products and accelerate approval process. In this article， FDA guidance on clinical trial design issies for gene therapy development of rare diseases and some current innovative statistical considerations are reviewed. In addition， a case study of Luxturna， the first approved gene therapy for a rare disease is discussed.\n\n【2】Keywords： Rare disease drug development； Demonstrating effectiveness or not in effectiveness； Real-world evidence； Therapeutic index\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Gene therapy is a technique to treat diseases by introducing exogenous normal genes into targeted cells to destroy abnormal genes or compensate beneficial protein products. There are three main mechanisms of gene therapies， namely， (i) replacing a defective gene with a normal copy of the gene， (ii) inactivating a defective gene， and (iii) transmitting a functional gene which can effectively treat the disease to the human body . As indicated in the 2020FDA guidance on Long Term Follow-Up after Administration of Human Gene Therapy Products， human gene therapy attempts to treat or cure human genetic diseases by gene modification technologies that help certain biological processes return to normal . Gene therapy products can be applied in a wide range of illnesses， such as cancer， communicable diseases， and hereditary diseases.\n\n【5】Without a carrier called vector， the modified gene cannot be inserted into body and work successfully. Certain vectors include plasmid DNA， viral vectors and bacterial vectors .A plasmid is often a circular DNA molecule separated from bacteria， which can reproduce in other organisms. Thus， plasmids are a suitable tool to deliver therapeutic genes to specific tissues. Viral vectors are another natural carrier in gene engineering. Before being used as vehicles to transfer genetic materials， infectious viruses have to be modified to become a harmless form. Many gene therapy products are derived from viruses， such as lentiviral vectors used to treat sickle cell disease， AAV virus vectors applied in tuberous sclerosis . The mechanism of bacterial vectors is similar to viral vectors， which is firstly removing the infectivity and then inserting the combination of bacteria and the therapeutic gene into human tissues. In addition to vectors， human gene editing technology and patient-derived cellular products are frequently used in gene therapy. For human gene editing technology， the principle is to stop the activity of defective genes or repair mutated genes. Forpatient-derived cellular gene therapy products， we directly extract pathological cells from the patient and finally returned the genetically modified cells to the patient .\n\n【6】As indicated by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) reports， there are about 7，000 rare diseases and over 25 million people in the United States suffer from them. Research shows that approximately80% of rare diseases are due to single gene mutation， and are commonly diagnosed in children . Moreover， most of the rare diseases are very hard to cure and usually fatal. However， effective therapies are limited. Thus， it becomes necessary for the research of effective treatments for rare diseases. Additionally， many rare diseases exhibit multiple sub-types or variations. As a result， the development of gene therapy products in the area of rare diseases has become very popular.\n\n【7】The remaining of this article is organized as follows. In the next section， FDA's guidance on gene therapy for rare diseases is reviewed. Some statistical considerations are given in Section 3， while Section 4provides a detailed discussion of a recent FDA approved gene therapy regulatory submission. Some concluding remarks are given in the last section of this article.\n\n【8】FDA Guidance on Gene Therapy for Rare Diseases\n\n【9】To assist the sponsors for developing a human Gene Therapy(GT) product for rare diseases， FDA released an industry guidance document on Human Gene Therapy for Rare Diseases in 2020 . The guidance is aimed to offer recommendations to researchers who seek to promote human gene therapy medication development targeting a specific rare disease in terms of the possible elements and issues necessary to be considered during each stage of the clinical trial design program. It should be noted this document does not establish a golden standard.FDA encourages any alternative method to support your product as long as it follows all the statutory requirements determined by FDA.\n\n【10】Although one rare disease affects only a few people， the total number of people suffering from rare diseases is enormous. Moreover， many rare diseases have no approved efficient therapies. Phenotypic heterogeneity and multi-subtypes of disease also add the difficulty of treatment. Therefore， natural history studies are quite important in treatment development for rare diseases since natural history studies can provide comprehensiveknowledge of a disease. However，limited information from the natural history of rare diseases is available for clinical trial development .\n\n【11】Many factors should be considered during all phases of clinical trials design. One example is ethical issues since most of the rare diseases happen during childhood which involves enrollment of children and permission from parents. Human Gene Therapy for Rare Diseases proposes an outline of suggested elements could be considered into the development of rare diseases treatments (focus on， but not limited to gene therapy). The content is as follows ：\n\n【12】Study population\n\n【13】For the selection of study population， two points should be taken into account： First， potential adverse events and benefits should be identified in advance based on previous preclinical or clinical data. Second， the study population should be representative and have the potential to generate instructive safety and efficacy data . When conducting gene therapy clinical trials for rare diseases， the following general principles should be considered ：\n\n【14】①) If the disease is caused by a genetic defect， the sponsor should perform genetic tests for the specific defects in all clinical trial subjects. This information is important to ensure correct diagnosis of the disorder of interest. Since many of the disorders may involve different mutations of a specific gene， safety and effectiveness may be linked to specific genotype in unpredictable ways. Thus， early understanding of such associations may help in planning future clinical trials.\n\n【15】(ii) As pre-existing antibody to any component of the GT product may pose a potential risk to patient safety and limit its therapeutic effect， FDA suggested that sponsors may exclude patients with pre-existing antibodies to the product. In such cases， it is strongly suggested that the sponsor should develop a companion diagnostic to detect antibodies to the product.\n\n【16】(iii) At the stage of clinical GT trials design， adverse events， the anticipated risk， and potential benefits to subjects should be considered . In addition， subjects with severe or advanced disease who might experience confounding adverse events related to the underlying disease should also be considered.\n\n【17】(iv) Since most rare diseases are pediatric diseases or show symptoms in childhood， pediatric studies are a critical part of drug development and need to be considered seriously. FDA also offers additional safeguards for children in clinical investigation. As indicated in 21 CFR 50.51， a clinical investigation should not show a risk greater than minimal risk unless presenting the prospect of direct benefit to individual subjects (21 CFR 50.52). If neither condition is satisfied， but the study may yield generalizable knowledge about the disorder or condition， may involve children as set forth in 21 CFR50.53. Note that adequate provisions must be made to obtain the permission of the parents and the assent of the child as per 21 CFR50.55.\n\n【18】(v) The risks of most GT products include the possibility of permanent unintended， along with adverse effects due to invasive procedures that may be necessary for product administration. Because of these risks， it is generally not acceptable to enroll normal， healthy volunteers into GT studies. A well-written informed consent document is also essential.\n\n【19】Study design\n\n【20】For rare diseases drug development，limited number of qualified patients can be enrolled in each phase of clinical studies is the most challenging issue. Insufficient study subjects increases the pressure for more pertinent data (e.g.， adverse events， efficacy outcomes， biomarkers) collected from each patient， which is beneficial for further trials design. As a result， it is suggested that the sponsor should refer to the following general principles for selection of an appropriate study design ：\n\n【21】(i) A randomized， concurrent-controlled trial is generally considered the ideal standard for establishing effectiveness and providing treatment-related safety data. Randomization in early stages of development is strongly encouraged when feasible.\n\n【22】(ii) Sponsors should consider designing their first-in-human study to be an adequate and well-controlled investigation that has the potential to provide evidence of effectiveness and safety of the test treatment under study in support of regulatory submission and marketing application.\n\n【23】(iii) Placebocontrols are suggested to be adopted for interpreting both safety and efficacy results. In a study that has multiple dose-level cohorts，each cohort should consider establishing a placebo group (iv)In case where the performance of the test treatment under study depends upon subjects with different disease stages or severities， sponsors are encouraged to consider stratified randomization based on disease stage/severity.\n\n【24】(v) For some gene therapies with different indications (e.g.， a genetic skin disease)， the use of an intra-subject control design(e.g.， a cross-over design such as n-of-1 trial design) may be useful. Comparisons of local therapeutic effects can be facilitated by the elimination of variability among subjects in inter-subject designs.\n\n【25】(vi) A single-arm trial using historical controls， sometimes including an initial observation period， may be considered if there are feasibility issues with conducting a randomized， controlled trial. If this design pattern is used， then knowledge of the natural history of disease is critical， which may provide the basis of a historical control， but only if the control and treatment populations are adequately matched， in terms of demographics， concurrent treatment， disease state， and other relevant factors.\n\n【26】(vii) As the study's power to detect treatment-effects diminishes due to small sample size and potential high inter-subject variability， alternative trial designs and statistical technigues that maximize data from a small and potentially heterogeneous group of subjects should be considered. Ideally， an endpoint based on a treatment outcome that virtually never occurs in the natural course of the disease would facilitate the interpretability of small trials.\n\n【27】(viii) Adequate measures are suggested to minimize bias. The preferred approach is to use a study design that includes blinding.\n\n【28】(ix)SSponsors are also encouragedto identifIyyrrelevant biomarkers early and to leverage all available information from published investigations for the disease of interested (or related diseases). Some biomarkers or endpoints are very closely linked to the underlying pathophysiology of the disease. In this case， changes in such biomarkers could be used during drug development for dose selection， or even as an early demonstration of drug activity.\n\n【29】Dose selection\n\n【30】Dose selection is crucial in GT drug development forrare diseases. The following principles are from FDA guidance ：\n\n【31】(i) Dose selection should be informed by all available sources of clinical information (e.g.， publications， experience with similar products and experience in related patient populations).\n\n【32】(iii))Leveraging non-human data obtained in animal models of disease and in vitro data maybe， in some cases， the only wayto estimate a starting effective human dose. Additional dosing information can be obtained from predictive models based on current understanding of in vitro enzyme kinetics，and allometric scaling.\n\n【33】(iii)For early-phase studies in subjects under serious conditions， it is better to start with a potentially therapeutic dose.\n\n【34】(iv) In practice， some GT products may have an extended duration of activity， so that repeated dosing may not be an acceptable risk until there is a preliminary understanding of the product's toxicity and duration of activity， and a comprehensive assessment of the product's immunogenicity.\n\n【35】Safety considerations\n\n【36】FDA indicates that the first necessity of designing a gene therapy clinical trial is to ensure the safety of patient subjects， and previous human experience of identical or similar gene therapy products can provide valuable reference. However， if few such experiences exist， it is dangerous to conduct large-scale first-in-human trials. To reduce the potential risk， FDA suggests sponsors stagger administration to consecutively enrolled subjects， followed by staggering between dose cohorts .\n\n【37】Immunogenicity is another factor that can affect safety. Thus， FDA implies that we should develop an effective test for specific immune reactions and keep paying attention to any immune responses against the proposed gene therapy drug during the whole process of the clinical trial . Moreover， possible long-term side effects resulted from gene engineering technology has always been contested. One gene therapy product might not expose safety issues until years later. Therefore， a long term follow-up survey for those patients who received the gene therapy is necessary .\n\n【38】FDA also notes that a complete protocol of gene therapy research should cover stopping rules， which require a forceful pause once any adverse events hope. These stopping criteria are significant to protect subjects from any unanticipated injury or safety threats .\n\n【39】Efficacy endpoints\n\n【40】An endpoint in a clinical trial is a measurable parameter (usually displays a patient’s physiological state) that could provide substantial evidence showing a clinical meaningful benefit of the drug/product. Selection of the primary efficacy endpoint is relevant to whether a drug can be approved. FDA proposes the following guidelines for appropriate endpoint selection for gene therapy rare diseases clinical trials： (i) Sponsors should understand the pathophysiology and natural history ofa disease as fully as possible at the outset of product development. Full understanding of disease pathophysiology is important in selection of endpoints or identifying potential surrogate endpoints which are especially helpful for sponsors who are considering seeking accelerated approval of a GT product.\n\n【41】(ii) Sponsors should identify specific aspects of the disease that are meaningful to the patient and might also be affected by the GT product's activity.\n\n【42】(iii) Considerable information can be gained by collecting clinical measurements repeatedly over time. Such a longitudinal profile allows the assessments of effect， largely based on within-patient changes， that otherwise could not be studied.\n\n【43】Patient experience\n\n【44】Since patient experience data may provide important additional information about the clinical benefit of a GT product， FDA encourages sponsors to collect patient experience data during product development， and to submit such data in the marketing application.\n\n【45】Statistical/Scientific Considerations\n\n【46】In addition to the above important elements to be considered， the following statistical considerations are necessarily implemented during the conduct of gene therapy rare diseases clinical trials.\n\n【47】Small sample size\n\n【48】In clinical research，power analysis is often performed for sample size calculation. The purpose is to achieve a desired power of correctly detecting a clinically meaningful difference at a pre-specified level of significance if such a difference truly exists. However， this method may not be appropriate for rare disease clinical trials due to limited available patients can be enrolled. To solve this problem， Huang and Chow proposed an innovative method based on a probability monitoring procedure to calculate the sample size in 2019 . The concept is to select an appropriate sample size for controlling the probability of crossing safety and/or efficacy boundaries at a pre-specified level of significance. For rare disease clinical development， an adaptive probability monitoring procedure may be applied if a multiple-stage adaptive trial design is used. More details regarding the probability monitoring procedure for sample size determination of rare diseases can be found in Huang and Chow .\n\n【49】Endpoint selection\n\n【50】In experimental treatment trials， the determination of a proper clinical endpoint is essential to project success since the endpoint or outcome provides evidence of whether a clinical benefit exists.A good endpoint should demonstrate both the safety and effectiveness of a proposed treatment with statistical significance and the treatment benefit must be clinically meaningful. In real cases， we sometimes find that there are multiple choices of clinically meaningful endpoints， all of which well measure or characterize the therapeutic effect of interest. Since the study endpoint is important for further decision of the sample size under a desired power， it is important to choose the primary endpoint which can best inform the disease status and measure the treatment effect. To better understand how to choose a primary study endpoint， the concept of therapeutic index was created by Chow and Huang. Each candidate endpoint is assigned a pre-specified weight based on previous observed -values and then apply a linear model to develop the therapeutic index function. More details regarding the development of therapeutic index can be found in Chow and Huang .\n\n【51】The use of biomarkers\n\n【52】A biomarker is a measurable characteristic which can reflect your physiological changes to a medical treatment (e.g. blood pressure). Since we do not have a full understanding of most rare diseases， using a biomarker as the endpoint might be more appropriate than a standard endpoint such as survival rate. There are several advantages of using biomarkers： (i) it is easily monitored and can be measured frequently during the whole trial， (ii) it is sensitive to minor treatment effect under a small sample size， (iii) it can predict/explore the promise of an investigational drug in early stage， and (iv) it may help accelerate the process of study and approval for the drug. In addition， biomarkers are able to guide adaptive trial designs . In some cases， the study treatment does not show significant improvement in general population but might be effective in a fraction of people who manifest some similar characteristics. Biomarkers can be utilized to identify the target population. Thus， under the assumption that there is a well-established relationship between a biomarker and clinical outcomes， the use of biomarker in rare disease clinical trials cannot only allow screening for possible responders at enrichment phase， but also provides the opportunity to detect signal of potential safety concerns early and provides supportive evidence of efficacy with a small number of patients available .\n\n【53】The Use of RWE for regulatory approval\n\n【54】FDA recommends proper use of Real-World Data (RWD) and Real-World Evidence (RWE) as support for regulatory decision making in clinical research. The 21 Century Cures Act， which was enacted back in 2016， turns the attention to the utilization of such data for the purpose of promoting approval of new therapy .\n\n【55】For example， advanced electronic tools， mobile devices and other healthcare applications allow people to generate massive amounts of valuable health data， which is an excellent complement to data generated from Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs). Although the real-world evidence is considered as a powerful support for regulatory decision making， the assessment of treatment benefit based on RWE could be biased due to lack of randomization and heterogeneity of RWD. Thus， in real clinical trials， where there are inconsistencies between RWE and substantial evidence， measures are needed to filter those qualified RWD and diminish the variability of RWD from standard substantial data for an accurate evaluation of the therapeutic benefit .\n\n【56】Demonstrate not-ineffectiveness\n\n【57】A standard statistical test to support the efficacy of the drug is to reject the null hypothesis of ineffectiveness， in turn； we can accept the alternative hypothesis of effectiveness. However， Chow and Huang challenged this interpretation， proposing that rejecting ineffectiveness implies not-ineffectiveness (or non-inferiority) instead of effectiveness (or superiority) . The concept of“not-ineffectiveness” should include \"inconclusiveness\"and\"effectiveness\". For this reason， Chow and Huang pointed out that effectiveness of the test treatment could be concluded iftwo conditions are met： (i) ineffectiveness is rejected；(ii) the probability of inconclusiveness is negligible. Chow and Huang have therefore developed a groundbreaking two-stage drug discovery trial method for rare diseases. At the first stage， employ a small number (n ) of patients from targeted population， then test for not-ineffectiveness at a pre-specified significance level. Note that ny may be determined by the probability monitoring procedure as mentioned in small sample size section. If the null hypothesis of ineffectiveness is rejected， move to the second stage. To achieve the statistical power (like 80% power)， N subjects are needed. It is suggested to recruit n， patients and borrow N-n2 data from Real-World Data (RWD) to eliminate inconclusiveness. If the test result indicates that the probability of inconclusiveness can be neglected(like<5%)， effectiveness of the studied therapeutic intervention under investigation is claimed .\n\n【58】Innovative trial design\n\n【59】As we mentioned before， small available sample is the main difficulty to conduct clinical study for rare diseases. Thus， it is impossible to use traditional clinical trial design methods to meet FDA's standards for approval of products for rare diseases. In some cases， we need to adopt some innovative trial designs which could help us obtain substantial evidence of effectiveness and safety of the product with small sample size. These innovative trial designs include， but are not limited to， the n-of-1 trial design， an adaptive trial design， master protocols， and a Bayesian design. The flexible use of combination of these innovative trial designs with the innovative thinking discussed earlier is not only to fix the dilemma of sample available (e.g.， n-of-1 trial design and master protocol) but also to ensure effectively， accurately， and reliably assess the treatment effect and increase the probability of success of the intended clinical trials(e.g.， adaptive trial design in conjunction with Bayesian approach for borrowing real-world data) .\n\n【60】Case Study-Approval of Luxturna\n\n【61】In this section， we will discuss a case study regarding gene therapy product Luxturna (voretigene neparvovec-rzyl) approved by the FDA on December 184， 2017. Luxturna is a novel gene therapy that was specifically developed for patients with an inherited retinal\n\n【62】Table 1： Efficacy results of the phase 3 study at year 1， compared to baseline.\n\n| Efficacy Outcomes  | LUXTURNAn=21  | Control n=10  | Difference (LUXTURNA minus Control)  | P-value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| MLMT score change using both eyes， median (min， max)  | 2  | 0  | 2  | 0.001  |\n| MLMT score change using the first treated eye， median (min，max)  | 2  | 0  | 2  | 0.003  |\n\n【64】Source： FDA Statistical and Clinical Reviews disorder resulted from biallelic RPE65 gene mutation. Luxturna is a major medical advance since it is the first gene therapy to be granted approval by FDA that targets on a single gene .\n\n【65】Background\n\n【66】Biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder often diagnosed in young children. Patients inherit one copy of mutated RPE65 gene from both parents (mutation site may be different). The function of RPE65gene is to make RPE65 protein， an enzyme involving in the visual cycle (converts light into electrical signals) which is important for normal vision. If two copies of RPE65 genes are mutated， the number of RPE65 proteins will rapidly decrease or disappear， resulting in the block of the visual cycle and causing visual impairment. The condition of vision loss will become worse with age， and the patients may even be totally blind in young adulthood. In the United States， almost 1，000 to 2，000 people are affected by eye diseases due to biallelic RPE65 mutation.\n\n【67】There was limited effective drug or treatment to cure the biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy prior to Luxturna. A common applied treatment is using the Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System， an artificial device that can help patients with blindness caused by outer retinopathy restore a basic vision. This device is first approved in the United States under a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) and is now commercially allowed in many countries. The Argus II System includes external components (a pair of glasses with camera and a portable computer) and internal components (a specific microelectrode implanted into eyes by surgery). The camera on the glasses can capture external images and the computer translates the light perception into electricalstimulation and is received by implanted electrode to activate retinal cells. The Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System is proved to be relatively safe and effective； however， the recovery of vision acuity varies in different patients .\n\n【68】The mechanism of Luxturna is to transmit a normal copy of the RPE65 gene directly to living retinal cells through a transformed adeno-associated virus as a vector. Thus， RPE65 proteins can be complemented and the visual cycle can continue again.\n\n【69】FDA review of clinical safety and efficacy\n\n【70】This section discusses the clinical trial program of Luxturna， including t thestudyydesign， important resultsand FDA's recommendations. The Luxturna regulatory approval is based on a clinical phase 1 analysis and a clinical phase 3 studies that established the key safety and efficacy proof for the BLA submission .\n\n【71】Phase 1 and phase 3 studies： The phase 1 study was an open-label， dose-escalation protection study in a total of 12 patients with reported retinal dystrophy associated with biallelic RPE65 mutations. Eleven of 12 patients with an injection time of 1.7 to 4.6 years received subretinal Luxturna injection to either eye. One patient got just one eye with a subretinal injection. Additionally， the Phase 1 analysis evaluated three doses and results indicated that no apparent dose\n\n【72】Table 2： Magnitude of MLMT score change using both eyes at year 1.\n\n| MLMT Score Change  | LUXTURNAn=21  | Control n=10  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | -0  | 3(30%)  |\n| 0  | 2(10%)  | 3(30%)  |\n| 1  | 8(38%)  | 3(30%)  |\n| 2  | 5(24%)  | 1(10%)  |\n| 3  | 5(24%)  | 0  |\n| 4  | 1(4%)  | 0  |\n\n【74】Source： FDA Statistical and Clinical Reviews that might affect safety， bioactivity， or preliminary efficacy. The high dose (1.5×10\" vector genome in an injection volume of 0.3 mL) was chosen for the phase 3 study.\n\n【75】The Phase 3 study was an open-label， randomized， controlled， cross-over trial. It was developed to test the effectiveness and efficacy of Luxturna sequential subretinal injection into each eye. Patients were randomized to either the Luxturna therapy group or the observational control group in a 2：1 ratio，and were monitored for the primary efficacy evaluation for duration of one year. After one year of study， patients in the control group were crossed over to receive Luxturna. The phase 3 study recruited 31 patients in the United States from two locations. At the stage of baseline evaluation， 21 of the 31participants were randomized to the therapy group with one drop. Ten patients were randomized to the control group with withdrawal of consent of one patient at the screening visit. A crossover study was conducted in the nine patients with one-year observation of Luxturna injection. The mean age was 15 years (4 to 44 years)， including 20(64%) pediatric patients (4 to 17 years) and 11 adult patients. The subretinal injection period ranged from 6 to 18 days for each patient's two eves.\n\n【76】Efficacy evaluation： The primary efficacy endpoint in the phase3 study was change in Multi-Luminance Mobility Testing (MLMT) performance from baseline to one vear after Luxturna administration. MLMT assessed the ability of a patient to traverse a course correctly and at a fair speed at various degrees of ambient light. The MLMT was measured at one or more of seven light levels， ranging from 400lux (corresponding to a brightly lit office) to 1 lux (corresponding to a moonless summer night)，using both eyes andeach eye independently. A score code ranging from 0 to 6 was assigned to each light level. A higher score implied that a patient was able to pass the test at a lower light level. Patients who did not pass MLMT in the brightest environment (400 lux) were given a score of -1. Each patient's MLMT was recorded and tested by independent， blinded graders. The MLMT score was the lowest light level at which the patient successfully passed the MLMT. Another parameter defined in this study is the MLMT score change from baseline to the end of study. An increase of the MLMT score suggested an improvement of eyesight. Additional efficacy endpoints included Full-Field Light Sensitivity Threshold(FST) and Visual Acuity (VA). The phase 1 and phase 3 regulatory review analyses are summarized below.\n\nThe results of the primary endpoint (MLMT score change) from | X180 X365 Study Duration (Days) Figure 1： MLMT time-course over two years (using both eyes).

A median MLMT score change of two and zero were observed in the Luxturna treatment group and control group， respectively， independent of the use of both eyes or the first-treated eye. An MLMT score change oftwo or greater is considered a clinically meaningful benefit for functional vision.\n\n【79】Table 2 and Table 3 illustrate the number and percentage of patients with different magnitudes of MLMT score change using both eyes and individual eyes， respectively， at year 1. If we consider both eyes， eleven patients (11/21，52%) in the Luxturna treatment group had an MLMT score change of two or greater， while only one patient(1/10，10%) in the control group had an MLMT score change of two， .\n\n【80】On the other hand， if we consider the first-treated eye and second-treated eye separately， fifteen patients (15/21，71%) in the Luxturna treatment group had an MLMT score change of two or greater， while no patient in the control group had a score change of 2 or greater.\n\n【81】Safety assessment： Twenty-seven (27/41，66%) ofthe 41 patients(12 from phase 1 and 29 from phase 3， totally 81 eyes) receiving Luxturna had ocular adverse reactions in 46 injected eyes (46/81，57%). The most common adverse reactions (incidence 2 5%) were conjunctival hyperemia， cataracts， increased intraocular pressure， retinal tears， dellen， macular hole， eye inflammation， macular breaks， subretinal deposits， eye irritation， eye pain， and maculopathies . Whether these ocular adverse symptoms are associated with injection of Luxturna is not clear. However， most of these adverse events were temporary and controllable. There were no deaths in the clinical studies. There were two serious adverse reactions， including (i) endophthalmitis (infection inside of the eye) with a series of subsequent complications， and (ii) loss of vision due to fovea thinning as a result of the subretinal injection. Systemic adverse events included hyperglycemia， nausea， vomiting， and leukocytosis. These systemic events were likely caused by systemic corticosteroid use and reactions to anesthesia.\n\n【82】As noted by the FDA， Luxturna subretinal injection should be given only to patients who have viable retinal cells as determined by the treating physician (s). Treatment with Luxturna must be done separately in each eye on separate days， with at least six days between surgical procedures. Patients should be treated with a short course of oral prednisone to limit the potential immune reaction.\n\n【83】Summary： The safety and efficacy of Luxturna were well established in a clinical trial with 41 patients aged between 4 and. All participants had confirmed biallelic RPE65 mutations. The primary efficacy endpoint of Luxturna was based on the phase 3 study with 31 participants by measuring the change from baseline to one year in a subject's ability to navigate an obstacle course at various light levels. The treatment group demonstrated significant improvements in their ability to complete the obstacle course at low light levels as compared to the control group. The most common adverse reactions， such as eye redness， cataract， can be mitigated by medical care.\n\n【84】Advisory committee recommendations\n\n【85】The Cellular， Tissue， and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee\n\n【86】Table 4： Ocular Adverse Reactions Following Treatment with Luxturna (N=41).\n\n| Adverse Reaction  | Patients n=41  | Treated Eyes n=81  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Any ocular adverse reaction  | 27 (66%)  | 46 (57%)  |\n| Conjunctival hyperemia  | 9(22%)  | 9(11%)  |\n| Cataract  | 8(20%)  | 15(19%)  |\n| Increased intraocular pressure  | 6(15%)  | 8(10%)  |\n| Retinal tear  | 4(10%)  | 4(5%)  |\n| Dellen (thining of the corneal stroma)  | 3(7%)  | 3(4%)  |\n| Macular hole  | 3(7%)  | 3(4%)  |\n| Subretinal deposits  | 3(7%)  | 3(4%)  |\n| Eye inflammation  | 2(5%)  | 4(5%)  |\n| Eye irritation  | 2(5%)  | 2(2%)  |\n| Eye pain  | 2(5%)  | 2(2%)  |\n| Maculopathy (wrinkling on the surface of the macula)  | 2(5%)  | 3(4%)  |\n| Foveal thinning and loss of foveal function  | 1(2%)  | 2(2%)  |\n| Endophthalmitis (infection inside of the eye)  | 1(2%)  | 1(1%)  |\n| Fovea dehiscence (separation of the retinal layers in the center of the macula)  | 1(2%)  | 1(1%)  |\n| Retinal hemorrhage  | 1(2%)  | 1(1%)  |\n\n【88】Note： Transient appearance of a ring-like deposit at the retinal injection site 1-6 days after injection without symptoms Source： Madified from the applicant's BLA submission (CTGTAC) evaluated the safety and effectiveness of Luxturna， giving several feedbacks. First， a 2-score increase of MLMT is clinical meaningful. Second， the potential risks of Luxturna are acceptable. Third， Luxturna may not work until 8 to 12 months of age because the retina has not been fully developed. Fourth， it should be considered if the efficacy of Luxturna declines over time. Consequently， the CTGTAC voted 16(Yes) to 0(No) in favor the approval of Luxturna.\n\n【89】Concluding Remarks\n\n【90】In this paper， a case study regarding Luxturna which is a gene therapy drug intended treating a rare disease of an inherited form of vision loss that may result in blindness. The FDA granted Luxturna(i) priority review， (ii) breakthrough therapy and (iii) orphan drug designations to assist the sponsor in Luxturna development. As discussed in Section 4， FDA's recommendation for regulatory approval of Luxturna was made based on a phase 1 clinical study and a phase 3 clinical study.\n\n【91】Although the CTGTAC voted for approval of Luxturna， several questions and concerns remain. These questions， which are likely to occur due to small sample size， include， but are not limited to (i) the treatment effect may have been contaminated by some covariates and/or interaction/confounding factors， (ii) no scientific/clinical or statistical justification for the selection endpoint and/or clinically meaningful difference， (iii) it is not clear that the study design can provide an accurate and reliable assessment of the treatment effect， and (iv) statistical methods for assessment of treatment may not be adequate (e.g.， shift analysis before and after treatment was not done). In addition， one of the major concerns is probably that whether the performance of Luxturna based on limited number of patients is not by chance alone and hence is reproducibility. Based on a quick assessment， the reproducibility probability was calculated based on the observed responses and the variability associated with the responses of the 31 subjects. The result indicates that there is a less than 60% probability of reproducibility if the study is conducted under similar experimental conditions in the future.\n\n【92】Thus， it is suggested that statistical considerations as described in Section 3 and some innovative thinking regarding study design and analysis should be taken into consideration when conducting rare diseases clinical trials.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "Figure 1： MLMT time-course over two years (using both eyes).

Luxturna is a major medical advance since it is the first gene therapy to be granted approval by FDA that targets on a single gene. Approval of Luxturna may provide new prospects for curing various intractable and life-threatening rare diseases. As indicated by the former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb， FDA can see a bright future of gene therapy， through which many dreaded， usually terminal medical problems may be solved， and now it is a critical time for the development of this novel form oftreatment. As a result， FDA has been devoted to establishing an integrated， appropriate policy framework to encourage and administrate gene therapy research. FDA will also gradually promulgate a series of disease-specific guidance papers to demonstrate the clinical development and detailed approval process of investigational gene therapy products to discuss some critical and creative thinking that might be helpful to evaluate the efficacy of GT products and accelerate approval process. In this article， FDA guidance on clinical trial design issies for gene therapy development of rare diseases and some current innovative statistical considerations are reviewed. In addition， a case study of Luxturna， the first approved gene therapy for a rare disease is discussed.\n\n【2】Keywords： Rare disease drug development； Demonstrating effectiveness or not in effectiveness； Real-world evidence； Therapeutic index\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Gene therapy is a technique to treat diseases by introducing exogenous normal genes into targeted cells to destroy abnormal genes or compensate beneficial protein products. There are three main mechanisms of gene therapies， namely， (i) replacing a defective gene with a normal copy of the gene， (ii) inactivating a defective gene， and (iii) transmitting a functional gene which can effectively treat the disease to the human body . As indicated in the 2020FDA guidance on Long Term Follow-Up after Administration of Human Gene Therapy Products， human gene therapy attempts to treat or cure human genetic diseases by gene modification technologies that help certain biological processes return to normal . Gene therapy products can be applied in a wide range of illnesses， such as cancer， communicable diseases， and hereditary diseases.\n\n【5】Without a carrier called vector， the modified gene cannot be inserted into body and work successfully. Certain vectors include plasmid DNA， viral vectors and bacterial vectors .A plasmid is often a circular DNA molecule separated from bacteria， which can reproduce in other organisms. Thus， plasmids are a suitable tool to deliver therapeutic genes to specific tissues. Viral vectors are another natural carrier in gene engineering. Before being used as vehicles to transfer genetic materials， infectious viruses have to be modified to become a harmless form. Many gene therapy products are derived from viruses， such as lentiviral vectors used to treat sickle cell disease， AAV virus vectors applied in tuberous sclerosis . The mechanism of bacterial vectors is similar to viral vectors， which is firstly removing the infectivity and then inserting the combination of bacteria and the therapeutic gene into human tissues. In addition to vectors， human gene editing technology and patient-derived cellular products are frequently used in gene therapy. For human gene editing technology， the principle is to stop the activity of defective genes or repair mutated genes. Forpatient-derived cellular gene therapy products， we directly extract pathological cells from the patient and finally returned the genetically modified cells to the patient .\n\n【6】As indicated by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) reports， there are about 7，000 rare diseases and over 25 million people in the United States suffer from them. Research shows that approximately80% of rare diseases are due to single gene mutation， and are commonly diagnosed in children . Moreover， most of the rare diseases are very hard to cure and usually fatal. However， effective therapies are limited. Thus， it becomes necessary for the research of effective treatments for rare diseases. Additionally， many rare diseases exhibit multiple sub-types or variations. As a result， the development of gene therapy products in the area of rare diseases has become very popular.\n\n【7】The remaining of this article is organized as follows. In the next section， FDA's guidance on gene therapy for rare diseases is reviewed. Some statistical considerations are given in Section 3， while Section 4provides a detailed discussion of a recent FDA approved gene therapy regulatory submission. Some concluding remarks are given in the last section of this article.\n\n【8】FDA Guidance on Gene Therapy for Rare Diseases\n\n【9】To assist the sponsors for developing a human Gene Therapy(GT) product for rare diseases， FDA released an industry guidance document on Human Gene Therapy for Rare Diseases in 2020 . The guidance is aimed to offer recommendations to researchers who seek to promote human gene therapy medication development targeting a specific rare disease in terms of the possible elements and issues necessary to be considered during each stage of the clinical trial design program. It should be noted this document does not establish a golden standard.FDA encourages any alternative method to support your product as long as it follows all the statutory requirements determined by FDA.\n\n【10】Although one rare disease affects only a few people， the total number of people suffering from rare diseases is enormous. Moreover， many rare diseases have no approved efficient therapies. Phenotypic heterogeneity and multi-subtypes of disease also add the difficulty of treatment. Therefore， natural history studies are quite important in treatment development for rare diseases since natural history studies can provide comprehensiveknowledge of a disease. However，limited information from the natural history of rare diseases is available for clinical trial development .\n\n【11】Many factors should be considered during all phases of clinical trials design. One example is ethical issues since most of the rare diseases happen during childhood which involves enrollment of children and permission from parents. Human Gene Therapy for Rare Diseases proposes an outline of suggested elements could be considered into the development of rare diseases treatments (focus on， but not limited to gene therapy). The content is as follows ：\n\n【12】Study population\n\n【13】For the selection of study population， two points should be taken into account： First， potential adverse events and benefits should be identified in advance based on previous preclinical or clinical data. Second， the study population should be representative and have the potential to generate instructive safety and efficacy data . When conducting gene therapy clinical trials for rare diseases， the following general principles should be considered ：\n\n【14】①) If the disease is caused by a genetic defect， the sponsor should perform genetic tests for the specific defects in all clinical trial subjects. This information is important to ensure correct diagnosis of the disorder of interest. Since many of the disorders may involve different mutations of a specific gene， safety and effectiveness may be linked to specific genotype in unpredictable ways. Thus， early understanding of such associations may help in planning future clinical trials.\n\n【15】(ii) As pre-existing antibody to any component of the GT product may pose a potential risk to patient safety and limit its therapeutic effect， FDA suggested that sponsors may exclude patients with pre-existing antibodies to the product. In such cases， it is strongly suggested that the sponsor should develop a companion diagnostic to detect antibodies to the product.\n\n【16】(iii) At the stage of clinical GT trials design， adverse events， the anticipated risk， and potential benefits to subjects should be considered . In addition， subjects with severe or advanced disease who might experience confounding adverse events related to the underlying disease should also be considered.\n\n【17】(iv) Since most rare diseases are pediatric diseases or show symptoms in childhood， pediatric studies are a critical part of drug development and need to be considered seriously. FDA also offers additional safeguards for children in clinical investigation. As indicated in 21 CFR 50.51， a clinical investigation should not show a risk greater than minimal risk unless presenting the prospect of direct benefit to individual subjects (21 CFR 50.52). If neither condition is satisfied， but the study may yield generalizable knowledge about the disorder or condition， may involve children as set forth in 21 CFR50.53. Note that adequate provisions must be made to obtain the permission of the parents and the assent of the child as per 21 CFR50.55.\n\n【18】(v) The risks of most GT products include the possibility of permanent unintended， along with adverse effects due to invasive procedures that may be necessary for product administration. Because of these risks， it is generally not acceptable to enroll normal， healthy volunteers into GT studies. A well-written informed consent document is also essential.\n\n【19】Study design\n\n【20】For rare diseases drug development，limited number of qualified patients can be enrolled in each phase of clinical studies is the most challenging issue. Insufficient study subjects increases the pressure for more pertinent data (e.g.， adverse events， efficacy outcomes， biomarkers) collected from each patient， which is beneficial for further trials design. As a result， it is suggested that the sponsor should refer to the following general principles for selection of an appropriate study design ：\n\n【21】(i) A randomized， concurrent-controlled trial is generally considered the ideal standard for establishing effectiveness and providing treatment-related safety data. Randomization in early stages of development is strongly encouraged when feasible.\n\n【22】(ii) Sponsors should consider designing their first-in-human study to be an adequate and well-controlled investigation that has the potential to provide evidence of effectiveness and safety of the test treatment under study in support of regulatory submission and marketing application.\n\n【23】(iii) Placebocontrols are suggested to be adopted for interpreting both safety and efficacy results. In a study that has multiple dose-level cohorts，each cohort should consider establishing a placebo group (iv)In case where the performance of the test treatment under study depends upon subjects with different disease stages or severities， sponsors are encouraged to consider stratified randomization based on disease stage/severity.\n\n【24】(v) For some gene therapies with different indications (e.g.， a genetic skin disease)， the use of an intra-subject control design(e.g.， a cross-over design such as n-of-1 trial design) may be useful. Comparisons of local therapeutic effects can be facilitated by the elimination of variability among subjects in inter-subject designs.\n\n【25】(vi) A single-arm trial using historical controls， sometimes including an initial observation period， may be considered if there are feasibility issues with conducting a randomized， controlled trial. If this design pattern is used， then knowledge of the natural history of disease is critical， which may provide the basis of a historical control， but only if the control and treatment populations are adequately matched， in terms of demographics， concurrent treatment， disease state， and other relevant factors.\n\n【26】(vii) As the study's power to detect treatment-effects diminishes due to small sample size and potential high inter-subject variability， alternative trial designs and statistical technigues that maximize data from a small and potentially heterogeneous group of subjects should be considered. Ideally， an endpoint based on a treatment outcome that virtually never occurs in the natural course of the disease would facilitate the interpretability of small trials.\n\n【27】(viii) Adequate measures are suggested to minimize bias. The preferred approach is to use a study design that includes blinding.\n\n【28】(ix)SSponsors are also encouragedto identifIyyrrelevant biomarkers early and to leverage all available information from published investigations for the disease of interested (or related diseases). Some biomarkers or endpoints are very closely linked to the underlying pathophysiology of the disease. In this case， changes in such biomarkers could be used during drug development for dose selection， or even as an early demonstration of drug activity.\n\n【29】Dose selection\n\n【30】Dose selection is crucial in GT drug development forrare diseases. The following principles are from FDA guidance ：\n\n【31】(i) Dose selection should be informed by all available sources of clinical information (e.g.， publications， experience with similar products and experience in related patient populations).\n\n【32】(iii))Leveraging non-human data obtained in animal models of disease and in vitro data maybe， in some cases， the only wayto estimate a starting effective human dose. Additional dosing information can be obtained from predictive models based on current understanding of in vitro enzyme kinetics，and allometric scaling.\n\n【33】(iii)For early-phase studies in subjects under serious conditions， it is better to start with a potentially therapeutic dose.\n\n【34】(iv) In practice， some GT products may have an extended duration of activity， so that repeated dosing may not be an acceptable risk until there is a preliminary understanding of the product's toxicity and duration of activity， and a comprehensive assessment of the product's immunogenicity.\n\n【35】Safety considerations\n\n【36】FDA indicates that the first necessity of designing a gene therapy clinical trial is to ensure the safety of patient subjects， and previous human experience of identical or similar gene therapy products can provide valuable reference. However， if few such experiences exist， it is dangerous to conduct large-scale first-in-human trials. To reduce the potential risk， FDA suggests sponsors stagger administration to consecutively enrolled subjects， followed by staggering between dose cohorts .\n\n【37】Immunogenicity is another factor that can affect safety. Thus， FDA implies that we should develop an effective test for specific immune reactions and keep paying attention to any immune responses against the proposed gene therapy drug during the whole process of the clinical trial . Moreover， possible long-term side effects resulted from gene engineering technology has always been contested. One gene therapy product might not expose safety issues until years later. Therefore， a long term follow-up survey for those patients who received the gene therapy is necessary .\n\n【38】FDA also notes that a complete protocol of gene therapy research should cover stopping rules， which require a forceful pause once any adverse events hope. These stopping criteria are significant to protect subjects from any unanticipated injury or safety threats .\n\n【39】Efficacy endpoints\n\n【40】An endpoint in a clinical trial is a measurable parameter (usually displays a patient’s physiological state) that could provide substantial evidence showing a clinical meaningful benefit of the drug/product. Selection of the primary efficacy endpoint is relevant to whether a drug can be approved. FDA proposes the following guidelines for appropriate endpoint selection for gene therapy rare diseases clinical trials： (i) Sponsors should understand the pathophysiology and natural history ofa disease as fully as possible at the outset of product development. Full understanding of disease pathophysiology is important in selection of endpoints or identifying potential surrogate endpoints which are especially helpful for sponsors who are considering seeking accelerated approval of a GT product.\n\n【41】(ii) Sponsors should identify specific aspects of the disease that are meaningful to the patient and might also be affected by the GT product's activity.\n\n【42】(iii) Considerable information can be gained by collecting clinical measurements repeatedly over time. Such a longitudinal profile allows the assessments of effect， largely based on within-patient changes， that otherwise could not be studied.\n\n【43】Patient experience\n\n【44】Since patient experience data may provide important additional information about the clinical benefit of a GT product， FDA encourages sponsors to collect patient experience data during product development， and to submit such data in the marketing application.\n\n【45】Statistical/Scientific Considerations\n\n【46】In addition to the above important elements to be considered， the following statistical considerations are necessarily implemented during the conduct of gene therapy rare diseases clinical trials.\n\n【47】Small sample size\n\n【48】In clinical research，power analysis is often performed for sample size calculation. The purpose is to achieve a desired power of correctly detecting a clinically meaningful difference at a pre-specified level of significance if such a difference truly exists. However， this method may not be appropriate for rare disease clinical trials due to limited available patients can be enrolled. To solve this problem， Huang and Chow proposed an innovative method based on a probability monitoring procedure to calculate the sample size in 2019 . The concept is to select an appropriate sample size for controlling the probability of crossing safety and/or efficacy boundaries at a pre-specified level of significance. For rare disease clinical development， an adaptive probability monitoring procedure may be applied if a multiple-stage adaptive trial design is used. More details regarding the probability monitoring procedure for sample size determination of rare diseases can be found in Huang and Chow .\n\n【49】Endpoint selection\n\n【50】In experimental treatment trials， the determination of a proper clinical endpoint is essential to project success since the endpoint or outcome provides evidence of whether a clinical benefit exists.A good endpoint should demonstrate both the safety and effectiveness of a proposed treatment with statistical significance and the treatment benefit must be clinically meaningful. In real cases， we sometimes find that there are multiple choices of clinically meaningful endpoints， all of which well measure or characterize the therapeutic effect of interest. Since the study endpoint is important for further decision of the sample size under a desired power， it is important to choose the primary endpoint which can best inform the disease status and measure the treatment effect. To better understand how to choose a primary study endpoint， the concept of therapeutic index was created by Chow and Huang. Each candidate endpoint is assigned a pre-specified weight based on previous observed -values and then apply a linear model to develop the therapeutic index function. More details regarding the development of therapeutic index can be found in Chow and Huang .\n\n【51】The use of biomarkers\n\n【52】A biomarker is a measurable characteristic which can reflect your physiological changes to a medical treatment (e.g. blood pressure). Since we do not have a full understanding of most rare diseases， using a biomarker as the endpoint might be more appropriate than a standard endpoint such as survival rate. There are several advantages of using biomarkers： (i) it is easily monitored and can be measured frequently during the whole trial， (ii) it is sensitive to minor treatment effect under a small sample size， (iii) it can predict/explore the promise of an investigational drug in early stage， and (iv) it may help accelerate the process of study and approval for the drug. In addition， biomarkers are able to guide adaptive trial designs . In some cases， the study treatment does not show significant improvement in general population but might be effective in a fraction of people who manifest some similar characteristics. Biomarkers can be utilized to identify the target population. Thus， under the assumption that there is a well-established relationship between a biomarker and clinical outcomes， the use of biomarker in rare disease clinical trials cannot only allow screening for possible responders at enrichment phase， but also provides the opportunity to detect signal of potential safety concerns early and provides supportive evidence of efficacy with a small number of patients available .\n\n【53】The Use of RWE for regulatory approval\n\n【54】FDA recommends proper use of Real-World Data (RWD) and Real-World Evidence (RWE) as support for regulatory decision making in clinical research. The 21 Century Cures Act， which was enacted back in 2016， turns the attention to the utilization of such data for the purpose of promoting approval of new therapy .\n\n【55】For example， advanced electronic tools， mobile devices and other healthcare applications allow people to generate massive amounts of valuable health data， which is an excellent complement to data generated from Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs). Although the real-world evidence is considered as a powerful support for regulatory decision making， the assessment of treatment benefit based on RWE could be biased due to lack of randomization and heterogeneity of RWD. Thus， in real clinical trials， where there are inconsistencies between RWE and substantial evidence， measures are needed to filter those qualified RWD and diminish the variability of RWD from standard substantial data for an accurate evaluation of the therapeutic benefit .\n\n【56】Demonstrate not-ineffectiveness\n\n【57】A standard statistical test to support the efficacy of the drug is to reject the null hypothesis of ineffectiveness， in turn； we can accept the alternative hypothesis of effectiveness. However， Chow and Huang challenged this interpretation， proposing that rejecting ineffectiveness implies not-ineffectiveness (or non-inferiority) instead of effectiveness (or superiority) . The concept of“not-ineffectiveness” should include \"inconclusiveness\"and\"effectiveness\". For this reason， Chow and Huang pointed out that effectiveness of the test treatment could be concluded iftwo conditions are met： (i) ineffectiveness is rejected；(ii) the probability of inconclusiveness is negligible. Chow and Huang have therefore developed a groundbreaking two-stage drug discovery trial method for rare diseases. At the first stage， employ a small number (n ) of patients from targeted population， then test for not-ineffectiveness at a pre-specified significance level. Note that ny may be determined by the probability monitoring procedure as mentioned in small sample size section. If the null hypothesis of ineffectiveness is rejected， move to the second stage. To achieve the statistical power (like 80% power)， N subjects are needed. It is suggested to recruit n， patients and borrow N-n2 data from Real-World Data (RWD) to eliminate inconclusiveness. If the test result indicates that the probability of inconclusiveness can be neglected(like<5%)， effectiveness of the studied therapeutic intervention under investigation is claimed .\n\n【58】Innovative trial design\n\n【59】As we mentioned before， small available sample is the main difficulty to conduct clinical study for rare diseases. Thus， it is impossible to use traditional clinical trial design methods to meet FDA's standards for approval of products for rare diseases. In some cases， we need to adopt some innovative trial designs which could help us obtain substantial evidence of effectiveness and safety of the product with small sample size. These innovative trial designs include， but are not limited to， the n-of-1 trial design， an adaptive trial design， master protocols， and a Bayesian design. The flexible use of combination of these innovative trial designs with the innovative thinking discussed earlier is not only to fix the dilemma of sample available (e.g.， n-of-1 trial design and master protocol) but also to ensure effectively， accurately， and reliably assess the treatment effect and increase the probability of success of the intended clinical trials(e.g.， adaptive trial design in conjunction with Bayesian approach for borrowing real-world data) .\n\n【60】Case Study-Approval of Luxturna\n\n【61】In this section， we will discuss a case study regarding gene therapy product Luxturna (voretigene neparvovec-rzyl) approved by the FDA on December 184， 2017. Luxturna is a novel gene therapy that was specifically developed for patients with an inherited retinal\n\n【62】Table 1： Efficacy results of the phase 3 study at year 1， compared to baseline.\n\n| Efficacy Outcomes  | LUXTURNAn=21  | Control n=10  | Difference (LUXTURNA minus Control)  | P-value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| MLMT score change using both eyes， median (min， max)  | 2  | 0  | 2  | 0.001  |\n| MLMT score change using the first treated eye， median (min，max)  | 2  | 0  | 2  | 0.003  |\n\n【64】Source： FDA Statistical and Clinical Reviews disorder resulted from biallelic RPE65 gene mutation. Luxturna is a major medical advance since it is the first gene therapy to be granted approval by FDA that targets on a single gene .\n\n【65】Background\n\n【66】Biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder often diagnosed in young children. Patients inherit one copy of mutated RPE65 gene from both parents (mutation site may be different). The function of RPE65gene is to make RPE65 protein， an enzyme involving in the visual cycle (converts light into electrical signals) which is important for normal vision. If two copies of RPE65 genes are mutated， the number of RPE65 proteins will rapidly decrease or disappear， resulting in the block of the visual cycle and causing visual impairment. The condition of vision loss will become worse with age， and the patients may even be totally blind in young adulthood. In the United States， almost 1，000 to 2，000 people are affected by eye diseases due to biallelic RPE65 mutation.\n\n【67】There was limited effective drug or treatment to cure the biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy prior to Luxturna. A common applied treatment is using the Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System， an artificial device that can help patients with blindness caused by outer retinopathy restore a basic vision. This device is first approved in the United States under a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) and is now commercially allowed in many countries. The Argus II System includes external components (a pair of glasses with camera and a portable computer) and internal components (a specific microelectrode implanted into eyes by surgery). The camera on the glasses can capture external images and the computer translates the light perception into electricalstimulation and is received by implanted electrode to activate retinal cells. The Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System is proved to be relatively safe and effective； however， the recovery of vision acuity varies in different patients .\n\n【68】The mechanism of Luxturna is to transmit a normal copy of the RPE65 gene directly to living retinal cells through a transformed adeno-associated virus as a vector. Thus， RPE65 proteins can be complemented and the visual cycle can continue again.\n\n【69】FDA review of clinical safety and efficacy\n\n【70】This section discusses the clinical trial program of Luxturna， including t thestudyydesign， important resultsand FDA's recommendations. The Luxturna regulatory approval is based on a clinical phase 1 analysis and a clinical phase 3 studies that established the key safety and efficacy proof for the BLA submission .\n\n【71】Phase 1 and phase 3 studies： The phase 1 study was an open-label， dose-escalation protection study in a total of 12 patients with reported retinal dystrophy associated with biallelic RPE65 mutations. Eleven of 12 patients with an injection time of 1.7 to 4.6 years received subretinal Luxturna injection to either eye. One patient got just one eye with a subretinal injection. Additionally， the Phase 1 analysis evaluated three doses and results indicated that no apparent dose\n\n【72】Table 2： Magnitude of MLMT score change using both eyes at year 1.\n\n| MLMT Score Change  | LUXTURNAn=21  | Control n=10  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | -0  | 3(30%)  |\n| 0  | 2(10%)  | 3(30%)  |\n| 1  | 8(38%)  | 3(30%)  |\n| 2  | 5(24%)  | 1(10%)  |\n| 3  | 5(24%)  | 0  |\n| 4  | 1(4%)  | 0  |\n\n【74】Source： FDA Statistical and Clinical Reviews that might affect safety， bioactivity， or preliminary efficacy. The high dose (1.5×10\" vector genome in an injection volume of 0.3 mL) was chosen for the phase 3 study.\n\n【75】The Phase 3 study was an open-label， randomized， controlled， cross-over trial. It was developed to test the effectiveness and efficacy of Luxturna sequential subretinal injection into each eye. Patients were randomized to either the Luxturna therapy group or the observational control group in a 2：1 ratio，and were monitored for the primary efficacy evaluation for duration of one year. After one year of study， patients in the control group were crossed over to receive Luxturna. The phase 3 study recruited 31 patients in the United States from two locations. At the stage of baseline evaluation， 21 of the 31participants were randomized to the therapy group with one drop. Ten patients were randomized to the control group with withdrawal of consent of one patient at the screening visit. A crossover study was conducted in the nine patients with one-year observation of Luxturna injection. The mean age was 15 years (4 to 44 years)， including 20(64%) pediatric patients (4 to 17 years) and 11 adult patients. The subretinal injection period ranged from 6 to 18 days for each patient's two eves.\n\n【76】Efficacy evaluation： The primary efficacy endpoint in the phase3 study was change in Multi-Luminance Mobility Testing (MLMT) performance from baseline to one vear after Luxturna administration. MLMT assessed the ability of a patient to traverse a course correctly and at a fair speed at various degrees of ambient light. The MLMT was measured at one or more of seven light levels， ranging from 400lux (corresponding to a brightly lit office) to 1 lux (corresponding to a moonless summer night)，using both eyes andeach eye independently. A score code ranging from 0 to 6 was assigned to each light level. A higher score implied that a patient was able to pass the test at a lower light level. Patients who did not pass MLMT in the brightest environment (400 lux) were given a score of -1. Each patient's MLMT was recorded and tested by independent， blinded graders. The MLMT score was the lowest light level at which the patient successfully passed the MLMT. Another parameter defined in this study is the MLMT score change from baseline to the end of study. An increase of the MLMT score suggested an improvement of eyesight. Additional efficacy endpoints included Full-Field Light Sensitivity Threshold(FST) and Visual Acuity (VA). The phase 1 and phase 3 regulatory review analyses are summarized below.\n\nThe results of the primary endpoint (MLMT score change) from | X180 X365 Study Duration (Days) Figure 1： MLMT time-course over two years (using both eyes).

A median MLMT score change of two and zero were observed in the Luxturna treatment group and control group， respectively， independent of the use of both eyes or the first-treated eye. An MLMT score change oftwo or greater is considered a clinically meaningful benefit for functional vision.\n\n【79】Table 2 and Table 3 illustrate the number and percentage of patients with different magnitudes of MLMT score change using both eyes and individual eyes， respectively， at year 1. If we consider both eyes， eleven patients (11/21，52%) in the Luxturna treatment group had an MLMT score change of two or greater， while only one patient(1/10，10%) in the control group had an MLMT score change of two， .\n\n【80】On the other hand， if we consider the first-treated eye and second-treated eye separately， fifteen patients (15/21，71%) in the Luxturna treatment group had an MLMT score change of two or greater， while no patient in the control group had a score change of 2 or greater.\n\n【81】Safety assessment： Twenty-seven (27/41，66%) ofthe 41 patients(12 from phase 1 and 29 from phase 3， totally 81 eyes) receiving Luxturna had ocular adverse reactions in 46 injected eyes (46/81，57%). The most common adverse reactions (incidence 2 5%) were conjunctival hyperemia， cataracts， increased intraocular pressure， retinal tears， dellen， macular hole， eye inflammation， macular breaks， subretinal deposits， eye irritation， eye pain， and maculopathies . Whether these ocular adverse symptoms are associated with injection of Luxturna is not clear. However， most of these adverse events were temporary and controllable. There were no deaths in the clinical studies. There were two serious adverse reactions， including (i) endophthalmitis (infection inside of the eye) with a series of subsequent complications， and (ii) loss of vision due to fovea thinning as a result of the subretinal injection. Systemic adverse events included hyperglycemia， nausea， vomiting， and leukocytosis. These systemic events were likely caused by systemic corticosteroid use and reactions to anesthesia.\n\n【82】As noted by the FDA， Luxturna subretinal injection should be given only to patients who have viable retinal cells as determined by the treating physician (s). Treatment with Luxturna must be done separately in each eye on separate days， with at least six days between surgical procedures. Patients should be treated with a short course of oral prednisone to limit the potential immune reaction.\n\n【83】Summary： The safety and efficacy of Luxturna were well established in a clinical trial with 41 patients aged between 4 and. All participants had confirmed biallelic RPE65 mutations. The primary efficacy endpoint of Luxturna was based on the phase 3 study with 31 participants by measuring the change from baseline to one year in a subject's ability to navigate an obstacle course at various light levels. The treatment group demonstrated significant improvements in their ability to complete the obstacle course at low light levels as compared to the control group. The most common adverse reactions， such as eye redness， cataract， can be mitigated by medical care.\n\n【84】Advisory committee recommendations\n\n【85】The Cellular， Tissue， and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee\n\n【86】Table 4： Ocular Adverse Reactions Following Treatment with Luxturna (N=41).\n\n| Adverse Reaction  | Patients n=41  | Treated Eyes n=81  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Any ocular adverse reaction  | 27 (66%)  | 46 (57%)  |\n| Conjunctival hyperemia  | 9(22%)  | 9(11%)  |\n| Cataract  | 8(20%)  | 15(19%)  |\n| Increased intraocular pressure  | 6(15%)  | 8(10%)  |\n| Retinal tear  | 4(10%)  | 4(5%)  |\n| Dellen (thining of the corneal stroma)  | 3(7%)  | 3(4%)  |\n| Macular hole  | 3(7%)  | 3(4%)  |\n| Subretinal deposits  | 3(7%)  | 3(4%)  |\n| Eye inflammation  | 2(5%)  | 4(5%)  |\n| Eye irritation  | 2(5%)  | 2(2%)  |\n| Eye pain  | 2(5%)  | 2(2%)  |\n| Maculopathy (wrinkling on the surface of the macula)  | 2(5%)  | 3(4%)  |\n| Foveal thinning and loss of foveal function  | 1(2%)  | 2(2%)  |\n| Endophthalmitis (infection inside of the eye)  | 1(2%)  | 1(1%)  |\n| Fovea dehiscence (separation of the retinal layers in the center of the macula)  | 1(2%)  | 1(1%)  |\n| Retinal hemorrhage  | 1(2%)  | 1(1%)  |\n\n【88】Note： Transient appearance of a ring-like deposit at the retinal injection site 1-6 days after injection without symptoms Source： Madified from the applicant's BLA submission (CTGTAC) evaluated the safety and effectiveness of Luxturna， giving several feedbacks. First， a 2-score increase of MLMT is clinical meaningful. Second， the potential risks of Luxturna are acceptable. Third， Luxturna may not work until 8 to 12 months of age because the retina has not been fully developed. Fourth， it should be considered if the efficacy of Luxturna declines over time. Consequently， the CTGTAC voted 16(Yes) to 0(No) in favor the approval of Luxturna.\n\n【89】Concluding Remarks\n\n【90】In this paper， a case study regarding Luxturna which is a gene therapy drug intended treating a rare disease of an inherited form of vision loss that may result in blindness. The FDA granted Luxturna(i) priority review， (ii) breakthrough therapy and (iii) orphan drug designations to assist the sponsor in Luxturna development. As discussed in Section 4， FDA's recommendation for regulatory approval of Luxturna was made based on a phase 1 clinical study and a phase 3 clinical study.\n\n【91】Although the CTGTAC voted for approval of Luxturna， several questions and concerns remain. These questions， which are likely to occur due to small sample size， include， but are not limited to (i) the treatment effect may have been contaminated by some covariates and/or interaction/confounding factors， (ii) no scientific/clinical or statistical justification for the selection endpoint and/or clinically meaningful difference， (iii) it is not clear that the study design can provide an accurate and reliable assessment of the treatment effect， and (iv) statistical methods for assessment of treatment may not be adequate (e.g.， shift analysis before and after treatment was not done). In addition， one of the major concerns is probably that whether the performance of Luxturna based on limited number of patients is not by chance alone and hence is reproducibility. Based on a quick assessment， the reproducibility probability was calculated based on the observed responses and the variability associated with the responses of the 31 subjects. The result indicates that there is a less than 60% probability of reproducibility if the study is conducted under similar experimental conditions in the future.\n\n【92】Thus， it is suggested that statistical considerations as described in Section 3 and some innovative thinking regarding study design and analysis should be taken into consideration when conducting rare diseases clinical trials.", "index": 31437, "show": true, "start": 31437, "end": 31498, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false, "comment": "【76】"}], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:42:17", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:43:29", "cost": 72.193}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:48", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:43:29", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:42:16"}

In the first case， the PT-INR value increased from 2.24 to 2.73 9 days after initiating erlotinib treatment in a 59-vear-old Japanese man receiving prophylactic warfarin therapy for cardiovascular disease. However， erlotinib did not adversely affect the hepatic function in this patient. In the second case， the PT-INR value increased from 1.58 to 7.54 7 days after initiating erlotinib treatment in a 61-vear-old Japanese man receiving prophylactic warfarin therapy for cerebral infarction； this was accompanied by bleeding diathesis (purpura). In both cases， PT-INR was well maintained by warfarin therapy prior to initiating erlotinib treatment.\n\n【2】Our experience with these cases underlines the importance of the careful monitoring of the PT-INR value and appropriate adjustment of warfarin dosage in patients receiving concomitant erlotinib and warfarin therapy.\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Drug interactions can cause many clinical complications， particularly when drugs are co小一administered with anticancer agents. Erlotinib， a reversible epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is commonly used to treat advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Warfarin， an anticoagulant， interacts with various drugs， resulting in altered effects.\n\n【5】Thromboembolic phenomena， such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism， commonly occur in cancer patients and often necessitate prophylactic anticoagulant therapy with warfarin . Owing to the interaction of several drugs with warfarin and the large inter-individual variability in pharmacodynamics， warfarin dosage must be adjusted according to the prothrombin time-international normalized ratio (PT-INR) in individual patients.\n\n【6】The prescription information for erlotinib treatment includes a precaution for patients on concomitant warfarin therapy owing to the associated risk of elevated PT-INR values. However，the underlying mechanism of this interaction is unknown. Although a few reports have described the interaction between gefitinib and warfarin ， the interaction between warfarin and erlotinib is not well characterized. Here we report two patients with lung cancer， who exhibited an increase in the PT-INR values after concomitant administration of erlotinib and warfarin.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】Case 1\n\n【9】A 59-year-old Japanese man was diagnosed as having lung non-squamous cell adenocarcinoma(stageIV：T1N3M1). He was maintained on a regular warfarin therapy (3.5 mg daily) for prophylaxis from cardiac infarction. After three courses of chemotherapy with carboplatin and pemetrexed， he exhibited a grade 3 reduction in hemoglobin and a decline in renal function. Therefore， second-line chemotherapy was initiated with erlotinib at the dose of 150 mg daily (day 1). His PT-INR value was relatively stable (2.4) and the daily warfarin dosage was maintained at 3.5 mg for at least 3 months before erlotinib was initiated. Nine days after initiating erlotinib therapy，the patient’s PT-INR value increased from 2.24 to 2.73. Therefore， starting from day9， the warfarin dose was decreased to 2.5 mg daily. On day 13， his PT-INR value restored to 2.24， and he continued receiving warfarin at the dose of 2.5 mg . Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)， alanine aminotransferase (ALT)， serum creatinine (SCr)， and serum albumin (Alb) levels did not change after treatment with erlotinib. There were no changes in diet or severe episodes of nausea or vomiting.\n\n【10】Case 2\n\n【11】A 61-year-old Japanese man was diagnosed as having lung non-squamous cell adenocarcinoma (stage IV： T4N3M1). He was on warfarin therapy for multiple cerebral infarcts. Warfarin dosage was adjusted to maintain a target PT-INR value of 2.5. His PT-INR value was relatively stable (1.5) when 3 mg warfarin was administered daily for at least 1 month before initiating the sixth-line chemotherapy comprising a daily dose of 150-mg erlotinib (day1). On day 19， before initiating erlotinib therapy， his PT-INR value was 2.86； thus， warfarin dose was reduced to 2 mg. On day 9， before initiating erlotinib therapy， the PT-INR value was still high (2.79)， which warranted a further dose reduction to 1 mg. On day 1， after initiating erlotinib， the PT-INR value decreased to 1.58； thus， from day 2， warfarin dosage was increased to 2 mg daily.\n\n【12】However， 7 days after initiating erlotinib therapy， the PT-INR value increased to 7.54 . The patient developed purpura on the arms. Warfarin was discontinued， and the anticoagulant effect was rapidly reversed by administering subcutaneous phytonadione. Owing to the decline in the renal and hepatic functions (day 1： SCr，1.09 mg/dL； AST， 49U/mL； ALT，29 U/mL→ day 7： SCr， 1.52 mg/dL； AST，99U/mL；ALT，46U/mL)，erlotinib treatment was discontinued. Three days later (day 10)， the PT-INR value decreased to 3.3. Both patients took the prescribed warfarin dose every day without fail.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Owing to the relatively advanced age at the diagnosis of lung cancer， most patients are likely to receive anticoagulant therapy for pre-existing cardiovascular diseases . Prophylactic or therapeutic warfarin therapy is often recommended for cancer patients. Warfarin has a narrow therapeutic index， which makes it the third most common drug responsible for hospital admissions because of adverse drug effects . The interaction of several drugs with warfarin elevates the risk of thrombotic or hemorrhagic events in such patients . We report two cases wherein the co-administration of erlotinib and warfarin potentiated the effect of warfarin.\n\n【15】In case 1， the PT-INR value increased 9 days after initiating erlotinib treatment. Kelly S et al.  demonstrated an increase in the PT-INR value 7 days after initiating erlotinib， which necessitated a decrease in the warfarin dose. As a result， in this case， the first blood examination was performed on day 5， when the PT-INR value was relatively stable. However， blood examination at an earlier stage is required to establish the time-point at which the PT-INR value begins to rise after initiating erlotinib along with warfarin therapy. In case2， warfarin dosage was increased at the time of initiating erlotinib， which resulted in a sudden increase in the PT-INR value. If a sudden decline in the renal or hepatic functions causes a sudden rise in the PT-INR value， as in this case， it is necessaryto consider an increase in the warfarin concentration in the blood.\n\n【16】The exact mechanism underlying this interaction is yet unknown； however， it is possibly related to a decrease in warfarin metabolism via the inhibition of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system by erlotinib or one of its metabolites. Warfarin is present as a racemic mixture， with each enantiomer differentially metabolized by the liver microsomal system. The R-enantiomer is metabolized by CYP1A2/3A4， whereas the S-enantiomer is primarily metabolized by CYP2C9. The efficacy of warfarin is mainly affected by the altered metabolism of the S-enantiomer； however， the R-form has a longer half-life and is a noncompetitive inhibitor of S-warfarin metabolism by CYP2C9 . Erlotinib is metabolized in the liver， mainly by cytochrome CYP 3A4/3A5， and to a lesser extent， by CYP1A1/1A2. Because the metabolizing enzyme of erlotinib resembles that of the R-form of warfarin， it is likely that the competitive inhibition of warfarin metabolism is responsible for the increase in the warfarin concentration in the blood. It is interesting that afatinib was hardly metabolized by CYP， unlike other EGFR-TKIs. Future data on the concomitant administration of afatinib and warfarin may help elucidate the mechanism of interaction between warfarin and EGFR-TKIs.\n\n【17】According to the package inserts of warfarin and erlotinib， both drugs are highly plasma protein bound (warfarin： 97%， erlotinib：95%). According to the product information of erlotinib， an in vitro study that examined the impact of erlotinib on the plasma protein binding of warfarin showed a little effect on the binding capacity of warfarin； the underlying mechanism of this interaction is unclear. It is likely that erlotinib may also compete with warfarin for the albumin-binding sites， which may result in elevated levels of unbound warfarin， and a consequent potentiation of hypoprothrombinemia. Therefore， pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions seem to occur between erlotinib and warfarin. Liver disease， kidney disease， and hypoalbuminemia are known risk factors for bleeding in patients on warfarin therapy . In the phase I pharmacokinetic studies of erlotinib， patients with renal dysfunction could tolerate 150 mg of erlotinib daily and were found to have erlotinib clearance similar to that in patients with normal renal function. However， patients with hepatic dysfunction should receive a lower dose consistent with their reduced clearance . In case 1， the co-administration of warfarin and erlotinib did not affect the renal and hepatic functions； however， in case 2， a decline in the renal and hepatic functions occurred after initiating erlotinib. Therefore， this probably shows the potential influence oferlotinib on the decline in the hepatic functions. Camidge et al.  demonstrated an increase in the area under the curve of warfarin when warfarin and capecitabine were co-administered. We did not measure the warfarin concentrations in the blood in the two cases. It is likely that erlotinib increased the warfarin concentrations in the blood via the inhibition of its metabolism by CYP 3A4， which potentiated its anti-coagulant effects. Warfarin therapy has a detrimental effect on cancer patients. During warfarin maintenance therapy， approximately one-third of the patients experience side effects， such as recurrence and bleeding . In a recent study， erlotinib alone or in combination with bevacizumab， as the first-line therapy， was shown to have a favorable effect in patients with advanced NSCLC . Bevacizumab therapy is associated with a risk of bleeding. Therefore， the screening of patients on warfarin therapy is of key importance prior to initiating erlotinib. The concomitant administration of erlotinib and warfarin requires patient education regarding the risk of bleeding and the need for a close monitoring of PT-INR for necessary warfarin dose adjustment.\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】The concomitant administration of erlotinib aniddwartarin resulted in an increase in the PT-INR values， which suggests the need for the careful monitoring of the PT-INR values and appropriate adjustment ofwarfarin dosage.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:36:41", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:36:52", "cost": 11.818}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:48", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:36:52", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:36:40"}

These include reduced appetite， constipation， palpitations， postural hypotension and urinary retention， which are well recognized. There has been concern recently about regular intravenous use especially using central lines with extravasation and line erosion， probably due to the low pH of the preparation.\n\n【2】We present two patients with gastroparesis and persistent nausea unresponsive to oral anti-emetics treated with long term intramuscular or subcutaneous Cyclizine. This resulted in long-term skin and subcutaneous changes and the development of significant soft tissue abscess formation， each requiring extensive surgery for drainage.\n\n【3】Conclusion： Intramuscular or subcutaneous Cyclizine， in addition to other side effects and risks， may be associated with skin changes at the site of repeated injection and the development of abscesses. Regular intramuscular or subcutaneous Cyclizine should be avoided if possible.\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Cyclizine is a widely used histamine H1 receptor antagonist of the piperazine class which is characterized by a low incidence of drowsiness. It possesses anticholinergic and antiemetic properties . Its proposed mechanism ofaction， as an anti-emetic， is byincreasing lower esophageal sphincter tone and reducing the sensitivity of the labyrinthine apparatus. It may inhibit the part of the midbrain known collectively as the emetic centre.\n\n【6】Cyclizine has a variety of documented side effects， these include but are not limited to； reduced appetite，palpitations， postural hypotension， urinary retention and agitation via its anti-cholinergic properties. In addition， it has been recognized as a drug that can be abused； when taken orally or intravenously and causes a \"high and on occasions have a hallucinogenic effect.\n\n【7】Cyclizine has a low pH of approximately 3.3 to 3.7 when undiluted； this is thought to be contributory to its vascular irritating effects. Some guidelines have suggested that solutions with a pH<5 are unsuitable for peripheral administration due to the risk of vessel irritation； however， this has been debated .\n\n【8】The use of subcutaneous Cyclizine is widely recognized and studied within the palliative care setting. One retrospective study assessing the use of syringe drivers in palliative care denotes subcutaneous infusion of Cyclizine as high risk in relation to injection site reactions. This study proposes that infusions including Cyclizine are approximately five times more likely to cause injection site reactions， although the use of Cyclizine alone and/or the long term effects of such administration have not been greatly studied .\n\n【9】In patients with long term venous catheters there are increasing concerns over the effects of Cyclizine on the catheter with reports of increased line occlusion， fracture from unblocking and a signal of increased line infection rates. A recent BAPEN position statement advises， based on these risks， that other anti-emetics be used preferentially .\n\n【10】A search conducted of the yellow card drug analysis reports on the MHRA website revealed 29reports of site reactions upon giving Cyclizine via the intramuscular or subcutaneous route. The reactions reported include but were not limited to skin necrosis， embolia cutis medicamentosa and chemical burns. From these reports 5 of are recorded as necrosis and 1 as ulcer， all of the 29 reports relating to skin reactions were single active constituent reports . A literature review conducted using Medline， Embase and Pubmed demonstrated that the effects of long term subcutaneous Cyclizine injections have not been widely studied. However one other case report published in the American Journal of Dermatology makes reference to the potential risk of embolia cutis medicamentosa seen with a patient using subcutaneous Cyclizine， although no clear reference to Cyclizine is made when discussing the potential mechanism by which this reaction occurred. The search terms used for the review included “Cyclizine，“subcutaneous”，“intramuscular”， “injection site reaction” and“abscess”.\n\n【11】Case Presentation\n\n【12】We describe two patients who were taking regular intramuscular or subcutaneous Cyclizine for refractory， intractable nausea despite trials of oral medications. Both patients were advised against regular long-term use however they wished to continue initially due to the relief from this very troubling symptom. Both patients have given written permission for their details to be published.\n\n【13】First patient：EB is a 65 year old female whopresented with nausea and vomiting leading to dehydration and admission to hospital. She had been fit and well following treatment for breast cancer until she had 4 episodes of pancreatitis. This left her with severe abdominal pain that only gained relief with opiate based painkillers. She was not diabetic. After thorough investigation a diagnosis of opiate induced pan-enteric gut dysmotility was made. Her gastroparesis persisted despite a gastric pacemaker. She maintained her nutritional state without the need for tube feeding or parenteral nutrition. Several anti-emetic regimes were trialed and the patient found symptomatic relief from intramuscular Cyclizine. She took this as required at least once a day if not more often.\n\n【14】After around 12 months the patient started to develop skin changes around the injection sites in her thighs， the skin being indurated and firm. The patient was advised to discontinue subcutaneous injections. An ultrasound scan of the areas suggested that fat necrosis secondary to the injections was the most likely diagnosis. Around6months later the patient developed a significant abscess of the right buttock that required drainage. An attempt was made to treat this conservatively. However she had ongoing discharge and abscess， the abscess culture grew Klebsiella preumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis. She was referred to the plastic surgeons that performed a surgical excision and repair without grafting on this area， requiring an 8 day admission.\n\n【15】After this surgery she had a Staphylococcus aureus skin infection. Her right thigh wound then dehisced. Curettage and washout was attempted once but again she subsequently required excision of the abscess down to the muscle fascia and the histology showed “necrosis and inflammation and granulation tissue in keeping with an injection site\". This resulted in a 6 day admission.\n\n【16】These abscesses were around the site of her intramuscular injections. The opinion ofthe operating surgeon， given the fat necrosis at the site， was that the cause of the abscesses was the Cyclizine. Through this period of time she was not immunosuppressed. The patient has subsequently been managed with oral anti-emetics and has not had any further problems with abscesses. The patient was around 75 kg in weight and so although this patient was prescribed intramuscular Cyclizine it is likely that much ofthe drug was delivered into the subcutaneous space.\n\n【17】Second patient： JR was at presentation a 68 year old female patient with Polyglucosan body myopathy causing Gastroparesis and small bowel dysmotility. Her past medical history was of osteoarthritis and hypertension. She had no obvious cause for immune-compromise or diabetes. Her malnutrition as a result of her gut dysmotility was initially managed via a surgically placed jejunostomy； however， she required progression to parenteral nutrition as she was unable to tolerate feeding via the jejunostomy. Nausea continued to be a prominent symptom despite adequate nutrition.\n\n【18】Oral anti-emetics had proven to provide very little benefit for treating her nausea. She had a trial of a variety of anti-emetics via subcutaneous infusion， with Cyclizine providing the best symptom relief. Over time the patient also developed skin changes with firm induration at the injection sites.\n\n【19】The patient subsequently developed an abscess on the left arm and the left lower quadrant of her abdomen. She was admitted for 8 days and treated with IV antibiotics (teicoplanin and clindamycin). These abscesses then required surgical drainage， culture from the abscesses was positive for Staphylococcus aureus. The patient has subsequently managed Octreotide as sub-cutaneous injections without problem.\n\n【20】Discussion\n\n【21】In additiontotheknown side-effects of Cyclizine these case reports demonstrate that long term Cyclizine use through the intramuscular or subcutaneous route can be associated with skin changes and then the risk of deep abscess formation requiring surgical drainage. The patients presented were not immunosuppressed and did not have diabetes. It is important to consider other potential factors such as poor injection technique although the patients in these cases had managed other subcutaneous drugs without issue.\n\n【22】The presumed mechanism of action is likely similar to the problems seen with intravenous use. LowpH causes skin necrosis and fibrosis and allows secondary infection. The pH of Cvclizine is 3.3 to3.7. Intramuscular and subcutaneous preparations are typically not diluted to keep the volume to a minimum.\n\n【23】There are no current comments in the prescribing license for Cyclizine for its use subcutaneously. Anecdotal reports to the authors suggest that this complication of long-term subcutaneous Cyclizine injections may be relatively common although not reported in the medical or pharmacological literature.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:44:00", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:44:14", "cost": 14.801}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:48", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:44:14", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:43:59"}

The adverse effect of rhabdomyolysis， in which there is muscle necrosis， is rare and only occurs in 0.04% to 0.2% of patients using statin as the single lipid lowering agent.\n\n【2】This report reviews a case of a 75 year old lady presenting post three month ofhigh dose statin use， after being stable on a lower dose for several years， with anuric renal failure secondary to severe necrotizing myostitis (creatine kinase >97 500 U/L). She pre-morbidly had a normal renal function， with no documented episodes of acute kidney injury prior to this admission. After five weeks on hemodialysis， she had renal recovery.Histopathology on renal biopsy confirmed tubulo-toxic injury secondary to myoglobin deposition and cast formation. Similarly， muscle biopsy histopathology demonstrated toxin-mediated muscle necrosis.\n\n【3】Though similar cases have previously been reported in literature， there is none of this severity. Usually， there is quick recovery ofrenal function with statin cessation and intravenous fluid therapy. Also of interest was her apparent lack of risk factors-barring gender and age， this lady had not been on any common cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors apart from ticagrelor. Statin and anti-platelet agents are very commonly used together， raising a fascinating learning point both in medication prescribing with attention to medication interactions as well as management of morbidity and mortality within a spectrum of commonly known adverse effects.\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Hydroxymethylglutaryl Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors， commonly known as statins， are well recognized in the management of hyperlipidemia and are also recognized as having additional cardiovascular benefits . Whilst statins are relatively well tolerated， two significant adverse effects are that of hepatotoxicity and skeletal muscle injury which can range from myalgias to myopathy. The latter is defined as an increase in serum creatinine kinase of at least ten-fold， and this occurs in 0.5% to 1% of patients with a dose related effect .\n\n【6】The progression of myopathy to rhabdomyolysis， in which there is muscle necrosis， occurs in 0.04% to 0.2% of patients using statin as the single lipid lowering agent . The incidence of fatal rhabdomyolysis is reported at the rate of 0.15 deaths per one million prescriptions . Rhabdomyolysis is a clinical and biochemical syndrome encompassing acute renal injury as a result of renal tubule deposition of myoglobin， cardiac abnormalities and compartment syndrome secondary to skeletal muscle damage， and biochemically resulting in release of creatinine kinase， creatinine， potassium， uric acid， myoglobin， calcium and phosphate .\n\n【7】Here we discuss an interesting case of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure after increase in statin dose with concurrent use of ticagrelor.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】We present a 75 year old Maltese lady， Ms DC， premorbid independent living at home alone admitted after a fall， and with only fifteen minutes spent on the floor before rescue. Past medical history was significant for acute myocardial infarction three months prior which had been managed with percutaneous coronary intervention. She also had a longstanding history of hypertension， osteoarthritis， depression and cataract removal. Her medications consisted of atorvastatin 80 mg， twice daily metoprolol 50 mg and ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily， and daily dosing of amlodipine 5 mg； aspirin 100 mg； amitriptyline 50 mg and perindopril 5 mg. During her admission with myocardial infarction， the atorvastatin dosage had been increased from 40 mg to80 mg and she had been commenced on ticagrelor. Prior to this she had been tolerating atorvastatin at the dose of 40 mg for many years without any reported side effects and had no previous evidence of acute or chronic kidney disease previously.\n\n【10】Ms DC was referred to her local hospital for further management of progressive generalized weaknessS. Initial examination demonstrated significant lower limb predominant weakness with3/5 power bilaterally. Biochemistry showed an acute kidney injury with creatinine 404 umol/L， urea 17 mmol/L and eGFR of 9 with a metabolic acidosis. Urinalysis revealed greater than 1000×10/L of both erythrocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Other results of significance on admission included：Hemoglobin 132 g/L， white cell count 15 ×10/L (neutrophils 11.6×10/L)， CRP 73 mg/L， INR 1.6. Ms DC deteriorated over a period of several days with predominant hypothermia， hypotension and anuria. She was commenced on inotropes and intravenous antibiotics and transferred to a tertiary facility for Intensive Care unit (ICU) admission.\n\n【11】The working diagnosis at the time was acute tubular necrosis secondary to sepsis. She was commenced on Continuous Veno-Venous Hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF). Creatinine kinase on ICU admission was greater than 25， 000 U/L， continuing to rise over the subsequent days to 97， 500 U/L. On serial examination， there was progressive bilateral upper and lower limb proximal weakness. Vasculitis and glomerulonephritis screens were negative.\n\n【12】There was concern for a necrotizing myositis given the severity of the renal failure. An MRI-guided muscle biopsy of vastus medialis was done. Histology demonstrated an extensive rhabdomyolysis process most consistent with a toxic pathology rather than autoimmune， and the imaging was also consistent with a myopathic process.\n\n【13】Correlating with this biopsy finding， myositis antibodies(including Ro-52， PM-Scl 100， JO-1 antibodies as well anti SRP) were negative. HMG-CoA reductase antibody was also negative. Renal biopsy showed a tubulo-toxic process secondary to myoglobin-related cast formation.\n\n【14】After five weeks on dialysis， Ms DC began producing urine with return of renal function to normal. Renal replacement therapy was ceased and the patient was transferred to sub-acute care for rehabilitation .\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】The severe rhabdomyolysis demonstrated in this case is attributed to the increased dose ofatorvastatin andconcomitant use of ticagrelor， a medication that also utilizes the CYPP4503A4 pathway.\n\n【17】The cytochromeeP450 3A4 pathway allowsforSstatin glucuronidation which is necessary for statin clearance. When this pathway is occupied by other metabolites it leads to increased serum statin levels . In a review of cases of rhabdomyolysis submitted to the United States Food and Drug Administration， over 50% of cases were attributable to the additional use of medications which share this pathway . Common medications associated with increased risk of rhabdomyolysis when used in conjunction with statins include fibrates， cyclosporine， macrolide antibiotics， warfarin， digoxin and antifungals .\n\n【18】Typically， cessation of the statin in combination with intravenous fluids and， in rare cases， a short course of renal replacement therapy is sufficient . Unal et al.  describe two cases in which both patients detailed required four to five sessions of hemodialysis before there was renal recovery. Similarly， in another case reported by Ram et al. ， only seven sessions of hemodialysis were required before adequate urine output was noted. Panchangam et al. presents an account of rhabdomyolysis in a 57 vear old male with need for hemodialysis for more than 2 weeks.\n\n【19】A similar case to this has been found， where an elderly female patienttpresentedwith statin-induced myositis attributed commencing ticagrelor and atorvastatin 80 mg daily two months prior to presentation. However， in that case， the patient recovered after statin was withheld and intravenous fluids instituted without need for renal replacement therapy .\n\n【20】This case is unusual as Ms DC required prolonged dialysis prior to renal recovery despite early statin cessation. This raised the question of an alternative pathology， leading to further investigation for autoimmune myositis or an immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy. However，serum and histopathological evidence demonstrated only a severe toxin-mediated myositis.\n\n【21】Potentiaallcontributors tO the severity ofthis case of rhabdomyolysis included her older age， female sex， increased dose of statin and addition of ticagrelor. Other known risk factors include diabetes， chronic kidney or liver disease and hypothyroidism，though these were not an issue for this patient . Atorvastatin at the 80 mg dose is also known to have a higher risk of adverse effects .\n\n【22】This case raised a timely reminder to all medical practitioners to be cautious on up-titration of statins. It is important to carefully consider risk factors and potential contraindicated medications， as rarely rhabdomyolysis can be fatal and， as seen in this case， can lead to significant morbidity. However， despite the severity of rhabdomyolysis seen here， when treated early can still lead to good renal recovery.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:18:17", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:18:52", "cost": 34.983}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:48", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:18:53", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:18:17"}

The patient consulted at the local hospital， and symptoms did not improve after symptomatic treatment with acid suppression and gastric protection，later on consulted our hospital.\n\n【7】Past medical history： Physically healthy in the past， denied history of hypertension， diabetes mellitus， coronary heart disease， chronic bronchitis， gallstones， cholecystitis， hepatitis， tuberculosis and other infectious diseases， no history of surgery， no history of blood transfusion.\n\n【8】Personal history： Born locally， deny history of smoking， drinking， exposure to radioactive substances and chemical toxins.\n\n【9】Marital history： Menstrual history， and family history had no special findings.\n\n【10】Physical examination： Normal vital signs， no special cardiopulmonary and neurological investigations，anemic appearance，abdominaltenderness，subxiphoid andperiumbilicaltenderness， no rebound pain， liver and spleen not detected，normal bowel sounds， no significant edema in both lower limbs. The patient was admitted to the hospital and the relevant examination indicators were completed； abnormal indicators included； Hemoglobin 102 g/L， ALT 982 U/L， AST 636 U/L； the remaining indicators viral examination four items， blood coagulation functions， hepatitis screening， autoimmune liver disease antibody， hepatitis B five，troponin， D2-aggregates， amylase，CRP，lactate， AFP， CA125， CA199 showed no significant abnormalities. The electrocardiogram result was normal. The abdominal ultrasound showed mild fatty liver. The patient was admitted to the hospital with the following diagnoses； poor appetite or anorexia to be investigated，abdominal pain to be investigated， liver insufficiency， anemia， and fatty liver.\n\n【11】After admission， the patient was administered symptomatic treatment such as conventional acid suppression， gastric protection and liver protection， but the abdominal pain did not ease and tended to worsen， tossed and turned at night， making it difficult to sleep. The patient's appetite was getting worse and worse， portrayed a melancholic painful face. On physical examination， the abdomen was tender， the abdominal muscles were not tense， there was pressure pain around the epigastric regions and around the umbilicus， there was no rebound pain， Murphys sign was negative， McBurneys pressure pain was negative， an emergency abdominal CT was performed and revealed the following A small amount of pelvic effusion， basically excluding perforation， appendicitis， cholecystitis，pancreatitis，etc.Omeprazole Was administered for sedation， and the patient's symptoms were relieved after sedation， but the effect of the drug disappeared and the patient's above symptoms returned!\n\n【12】What the hell is this disease? Through comprehensive analysis of the causes of abdominal pain in patients， the following diseases need to be differentiated：\n\n【13】Acute myocardiallinfarction， aorticCcoarct： The patient's electrocardiogram， troponin is normal， the difference in blood pressure between the upper extremities is notlarge， and cardiovascular disease is discharged after consultation with cardiology.\n\n【14】Arterial embolism： Common pulmonary embolism， generally patients with respiratory distress， often with a history of long-term bed rest， atrial fibrillation， etc.， according to the patient's age， past history， the acute intestinal obstruction， intestinal perforation： The patient has a soft abdomen， the anus can vent and defecate， and a small amount of pelvic fluid can be seen in the abdominal CT，which can be ruled out after consultation with gastrointestinal surgery， acute pancreatitis， acute cholecystitis， acute appendicitis： According to the patient s signs， blood tests， and imaging examinations can be ruled out； acute gastritis， peptic ulcer： The patient s abdominal pain is relieved between giving gastroscopy examination shows chronic non-atrophic gastritis. The patient can be excluded basically.\n\n【15】Causes of liver insufficiency：\n\n【16】1. Infection： The patient's viral four item examination， hepatitis B five item examination， hepatitis screening can exclude viral， the patient does not have a history of water contact in infected areas， basically can exclude parasitic infections.\n\n【17】2. History of drug use： The patient complained of no previous history of exposure to special drugs and chemicals and food intake history， so temporarily can be ruled out.\n\n【18】3. The patient does not have a history of alcohol consumption； alcoholic can be ruled out.\n\n【19】4. Genetic metabolism and immunity： The patient Family history of special genetic disease， autoimmune antibodies and other indicators are not significantly abnormal， can be ruled out for the time being.\n\n【20】Mild anemia： It may be related to the patient 's poor appetite and malnutrition in recent times.\n\n【21】After six days ofsymptomatic treatment with sedation， gastric protection and liver protection， the patient's liver function was rechecked： ALT 465 U/L. The patient's transaminases were significantly better than before， but the patient’s abdominal pain was en. still recurrent and tended to worsen， so the patient was advised to seek further consultation at a higher-level hospital to clarify the cause of abdominal pain.\n\n【22】However， five days later， we saw this patient again in the outpatient clinic with a painful face and hands over the abdomen， asking to be hospitalized. Since the diagnosis was still not clear at the provincial hospital， the patient had to return to our hospital and asked for pain relief. After repeated questioning of the patient's medical history and detailed examination of the patients body， it was found that there were black dirt deposits in the patient's fingernails， and that the patient was a hairdresser by profession who often dyed hair for customers and did not pay attention to hygiene protection， but had no history of exposure to other substances. The patient was urgently administered 6 tests of trace elements， and the value of the test was： Blood lead 446 ug/L (normal reference value 0 ug/L to 100ug/L)， which was much higher than the test value after repeated dilution by the laboratory. Up to this point the patient s abdominal pain and liver insufficiency could be explained. The patient was also administered edetate sodium injection 1 g daily， added into 250 ml glucose injection， IV for 4 h to 8 h for three days， stopping for four days as a course of treatment， and with oral lead detoxification drugs， after about 2 courses of treatment， the patient's abdominal pain symptoms were relieved，eating gradually resumed， andliver function was significantly better than before， and discharged from the hospital with oral lead detoxification drugs， and the patient s blood lead was98 ug/L after one month follow-up， hemoglobin The patient's blood lead was 98 ug/L， hemoglobin and liver function were normal， and the symptoms returned to normal.\n\n【23】Discussion\n\n【24】Lead has toxic effects on all tissues and organs ofthe body， mainly on the nervous， digestive and hematopoietic systems . Lead can disruptthe normal function of excitation and inhibition ofthe cerebral cortex， impair cortical-visceral regulation， and reduce peripheral Inerve conduction speed. When lead enters the human body， it mainly causes anemia due to impaired hemoglobin synthesis， abdominal pain due to vasospasm due to impaired porphyrin metabolism， impairment of y-aminobutyric acid function， and damage to the nervous system . Lead can cause abnormal metabolism of amino Ketovalericacid，which leadsto accumulation and oxidation ofoxygen radicals and damage to hepatocytes. In addition， blood lead can enhance the expression of apoptosis protein， which directly damages hepatocytes and causes spasm of small arteries in the liver，resulting in local ischemia and liver damage . The main manifestation of lead poisoning in the gastrointestinal tract is sudden onset of abdominal colic， which is severe and unbearable， the pain is mostly around the umbilicus， but also in the upper and lower abdomen； during the attack， there is anxiety， cold sweat， no fixed pressure point in the abdomen， no rebound pain，accompanied by nausea and vomiting， and the bowel sounds can be normal. Generally，the normal adult blood lead level is less than 100 ug/L. In this case， the patient's occupation is hairdresser and hair dyeing， and she has long-term contact with hair dye ， and the hair dye contains lead acetate， if the content exceeds the national standard， it can enter the blood through the skin， respiratory tract and gastrointestinal mucosa， causing lead poisoning. Combined with the patient’s clinical manifestations and auxiliary examinations suggesting anemia and liver function damage， the blood lead level is still several times higher than the normal value even though the patient's blood lead is diluted several times， so the diagnosis of chronic severe lead poisoning is confirmed， and the effect of lead expulsion treatment is obvious， and this case is in line with the above characteristics. Since lead poisoning is an occupational disease and the diagnosis is identified by the specialized occupational disease control institute， the receiving physicians lacked knowledge of the clinical manifestations of lead poisoning， and coupled with the patient's repeated episodes of periumbilical colic and the poor effect of general symptomatic treatment， they mostly considered surgical diseases and did not consider lead poisoning， resulting in misdiagnosis. The misdiagnosis in this case lasted for 10 days.\n\n【25】Reasons for misdiagnosis andlessons learned：\n\n【26】1. The medical history is not comprehensive enough， especially for those who have recurrent episodes of abdominal colic and the diagnosis is not clear， the patient's past history and occupational exposure history should be carefully inquired， and the patient's history of exposure to lead-containing substances is the most critical factor suggesting chronic lead poisoning .\n\n【27】2. Many physicians in general hospitals do not know enough about this disease， and they should consider not only common and multiple diseases but also rare and uncommon diseases when diagnosing.\n\n【28】3. The health department should train medical personnel in general hospitals on heavy metal poisoning. The identification should be enhanced in order to avoid misdiagnosis and pain to patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:43:31", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:44:46", "cost": 74.312}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:48", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:44:45", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:43:30"}

The fenestration of the SVC-RA patch played a role in decompression of SVC to reduce Central Venous Pressure (CVP). Meanwhile， it could be an entrance for stent placement， avoiding needle acupuncture and laser burning. The fenestration of the RA-IVC patch not only introduced the blood flow from the IVC into the RA， but also supported the fixation of the stent.\n\n【3】Results： During the hospitalization， the postoperative blood oxygen saturation (SaO2) of both children maintained above 85% and the CVP remained at 15 mmHg and 14 mmHg， respectively. Long-term follow-up after discharge， these two children were with a good quality of life.\n\n【4】Conclusion： We modified the traditional Glenn treatment.

In order to avoid trauma accumulation， postoperative adhesions， long Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB) time and other issues caused by repeated surgeries， the second stage of Total Cavo-Pulmonary Connection (TCPC) is often finished by the use of minimally invasive intervention. Although Hybrid Fontan surgery holds many advantages， in fact， this method has not been widely adopted yet. This is partly due to the high threshold of intervention. Therefore， we modified the traditional Glenn procedure and carried out two clinical cases successfully.\n\n【9】Surgical Techniques\n\n【10】The first child was 2 years old and diagnosed with “tricuspid valve atresia， atrial septal defect， ventricular septal defect\". The second child was 2 years old and diagnosed with “pulmonary atresia， ventricular septal defect， patent ductus arteriosus， atrial septal defect\". They were admitted into our hospital in November，2015 and December，2017， respectively.\n\n【11】After obtaining approvals from Shanghai Children’s Medical Center Research Advisory Committee and the consents of parents， we performed the modified Bidirectional Glenn procedure (BDG) on November 10， 2015 and December 11， 2017. The schematic diagram was shown in Figure 1A， the intubation between ascending aorta and RA was established for CPB after heparinization. The azygos vein was ligated and the aorta was blocked. A small incision in RA was made to expose the SVC-RA and RA-IVC junction. Stitch off SVC-RA junction and RA-IVC junction with two Gore-Tex patches with a thickness of 0.1 mm and a diameter of 20 mm (SVC-RA Gore-Tex patch and RA-IVC Gore-Tex patch). There was a fenestration in the middle of the patch . The fenestration of SVC-RA patch was 2 mm while the fenestrations of RA-IVC patch was 15 mm. Cut off the SVC and anastomose the distal end of SVC in an open fashion to RPA. Disconnect the Main Pulmonary Artery (MPA) and suture both ends.\n\n【12】Results\n\n【13】The postoperative signs were stable and these two children discharged at half a month after surgery. After a long-term follow-up， they have lived very well so far and are preparing for intervention.\n\n【14】The preoperative SaO， were 69% and 71%， respectively. During the hospitalization， the postoperative SaO. were both above 85% and the CVP maintained at 15 mmHg and 14 mmHg， respectively. The cardiac ultrasound examination confirmed the fenestration of SVC-\n\n【15】RA Gore-Tex patch was about 2 mm and the flow velocity across the hole was about 1.4 m/s. During the follow-up， there were no severe complications occurred apart from some restrictive physical activities. The postoperative angiogram was shown in Figure 2.\n\n【16】Comments\n\n【17】In this study， we modified the traditional BDG and carried out two clinical cases. This modification would not only reduce the threshold of intervention. More importantly， it could also avoid the SVC syndrome to an extent after Glenn procedure .\n\n【18】Since the first introduction in 1971 ， Fontan surgery has led to an overall improvement in postoperative mortality. With a deeper understanding， staged procedures with a transitional BDG can ensure young children to survive through the period with high risks. However， the classically repeated surgical procedure means multiple traumatic injuries， severe postoperative adhesion and prolonged CPB time . Therefore， with the rapid developments of catheter technology， the combination of intervention and surgical procedures becomes attractive， which is called the hybrid Fontan surgery. In 1995， Konertz et al.  implemented it in clinical firstly. After 20 years of developments， three styles of hybrid Fontan procedure are gradually established： RA lateral tunnel ， extra-cardiac conduit  and hemi-TCPC . The postoperative complications of RA lateral tunnel are more than the other two methods due to its larger RA incision. Meanwhile， surgeons have to use a new suitable conduit to replace the original in order to meet the growth of children when adopt extra-cardiac conduit. Therefore， the hemi-TCPC becomes the most popular due to its relatively few complications and simple surgical procedures.\n\n【19】Unlike the previously reported hemi-TCPC， we sew two Gore-Tex patches in the RA to “close”the SVC-RA and RA-IVC junction. The Gore-Tex is composed of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene(ePTFE)， making it hard for cells to adhere， which will relieve the late calcification. At the same time， the Gore-Tex patch with a thickness of0.1 mm owns excellent flexibility. So it can also be easily compressed when the stent is expanded. Laser burning or needle puncturing was required to accomplish the guide of wire or catheter in intervention， both of which had the risks of accidental injury to vascular or atrial wall. Therefore， we set aside a 2 mm fenestration in the SVC-RA Gore-Tex patch. It can not only serve as the entrance for guiding wire or catheter， but also can play a role in decompression to avoid the occurrence of SVC syndrome. In fact， the function of the hole is equivalent to fenestration. Although sacrificing part of SaO。 there is a wealth of evidence that fenestration is beneficial for children over the long term .\n\n【20】Previously， it was often necessary to fix the IVC with a ring externally in order to avoid the separation of the stent and IVC which would cause the distortion and damage to the venous wall we think. So in this modification， we sutured a Gore-Tex patch with a diameter of 20 mm to the RA-IVC junction. This Gore-Tex patch would act as a fixation during the stent implantation. Meanwhile， the reserved 15 mm opening in the middle of the patch could also facilitate the venous blood to return.\n\n【21】In addition， with regard to the fenestration size of the SVC-RA patch， we set it at 2 mm. This was because we were worried that if the fenestration was too large， it would sacrifice excessive oxygen saturation， resulting in unnecessary cyanosis. It turned out that the postoperative oxygen saturation of both children remained above 85%， which was a satisfactory result . Theoretically， the reserved fenestration created a right-to-left blood shunt， so there must be a certain correlation between the fenestration size and the decline of oxygen saturation. However， it is regrettable that there is no specific formula for such relation. Currently， we are carrying out hemodynamic analysis to perform precise Glenn fenestration according to different children.\n\n【22】Preserve the antegrade blood can compensate for the negative effect on oxygen saturation of the SVC-RA fenestration. The keep of antegrade blood can significantly increase the blood volume involved in oxygenation， thereby boosting the oxygen saturation. Meanwhile， the antegrade pulmonary blood flow contains some hepatic biochemical agents， which helps prevent the occurrence of small arteriovenous fistula . Besides， pulsating blood flow also increases the shear force-mediated NO release， thereby reducing the long-term Pulmonary Vascular Resistance (PVR) . However， fully reserved antegrade bloodstream might increase the PAP and CVP in the short-term， eventually causing severe circulatory disturbance . Therefore， and we plan to keep partial antegrade blood in some favorable cases in the future .\n\n【23】Limitation\n\n【24】Limited to a variety of issues， this modification was only applied to two patients. More cases are needed to provide sufficient clinical data. Secondly， the specific impact of fenestration size of SVC-RA patch and the oxygen saturation should be illustrated by deep hemodynamic analysis. Thirdly， an overall effect on the oxygen saturation of the SVC-RA patch fenestration and the MPA patch fenestration is also needed to analyze to conduct safer and more effective Glenn fenestration.\n\n【25】Conclusion\n\n【26】Through our clinical practice， we modified the traditional Glenn treatment. We believe it is suitable for some favorable patients especially for those with high CVP and can reduce the technical threshold of the intervention.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:11:20", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:11:38", "cost": 17.802}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:48", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:11:37", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:11:19"}

These tumors rarely rupture into the adjacent structures， such as the pleural space， pericardium， lung parenchyma or tracheal tree. Thoracic CT-Scanis an examination in the diagnosis and therapeutic strategy. We report a case of mature mediastinal teratoma with rupture into the lung， and bronchus.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A young 19-year-old patient consults for a productive cough with purulent expectorations evolving for 3 months in a febrile context. Interviewing revealed the notion of intermittent chest pain with an episode of trichoptysis (sputum containing hair). Clinical examination found a patient in very good general condition with a heart rate at 78 per minute and a respiratory rate at 21 cycles per minute. There was a clinical infectious syndrome with a fever at 38.5°Cand pleuropulmonary examination noted the presence of a decrease in the transmission of vesicular murmur of the left lung. The standard chest x-ray revealed an excavated opacity which sat at the level of the middle part of the left lung. Viewed the context of hydatid endemic in our country， the diagnosis of a pulmonary hydatid cyst ruptured in the bronchi had been evoked. But before the notion of trichoptysis with sputum bristles， a thoracic computed tomography was performed. It had revealed a mediastinopulmonary cystic lesion containing area bubbles with numerous calcifications . Surgical exploration by postero-lateral thoracotomy had found a mediastinal cystic lesion containing sebum and hair， broken and fistulated in the left lung . The gesture consisted of a complete resection of the lesion extended to the lingual. The postoperative sequences were marked by the occurrence of atelectasis requiring fibro aspiration with kinesia active respiratory therapy. The patient was discharged at D+6 postoperative after removal of the thoracic drain. Anatomopathological examination of the surgical specimen confirmed the diagnosis of an intra-thymic teratoma containing cartilaginous， pancreatic， and osseous sebaceous glands.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】The rupture of a cystic mediastinal teratoma is rare but always symptomatic . The mechanism of this rupture is still controversial， although ischemia， infection and chronic inflammation have been incriminated . On the other hand， ectopic production of proteolytic or digestive enzymes favors inflammatory adhesion with erosion of adjacent structures . Most authors have reported a rupture of a mediastinal teratoma following autolysis caused by the digestive enzymes released by the pancreatic tissue or salivary gland contained in the teratoma itself . The presence of trichoptysis is pathognomonic of a rupture of a teratoma in the lung or in the bronchi. Thoracic computed tomography is the best paraclinic examination to study not only teratoma but also its relationship to adjacent structures. It also allows the planning of surgical strategy by seeking the presence of inflammatory adhesions between the teratoma and the neighboring organs. Cheung et al.  report the CT findings ofa case of mediastinal cystic teratoma before and after rupture， and say that features of bursting of the spherical fatty component and intrapulmonary bronchial invasion are also suggestive of rupture of the mediastinal teratoma. The management of a ruptured teratoma is a surgery without delay. It confirms the diagnosis of the mature teratoma by eliminating the presence of an immature component and avoiding any complication due to its rupture， which can lead to haemoptysis， acute respiratory distress or cardiac tamponade . This surgery is very haemorrhagic because of the adhesions between the mediastinal structures such as the phrenic nerve， the aorta， the vena cava and the pulmonary vessels. Antibiotic treatment should be continued in order to avoid post-operative infectious complications.\n\n【9】Conclusion\n\n【10】The rupture or fistulization of a mature mediastinal teratoma reflects the delayeddiagnosis.ThilsSimpliesfurther surgical intervention without delay to confirm the diagnosis by eliminating the presence of immature or malignant components， thus avoiding the occurrence of fatal complications.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:50:24", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:50:34", "cost": 9.528}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:48", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:50:34", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:50:24"}

Endometrial biopsy was performed and result was found as endometrial adenosarcoma. There were no distant metastases found at imaging. TAH + BSO (Total Abdominal Hysterectomy and Bilateral Salpingo-Oophorectomy) operation was performed and adjuvant chemotheraphy(four cyclus ifosfamide， mesna， epirubicin) was given. We did not encounter any problems in monitoring. This case which includes endometrial adenosarcoma is presented because of its rarity.\n\n【2】Keywords： Endometrial adenosarcoma； Malignant mixed mullerian tumor； Vaginal bleeding； Computer tomography\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】The uterine Millerian adenosarcoma， a mixed mesodermal tumor variant， is described by a glandular proliferation without a typical in a maligne sarcomatous stroma . The endometrial adenosarcoma is a kind of rare endometrial cancer， even if endometrial adenosarcoma is often seen in premenapausal and postmenapausal women. It contains the epithelial benign and malignant stromal component. The case is presented due to a rare tumor. It consists of 8% of uterine sarcomas. With monitored in endometrium， it can be seen in localisations such as cervix， fallopian tube， ovarian and paraovarian tissues . It presents as a protuberant polypoid mass in to the cervical channel . Generally， clinical manifestations are non-specific ones， usually common to those of other neoplasias having that localization. They are diagnosed in menopaused patients， the main symptom being represented by vaginal bleeding. It is describe a case of adenosarcoma of the uterine corpus associated with ovarian the coma， estrogen stimulation may play a role in the development of mesenchymal and mixed epithelial/mesenchymal uterine tumors， including adenosarcoma \n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】39 year old woman，who had 3 children， has had complaints about vaginal bleeding intermittently since nearly ten years. She hadn’t the story of miscarriage， dead birth and curettage. After it was monitored endometrial polyp in pelvic ultrasound scan due to abnormal uterine bleeding， the hysteroscopic polypectomy was done. Its pathology was reported as endometrial benign polyp. During her ongoing process， because of that her vaginal bleeding continues， patient has been reevaluated. Pathology was not determined during the hematologic and the biochemical laboratory analysis. Systemic consultation was founded normal. Of the tumor reagents， CA-125： 39.3U/mL  was determined a little high. In the ultrasound imaging of the pelvis， the 18x10 mm hypoechoic myoma， in posterior corpus of the uterus， endometrial tickness was 7 mm， right ovary was 23x21mm， left overy was 33x27 mm anda follicle cyst which was 18x22 mm was shown in it. In her abdominopelvic computed tomography， the myometrium was showing a heterogeneous contrast staining. Endometrial biopsy was performed and result was found as endometrial adenosarcoma. The total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salphingo-ooferctomy surgeries were performed to the patient. In the result of pathology in the macroscopic examination， a tumoral lesion which was in the back wall of the uterus， 6x2 cm， bleeding， hard， solid， grown up to the lumen， ended to the cervical canal at a distance of 1 cm， was monitored. During microscopic examination， it was reported as the 6x2 cm adenosarcoma， the 1/3 myometrial invasion into the middle part， the index Ki-67 was high (30%) and mitosis were rare， about 1-2 on microscopic field with objective X10. Adjuvant chemotheraphy (four cyclus ifosfamide， mesna，epirubicin) was given and then the patient was followed.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Uterinesarcomas containlessthan 1% of gynecologicalcancers and2%-5% of all uterine cancers . Uterus sarcomas (leiomyosarcoma， endometrial stromal sarcoma， adenosarcoma and carsinosarcoma) are heterogyne malignant group that has common pathological and clinical aspects. Uterine adenosarcoma was firstly designated in 1974by Clement and Scully . The tumor has epithelial component and stromal component. The epithelial benign component has inactive or proliferative endometrial glands. The masenchymal component， which shows malignant features， seems tolow-grade stromal sarcoma. In sarcoma to us component， masenchymal elements such as striated muscle， cartilage and fat are available .\n\n【9】Endometrial adenosarcomas begin as polyp from the endometrial surface， and then invade in myometrium. They have often the low-malignant potentials. In adenosarcomas， it has been constated about the rate of 24% of relapse and notified that the degree of myometrial invasion is， in case of relapse， an important factor of risk .\n\n【10】In the etiology of adenosarcoma，the history of pelvic radiation2506and taken part of tamoxifen was located . In 10-25% ofpatients having this disease， it is seen that there is the story ofpelvic radiation as a etilogical factor. In the patients who have breast cancer and are using tamoxifen， the increased risk is founded because it is based on the estrogenic effect on uterus. Then， it is notified in the patients that the benign uterine bleeding has begun almost 5-25 years before . In our event， there isn't the tamoxifen use and story of pelvic radiation but the story of the benign uterine bleeding was existed in10 years before the diagnosis.\n\n【11】Carcinosarcoma and adenofibroma exist in the seperative diagnosis ofendometrial adenosaroma. When adenofibroma consists of benign epithelium and stroma， the degrees of carcinomatous and sarcomatoid differentiation in carcinosarcoma must be evaluated. Even if the managements of endometrial carcinosarcoma and adenosarcoma are similar， its prognosis and results are different. They differ in terms of having epithelial components from other sarcomas of uterus， and having benign epithelial component from mixed malign mesodermal tumors.\n\n【12】In consequence of clinical and pathologic analyses that Clement and his friends made in 10 events of Mullerian adenosarcoma in 1989， they defined a sub type of excessive sarcomatous component. In this sub type， risk of relapse was determined much higher in metastasis and rate of death . The presence of sarcomatous component in 25% more than the total volume of tumor was identified as sarcomatous excessive proliferation. There are high mitotic activity in mesenchymal elements . In these events， the histological particularities deal with the poor prognosis； extra uterine spread in the diagnosis， myometrial invasion， sarcomatous excessive proliferation at mesenchymal component， endovascular invasion and the presence the elements of rhabdomyosarcoma Follow-up cure is planned for the patient because ofthe risk of relapse and metastasis. Adjuvant chemotheraphy is planned for our event because of the risk of relapse and metastasis.\n\n【13】The rate of relapse in uterine adenosarcoma is 25-40% and a distant metastasis is determined in 5% of patients . Mostly， relapse only consists of sarcomatous component.\n\n【14】The basis of treatment of endometrial adenosarcoma is surgical excision. According to the stage of the disease， the standard surgical method is based on radical or total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and omentectomy . In our event， total hysterectomy andbilateral salpingo-oophorectomyandomentectomy operations were applied to the patient.\n\n【15】The primary endometrial adenosarcoma is a kind of rare cancer. The diagnosis of the endometrial adenosarcoma is based on the preoperative scanning and the postoperative pathologic analysis. The results of the pathology must be evaluated by an experienced specialist. Because the adenofibroma and carsinosarcoma have the different clinical results， they must be considered in definitive diagnosis. The presence of the high-grade sarcomatous component and the presence of the deep myometrial invasion and the vascular invasion are connected with the poor prognosis and increase the risk of relapse and metastate.

Including trauma， atherosclerotic ulcers， and cystic necrosis of the intima can cause infection of the aorta. The infectious state can occur and pass to the aorta from blood or surrounding tissues. Including diabetes mellitus， vascular malformations， and other invasive catheterization are clinical risk factors . Such as mycotic aneurysm， infectious pseudoaneurysms， infected preexisting aneurysms， and infectious aortitis， all these cases are usually serious and require further surgical intervention.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】An 83-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital due to intermittent fever for 1 week. She had history of type 2 diabetes mellitus， hypertensive cardiovascular disease， and old cerebrovascular accident. She had no history of trauma. On physical examination， her temperature was 38.5℃， and the cardiovascular hemodynamics was stable initially. The white cell count was 17，540/uL， C-reactive protein level was 15.39 mg/dl， and other blood tests were unremarkable. Chest X-ray demonstrated tortuosity of aorta with calcification of aortic arch . Her blood cultures subsequently all grew Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Intravenous antibiotic of vancomycin was administrated. Echocardiography revealed no vegetation. On the 7h day after admission， the symptoms of chest tightness with shortness of breath and high blood pressure were noted. The electrocardiograms demonstrated sinus tachycardia， a follow-up chest X-ray showed progressive mediastinal widening . Contrast enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) scan demonstrated thickening of the wall of descending aorta that measured 0.7 cm， indicative of aortitis with intramural hematoma . The clinical diagnosis of infectious aortitis complicated by type B intramural hematoma was made finally. Unfortunately， she expired without further surgical management due to Do No Resuscitation (DNR) from this patient and her family.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Infectious aortitis can be caused by several mechanisms： 1. Direct bacteremia seeding of an intimal injury， 2. Septic emboli of the aortic vasa vasorum， 3. Continuous focus of infection extending to the aorta wall with intramural hematoma.\n\n【9】4. Trauma， such as a penetrating injury .\n\n【10】The diagnosis of infectious aortitis is usually suspected on imaging studies and on symptoms of infection (fever， associated with chest， abdominal or back pain)， which may be delayed and is confirmed by the culturing organisms from the blood or surgical specimens. Surgical intervention should be considered when the patients with impending aortic rupture or uncontrolled sepsis. CT scan is a helpful diagnostic tool and may demonstrate rapid aneurysm development， peri-aortic soft-tissue mass and peri-aortic gas (in advanced cases).

The proband did not respond to antiepileptic and other symptomatic medications. We identified a heterozygous single-nucleotide deletion of SGCE gene， c.360delT， in the proband. Affected members in this family are heterozygous carriers of this variant. The patient's father and his two brothers are carriers but asymptomatic. It is consistent with the autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with maternal imprinting which caused incomplete penetrance of SGCE-associated myoclonus-dystonia syndrome.\n\n【3】Conclusion： This study reports a 4-generation family with myoclonus-dystonia syndrome and expands the phenotypic spectrum of variant c.360delT associated disease.\n\n【4】Abbreviations\n\n【5】ACMG： American College offMedical(Genetics aand1Genomicsguidelines；EEG：Electroencephalography； EMG： Electromyogram； HGMD： Human Gene Mutation Database； MDS：Myoclonus-Dystonia Syndrome； MRI： Magnetic Resonance Imaging； PMA： Progressive Myoclonus Ataxia； SGCE： -Sarcoglycan； WES： Whole-Exome Sequencing\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Myoclonus-Dystonia Syndrome (MDS)， also called Dystonia-11(DYT11)andSGCE myoclonus-dystonia (SGCE-M-D) is a rare neurological disorder characterized by a combination of myoclonic jerks， typically affecting neck， trunk and upper limbs， and twisting and repetitive movements resulting in abnormal postures (dystonia). Approximately 50% patients present with writer’s cramp and cervical dystonia . This disease is a genetically heterogeneous movement disorder with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance . The e-Sarcoglycan (SGCE) gene (Dystonia-11， myoclonic； OMIM 604149)， located in the chromosome region 7q21.3， is associated with familial MDS . SGCE gene encodes epsilon-sarcogly can protein， single pass transmembrane proteins that are part of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex， which contribute to mediating the stability of the plasma membrane. According to Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD)， there are 133mutations in SGCE gene reported to be associated with myoclonus dystonia or similar symptoms， including 131 confirmed disease-causing mutations . However， no genotype-phenotype correlations have been identified . Herein we report clinical information and genetic data on a4-generation Chinese family of MDS caused by a deletion， c.360delT， in SGCE gene.\n\n【8】Materials and Methods\n\n【9】Clinical data collection\n\n【10】Clinical information of the proband were collected from medical records and of her family members were recorded through personal follow-up visits. The written consent forms were obtained with the informed consent of all participants.\n\n【11】Further examinations\n\n【12】Physical examination was to check the patient's motor function. Laboratorial assessments were also performed， including complete blood count， urinalysis， stool test， basic metabolic panel， blood lactate and ammonia. Electromyogram (EMG)， brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Electroencephalography (EEG) were also applied.\n\n【13】Whole-exome sequencing\n\n【14】Whole-exome sequencing was performed by Running Gene Inc. (Beijing， China) following the manufacturer's protocol. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood using a blood DNA Isolation Kit(#CW2553， Cwbio， Taizhou， China). Genomic DNA sample was shared by sonication. The sheared genomic DNA fragments were processed by end-repairing， A-tailing， adaptor ligation and a 4-cycle pre-capture PCR amplification. The amplified products were then captured by IDT and xGen Lockdown’ Probes (Integrated DNA Technologies， Coralville， IA) to enrich the exonic DNA. The libraries were first tested for enrichment by qPCR and for size distribution and concentration using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific， Waltham， MA). The samples were then sequenced on an Illumina Novaseq (Illumina， San Diego， CA). Two parallel reactions were performed for each sample.Exon-enriched DNA was sequenced by the Illumina Novaseq platform following the manufacturer's instructions. Raw image files were processed by the Illumina Sequence Control Software (Illumina) for base calling and generating the raw data. The low-quality variations were filtered out based on an in-house algorithm. The high-quality sequencing reads were aligned to the human reference genome sequence (GRCh37/hg19) using Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool . The Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions and deletions (indels) were called using the GATK software . SNPs and indels with low-quality were filtered out. For candidate variants， all were annotated using public databases (1k Genomes Project ，ExAC ，gnomAD， ESP6500 ， Ensembl ， HGMD etc.). The pathogenicity of variants will be generated based on American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines . Sanger sequencing was then used to verify the variant and analyze their genetic origin(SGCE-forward： TAGGCGAGATTAGTAATGATCCCA； SGCE-reverse： CTTTATAAACAGAGAAGAATGG-CAC). PCR products were sequenced by ABI 3730 (Applied Biosystems， Carlsbad， CA) and analyzed by Chromas Lite v2.01 (Technelysium Pty Ltd.， QLD， Australia).\n\n【15】Results\n\n【16】Clinical presentation\n\n【17】The proband (IV-31) was a 12-year-old girl and her parentS(III-42 and III-43) are non-consanguineous. The pregnancy was unremarkable and the proband was delivered by caesarean section at gestational 39h week. She developed normally in infancy. Since the age of 2， she began to exhibit exaggerated startle response with or without acoustic and/or tactile stimuli during awake， and her motor development dramatically delayed compared with peers. She could not walk independently because an unexpected startle during walk could make her fall down. During a startle attack， her arms became fully extended and her whole body involuntarily tightened. Each episode lasted for a few seconds， during which she was fully conscious. The frequency of attacks is more than a hundred per day and also depended on the environment around her. All symptoms (I1I-38 and III-40) and two cousins (IV-27 andIV-28) carry aheterozygous variant of SGCE gene，c.360delT . Her mother  and grandfather(II-10) are wild-type at this site. MDS-affected members are labelled in black. (B) Binary alignment map of whole-exome sequencing shows heterozygous c.360delT.(C) Chromatograms from Sanger sequencing show wild-type and c.360delT  of SGCE gene in family members.\n\n| Table 1： Variant table.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Gene  | Chromosome  | HGVS (NM003919，NP003910)  | Variant type  | Predicted effect  | dbSNP/ClinVarID  | Genotype  |\n| SGCE  | 7：94257544  | c.360delT，p.E121Kfs11  | Deletion  | Frame shift  | NA  | Heterozygous  |\n\n【19】disappeared during sleep except for sleep myoclonus. The patient had previously taken valproate， levetiracetam， clonazepam zonisamide and phenobarbital but symptoms were not improved. Until the last follow-up visit， the patient still presents myoclonic and dystonic symptoms without any improvements. The proband (IV-31) is in a large family in which 13 family members are affected by MDS. The proband's brother (IV-30)， grandmother (II-11)， two cousins (IV-27 and IV-28) and distant relatives (II-3，II-5，II-6， III-24，III-26， III-27，IV-8 and IV-18) all presented myoclonic and/or dystonic symptoms to varying degrees. Affected family members in generation II presented with both myoclonus and torticollis. Symptoms in generation III manifested as slight torticollis. In the4 generation， torticollis became not obvious. The proband's mother(III-43)，two uncles (III-38 and III-40) and grandfather (II-10) were asymptomatic. Theprobandsbrother (IV-30)reported a reduction in myoclonus in response to alcohol ingestion. Therefore， this family is fully compliant with the diagnosis of MDS.\n\n【20】Physical and biochemical examinations\n\n【21】The proband (IV-31) was admitted to our hospital for further examinations. On admission， she was conscious with normal facial features and without horizontal nystagmus.The muscle strength of his upper and lower extremities and muscle tone were all normal. Tendon reflexes were active on all extremities and bilateral pathological reflexes were negative. Pain sensation was present symmetrically. Romberg’s sign was negative. No abnormal signs presented in his heart，lungs and abdomen. The results oflaboratorial assessments were within normal limits and unremarkable. The result of Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children  was normal. No abnormal findings were observed in the results of EMG， brain MRI and EEG.\n\n【22】Genetic analysis\n\n【23】Whole-exome sequencing identified a heterozygous deletion， c.360delT ， in exon 3 of SGCE gene (NM003919， chr7：94257544) in the proband . This deletion will lead to mRNA degradation by nonsense-mediated mRNA decay or frame shift causing premature termination of the peptide chain from 462 amino acidsto 130(PVS1). This variant is absent from public databases (PM2). The deletion also co-segregates with disease in multiple affected family members (PP1). Multiple in silico algorithms predicted it deleterious (Mutation Taster 2 ， 1， disease causing； SIFTindels ， damaging， confidence score =0.858； FATHMM-indel ， score =0.988>cutoff =0.5， pathogenic； CADD ，26.8>15， deleterious； CAPICE ， 0.986>0.02， pathogenic) (PP3). The proband's phenotypes and family histories are highly specific for MDS (PP4). According to HGMD database， this deletion has been reported as a disease-causing mutation in a family with Progressive Myoclonus Ataxia (PMA) but without laboratorial evaluation (PP5). Thus， this variant is classified as pathogenic， based on ACMG guidelines. Sanger sequencing verified this pathogenic variant was also carried by her father (III-42)， brother (IV-30)， grandmother (II-11)，two uncles (III-38 and III-40) and two cousins (IV-27 and IV-28). The proband's mother (III-43) and grandfather (II-10) are wild-type at this site. The disease in this family was inherited as an autosomal dominant pattern with maternal imprinting.\n\n【24】Discussion\n\n【25】MDS is a rare autosomal dominant neurological disorder. The onset age is usually less than 20 years old and with an estimated prevalence of 1-9/1000000inEuropeanpopulation . It manifests as myoclonus and dystonia. Among them， myoclonic jerks mainly occur in the upper limbs and trunk， with a few involving the lower limbs. The myoclonus is not under conscious control and often occurs when stimulated by sound. Other factors eliciting the movement include stress， sudden noise， tactile stimuli and caffeine. Focal or segmental dystonia manifests as writing spasm and/or torticollis and dystonia in the lower limbs is rare. Due to early onset and frequent myoclonic seizures， the normal life of patients is severely disrupted and they are often accompanied by many mental disorders， such as anxiety， depression and compulsive behaviors . In addition， patients are often addicted to alcohol since most patients reported alcohol could alleviate myoclonic symptom dramatically . However， clinical manifestations of different patients were various. Myoclonic symptoms are prominent and only some patients present dystonia. Some of manifestations are too mild to be noticed. Usually， patient’s intelligence is not affectedandthe results of neurological examinations are normal. No specific abnormality shows in cranial MRI， and EEG findings are not consistent with corticogenic myoclonus. Thus， MDS is often misdiagnosed as Tourette syndrome， epilepsy， or psychogenic non-epileptic seizure. The diagnosis of MDS is usually based on both clinical manifestations and genetic background of patients. Mutations SGCE gene is the causative factor of MDS . Pedigree analysis showed that different origin of the pathogenic allele would lead to a remarkable difference in penetrance，indicating the maternal imprinting mechanism of MDS. Although pathogenic alleles with either maternal or paternal origin can be inherited to offspring， only paternal alleles can be expressed and most of maternal alleles will be silenced by DNA methylation . Approximately 5% of patients inherited disease alleles with maternal origin but presented milder symptoms. The reason for loss of suppression is unknown. A heterozygous deletion， c.360delT ， of SGCE gene was first identified in the proband (IV-31) and verified in other family members. Variant c.360delT was considered as a causative variant of MDS. Although 126 disease-causing mutations of SGCE have been reported to be associated with myoclonus dystonia， variant c.360delT has been reported in a family with Progressive Myoclonus Ataxia(PMA)， also referred to as dyssynergia cerebellaris myoclonica rather than MDS . In the current family， our patient (IV-31) presented involuntary bodytremors in upper limbs and trunk and frequent falls， which result in inability to walk. Other family members presented with mild myoclonus and/or torticollis and symptoms could be alleviated after alcohol ingestion. In the PMA family， the proband suffered from dysmetria and ataxic gait， which did not present in MDS family， and frequent falls and limb myoclonus， which also showed in the present family. Similarly， both patients had normal intelligence and showed normal results in neurological examinations， MRI and EEG. They both did not respond to symptomatic treatments but PMA patient experienced progressive worsening of symptoms. Both families showed an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with maternal imprinting. It is intriguing to note that the identical variant may cause two different， but somewhat similar， diseases. Personal genetic background， lifestyle or environmental factor may cause heterogeneity of phenotypes. We also suppose that the inconsistent symptoms， dysmetria and ataxia， were probably caused by other gene(s)， which they missed due to lack of whole-exome sequencing(only a SGCE gene fragment (from intron 5 to intron 7) was sequenced)， irrelevant to c.360delT in SGCE. This hypothesis could also explain why the phenotypes of this PMA family are unique (1 in133) among SGCE mutations in HGMD. However， the correlation between phenotypes and variants should be explored and analyzed with more cases. Currently， no drugs are specifically designed for MDS. Antiepileptic drugs have been reported in individual cases and clinical series with varying responses. A randomized， double-blind， placebo-controlled crossover study showed that zonisamide was the only drug with level 1 evidence of effectiveness in both myoclonus and dystonia .Other antiepileptic including valproate， levetiracetam， clonazepam， gabapentin and topiramate have also been trialed in patients with MDS . Only valproate has been reported to be effective in reducing the occurrence of myoclonus in some patients. However， levetiracetam has limited efficacy and gabapentin caused a severe worsening the conditions . Other than antiepileptic medications， benzodiazepines， anticholinergic agents， dopaminergic agents， serotoninergic agents have been administrated to treat myoclonus and/or dystonia but also with various responses. Except for medications， surgical treatment， such as deep brain stimulation， has also been reported as an effective and safe treatment for MDS when medications failed . In this case， the patient failed in all medication attempts，bilateral implantation of deep brain stimulation could be an opportunity to improve myoclonus and dystonia. To summarize， MDS is a neurological movement disorder which mainly manifested as myoclonus and dystonia. It is genetically characterized by an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with maternal imprinting. In this study， we reported a4-generation MDS family who carried c.360delT deletion in SGCE gene. Affected members presented with myoclonic jerk， involuntary body tremors， frequent falls and torticollis with varying degrees， and alcohol ingestion could help to alleviate symptoms in some patients. However， patients responded to antiepileptic and other symptomatic drugs in varying outcomes. We hope that medications specific for MDS will be developed sooner rather than later.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:31:23", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:31:56", "cost": 33.672}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:48", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:31:56", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:31:22"}

However， rituximab is expensive and has limited availability. Llama-derived single-chain antibody fragments are small molecules with several advantages over conventional antibodies， which have been widely used for cancer treatment. The present studyaims to obtain a single-domain anti-CD20 antibody from an immune Llama phage display library.\n\n【2】Methods： An immune Llama phage display library was constructed with phage display technology. The anti-CD20 single-domain Antibodies (sdAbs) were selected and the genes were cloned into expression vector pSJF2. The antibodies were efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli. The affinity and in vitro biological functions ofdifferent anti-CD20 sdAbs were measured by Biolayer interferometry.\n\n【3】Result： Three anti-CD20 single-domain antibodies (anti-CD20e7， anti-CD20b1 and anti-CD20fl) were obtained which were produced at high yield in Escherichia coli and showed high affinity.\n\n【4】Conclusion： These results， together with the ease of production， show that anti-CD20 VHHs are valuable candidates for the development of B-cell lymphoma therapies.\n\n【5】Keywords： B-cell lymphoma； Immune phage display library； Llama-derived single-chain antibody fragments\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】CD20， a non-glycosylated 33-kDa transmembrane phosphoprotein encoded by MS4A1(Membrane-Spanning 4 domains， subfamily A)， is involved in the regulation of B-cell growth and differentiation. CD20 is homogeneous or strongly positive， favoring diagnoses of lymphocyte-predominant HL， T-cell/histiocyte-rich large B-cell lymphoma ， diffuse large B-cell lymphoma， primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma or grey zone lymphoma. Rituximab， applied as a monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapeutics， is the first monoclonal antibody licensed for Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL) immunotherapy. Most of the clinical experience with anti-CD20 antibodies has been with rituximab . The response rate， Progression-Free Survival (PFS)， and Overall Survival (OS) of NHL patients has been improved with incorporation of rituximab. In aggressive lymphoma， patients who do not respond to rituximab-combined chemotherapy in a front-line setting represent individuals with poor clinical outcomes. Infusion-related symptoms(e.g.， urticaria， fever， and chills) have been found in more than half of patients. Although these symptoms are usually modest， more serious reactions can occur， including hypotension， rigors， bronchospasm， and angioedema， in as manyas 10% ofpatients .Multiple next-generation anti-CD20 antibodies have been designed to improve the promise of B-cell lymphoma therapy .\n\n【8】An emerging alternative approach to immunotherapy is llama-derived VHH recombinant monoclonal antibodies， also known as“nanobodies\". Recently， the serum of came lids was found to contain not only the four conventional chain-Immunoglobulin G (IgG) molecules but also Heavy Chain Antibodies (HCAbs)， which lack light chains and the CH1 domain. The VHH domain of approximately 15 kDa， which is much smaller than other recombinant antibody formats (60 kDa)， is the smallest known antigen recognition site found in mammals. VHH has full binding capacity and affinity comparable to conventional antibodies. Monomeric Nbs have dimensions of 4 nm x\n\n【9】2.2 nm and offer several advantages over antigen-binding fragments derived from classical antibodies . Due to their small sizes， VHHs act as strong enzyme inhibitors， reaching enzyme pockets that are not accessible to common antibodies. When cloned and purified as Monomeric domains， VHHs demonstrate remarkable stability under a wide range of denaturing， temperature， and pH conditions . Recombinant VHH antibody fragments are emerging as new versatile reagents for the diagnosis and treatment oftumors.\n\n【10】Here， we exploited the properties of VHH to develop a reagent that could be applied for the diagnosis or treatment of B cell lymphoma. We show that VHHs are broadly reactive reagents that can be engineered for use in immunodiagnostic tests for CD20antigen. The results indicate that these new antibodies are promising as immunological tools for B celllymphoma research andtherapeutic development.\n\n【11】Materials and Methods\n\n【12】Llama immunization and immune response monitoring\n\n【13】A male llama of one year of age was subcutaneously immunized five times (days 0， 30，50，70， and 90) with 300 ug/per dose of CD20. For the first immunization， CD20 was emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant. (Sigma-Aldrich， St. Louis， MO，USA). This study was approved by the hospital ethics committee [ scientific research ethics review No. ]. Incomplete Freund’s adjuvant(Sigma-Aldrich， St. Louis， MO， USA) was used in subsequent immunizations. The antibody responses to CD20 in serum during the time course of immunization were monitored by ELISA. For the ELISAs， 96-well flat bottom Maxisorp ELISA plates (NUNC， Thermo Scientific， Waltham，MA，USA) were coated with 50 ng of CD20 diluted in 50 uL ofPBS，pH 7.4，at 4°C. Then，2% skimmed Milk Powder in Phosphate-Buffered Saline (MPBS) was used to blocked the wells， and the wells were incubated at 37°C for 2 h. Sera diluted with 2% MPBS were added at 100 uL per well and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Subsequently， the Horseradish Peroxidase (HRP)-labelled goat anti-Llama antibodies were added to each well after three washes with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST，pH 7.4)， and the plates were incubated at 37°C for 1 h. The ELISA was developed with commercial 3，3，5，5-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (Sigma-Aldrich， St. Louis， MO，USA， added at 100 uL/well. The absorbance of each sample was read at 450 nm with an ELISA reader (Multiskan EX， Thermo scientific， Waltham， MA， USA)， and averages of duplicate wells were used in the calculation of the values.\n\n【14】Antigen biotinylation\n\n【15】The EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (sulfosuccinimidobiotin，Thermo Fischer Scientific， Waltham， MA， USA) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (1.0 g/L)， and 100 mg of CD20 antigen was biotinylated with EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-Biotin. The antigen was reacted with a 10：1 molar excess of NHS-LC-Biotin buffer (succinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)-hexanoate， Thermo Fischer Scientific， Waltham， MA， USA). The biotinylated antigen was incubated at room temperature for 30 min and then dialyzed against PBS overnight.\n\n【16】Immunized llama sdAb library construction\n\n【17】From llama-immunized with CD20 antigen， 50 mL of blood were collected after the fifth dose. At day 90， the lymphocytes were collected from these Llama for the construction of phage libraries， as previously described. The VHH-repertoire was PCR amplified from the total RNA of the llama， and the PCR amplification products were purified， digested with SfiI and Pst restriction enzymes， and cloned into the corresponding sites of the phagemid vector pHEN-6. The recombinant plasmids were introduced into Escherichia coli strain TG1 by electroporation. A small amount of electroporated cells was diluted to determine the recombination rate， and the remaining cells were incubated with 2YT/Amp at 37°C. Phages were precipitated with PEG6000-NaCl solution (20%， sterile)， and the phage titer was calculated.\n\n【18】Immunized llamasdAblibraryy panningand phage Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)\n\n【19】Specific binders were enriched after three rounds of in vitro selection by “biopanning\". M-280 streptavidin beads (Invitrogen， Carlsbad， CA， USA，) were incubated with 2% skim milk powder in PBS for 1 h at room temperature to block non-specific binding. The beads were drawn into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes with a magnetic tube holder (Dynal Biotech， Oslo， Norway)， and the supernatant was discarded. The magnetic streptavidin beads were mixed with biotinylated CD20 antigen (500 nM) and incubated with end-over-end rotation at room temperature for 30 min. Subsequently， the beads were incubated with phage for 2 h at room temperature. The magnetic streptavidin beads were rinsed 5 to 10 times. Bound phage was eluted with 200 uL of freshly diluted Triethylamine (TEA)， and then neutralized with Tris-HCl. The unbound phage was discarded. Phages were purified with PEG (20% PEG.5 M NaCl). Three rounds of selection were conducted， and phage populations from the second and third rounds were tested for specificity to CD20 by ELISA. Next， 2 to 3 rounds of panning were performed with 100 nM，20 nM，and 4 nM antigen concentration， and more than 100 clones isolated were after a single round. The isolated colonies were obtained from the second and third rounds of the bacteria， which was diluted and plated onto an LB/ampicillin plate. A single colony was selected and cultured in 96-well plates at 37°C for 5 h. Subsequently， M13K07helper phage was added and incubated for 30 min without shaking at37°C. The supernatant was collected and added to the 96-well plates， and a standard ELISA process was carried out with an HRP-anti-M13antibody (GE Healthcare， Munich， Germany). Twelve positive phage clones were analyzed by DNA sequencing.\n\n【20】Expression and purification of anti-CD20 VHHs\n\n【21】The VHH cDNA was mobilized from the phage display vector to the soluble sdAb expression vector pSJF2 by BamHI/BbsI and re-sequenced prior to transfer to TG1 by electroporation. Individual clones were inoculated into 10 mL of 2YT (supplemented with ampicillin (100 mg/mL) and grown overnight at 37℃ with shaking at250rpm. TG1cells were freshly transformed with the different plasmid constructs. VHH expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG for 8 h. After the cells were pelleted， the periplasmic proteins were extracted byosmotic shock. The VHH was purified from this periplasmic extract by using Ni-NTA (Qiagen， Duesseldorf， Germany)， as recommended by the manufacturer.\n\n【22】According to the manufacturer’s instructions， the sdAbs were assessed by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex75 (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences AB， Chicago， USA) column on an AKTA purifier 2000 system. The molecular weight was determined by using the Gel Filtration Calibration Kit HMW (high molecular weight， GE Healthcare)， the purified proteins were assessed by SDS-PAGE， and the protein concentrations were determined by BCA (Pierce， Rockford， IL， USA).\n\n【23】Affinity measurements\n\n【24】Interaction studies between VHHs and CD20 were performed by using BLI. CD20 antigen was biotinylated by using NHS-LC-biotin buffer， followed by dialysis with PBS. A standard coupling protocol was employed by BLI using the Octet RED system (Pall Forte Bio Europe， Portsmouth， UK) and Fortebio Acquisition Software. Biotinylated CD20 (20ug/mL) coupled to Streptavidin (SA) biosensors was used to establish a baseline in PBST buffer (PBS pH7.4， 0.1% BSA， albumin fraction and 0.02% Tween-20， both Merck KGaA， Darmstadt， Germany) prior to association at varying analyte concentrations. Serial dilutions of 200 uL were generated to produce20， 10， 5， 2.5， and 1.25 uM concentration of sdAbs in appropriate wells of the assay plate. Octet Analysis Software version 6.4 was used for automatic data processing. Biosensor data were fit by using a 1：1binding model.\n\n【25】ELISA competition assays\n\n【26】Ninety-six wells were coated with 100 pL CD20 (10 ug/mL in 50 mM NaCO， buffer， pH 9.5) and incubated overnight at 4℃. Non-specific binding was closed with 380 pL 3% BSA. Different concentrations (0， 50100，250，500 ug/mL) of anti-CD20e7， anti-CD20b1 and anti-CD20f1 were incubated with 50 pL CD20 (50 ug/mL) for 2 h at 37°C. Anti-BAFF sdAb was used as a negative control. After washing the microtiter wells three times with PBST， 100 uL HRP-labeled goat anti-human IgG (Sigma-Aldrich) was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The wells were added substrate TMB after three washes with PBST， and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Optical density was read at 450 nm.\n\n【27】Results\n\n【28】Anti-CD20 antibody titer test\n\n【29】Antibody titers to CD20 were monitored by ELISA to evaluate the llama immune response. The antiserum titer on day 90 was determined as 1 × 10 for CD20. The Llama serum was used as a control prior to immunization， and the Llama was immunized four times with CD20 antigen over three months. The antigen amount was approximately 1.5 mg. Prior to each immunization， 1~2 mL of blood was collected from the Llama jugular vein， and the anti-CD20antibody level in the Llama was measured by enzyme immunoassay. Negative and immune sera were diluted 1：100， 1：1000， and 1：. As shown in Figure 1， the level of anti-CD20 antibody in the serum increased with as the immune Llama interval lengthened， and the immune times increased after the fourth immunization. ELISA revealed an A450 value of 2.22 for the antibody in the Llama serum diluted 10，000 times， whereas an A450 value was 0.132 for the blank showed diversity and multiple sequence comparisons revealed eight sequence profiles of CD20 ， which are stored in the GenBank database under the following accession numbers.： CD20-24， CD20b1， CD20b7， CD20d4， CD20d10， CD20e7， CD20f1， and CD20g. Among these 8 clones，anti-CD20e7，anti-CD20b1 andanti-CD20fl yielded the highest ELISA signals and were therefore selected for further characterization .\n\n【30】Table 1： Enrichment of specific phages during subsequent rounds of panning.\n\n【31】RoundTitre of input phageTitre of output phageOutput phages/input 1.

Antibody heavy chain observed in agarose gels was a 500-bp product， and the gel-purified VHH genes were amplified the variable domains as the template. PCR fragments were integrated into phage vector pHEN-6 by using the SfiI sites introduced with primers. The co-infection of the VHH-pHEN-6-transfected TG1 E. coli strain with the M13K07 helper phage was performed in the phage rescue strategy， and a total of 8×106 phage particles were obtained. The library was approximately 3×10° clones with 24/24 unique clones having inserts at a ratio of nearly 2 VH：1VHH， as determined by examining the amino acid composition of the framework. A total of 40 clones were randomly selected from the library to evaluate the percent of clones carrying VHH genes.

Three sdAbs were highly pure and homogeneous by SDS-PAGE， which migrated at an expected size of 15 kDa. Size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex75 column generated single symmetric peaks at the expected elution position of a monomeric molecule with a molecular weight of 15 kDa， which is the average molecular weight of heavy chain variable domains. On a calibrated Superdex75 column，anti-CD20e7，anti-CD20b1， and anti-\n\n【46】CD20f1 antibodies were eluted from 12.5 mL to 13.5 mL， which was equivalent to 15 kDa . The yield of purified anti-CD20fl was approximately 28 mg/L， and the yields of the other antibodies were approximately 21 mg/L.\n\n【47】Antibody affinity constant measurement\n\n【48】The affinity between CD20 and the selected purified VHHs (anti-CD20e7， anti-CD20b1，and anti-CD20f1) was measured by BioLayer Interferometry (BLI) using Forte Bio's Octet System (Pall Forte Bio Europe， Portsmouth， UK). All obtained binding constants were in the nanomolar range (10-6to10-7). According to the kinetic model， anti-CD20f1 showed the highest affinity to CD20， which has a computed Kd of 8.23×10. However， anti-CD20f1 VHH showed higher affinity to CD20 than anti-CD20e7 or anti-CD20b1 .\n\n【49】Antigen binding specificity of the purified VHH\n\n【50】The three sdAbs were therefore tested for competition with CD20to assess the affinity of the antibodies and the concentration ofaction. The inhibition ratios of the three sdAbs significantly increased with negative control. sdAbs concentrations ， which were compared with the negative control(anti-BAFF sdAb).\n\n【51】Discussion\n\n【52】With advances in antibody engineering， monoclonal antibody fragments have been able to precisely select antigenic epitopes to achieve rapid access to dense tissues and inhibit local damage progression . Different types of nanobodies have been used clinically for disease diagnosis and therapeutic agents. Recently， we have explored \"next generation\" therapeutic approaches for B-cell lymphoma using dose-dense chemotherapy regimens and immunotherapy via monoclonal antibodies.\n\n【53】Three mechanisms of action of anti-CD20 antibodies have been proposed . First， in Complement-Dependent Cytotoxicity (CDC)， the activation of the complement cascade and cell lysis through the formation of Membrane Attack Complexes (MAC) was caused by the first component of Complement (C1) binding to the Fc portion of the anti-CD20 molecule . Second， in Antibody-Dependent Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity (ADCC)， anti-CD20 antibodies bind to the CD20 molecule， and natural killer cells or macrophages， which release effector molecules， such as perforin， bind to the Fc portion of the anti-CD20 molecule through Fcy receptors， resulting in cell lysis. Last， in direct cytotoxicity， the anti-CD20 antibody induces the internal signaling of apoptosis or other cell-death pathways within the tumor cells， causing antiproliferative effects or cell death . Anti-CD20antibodies bind to an extracellular portion of the CD20 molecule. Most anti-CD20 antibodies， including rituximab， Tositumomab， and Obinutuzumab， bind to the larger of two extracellular loops within the CD20 molecule， this loop includes the Alanine-N-Proline (ANP) residues at positions 170 to 172.\n\n【54】The nanobody has the characteristics of low molecular weight， low immunogenicity， high stability， high solubility， high affinity， high specificity and high permeability for tumor target antigen， and this molecule can identify the unusual and unexposed epitopes . Therefore， the early diagnosis ofnanobodies is particularly suitable for tumors or the preparation of special biological target tumor antigens to rituximab in drug treatments and is expected to make up for the lack of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma， provide new treatment options for the treatment of B cell lymphoma， and show broad application prospects.\n\n【55】In the present study， a novel therapeutic approach based onanti-CD20 VHH antibodies was developed. The purpose was to generate anti-CD20 sdAbs and to determine their biological effects. To our knowledge， the present study is the first report of the effects of anti-CD20 sdAbs on B-cell lymphoma cells. Bacterially expressed recombinant CD20 was successfully produced and conveniently purified. After immunizing llamas with recombinant CD20 and constructing an immune phage library displaying the VHH antibody repertoire， three VHHs that bind to CD20 were identified after multiple rounds ofbiopanning. Anti-CD20e7，anti-CD20b1，and anti-CD20f1 bound to CD20 when expressed and purified from E. coli. The recombinant protein was suitable for use as an antigen in phage bio-panning for selecting phage clones that bind to the protein from the established VH/VHH phage display library . According to the set positive criteria of the assays， 24VHH-phagemid-transformed E. coli clones were selected. DNA sequencing confirmed the high diversity of the obtained clones.\n\n【56】The immunized Llama VHH library was constructed. The choice of phage display strategy depends on the required affinity and the target application of the desired antibody . The immune antibody library mainly originates from the specific antigens of the individual peripheral blood lymphocytes in the Llama in vivo via antigen stimulation of a highly mutated antibody， which increases the affinity by over ten or even several hundred-fold， so in the antibody library preparation and screening of the high positivity rate， it is easy to obtain better antibody specificity and high affinity . Studies have attempted screening for anti-CD20-specific nanobodies from natural Llama-type nonimmune antibody libraries， but after four rounds of screening， the positivity rate of phage ELISA is relatively low， and it is difficult to select specific antibodies with high affinity， considering the main affected factors of nonimmune type antibody affinity and low output， despite subsequent affinity maturation. A series of methods are used to improve antibody affinity， but these methods are farless effectivethan the immune antibodylibrary. Halfof the antibodies in llama blood belong to VHH， which have light chains and CH1 regions of the heavy chain antibodies， while llamas aged 8to 12 months are in the strongest stage to resist the original stimuli， through which it is easy to produce antigen-specific antibodies. Due to the specificity of the molecular structure of heavy chain antibody， its apparent molecular weight in reducing SDS-PAGE is only 43 kDa， which is less than that of the ordinary 55-kDa heavy chain antibody. Therefore， Protein G affinity chromatography can be used to observe the production of unique heavy chain antibodies in llamas. To select the best immune antigen dose for subcutaneous injection to induce an immune effect， a moderate amount of the antigen was mixed with Freund's adjuvant to enhance the immunogenicity of this molecule. The immune process and timely monitoring of serum antibody titers of Llamas can directly reflect the production of specific antibodies because of the direct impact of the quality of the antibody library. We fully considered the potential problems to focus on immune animals to ensure the quality of the anti-nanoscale antibody library.\n\n【57】The design of an appropriate selection strategy is equally important for the construction of immune phage library. Effective panning and gradual decreasing of the concentration of CD20antigen resulted in the isolation of the most specific VHHs during each panning. The diversity of antibodies in the antibody library determines the quality ofthe antibodylibrary. Blymphocytes undergo antigen stimulation， and most of these molecules differentiate into plasma cells that produce a large number of antibody molecules. The gene rearrangement mechanism is the basis of antibody molecular diversity. The random combination of antibody fragments at the DNA level can theoretically produce 108 different types of antibodies.\n\n【58】The variable regions of antibodies， particularly the different CDR regions， are the main reasons for the diversity of antibody molecules. In the first round of PCR， we selected 11 different pairs of primers for VHH gene amplification by multiple degenerate primers to amplify Llama heavy chain antibody genes， which help to increase the diversity of the antibody gene. Moreover， the number of cycles in the two rounds of PCR amplification is controlled at 30 or more than35 cycles to avoid repeated amplification of dominant antibodies， generate redundant PCR products， and ensure the diversity of antibody libraries.\n\n【59】The three selected sdAbs possess unique characteristics in terms of their different CDR structures. More than 80% of the sequences for the three sdAbs share identity with the human VH domain， the main differences in amino acid sequence between the llama VHH and human VH are located in the CDRregions. The spatial conformation of antibody- and antigen-binding sites is determined by the length and amino acid composition of the complementary region of the antigen (CDR region). CDR3 is the important factor determining the variable sequence of antibodies. The nanoscale antibody has a long CDR3 area， which makes it possible to identify different epitopes and increase the affinity of nanoscale antibodies. Three strains of nano antibody affinity are different， and the main reason lies in that the CDR zone and FR zone configuration is slightly different， with some residues changed， making three monoclonal antibodies anti-CD20antibodies， namely， anti-CD20e7， anti-CD20b1， anti-CD20fl， that may recognize different epitopes， resulting in antibody affinity and biologically different functions.\n\n【60】In summary， three VHHs specifically recognize CD20 antigen. These clones could represent a new biotool for investigating the mechanisms of B-cell lymphoma and the development of alternative methods for CD20 diagnosis and may even be used as therapeutic agents to overcome the challenges of the current therapy.\n\n【61】Highlights\n\n【62】2.

Although the impact of pregnancy on SLE activity has been debated in the literature， majority of studies have noted increased SLE activity during pregnancy， causing peri-partum complications like pre-eclampsia， pre-term labour and stillbirth. Our case is a 31-year-old woman who suffered pre-eclampsia during her pregnancy， presenting one month post-partum with hemolytic anemia， decompensated cardiomyopathy with serositis and acute renal impairment. She was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus with lupus nephritis and started on immunosuppressive therapy with hydroxychloroquine， corticosteroids and mycophenolate mofetil. This case highlights the importance of understanding the heterogeneous nature of SLE presentation with multiple organ involvement and the impact on SLE activity on pregnancy and its outcomes.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease affecting multiple organs. Its predominance in women， especially of child bearing age is characteristic for the disease. It is extremely heterogeneous with a wide range of clinical and serological manifestations and marked disease course in different individuals.\n\n【4】Although SLE can present commonly with constitutional symptoms like fatigue， weight loss and arthralgia， 25% to 50% patients can have serious organ involvement with lupus nephritis， pleural disease and myopericarditis. Additionally， SLE activity is associated with poor pregnancy and peri-partum outcomes with high risk of pre-eclampsia，pregnancyloss，pre-term birth， stillbirth and low birth weight.\n\n【5】SLE is characterized by anemia， hypocomplementemia and raised Anti-Nuclear Antibody(ANA) and double stranded DNA antibody (dsDNA)， the latter being diagnostic.\n\n【6】Today we present a challenging case of a 31-year-old presenting one month post-partum with anemia， cardiomyopathy with a pericardial effusion， pleural effusions， arthralgia and acute renal failure.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】We present a 31-year-old Caucasian female (G1P1)who delivered twins through normal vaginal delivery 6 weeks prior to presenting to hospital with SLE. At 34 weeks， she was diagnosed as having pre-eclampsia with evidence of proteinuria， hypertension and deranged liver function tests. As a result， she underwent chemical induction and delivered twins via normal vaginal delivery without complications.She was hypertensive at>140/80 mmHg in the peri-partum period and was discharged with labetalol. Her past medical history included Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) with previous steroid use and was currently in remission. She was in a family of four， with a history of SLE in both her brother and mother. Two weeks after childbirth， she developed fatigue， shortness of breath on exertion and bilateral leg swelling and was diagnosed as having pleural effusions on chest X-ray. She received frusemide for this and her labetalol was changed to nifedipine. She was also found to have iron deficiency and anemia with hemoglobin of 68 g/L and was given an iron infusion. Other than mild vaginal bleeding post-delivery， she denied any other sources of bleeding. Two weeks following this， she developed arthralgia in the small joints of the hands and a macular， blanching rash over her feet， knees， chest wall and hands but sparing the face. She presented to a public hospital for further assessmentand management ofher anemia and fluid overload.On clinical assessment， she had evidence of conjunctival pallor and a macular blanching rash over chest， hands and feet. She also had small joint synovitis with swelling and tenderness at proximal interphalangeal joints and pitting edema of the feet.\n\n【9】Table 1： Classes of Lupus Nephritis according to Renal Biopsy.\n\n| Class  | Type of abnormality  | Management  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Minimal mesangial Lupus Nephritis  | Monitoring  |\n|  | Mesangial proliferate Lupus Nephritis  | Generally， a RAAS inhibitor but can consider immunosuppressive therapy for proteinuria >1 g/24hours  |\n|  | Focal Lupus Nephritis (involving <50% glomeruli)  | Induction and Maintenance therapy with steroids and MMF/Cyclophosphamide  |\n|  | IA： active lesions  | Induction and Maintenance therapy with steroids and MMF/Cyclophosphamide  |\n|  | NA/C： active and chroniclesions  | Induction and Maintenance therapy with steroids and MMF/Cyclophosphamide  |\n|  | IC： chronic lesions  | Induction and Maintenance therapy with steroids and MMF/Cyclophosphamide  |\n| V  | Diffuse Lupus Nephritis (involving>50% glomeruli)  | Induction and Maintenance therapy with steroids and MMF/Cyclophosphamide  |\n| V  | IV A： active lesions  | Induction and Maintenance therapy with steroids and MMF/Cyclophosphamide  |\n| V  | V A/C： active and chroniclesions  | Induction and Maintenance therapy with steroids and MMF/Cyclophosphamide  |\n| V  | IV C： chronic lesions  | Induction and Maintenance therapy with steroids and MMF/Cyclophosphamide  |\n| V  | Membranous Lupus Nephritis  | Consider steroids for proteinuria >3 g/24 hours  |\n| V  | Advanced sclerosing Lupus Nephritis  | Preparation of Renal replacement therapy  |\n\n【11】Her vital observations were stable throughout the admission with blood pressures of 120 mmHg to 130 mmHg systolic and70 mmHg to 90 mmHg diastolic. She had a normocytic anemia of Hb 71 g/L， with a blood film consisting of mild anisocytosis with moderate normochromic normocytic anemia with occasional tear drop and rare fragmented red cells. Her hemolysis screen revealed a positive coombs test， a low haptoglobin and high reticulocytes consistent with a haemolytic anemia. Cross-matching studies also found that multiple positive antibodies making it difficult to find compatible blood for transfusion. She also had acute kidney injury with a creatinine of 160 umol/L， hyperkalemia with potassium of6 mmol/L， metabolic acidosis with bicarbonate of 16 mmol/L and a 24-h urinary protein excretion of 0.64 g. Her kidney ultrasound revealed normal size kidneys without obstruction. Her urinalysis revealed 15 million/L erythrocytes without any cellular casts. Additionally， she also had evidence of serositis. This was in the form of bi-basal (left>right) pleural effusions  and a moderate pericardial effusion with moderately-severe reduction in LV function on an Echocardiogram (Echo). She had a serum troponin68 ng/L (<14 ng/L) and a BNP was 3500 pmol/L (<15.3 pmol/L) and her Electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed normal sinus rhythm. Her family history of SLE， pre-eclampsia during pregnancy and her current presentation with arthralgia， serositis， haemolytic anaemia and acute renal impairment， prompted an autoimmune screen. Her ANA was homogenously positive with a>2560 titre with reduced C3and C4 of 0.33 g/L and 0.03 g/L， respectively. She also had a high dsDNA level of 4485 IU/ml confirming the diagnosis of SLE. Due to the presence of severe hemolytic anemia with multiple antibodies precluding a blood transfusion and shortness of breath making it difficult for the patient to lie supine， a renal biopsy was abandoned and she was empirically started on treatment. She was given three pulses of intravenous methylprednisolone 500 mg followed by prednisolone 50 mg and hydroxychloroquine 200 mg daily. She was also started on Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF) 1 g twice daily as immunosuppression for Lupus Nephritis. Two units of packed red cells were given for her anaemia once she was able to be cross-matched， while her cardiomyopathy was managed with Bisoprolol\n\n【12】Table 2： Autoimmune， haemolytic and thrombophilia panel showing evidence of SLE and haemolytic anaemia.\n\n| Autoimmune screen  | Patient Value  | Normal Value  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ANA  | Positive.

The rest of her inpatient stay was unremarkable but showed an improvement in her renal function from a peak creatinine of 185 umol/L to 93 umol/L.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Systemic lupus erythematosus is a multi-system autoimmune disease with a heterogeneous presentation . It occurs up to 10times  more commonly in women， particularly women of child bearing age. It can present with a wide range of symptoms and signs include a rash， arthritis， serositis， nephritis and neuropsychological disturbance with psychosis and seizures. Constitutional symptoms like fatigue and fever seems to be the most common during presentation， rates being 50% to 90% . Arthritis and arthralgia are also common， occurring in up to 90% of patients with a characteristic polyarticular， symmetrical distribution without erosion . Skin\n\n| Table 3： Laboratory results during hospitalisation.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Day 1  | Day 2  | Day 3  | Day 4  | Day 5  | Day 6  | Day 7  | Day 8  | Day 9  | Day 10  |\n| K (mmol/L)  | 6  | 5.7  | 6.1  | 5.1  | 4.7  | 4.1  | 4.2  | 5  | 4.5  | 3.8  |\n| Urea (mmol/L)  | 18  | 20  | 22.5  | 28.4  | 25.6  | 21.3  | 15.1  | 14.1  | 14.3  | 14.4  |\n| Creatinine (mmol/L)  | 160  | 179  | 185  | 168  | 139  | 137  | 95  | 113  | 102  | 93  |\n| eGFR (mL/min/1.73m)  | 36  | 32  | 30  | 34  | 43  | 44  | 68  | 55  | 63  | 70  |\n| Hb (g/L)  | 71  | 72  | 67  | 66  | 57  | 55  | 65  | 94  | 92  | 89  |\n| ACR (mg/mmol)  | 136.5  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| PCR (g/mmol)  | 0.18  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n【18】Key： K： Potassium； U： Urea； Creat： Creatinine； eGFR： Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (CKD-EPI)； Hb： Haemoglobin； ACR： Albumin to Creatinine Ratio； PCR：Protein to Creatinine Ratio manifestations include the classic malar butterfly rash occurring up to 50%， discoid skin lesions， urticaria and photosensitivity.\n\n【19】Concerningly， the morbidity and mortality in SLE is determined by its multi-organ involvement and dysfunction. Renal involvement in the most apparent and can occur in up to 40% of SLE patients . The presentation and extent of disease is highly variable， ranging from asymptomatic haematuria/proteinuria to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. The pathogenesis is said to be due to deposition of immune complexes involving dsDNA antibodies on various sites in the kidney， namely the mesangium and the subendothelial region.Normally， patients present with a raised creatinine， proteinuria and evidence of urinary sediment with cellular casts alongside elevation of dsDNA levels and hypocomplementemia. A kidney biopsy is indicated in most patients with lupus nephritis to establish a diagnosis but patients with <500 mg/day of proteinuria and bland urinary sediment may not require a kidney biopsy. After biopsy，lupus nephritis is divided into categories according to histopathological grading .\n\n【20】Pulmonary involvement is also common in SLE， occurring in up to 90% of patients on autopsy. It manifests as pleurisy and exudative pleural effusions with a high LDH . Cardiac disease in SLE patients can involve many areas of the heart， notably pericarditis+/- effusion being the most common in up to 25% of the patients. Other cardiac manifestations include myocarditis and coronary artery disease. Gastrointestinal involvement occurs in up to 40%patients and can result in oesophagitis， pseudo-obstruction，hepatitis， pancreatitis and mesenteric ischemia .\n\n【21】Hematological manifestations are common in SLE and span from anemia， thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia. The causes of anemia in SLE patients could be multifactorial with anemia of chronic disease due to chronic inflammation being the most common. Other causes include iron deficiency， aplastic anemia and autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia has a prevalence of about10% in SLE patients  and is associated with other significant organ dysfunction including renal， cardiac and pleural disease . This type of anemia presents with increased reticulocyte count， raised LDH， raised indirect bilirubin， low haptoglobin and a positive coombs test. Interestingly， a phenomenon called Evans syndrome exists where there is occurrence of two or more hematological immune cytopenias， with ITP and AIHA combination being the most common . In addition， in 50% of these patients， this could be a manifestation of SLE and present before the onset of SLE . A study on 26 patients in 2006 looking at treatment of severe autoimmune hemolytic anemia in SLE patients found that corticosteroids were the best first line of treatment for the anemia.\n\n【22】Neuropsychiatric manifestations can not only be frequent in up to90% patients with SLE but can be on a wide spectrum from peripheral neuropathies， psychosis， seizures to cognitive dysfunction . The relationship between and pregnancy and SLE is interesting and has been thoroughly reviewed in literature. The effect of SLE on fertility is debatable. Although some studies have suggested a reduction in fertility amongst SLE patients due to age， less ovarian reserve with cyclophosphamide， disease activity and concurrent antiphospholipid syndrome ， others have not observed differences in fertility due to good disease control prior to conception and less use of cyclophosphamide .\n\n【23】Another concept debated in the literature is SLE activity in pregnancy. Whilst some studies found no significant increase in SLE activity between matched pregnant and non-pregnant SLE patients19， majority of the studies found high SLE activity in pregnant patients. These studies collectively demonstrated a fold increase in SLE activity during pregnancy ， most being mild-moderate disease activity. The pathophysiology of this could be due to T cell activity. A healthy pregnancy leads to a shift from TH1 to TH2 mediated immune response， enabling the mothers'immune tolerance to the fetus. SLE is considered a TH2 mediated disease， therefore may worsen during pregnancy . Risk factors for this seem to be active disease before conception and multiple flares in the years prior to conception . It is observed that SLE flares can occur anytime during pregnancy and importantly， several months after delivery . However， literature on SLE and negative pregnancy outcomes has been consistent. SLE has been associated with an increased risk of pre-eclampsia， pregnancy loss， pre-term labour， stillbirth and low birth weight. Pre-eclampsia rates range from 13% to 35% in SLE patients compared to general population with risk factors being first pregnancy， nulliparity， renal disease， low complement levels， hypertension and dsSDNA positivity . Patients with lupus nephritis have the highest risk with some studies showing rates up to 66%. Pregnancy loss and stillbirth are also higher in SLE， with a rate of up to 20% with risk factors being SLE activity and antiphospholipid syndrome . Preterm birth is notably increased in SLE with rates up to 30% with risk factors being hypertension， SLE activity and higher prednisolone doses . Finally， low birth weights less than 10h percentile are also found in 10% oflive-births in women with SLE .\n\n【24】Whilst the diagnosis of SLE was not obvious during our patients'episode of pre-eclampsia， presence of pre-eclampsia is a significant marker ofher subacutepresentation ofSLE. Althoughpregnancy is not contra-indicated in SLE patients， careful counseling and monitoring of patient through conception， pregnancy and post-partum period is important. Should our patient become pregnant again， remission of SLE activity 6 months prior to conception and careful co-ordination of the high-risk pregnancy with a multidisciplinary team approach is key .\n\n【25】Theconnectionbetween antiphospholipid d syndromeand SLE is also important. About 40% SLE patients have positive antiphospholipid antibodies although development of secondary antiphospholipid syndrome in SLE is slightly less common . Antiphospholipid syndrome is characterized by arterial and venous thrombosis and multiple pregnancy complications including pre-eclampsia， fetal death and placental insufficiency . The specific management of SLE largely depends on the predominant organ system that is involved but a large evidence base has suggested that all patients should be on hydroxychloroquine unless contraindicated. A large systematic review revealed that hydroxychloroquine has multiple benefits including reducing flares， protecting in against organ damage， reducing thrombosis and increasing longterm survival. Other studies have also revealed less skin and integument damage with the use ofhydroxychloroquine .\n\n【26】Lupus nephritis treatment depends usually on the features found at renal biopsy  . Generally， aggressive immunosuppressive treatment is reserved for classes III and IV with activelesions. Although the effects of treatment on all-cause mortality was difficult to elicit， KDIGO guidelines for lupus nephritis suggested that induction therapy should consist of corticosteroids and another agent. Whilst cyclophosphamide and MMF both lead to similar rates of disease remission and reduction of time to doubling of creatinine， MMFhadlower riskofovarian failure. Therefore，MMFis thepreferred treatment in women of child bearing age， like in our case . For maintenance therapy， evidence shows MMF being superior compared to other agents like azathioprine which increases rates of renal relapse and leucopenia . After appropriate treatment， patients usually go into remission. Rarely， some patients do not require further treatment after the initial presentation but most lead a relapsing and remitting disease course. The prognosis of SLE varies significantly between individuals and depends on various factors with poor prognostic factors being the presence of renal disease， co-existing hypertension， male sex， black race and presence of antiphospholipid syndrome. Although the overall survival has improved in the last decade owing to increased disease recognition and prompt treatment， SLE still has higher mortality rates up to 5 times more than the general population. In summary， the presentation of SLE in the post-partum period is important to note in a young patient with strong family history of autoimmune disease. It is also important to understand that SLE presents heterogeneously with multiple organ involvement with varying severity. Therefore， prompt diagnosis with thorough clinical assessment， laboratory autoimmune panel testing and management of organ disease with an appropriate level of immunosuppression is crucial， to improve the overall prognosis. Finally， it is important to understand the close interaction between pregnancy and SLE with its multiple negative effects on both maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. The overall management of an individual with SLE should be carried out in a multidisciplinary team involving physicians of different specialties， nursing and allied health staff and psychologists.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 15:40:40", "endTime": "2024/09/20 16:24:06", "cost": 2606.079}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:48", "update_time": "2024-09-20 00:24:05", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 23:40:39"}

Morbidity due to TAWH may be significant. The diagnosis is not straightforward and TAWH is often identified on computed tomography or intra-operatively.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 34 year old male restrained driver was involved in a single vehicle road traffic accident at unknown speed. He was brought into the emergency department by ambulance in full spinal precautions. He was previously well with no past medical history. On arrival the patient had normal vital signs with GCS 15/15. He was assessed in keeping with full ATLS protocols. Abdominal assessment revealed bruising across the lower abdomen consistent with ‘seat-belt sign’with tenderness and guarding in right lower quadrant. Clinically the patient appeared otherwise uninjured. The bedside Focused Assessment with Sonography in Trauma (FAST) scan was negative for free fluid. Contrast enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) of the abdomen demonstrated a wide-necked (2.5 cm) abdominal wall hernia at the right iliac crest containing fat with associated stranding and a trace of fluid in the right anterior abdominal wall muscles and subcutaneous tissues extending to the right inguinal region. The patient suffered no concomitant injuries. The patient was treated non-operatively and admitted for observation .\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】Traumatic Abdominal Wall Hernia (TAWH) is a rare form of hernia that is caused by disruption of the abdominal wall musculature and fascia (while the skin is still intact) following blunt abdominal trauma . As seen in our case previous studies have reported the association between seat belts and TAWH . The seat belt may cause a sudden increase in intra-abdominal pressure， leading to rupture of the abdominal wall . A study with 3，947 blunt trauma patients reported a 0.9% incidence rate of TAWH . As seen in this case， Pardhan et al.  reported that TAWH is most frequently located in the right lower quadrant. This type of abdominal wall hernia was first described by Shelby more than 100 years ago， with around 250 cases reported in medical literature . Despite this， diagnosis remains a challenge. Small hernias are often disguised with bruising and hematoma and may be missed on clinical examination. A high index of suspicion is required as TAWH is associated with concomitant complex injuries. A retrospective analysis of 80 cases of TAWH revealed that the associated injuries included lumbar spine fractures， pelvic fractures， splenic injuries， and bowel injuries . Retrospective study results from Hickey et al of patients with TAWH demonstrated by CT scanning (N=15)， showed the prevalence of associated injuries to be as high as 100% . The failure to diagnose TAWH may also lead to complications resulting from the hernia. Incarceration and strangulation of the intestine have been described . For the initial evaluation in the emergency department， ultrasound is easily accessible and can be helpful for primary diagnosis . However， most cases of TAWH are diagnosed by abdominal CT， as seen in this case， as it is widely used in the assessment of high energy trauma . CT also has the advantage of enabling the identification of potential concomitant injuries which were not present in this case. Surgical intervention is regarded as the treatment of choice for any form of TAWH . The choice of treatment of TAWH is dependent on clinical status of the patient， concomitant injury and size of the abdominal wall defect.\n\n【6】Conclusion\n\n【7】TAWH is a rare hernia following blunt abdominal trauma. It represents a diagnostic and therapeutic clinical challenge. Computed tomography is often instrumental in making the diagnosis. High clinical suspicion and knowledge of the pathophysiology of this rare diagnosis may facilitate early recognition and treatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:43:03", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:43:18", "cost": 15.585}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:48", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:43:19", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:43:02"}

Although a-Fetoprotein (AFP) is frequently used as serum marker for HCC， elevated AFP has been reported in most YST patients. Sal-Like protein 4 (SALL4)， a nuclear zinc finger transcription factor， has been reported as a highly sensitive and specific marker for primary and metastatic gonadal and extragonadal YST. Here， we present a case of HCC expressing SALL4by immunohistochemistry. The patient is a 73 year-old Caucasian female with a history of liver cirrhosis secondary to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis， presented for evaluation of an enlarging 4.8cm ill-defined heterogenous mass within segment 8， demonstrating arterial enhancement and washout. Laboratory studies showed elevated AFP level of 21，303 ng/mL. By histology， the background liver showed bridging fibrosis with nodular formation. The neoplastic cells consist of columnar cells with dense chromatin， eosinophilic cytoplasm， areas of glandular architecture and focal area of neoplastic cells lining the central vascular core. By immunohistochemistry the neoplastic cells are strongly positive for Cam 5.2， SALL4， Glypican-3， AFP， Arginase-1 (variable) and CK19 (focal). The neoplastic cells are negative for CK7， CK20， ER， GATA-3， CDX-2， Hepar-1， Lung adeno cocktail，synaptophysin， PAX8， Hercep， and WT-1. Although strong immunoreactivity of SALL4 is characteristic of YST， SALL4 expression is reported in up to 46% ofHCC cases. Our case highlights the potential pitfall when using SALL4 in distinguishing HCC and YST， especially in limited biopsy material.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide，and Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) accounts for approximately75% of all liver cancers . Although the pathogenesis of HCC is not clear， it generally arises in the setting ofinfections， alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases . There are a variety of signaling pathways including Notch， Wnt， Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) and hedgehog for the occurrence of HCC. Sal-Like protein 4(SALL4)， is a zinc finger transcription factor and is commonly expressed in germ cell tumors . Here we report an aggressive poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the liver expressing SALL4by immunohistochemistry， in a postmenopausal patient with cirrhosis.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】The patient is a 73 year-old female with a history of cirrhosis secondary to NASH，previously decompensated with ascites and portal hypertension requiring paracentesis. She initially developed abdominal pain and underwent Computed Topography (CT) scan of the abdomen which revealed a new hypodense mass-like lesion in the right liver measuring up to 2.2 cm in a background of cirrhosis. A follow-up study after 4 months with CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast showed a heterogeneous enhancement of a 4.8 cm mass in segment 8 with tumoral invasion of right portal vein. The mass did not demonstrate arterial enhancement but did demonstrate mild washout on venous phase with Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) category 4，probably HCC. Laboratory studies detected elevated a-Fetoprotein (AFP) of 21，303 ng/mL and CA 19-9 of 65 ng/mL.\n\n【6】The patient underwent CT-guided needle core biopsy of the liver that showed background liver with bridging fibrosis  and sheets of neoplastic consisting columnar cells with dense chromatin， increased mitosis and pale cytoplasm. There are areas of gland formation and focal area where the neoplastic cells lines around a central vascular core . By B： Paarly differentiated adenacarcinoma with neaplastic cells lining around a vessel； (hematoxylin-easin， ariginal magnifications at 100x). C and D： Immunohistochemistry showing strang and unifarm expressian of SALL4 and Glypican-3， respectively (immunahistochemistry， ariginal magnifications at 100x). immunohistochemistry the neoplastic cells are strongly positive for Cam 5.2， SALL4 ， Glypican-3 ， a-fetoprotein， Arginase-1 (variable) and CK19 (focal) while negative for CK7， CK20， ER， GATA-3， CDX-2， Hepar-1， Lung adeno cocktail， synaptophysin， PAX8，Hercep， and WT-1. Although the immunoprofile is suggestive of yolk sac tumor with diffuse SALL4 expression， this entity is very rare in postmenopausal women. In correlation with radiology， the overall findings support a yolk sac component of a high-grade epithelial neoplasm， consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma in a postmenopausal patient with cirrhosis. The term \"somatic derived yolk sac tumors\" has been described in this age population， where there is a yolk sac component associated with a high-grade epithelial neoplasm . The patient was not a candidate for surgical or locoregional intervention and the decision was made to transition the patient to palliative care. The patient died approximately three months after the tissue diagnosis.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】There are rare variants of hepatoid yolk sac tumor which can be difficult to distinguish from HCCby morphology alone . In clinical practice， immunohistochemistry is utilized to differentiate metastatic carcinomas that are morphologically similar and further workup of tumor ofunknown origin . SALL4 is a highly sensitive and specific marker for metastatic germ cell tumors and is particularly useful in the detection of metastatic Yolk Sac Tumors (YST) with diffusely finely granular SALL4 nuclear expression pattern . But， it is also frequently expressed in serous carcinoma of the ovary， urothelial high-grade carcinoma， gastric adenocarcinoma (intestinaltype)，acute myeloid leukemia， Wilms tumor， rhabdoid tumors of kidney and extrarenal sites . In addition SALL4 expression is also seen in forty-six percent of hepatocellular carcinoma， in punctate/clumped nuclear pattern . The expression of SALL4 in both germ cell and non-germ cell tumors could lead to a potential diagnostic pitfall in the differential diagnosis of HCC versus YST.\n\n【9】There is a recent trend in using immunohistochemistry as prognostic and mutation-specific markers to guide clinical management . HCCs with immunoreactivity to SALL4 are poorly differentiated with frequent vascular invasion and intrahepatic metastasis . In our patient， subsequent CT scan one month after the biopsy showed increasing size of the primary lesion from 4.8cm to 5.3 cm and an adjacent satellite lesion measuring 1.4 cm with arterial enhancement and washout (LI-RADS category 4). In large meta-analysis studies， SALL4 expression in cancers increases both cancer recurrence and patient mortality， suggesting that SALL4is a promising prognostic biomarker and a potential target for personalized medicine . Yong et al.  demonstrated by gene-expression microarray the HCCs with high levels of SALL4 are associated with progenitor-like gene signatures and poor prognosis. In addition， the absence of SALL4 expression in the background normal liver would serve as a potential for targeted therapy and provide less toxicity in patients with un derlying cirrhosis .\n\n【10】The universal application of SALL4 as a biomarker for HCC should be approached with caution due to the geographic variation in the dominant etiology of HCCs. Western patients develop HCC after hepatitis C viral infection， alcohol and nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases， while Asian HCC patients are commonlycarriers of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) . SALL4-immunoreactive HCCs rose more frequently in HBV- positive background . Additional markers such as Histone Deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and Histone Deacetlyase 2(HDAC2) has been shown to coexpress with SALL4， that correlated with underexpression of PTEN and unfavorable prognosis with worse overall and disease-free survival rates after surgery . In addition， SALL4 expression has been implicated in Wnt/B-catenin pathway in both gastric and hepatocellular carcinomas .\n\n【11】In summary， SALL4 is a highly specific marker for metastatic volk sac tumors but can be expressed in other cancers such as HCCs. SALL4 expression in HCCs is associated with frequent vascular invasion and intrahepatic metastasis. In addition， to avoid potential diagnostic pitfall in the differential diagnosis of morphologically similar neoplasms， it is importantto correlate immunohistochemistry profile with the background liver， clinical and radiologic findings.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:25:58", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:26:29", "cost": 31.053}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:48", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:26:29", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:25:58"}

Globally； numerous vaccines have been developed against COVID-19.In Europe and United states， four vaccines have been approved by the FDA. The Majority of people become Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech， although certainly side effect may occur， the benefit greatly outweigh the risks. Adverse cardiovascular side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine include myocarditis/pericarditis， Vaccine Induced Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT) and thromboses， which often related to low platelet levels and VITT in the setting.\n\n【2】Case Presentation (History/Examination)\n\n【3】A 60-year-old female presented to our Emergency Department (ED) after cardiopulmonary resuscitation due to asystole at home. She had been having progressive shortness of breath over 2to 3 Months that worsened acutely on the admission day with no significant past medical history. She got the COVID vaccination 3 times. On arrival to ED Patient was intubated. She was afebrile. An electrocardiogram was performed， which showed sinus rhythm with a left axis， normal intervals and negative T wave over II， III，aVFand V. An arterial blood gas showed the following results：pH 6.7 (normal 7.45)， pCO2 84 (normal 37 mmHg to 43 mmHg)， bicarbonate 6.5 (normal22 mmol/L to 26 mmol/L)，lactate 14 (normal 0.5 mmol/L to 2.5 mmol/L)， sodium 137 (normal134 mmol/L to 144 mmol/L)， potassium 3.8 (normal： 3.5 mmol/L to 5.5 mmol/L)， and anion gap21.9 mmol/L. There was an absence of ketones in the urinary dipstick， but positive for protein and glucose. Laboratory evaluation revealed markedly elevated creatinine level at 2.2 (normal： 0.7 mg/dl to 1.1 mg/dl) and hs-TNI at 2480 ng/l (normal： 2.3 ng/l to 11.6 ng/l). Takutsubo Cardiomyopathy was ruled out with Cardrio-MRT and ventriculography. The patient underwent a chest Computed Tomography (CT) scan that revealed bilateral pleural effusion without pulmonary embolism. Coronary angiogram was without a significant epicardial coronary artery disease. For further evaluation we measured the microcirculatory resistance (IMR=52) and Coronary Flow Reverse(CFR=1.3) which were pathologic. She was immediately started with CVVHDF and after that with the dialysis 3 times weekly for six weeks， which could be stopped， because the GFR was 61ml/min/m’， urine output >100 ml/h and creatinine 1.3 mg/dl. Because of the unclear cause of her accelerated decrease in kidney function with need for the continuous dialysis a kidney biopsy was performed that showed microthrombi and lymphatic infiltrates as an expression of vaccination damage. Brain CT performed on the first day of admission showed a subacute medullary lesion on the left periventricular side. The Brain MR showed multiple small subacute ischemia's， mainly in the centrum semiovale bds.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】The cardiovascular complications have been reported with both COVID-19 and its vaccination. Vaccination has a significant effort on the prevention of severe SARS-CoV-19 infect and its complications . The extra cause of the vaccine complications is not exactly understood， but they are likely due to inflammatory immune system response to components of the vaccine that attack cells and tissue in the body . Blood clots can form in veins and arteries. Typical locations are in legs and hands， less common are in the abdominal organs or brain . The complications are really rare， as example the incidence of the VITT is observed in 1/100.000 vaccine exposures .\n\n【6】Conclusion\n\n【7】The COVID-19 continues to cause significant morbidity and mortality over the world.

Chronic pain in this condition may be perpetuated by central nervous system sensitization and is refractory to treatment. Vibroacoustic therapy has the potential to modulate pain responses via somatosensory input.\n\n【2】Objective： To examine the effects of a short course of self-administered，home-based vibroacoustic chair therapy as add-on treatment in EDS.\n\n【3】Methods： A patient with painful EDS was supplied with a vibroacoustic chair. The patient used the chair up to seven days per week twice per day for 53 out of a possible 58 sessions over 29 consecutive treatment days (approximately 4 weeks)， followed by a two week “washout\"period. Responses were assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory， Short Form (BPI-SF) and the Sleep Quality Numerical Rating Scale (SQNRS) administered at study initiation， and at the end of weeks 2， 4 and 6. A patient global impression of change (GIC-P) was obtained at the conclusion of active treatment (week 4). Thirty minute semi-structured interviews were carried out at the end of week 4 and week 6. The change from baseline in the BPI subscales， the Pain Severity Score (PSS) and the Pain Interference Score (PIS)， from baseline to end of the active treatment period and patient global impression of change were the primary end points. Changes in the SQNRS over the course of the study and the changes in BPI subscales and from time oftreatment termination until the final assessment were the secondary endpoints.\n\n【4】Results： The PSS was 7.75 at baseline and unchanged at termination of treatment. The PIS improved by 2.43 points from baseline (8.86) to termination of active treatment (6.43). Patient Global Impression of Change was “slightly better\"following treatment. The patient experienced a mostly positive stimulation of bowel function， relaxation and/or lessening of muscle tension， andan improvement in energy levels. Bothersome tingling sensations were experienced especially close to the time of initiation for a brief period but there were no serious adverse effects. During the washout period， the PSS increased slightly by 0.25 points between the termination of therapy (7.75) and final follow-up (8.0). The PIS changed 1.14 points， from 6.43 at termination of therapy to 7.57 at final assessment. Sleep quality also worsened during the washout period with an increase in the SQNRS scale from 8 to 9 although it did not change from baseline during the active treatment period. There was some overall deterioration in symptom control in the two weeks after treatment termination.\n\n【5】Conclusions： This N of 1 study suggests modest symptom improvement from vibroacoustic therapy in EDS-HT. There was an unexpected effect of bowel stimulation. Larger controlled studies are needed to confirm and extend these findings.\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】The Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes (EDS) are a heterogeneous group of heritable connective tissue disorders characterized by articular hypermobility， skin extensibility， and tissue fragility. Widespread pain and tenderness are prominent features of the autosomal dominant Ehlers-Danlos syndrome hypermobility type(EDS-HT). Major diagnostic criteria include skin involvement with hyperextensibility and/or smooth， velvety skin as well as generalized joint hypermobility.Joint hypermobility is the dominant clinical manifestation with certain joints， having a propensity to dislocate.\n\n【8】It has been postulated that early in the course of the condition mechanical factors account for the pain but later central nervous system sensitization produces generalized hyperalgesia. While pain predominates， depression， fatigue， impaired sleep， and diminished quality of life occur .\n\n【9】The pain in this condition is refractory to treatment \n\n【10】Vibroacoustic therapy (VAT) uses sound and mechanical vibrations in the audible range applied directly to the body with therapeutic intent . The mechanisms of action responsible for improvement in these areas may involve stimulation of Pacinian corpuscles， direct mechanical tissue stimulation， induction of the relaxation response and cellular/subcellular effects. Mechanical stimulation in the range of 60-600 Hz activates Pacinian corpuscles， which are involved in somatosensation and may influence pain perception . At least some of the benefits may derive from reduced muscle tension .\n\n【11】VAT has produced significant gains in the relief of pain of musculoskeletal origin ， including fibromyalgia and back pain.\n\n【12】Dr. Patrick of the NIH Clinical Center has treated more than15，000 patients having a wide variety of medical conditions . Skille and other therapists have data from more than 40，000 hours of treatment. No serious adverse reactions have occurred .\n\n【13】Given the potential for benefit， the relative safety of VAT and the lack of alternative therapies， we considered that a trial of VAT in a patient diagnosed with EDS-HT was justified.\n\n【14】Materials and Methods\n\n【15】Participant\n\n【16】Diagnosis： The patient was a 19-year-old male student of Ashkenazi Jewish and Polish/Russian background. He carried a diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome(EDS) spectrum disorder of the hypermobile type with features of classical type.\n\n【17】Pain onset and symptoms： The patient had the onset of widespread pain prior to his 14 birthday. At that time， he developed flu-like symptoms consisting of a sore throat， abdominal pain， vomiting， fever， cough， night sweats and generalized aching. He was initially treated with a three day course of clarithromycin for suspected pneumonia but a chest x-ray proved normal. The most remarkable feature of a detailed workup was an antistreptolysin O titer of 402. Principal ongoing pain complaints were focused on the lower limbs and only occasionally in the hands. There were intermittent sharp pains superimposed on long-duration pain. The patient rated his baseline pain as eight out of 10. He was unable to walk without a cane and had given up sporting activities.\n\n【18】Medical history： Going back to childhood there were recurrent shoulder and carpal-metacarpal joint dislocations as well as knee buckling. Additionally， he experienced urinary frequency and urgency， depressive symptoms， anxiety， panic attacks and sleep disturbances. Additional medical history included bilateral inguinal hernias at approximately age 10 and a small periumbilical hernia. The inguinal hernias were treated surgically. He was noted to have soft stretchable skin without any skin fragility or easy bruising. There had been no spontaneous skin tearing.\n\n【19】Family history： A brother， seven years older， maternal first cousin and mother's paternal uncle had suffered from similar skin disorders and pain. Another brother， three years older and a sister， three years younger had similar skin but no pain complaints.\n\n【20】Clinical examination： The patient's Beighton score was five out of nine confirming hypermobility. There wereno pseudotumors or piezogenic papules. Brisk deep tendon reflexes at the knees and some brief clonus at the ankles of uncertain significance were noted but no other neurological abnormalities were documented.\n\n【21】Investigations： A skin punch biopsy contained numerous scattered dysmorphic fibrils including many flower-like collagen fibrils with moderate diameter variability. There were no other significant findings by light and electron microscopy and elastin fibers were normal. Genetic testing was extensive but he was known to have a COL5A1 variant， 190 3C>T translocation.\n\n【22】Sleep studies demonstrated arousals at four minute intervals and decreased REM sleep. He had extensive imaging with MRI， including the brain， the knees and proximal muscles. All the studies were negative or normal. MRI studies of the length of the spine showed only a small (incidental) Tarlov cyst at T10-T11 which was radiographically stable for 4 years. An echocardiogram was negative for mitral regurgitation and mitral valve prolapse. The aorta and aortic root appeared normal. A bladder ultrasound， done while he was experiencing a sense of fullness， was associated with only 4 mL of fluid.\n\n【23】Attempted therapies： Sleep hygiene and massage provided some benefit. Physiotherapy improved his shoulder strength. Interventions without substantial benefit included relaxation techniques and medications of varying types. These included tramadol containing medications and opioids， cannabinoids， mirtazapine， dopamine receptor blockers， \"Z drugs\"， baclofen， gabapentinoids and SNRI's\n\n【24】Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria\n\n【25】Contraindications to the use of VAT were reviewed and determined to be absent before the trial of therapy was initiated . Discussion with our patient confirmed that he had adequate English proficiency for completion of questionnaires， the ability to tolerate the treatment and a willingness to complete the study assessments.\n\n【26】Intervention(VAT)\n\n【27】The study was of six weeks’ duration； with four weeks of active treatment followed by two weeks’“washout.\"It was intended that the patient receive 56 treatment sessions given as two sessions per day over 28 consecutive days. However， the actual usage was 53 sessions over 29 consecutive days. Treatment was self-administered with a vibroacoustic chair (Sound Oasis Model VTS-1000， Sound Oasis Company， Marblehead MA 01945-0526，USA).\n\n【28】The first session of the day included 30 minutes of the Sound Oasis “Energize”program consisting of three music tracks with a component of low frequency gamma entrainment (41 Hz to 73 Hz with 41 Hz dominant； 36 Hz to 61 Hz with 41 Hz dominant； and36 Hz to 65 Hz with 41 Hz dominant) and with mono and binaural high alpha (10Hz) and beta (15Hz) entrainment. The patient was instructed to play the “Energize”program at an intensity level of 15and a volume level of 1 or 2. The second session of the day included30 minutes of the Sound Oasis “Sleep”program consisting of three music tracks with a component of low frequency gamma entrainment(32 Hz； range between 27.5 Hz to 44 Hz； and range between 34 Hz to52 Hz) and with mono and binaural delta (2Hz) entrainment. The patient was instructed to play the “Sleep”program at an intensity level of 5 and a volume level of 1 or 2.\n\n【29】The patient was given specific instructions (both in person and via a supplied manual) regarding usage of the VAT system. The research coordinator was available to answer any questions. In the event of adverse reactions the patient was advised to discontinue the intervention and report the reaction to one of the study team members.\n\n【30】Measures\n\n【31】The Brief Pain Inventory (Short Form； BPI-SF，Copyright 1991Charles S. Cleeland， PhD， used with permission)  was employed to measure the severity of patient’s pain and pain-related functional impairment.The pain severity score (PSS) is calculated by obtaining a mean score from 4 questions that patients report， rating the severity of their pain at its “worst\"， “least\"， “average\"， and “now\". These responses are measured on an 11-point scale from 0 (no pain) to 10(pain as bad as you can imagine). Pain interference is also measured on an 11-point scale and assesses the degree to which pain interferes in 7 categories including： daily activities， general activity， walking， work， mood， enjoyment of life， relations with others and sleep. A mean score is obtained for these 7 items (PIS). Reliability of the PSS and PIS is good as indicated by alpha coefficients of 0.85 and 0.88， respectively .\n\n【32】Sleep Quality Numerical Rating Scale (SQNRS). Sleep quality was measured on an 11 point Likert scale with 0 corresponding to best possible sleep and 10 to worst possible sleep was administered .\n\n【33】Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC)： A patient global impression of change was collected on a 7 point Likert scale (range 1=Very much worse，2=Much worse，3= slightly worse，4=No change，5= slightly better， 6= Much better， 7= Very much better).\n\n【34】Assessments\n\n【35】At the first study visit， written informed consent and consent to the transmission of personal health information via email was obtained. Since the study involved only one participant， Research Ethics Board approval was not required. The trial was conducted in accordance with the principals set out in the Declaration of Helsinki. The BPI-SF and SQNRS were administered at study initiation and at the end of weeks 2， 4 and 6.The PGIC was administered at the end of active treatment (week 4). The patient was given the vibroacoustic therapy system to take home for the duration of active therapy. The patient was contacted by the research coordinator two days following the first visit to ensure he was comfortable using the VAT system.\n\n【36】Forms for data collection were provided to the patient at study initiation.Dates and duration of usage of the study intervention， and the presence or absence of side-effects were recorded by the patient on a calendar. The patient was provided with specific instructions(in person and via instruction manual) regarding how to complete the calendar and was asked to submit the completed calendar via email weekly. The research coordinator contacted the patient weekly to ensure completion and submission of the calendar. The patient was instructed to present himself in person for the completion of assessments， or if this was not possible， to communicate the content ofthe forms electronically via email. For the first three visits (baseline， weeks 2 and 4)， the patient completed the forms in person. The final assessment forms (week 6) were completed at home and sent to the research coordinator via email. There were three telephone treatment check-ins， the first occurred 2 days following the baseline visit， the second occurred one week following the baseline visit and the last occurred at week 6.\n\n【37】Thirty minute semi-structured interviews took place in person at week 4， following active treatment， and over the phone at week6， following the 2 week washout period. The goal was to explore the patient's experience and perceived effectiveness of the VAT system for managing pain and sleep. The participant was asked about any new treatments started and any changes in medication.\n\n【38】Statistical Analysis\n\n【39】The change from baseline in the PSS and PIS to end of the active treatment period and the PGIC were the primary end points. Secondary endpoints were changes in the SQNRS over the course of the study and changes in the PSS， PIS and from time of treatment termination until the final assessment. Data were managed and results plotted in Microsoft Excel 2010 (Microsoft， Redmond， Washington USA).\n\n【40】Results\n\n【41】Primary findings\n\n【42】The BPI pain severity score measured 7.75 at baseline and was unchanged at termination of treatment. The BPI pain interference score improved by 2.43 points from baseline (8.86) to termination of active treatment (6.43). Following active treatment， the patient assigned a value of 5 on the PGIC scale， corresponding to “slightly better” indicating the patient perceived an improvement in his condition.\n\n【43】Secondary findings\n\n【44】The PSS increased slightly by 0.25 points between the termination of therapy (7.75) and the final follow-up two weeks later (8.0). The PIS increased 1.14 points， from 6.43 at termination oftherapy to 7.57at final assessment， indicating a worsening in pain disability. Sleep quality also worsened during this timeframe reflected in an increase on the SQNRS from 8 to 9. However， the SQNRS  remained unchanged from baseline over the course of active treatment.\n\n【45】Therefore， all three measures were compatible with a less favorable clinical state two weeks following termination of active treatment. Figure 1 illustrates these findings.\n\n【46】Freeform Observations\n\n【47】The patient made freeform observations on 9 out of 29 (31%) treatment days and on 11 out of 15 (73%)post-treatment days. These subjective responses will be reported together with responses from the semi-structured interviews at week four and week six.\n\n【48】Table 1： Exclusion Criteria.\n\n| Concomitant serious illnesses：  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Malignancy  |  |\n| Vertebral Fracture  |  |\n| Active inflammatary conditions e.g. spinal infection， ankylasing spandylitis  |  |\n| Osteoporosis  |  |\n| Scoliosis  |  |\n| Coccydynia  |  |\n| Metabolic bone disease  |  |\n| Bleeding or clotting disorder  |  |\n| Hypotension  |  |\n| Active psychiatric disorders (at discretion of investigators)  |  |\n| Use of antipsychotic medication  |  |\n| Bipolar disorder  |  |\n| Schizophrenia  |  |\n| Severe/psychotic depression or anxiety disorder  |  |\n| Pacemaker implant  |  |\n| Pregnancy  |  |\n| Table 2： Interview Questions at Week 4.  |  |\n\n【50】Table 2： Interview Questions at Week 4.\n\n| Patient Ratings： 0- 10 (10 is better)  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Parameter  | Numerical rating  |\n| Helpfulness for Pain  | 2  |\n| Helpfulness for improving sleep quantity  | 5  |\n| Helpfulness for improving sleep quality  | 4  |\n| Helpfulness for managing daily activities  | 4  |\n\n【52】The patient likened the experience of using the chair to having a massage and felt it would substitute for one.\n\n【53】The patient's use of the chair was extensive.He used it seven days per week and for 53 out of a possible 58 sessions. During the treatment phases there were consistent and/or repeated reports that VAT had significant activating effects on bowel function.Relaxation and/or lessening of muscle tension was reported on four days. The patient remarked that the treatment was relaxing but also helped to mobilize him in the morning.\n\n【54】He described an improvement in energylevels. There appeared to be effects on productivity which in turn elevated his mood. However， he could not be sure that the chair， rather than physiotherapy and additional self-help measures brought about these improvements.\n\n【55】The patient only made one change to his medication regime during the treatment period one day prior to termination. At that time he began taking a medication to counter an overactive bladder. He also began more challenging physiotherapy exercises during the treatment period，focusing on strengthening the shoulder and bladder.\n\n【56】In the post-treatment phase the patient reported increased muscle tightness or pain， headaches， sleep problems and he also reported increasing his bladder mediation dose from 4mg to 8mg/night. The medication dose increase was probably not linked to the termination of active treatment.\n\n【57】With respect to reported side effects， the patient experienced tingling sensations especially close to the time of initiating therapy. The tingling was described as “bothersome. In addition， effects of chills and nausea were reported once each on treatment days. While the patient felt that the use of the chair had mostly positive effects on his bowels， sometimes the stimulating effects led to a short interruption of treatment， which he found mildly bothersome.\n\n【58】Commenting on the shortcomings of the system， the patient noted that the chair did nottouchhis legs and therefore did not benefit that part of the body. Furthermore， the discrepancies in contours of the chair and of the patient’s back diminished the comfort of the treatment. He did find the time commitment to be an additional drawback.\n\n【59】At the termination of active treatment (week 4) the patient was asked to respond to four specific questions and to rate his response from O， representing not helpful at all to 10， representing extremely helpful.The questions and responses are summarized in table 2.\n\n【60】Following the 2-week washout period， in retrospect he found the VAT to be helpful for increasing his energy levels and providing a restful sleep， which in turn， impacted his mood positively. He reported that the increase in energy and improved mood encouraged him to take an important step and seek out a volunteer opportunity， something he felt unable to do prior to treatment due to his level of pain severity and interference.The patient remained unsure whether the chair or other factors fully accounted for the changes which occurred during the study timeframe. However， post-washout that he now believed the VAT to be mostly responsible for these changes.\n\n【61】Given these positive experience， he indicated that he would choose to use the system in the future and in fact approached us for information as to how he could acquire a chair for personal use. It was his preference to use the chair prior to sleep and on an “as needed”basis rather than twice per day.\n\n【62】Discussion\n\n【63】Use of the vibroacoustic chair was associated with some decline in the pain interference score over the four week treatment interval. However， there was no detectable change in the pain severity score or sleep quality from initiation to termination of active treatment. The patient’s global impression of change was positive but only moderately so.\n\n【64】The pain interference score showed some worsening of pain in the washout period. There was also a decline in sleep quality at the final assessment. Although minimal， the BPI pain severity score also showed worsening at the same time point.\n\n【65】Taken together with the patient's narrative reports， these finding are suggestive of very modest treatment effects accruing during the active phase of therapy and declining thereafter. There were no significant adverse effects but bothersome tingling especially in the early treatment sessions which could conceivably limit patient acceptance ofthe treatment in the event that it proves to be a common rather than isolated experience.\n\n【66】Given that this is an N of 1 unblinded study the significance of the reported findings is difficult to interpret. As this was an add-on therapy， it is not possible to attribute all of the changes seen during the study period to the effects of the chair. In addition to purely placebo effects， the other concurrently applied interventions and random variation may have contributed to the outcomes.\n\n【67】The noticeable lack of effect on the lower limbs， which would not have received direct stimulation in this treatment paradigm， is also of interest. Our expectation was that stimulation of the torso would producea generalized benefit extendingbeyond the site ofapplication. The study patient’s ongoing pain complaints were concentrated in the lower limbs. It is possible that patients'whose pain lies is largely centered in the torso might show more robust treatment effects.\n\n【68】Regardless of these limitations， the patient's positive responses have to be gauged against the refractory nature of his condition.\n\n【69】VAT requires further study for the treatment of painful Ehlers-Danlos and other chronic pain disorders such as fibromyalgia. The effect of bowel activation was unexpected and suggests that VAT of the torso might be beneficial for conditions are associated with chronic constipation.\n\n【70】Equipment manufactures should consider designing consumer VAT units that provides wide area stimulation including the lower limbs as well as the torso.\n\n【71】Conclusion\n\n【72】VAT offers an innovative， treatment approach that can be self-administered with few side effects in patients with EDS. Further research is necessary to define its role in therapy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:47:51", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:48:24", "cost": 32.948}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:48", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:48:24", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:47:49"}

Infantile atopic dermatitis may be caused， in particular， by exposure to indoor environmental factors during gestation and infancy； however， the underlying mechanism is unknown. A total of 2，609 healthy newborns who were enrolled in the COCOA study (COCOA) from 2008 to 2015 were surveyed for indoor environmental exposure to fungi during gestation and then diagnosed postnatally for atopic dermatitis. Fungal microorganisms were analyzed in house dust samples collected during gestation and their relationship was investigated. A total of 2，609 respondents were surveyed (52.8% male and 47.2%female) Children， 1， 2， and 3 years old diagnosed with atopic dermatitis comprised 15.2%，15.7%， and 14.1% of the respondents， respectively. The prevalence of exposure to mold during gestation was 1.46 (95% CI， 1.04) and 1.52 (95% CI， 0.43)， in the first and third years after birth， respectively. One-year-old children with atopic dermatitis and no fungal markers detected in the bathroom environment during gestation accounted for less than 5% (aOR， 1.51； 95% CI， 0.38). Exposure to indoor fungi during gestation and infancy is associated with the development ofatopic dermatitis in children. Future research will be necessary to establish the underlying mechanisms.\n\n【2】Keywords： Atopic dermatitis； Indoor environment； Mold； Pregnancy； Child\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Atopy dermatitis is known to be the most common occurrence of chronic recurrent dermatitis in children in childhood， and it is a disease that can be carried out with asthma， allergic rhinitis and chronic care . According to the epidemiological studies of childhood asthma and allergic diseases in children (International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood，ISAAC)， the results of a recent survey of atopic dermatitis in the 12 months of childhood (6~7 years old) are steadily increasing trend in the latest 12 months. Domestic children's atopic dermatitis also rose to 17percent in 2000 and 27 percent in.\n\n【5】Major causes of occurrence of atopic dermatitis are not known specifically， but are thought to be caused by interactions between genetic factors and environmental factors. With one parent's atopic dermatitis at least one child， the occurrence of a single parent is very high at 41.7 percent. In the event ofparental dermatitis in parents， the birth of a child affects the mother's atopic dermatitis in her mother (30.7%) and father (22.2%). Genetic factors cause that the mutations in the skin of the skin， which are genetically related to the skin barrier， are responsible for atopic dermatitis. Recent trend in the atopic dermatitis in atopic dermatitis has caused a major obstacle to the formation of a normal skin barrier due to the deterioration of the protein in the outer layer of the skin and the function of the protein . Influenced by environmental effects， the effects of changes in chemicals and living conditions (Especially， foods like food， formaldehyde， volatile organic chemicals， indirect smoking， mold， house dust mites， cockroach， house dust mites， etc.) from nearby factories contribute to the occurrence of atopic dermatitis . Among various environmental factors， mold exposure is thought to be the cause of the occurrence of atopic dermatitis . Global warming has caused temperatures worldwide to rise 0.1C over the next ten years， and the humidity is increasing by about 2% to 5%. The occurrence of fungal growth on this planet is reported to be growing， and the occurrence of fungal growth may be linked to increased occurrence of atopic dermatitis. Effects of microbial reproduction and development on indoor and outdoor air include temperature，humidity， and various nutrients. Among them，humidity is an important factor that directly effects the density of the fungi in the air . In the case of increased humidity in the home， the reproduction of fungus on walls and ceilings can be enhanced， resulting in an increase in the density of the airborne fungus due to increased concentrations of airborne tissue .\n\n【6】The results of the analysis of mold strain and fungal exposure caused by the influence of air are as follows. There is a lot of environmental assessment for households in determining the scope and types of microbial growth. It was conducted at random to assess the water damage by selecting 112 houses. Mold analysis collected20 bedrooms and 10 roof tiles， using a badge (polycarbonate filters， SKC， Eighty-four， PA， USA) to confirm the specimen with a microscope (bacteria). As a result， the main fungus is Aspergillus and Penicillium. There was a higher concentration of water than water damage where there was no water damage. The concentrations of toxins and B-glucan exceeded the criteria for health effects . In other journals， indoor exposure to moisture and mold was associated with the atopic dermatitis in the child's atopic dermatitis . We detected mold fouling on the walls of our homes through an infrared camera (IR： Infrared Radiation). As a result， the risk of fungal and bacterial concentrations and symptoms of atopic dermatitis in the air increased fifteen fold .\n\n【7】Fungal exposure affects the cells (Langerhans cells， keratinocytes， T lymphocytes) and factors (cytokines and Immunoglobulin (Ig)， IgE) involved in the development of atopic dermatitis. Increased CD4 and CD8+ T cell ratios， (Dupuy 1994) CD18， Th2-mediated cytokines Interleukin (IL) -4， IL-5， IL-10 and IgE promote the immune response and increase the risk of atopic dermatitis . In the development of atopic dermatitis， changes in the immune response due to exposure of microorganisms and fungi in the indoor and outdoor air are mainly caused during infancy . According to a recent UK study， fungal concentrations were measured using quantitative analytical methods (Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)). Ascomycota， Basidiomycota， and Malassezia were found to have a health effect at high concentrations in molds that affect water damage in domestic baths. Exposure to fungal species in the home has been a major cause of deterioration of immune function .\n\n【8】As a result， there are many data on fungus exposure cases reported abroad， but studies (cross-sectional study) on fungi mainly consist of questionnaires and observations.\n\n【9】There are very few studies on domestic atopic dermatitis and fungi. As a result of small -scale studies and short-term measurements and analyzes， there is little analysis of the basic data ofearly pregnancy. It was confirmed that exposure to fungi in early pregnancy hada negative effect on weight and growth of infants. Other influences on infant development have been proven by causality， such as temperature， humidity， and seasonality . As a prospective study， there is little research into the risk of fungal exposure after pregnancy. Among them， no data were available to assess the risk level according to the indoor mold exposure results of the family. Exposure to mold during pregnancy and infancy can be considered as an important risk factor for the development of atopic dermatitis . It is necessary to investigate the characteristics of fungal exposure in the environment which is one of the increasing factors of atopic dermatitis. Therefore， the purpose of this study is to determine whether exposure of fungi during pregnancy is related to the development of atopic dermatitis in infants and young children. Second， we analyzed the relationship between fungal species measured in indoor dust during pregnancy and infantile atopic dermatitis.\n\n【10】Materials and Methods\n\n【11】Subjects and study design\n\n【12】The subjects of this study were collected from the cohort(COCOA： Childhood Asthma and allergic Diseases Cohort Study) of cause identification of atopic asthma in the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since 2008. The study was conducted on2，609 children who participated until December 2015. Among them， there were 86 withdrawal consent， 3 tracking loss， 89 twins at birth，123 withdrawal victims， 123 withdrawal consent，25 tracking loss，429under 1 year old， 50 twins at 1 year old， withdrawal of consent 180. The study was conducted by excluding 13 cases of tracing loss， 493cases of under 3 years old， and 25 cases of twins at 3 years of age. The result is the remaining 1，064 . The subjects were surveyed36 weeks of pregnancy and 6 months， 1， 2， and 3 years after birth， focusing on the basic data of dust samples and questionnaires. The ISAAC (International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood) questionnaire was used to confirm symptoms and diagnosis of atopic dermatitis.\n\n【13】Research method overview\n\n【14】The environmental factors were divided into indoor dust analysis results and survey questionnaire. The diagnosis and symptoms of atopic dermatitis that appeared early after birth were investigated. The results of fungal exposure and allergic diseases were analyzed for causality and relevance to confirm environmental factors.\n\n【15】Questionnaire survey\n\n【16】The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board(IRB) at each hospital. This study was first conducted at Seoul Asan Hospital (IRB number 2008-0616)， Samsung Seoul Hospital (IRB number 2009-02-021)， Yonsei University Hospital (IRB number2008-0588) and CHA Gangnam Medical Center Hospital (IRB number 2010-010) in December 2008， and Seoul National University Hospital (IRB numberH-1401-086-550) began recruiting at COCOA in 2014. Consent was obtained from the mother. The interviews were carried out based on environmental factors. Acceptance of consent was made in accordance with the principles and recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki. The environmental questionnaire is as follows. The environmental questionnaire surveyed bed and living room， kitchen， bathroom， and other conditions in the residence period， mold exposure， exposure to wet space， and mold space. Among the main data， the severity of fungus exposure was examined by separating the fungi into 'invisible and 'visible (as 5%， 5~30%，30%more). Here， the 5% criterion was determined as adult hand size.\n\n【17】Diagnosis of allergic diseases\n\n【18】The questionnaire for atopic dermatitis was used in ISAAS questionnaires. Periodic follow-up was performed， parents' diagnosis between house dust samples from healthy and AD groups.\n\n| Children's age  | 1-year  | 2-year  | 3-year  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Variables  | N(%)，means + SDs  | N(%)，means ± SDs  | N(%)，means ± SDs  |\n| Number  | 1750  | 1288  | 1064  |\n| Maternal age (years)  | 32.7±3.4  | 32.6±3.5  | 32.5±3.5  |\n| Maternal history of allergic diseases  |  |  |  |\n| No  | 1160(70.2)  | 869(70.3)  | 724(70.8)  |\n| Yes  | 492(29.8)  | 367(29.7)  | 299(29.2)  |\n| Paternal history of allergic diseases  |  |  |  |\n| No  | 1099(72.0)  | 869(73.3)  | 721(73.1)  |\n| Yes  | 428(28.0)  | 317(26.7)  | 266(26.9)  |\n| Household income(10，000 won)  |  |  |  |\n| ≤299  | 303(19.1)  | 241(20.2)  | 211(21.3)  |\n| 300-499  | 661(41.7)  | 509(42.7)  | 418(42.6)  |\n| 2500  | 622(39.2)  | 441(37.0)  | 359(36.1)  |\n| Maternal educational level  |  |  |  |\n| ≤ High school  | 99(5.8)  | 81(6.4)  | 70(6.7)  |\n| sUniversity  | 1243(73.3)  | 912(72.0)  | 738(70.3)  |\n| 2 Graduate school  | 355(20.9)  | 273(21.6)  | 242(23.0)  |\n| Child's sex  |  |  |  |\n| Boy  | 907(52.0)  | 681(52.9)  | 571(53.7)  |\n| Girl  | 839(48.0)  | 607(47.1)  | 493(46.3)  |\n| Gestational age (week)  | 39.2±1.2  | 39.2±1.2  | 39.1±1.2  |\n\n【20】AR： Allergic Rhinitis； AD： Atopic Dermatitis questionnaires were used at 6 months， 1， 2， and 3 years after the birth of the subjects diagnosed with atopic dermatitis during the observation period. It is estimated that allergic physicians diagnosed directly at 5 hospitals.“Atopic dermatitis was defined as\" when an itchy skin rash (fever or atopic dermatitis) has been present for at least 6 months and has been diagnosed as \"eczema\" (fever or atopic dermatitis) by a doctor since birth.\n\n【21】Indoor mold exposure survey\n\n【22】Dust collection was conducted in 40 out of 2609 children living in Seoul and Gyeonggi-do from 2008 to December 2015. Twenty of the normal subjects and twenty of the atopic dermatitis were collected in the space where the infants live in the bedroom. The collection method was collected for 20 min through a professional vacuum cleaner (Electrolux)， and the collected dust was separated and stored in the freezer . The microorganism DNA present in the house dust was separated using FastDNA SPIN Kit for Soil(Qbiogene， MP Biomedicals， Illkirch， France). The isolated DNA was PCR amplified using the fusion primer containing the barcode and the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region. The sequences of the PCR products were confirmed using Illumina's MiSeq platform. The sequence of the microorganisms was analyzed by CL community(Chunlab， Seoul， korea) program.\n\n【23】Statistical analysis\n\n【24】In this study， dependent variables (atopic dermatitis at 6 months，1， 2， and 3 years) such as the correlation with fungal environmental factors were analyzed using SAS (SAS Institute Inc.， Cary， NC， USA) version 9.3. Frequency analysis was used to show the general characteristics (percentage) of subjects (infants during pregnancy).\n\n【25】Table 2： Prevalence of atopic dermatitis.\n\n|  | N (%)， means ±SDs  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Parent-reported， doctor diagnosed atopic dermatitis  |  |\n| 1 count  | 229/1139(20.1%)  |\n| 2 count  | 171/852 (20.2%)  |\n| 3 count  | 109/600(18.2%)  |\n| diagnosis of atopic dermatitis by physician  |  |\n| 1 count  | 200/1314(15.2%)  |\n| 2 count  | 152/966(15.7%)  |\n| 3 count  | 104/737(14.1%)  |\n\n【27】The diagnosis of atopic dermatitis due to general characteristics is considered to affect children， parents， and environmental questionnaires. The association between parental allergic disease history and chi-square test and t-test was used to determine the difference in fungal exposure. The effects of fungi on children's atopic dermatitis were analyzed by adjusting the exposure period according to the factors ofchildren， socioeconomic factors of parents， and parental allergy history. To determine the effect of indoor dust collection on atopic dermatitis， multiple logistic regression analyzes were used to calculate the difference in ratios (Odds ratio，OR) and the 95% confidence interval (95% Confidence Interval， 95% CI).\n\n【28】Results\n\n【29】Characteristics of the study population\n\n【30】The subjects were 1 (N=1750)，2(N=1288)， and 3 (N=1064) year old， the average age of the mother was 32 (32.6±3.5) years old.

But it was not statistically significant. In the case of atopic dermatitis at 1year， the information on the fungus exposure by the environmental questionnaire was analyzed. As a result， the exposure area of the fungus tended to decrease in 30%， 0.99 (95% CI， 0.59)， less than5~30%，0.78 (95% CI， 0.42) and less than 5% 0.76 (95% CI， 0.06).

In the environmental questionnaire， fungal exposure results show that 2-year-old atopic dermatitis is gradually increasing as the fungus exposure area expands compared to the group without mold exposure. In atopic dermatitis， the risk of exposure to molds in various places of the room increased from a total area of 30% to 2.69 (95% CI， 1.97)， compared to those without 1 year of age. On the other hand， at 2 years of age， the risk increased to 1.81(95% CI， 0.51) at less than 5~30% of the total area compared to the group without mold .\n\n【52】Fungal analysis results collected from indoor dust\n\n【53】This study was conducted by visiting a 36-week pregnant home in December 2015 to collect dust from the bedroom. As a result， 20children with atopic dermatitis and 20 normal children were found to have a parent age of 33.55 years with atopic dermatitis. The gestational age was almost the same (39.17 in the normal group， 39.49 in the atopic dermatitis group)， and birth weight was as high as 3043.58grams in the atopic dermatitis group . The total number of401，206 reads was obtained by sequencing microbial DNA from fungi present in 20 normal and 20 atopic fungi . There was no significant difference in OTUs， Chaol， Shannon， and Simpson values between the normal groups and atopic dermatitis groups \n\n【54】Comparison of fungal distributions diversity\n\n【55】The total number of molds found in the house dust collectors was 10 at the phylum level (Ascomycota， Basidiomycota， Eukaryaucp， Fungiuc， Chytridiomycota， Glomeromycota， Mucoralesp， Mortierellalesp， Blastocladiomycota， Monoblepharidomycota). Among them， Ascomycota was significantly higher in the atopic dermatitis group (73.98±2.96%) than in the normal group (63.61±3.91%) (P=0.021)， and Basidiomycota was lower in the atopic dermatitis group (14.21± 1.53%) than in the normal group (27.86±3.87%)(P=0.001) . A total of 1，068 species of fungi were found at the genus level. Among them， there were 4 molds which showed significant difference in the house dust of normal group and atopic dermatitis group (Cyphellophora， Malassezia， Pleurotus， Trichosporon). However， Alternaria， Aspergillus， Fusarium， and Candida，which are generally associated with allergic diseases， showed a higher trend in the house dust of the atopic dermatitis group than the normal group .\n\n【56】Discussion\n\n【57】The results of this study showed that exposure to fungi during pregnancy using environmental questionnaires was a risk factor for the development of atopic dermatitis at 1 and 3 years of age， and increased risk of atopic dermatitis at higher exposure to fungi in bathrooms and other places in the room. The incidence of atopic dermatitis was increased at 2 years ofageaccording to degree of fungus mark. Ascomycota was higher in the atopic dermatitis group (73.98 ±2.96%) than in the normal group (63.61±3.91%). Analysis of indoor dust during pregnancy showed that Ascomycota was higher in atopic dermatitis than in normal group in molds exposed to mold. These results suggest that exposure of indoor fungi during pregnancy may cause atopic dermatitis and that there is a difference in the types of indoor fungi exposed during pregnancy. There has been no previous study on the sequencing of indoor fungal exposure during pregnancy in Korean infants. In this study， we prospectively investigated the relationship between fungal exposure during pregnancy and atopic dermatitis in pregnant women. In addition， this study was the first study to demonstrate the difference of fungi in indoor dust. Domestic studies have shown that Malassezia and Candida， which are directly related to atopic dermatitis， are found in blood antibodies . The causal factor of atopic dermatitis is correlated with fungal exposure.\n\n【58】Table 7： List of fungal genera and their relative abundance (%) in house dust samples trom two groups.\n\n| Taxon  |  | Status  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Phylum  | Genus  | Health(n=20)  | AD(n=20)  | PValue  |\n| Ascomycota  | Alternania  | 7.9104  | 12.8797  | 0.079  |\n| Ascomycota  | Aspergilfus  | 4.1237  | 5.1118  | 0.705  |\n| Ascomycota  | Aureobasidium  | 5.8441  | 5.0303  | 0.85  |\n| Ascomycota  | Candida  | 0.7504  | 1.0536  | 0.725  |\n| Ascomycota  | Cladosporium  | 7.8394  | 7.6885  | 0.725  |\n| Ascomycota  | Cyphellophora  | 0.5648  | 0.6081  | 0.022  |\n| Ascomycota  | Exophiala  | 0.3533  | 0.8299  | 0.957  |\n| Ascomycota  | Fusarium  | 0.6404  | 1.3015  | 0.685  |\n| Ascomycota  | Leptosphaerufina  | 1.4300  | 0.8881  | 0.291  |\n| Ascomycota  | Meyerozyma  | 0.0367  | 1.7910  | 0.989  |\n| Ascomycota  | Nigrospora  | 0.7219  | 0.5520  | 0.344  |\n| Ascomycota  | Penicillium  | 2.7624  | 1.3681  | 0.978  |\n| Ascomycota  | Peyronellaea  | 1.6187  | 2.7516  | 0.818  |\n| Ascomycota  | Phoma  | 7.1393  | 6.3727  | 1  |\n| Ascomycota  | Pleospora  | 0.4702  | 0.5722  | 0.487  |\n| Ascomycota  | Saccharomyces  | 2.9811  | 1.0517  | 0.176  |\n| Basidiomycota  | Cryptococcus  | 1.8277  | 2.1603  | 0.725  |\n| Basidiomycota  | Malassezia  | 10.8815  | 4.4114  | 0.005  |\n| Basidiomycota  | Malasseziaceae uc  | 0.8520  | 1.2991  | 0.626  |\n| Basidiomycota  | Pleurotus  | 3.2915  | 0.0260  | 0.005  |\n| Basidiomycota  | Rhodotorula  | 1.5704  | 0.7741  | 0.725  |\n| Basidiomycota  | Trichosporon  | 4.1956  | 0.3016  | 0.003  |\n\n【60】In low-income households who remodeled in the past， the fungal concentration was 38% higher than those who did not remodel . Other studies have shown that the risk of exposure to dust mite 94.3%， cockroach 41.5%， and fungus 19.4% increases in children aged 6to 15years who were diagnosed with atopic dermatitis .\n\n【61】Similar to this study in Japan， fungal exposure in bathrooms and showers was a risk factor for atopic dermatitis . In the United States， the risk factors for fungal exposure in atopic dermatitis patients are reported to affect young adults and adults as well as the prevalence rate in children under 6 years of age . As a result of this study， the risk of atopic dermatitis was increased to 1.46 and 1.52times in 1 year and 3-year-old children. In case of 1-year old atopic dermatitis， the degree of fungus exposure in the bathroom was less than 5% the risk of atopic dermatitis was increased according to the degree of exposure， which was 1.51-and 2.21-times higher risk than the group without fungus exposure.\n\n【62】Direct measurement of mold in dust， the phylum level of mold was higher in indoor dust mildew during pregnancy than Ascomycota in atopic dermatitis group (P=0.021). Basidiomycota was lower in Malassezia， Pleurotus and Trichosporon in atopic dermatitis group (P=0.001). At the genus level， the fungi that showed statistically significant differences were Cyphellophora， Malassezia， Pleurotus and Trichosporon. According to foreign data，the result of using the rRNA clone library for fungal microorganisms in 9 patients with atopic dermatitis and 10 patients with normal group. Candida albicans， Cryptococcus diffluens， and Cryptococcus liquefaciens were found to be a new type of skin in atopic dermatitis patients . Species as a cause of deterioration of atopic dermatitis and in some adult studies， molecular DNA classification and Malassezia yeast were found in75% to 98% of healthy adults in the normal mass of the skin and normal skin . Patients with atopic dermatitis are very susceptible to mold because their skin is dry and damages the barrier function of the skin. Considering the diversity of indoor fungal concentration(Ventilation， temperature， humidity， etc.)， Malassezia was found in3 out of 19 patients， and was found to be an allergic risk factor for increased fungal exposure .\n\n【63】The effect of fungal exposure on atopic dermatitis was found to affect atopic dermatitis according to the time ofexposure， the duration of exposure， and the exposure dose ofearly childhood (12 months old) during the infancy， which directly affects the production ofROS in the skin. The mechanism of atopic dermatitis of certain fungi exposure is related to the occurrence of atopic dermatitis because the specific fungal toxin component including patulin inhibits the expression of Th1 cytokines such as IFN-y and IL-12， thereby becoming more prominent in the Th2 response . Previously published studies have shown that certain gene polymorphisms associated with the treatment of reactive oxygen species such as GSTP1 and GSTM1are associated with the development of atopic dermatitis， which is associated with the development of atopic dermatitis through the production of reactive oxygen species .\n\n【64】Based on the results of this study， further studies will be needed to determine whether there is any difference in the production of reactive oxygen species depending on the type of fungi . Differences in the fungal cell wall components depending on the type of fungus may affect the immune response， immune system formation， inflammation and gene expression by acting on different cell receptors. In addition， depending on the type of fungus， it is associated with activation of cells to specific antigens. This may cause other immune mediated responses and may be associated with the development of atopic dermatitis. Further studies on this mechanism will be needed in the future.\n\n【65】Limitations of this study include a prospective study of information on the first fungal exposure， but may be inconsistent with the actual exposure as it is based on the survey. However， this questionnaire has been used widely in European studies and has already been applied in the existing epidemiological studies in Korea . Second， there is a limit to whether the total number of individuals tested at the molecular level in indoor dust is as low as40 homes . However， there is no prospectively investigating the exposure of indoor fungi duringpregnancy both at home and abroad.\n\n【66】Therefore， I think that it will be a new attempt and I hope that the research will be reproduced in many subjects in the future. Despite these limitations， this study is not only meaningful as a prospective causal relationship between exposure to fungus during pregnancy and early childhood and the development of atopic dermatitis in children through the COCOA study， a birth cohort for the general public in Korea.\n\n【67】In particular， it may be the first study to measure fungi at the molecular level in exposed indoor dust during actual pregnancy. In summary， exposure to mold during pregnancy was associated with the development of atopic dermatitis in infants and young children. Ascomycota was significantly higher in the house dust of subjects with atopic dermatitis than in the normal group， and Basidiomycota was lower in subjects with atopic dermatitis at the phylum level in indoor dust exposed during pregnancy. Among the fungi belonging to Ascomycota at Genus level， Alternaria， Aspergillus， Fusarium， and Candida were more common in atopic dermatitis subiects and Malassezia， Pleuotus and Trichosporon were fewer. These results suggest that the fungi of indoor dust exposed during pregnancy may be different. Future research will be necessary.\n\n【68】Conclusion\n\n【69】Indoor mold exposure during pregnancy and11infancy is associated with the development of atopic dermatitis in children.At1 and 3 years old， mold exposure is increased in various places in the bathroom and in the room by doctor’s diagnosis of atopic dermatitis. On the other hand， fungal exposure increased at the age of 2 years in the diagnosis of atopic dermatitis. The concentrations of phylum and genus in the indoor house dust molds exposed during pregnancy were different. In the case of 40 households， microbial DNA was isolated and sequenced in indoor dust. Ascomycota was significantly higher in the atopic dermatitis group than in the phylum group， while statistical significance was lower in the atopic dermatitis group in the basidiomycota. These results suggest that maternal exposure to mothers during pregnancy may play an important role in the development of atopic dermatitis in children. According to actual measurement data， the type of fungus exposed to indoor dust during pregnancy is different among normal children and atopic dermatitis among the born children. These results suggest that mothers may be associated with the development of atopic dermatitis in children due to exposure to other types of fungi in indoor environments in the future. More research is needed in the future， as well as how the fungal exposure of the indoor environment is linked to human disease. Studies on the mechanism of fungal exposure related to the development of allergic diseases through animal research and cell research are necessary.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:49:09", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:49:48", "cost": 39.317}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:48", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:49:47", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:49:08"}

Proliferation of abnormal cells in the bone marrow interfere with normal production of normal blood cells . Classically， patients present with lethargy， easy bleeding and bruising， and increased risk ofinfection. Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) is a rare blood disorder caused antibodies against the enzyme ADAMTS13， which results in the fragmentation of platelets by uncleaved von Willebrand multimers and subsequent formation of blood clots in microvasculature throughout the body . Classically， these patients present with low-grade fevers， anemia， thrombocytopenia， acute kidney injury， altered mental status， and schistocytes on peripheral blood smear . We would like to present a patient whose clinical presentation aligned with TTP， but upon further investigation， was found to have a rare form of AML.\n\n【5】This is a 75-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with altered mental status， non-bloody diarrhea， subjective fevers， and intermittent epistaxis， each of which had been present for the past two weeks. Past medical history was notable for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus， paroxysmal atrial fibrillation， anticoagulated with apixaban 5 mg BID， and hypertension. At this time， physical exam was notable for a lethargic， obese male in no acute distress， epistaxis from right nostril， 3/6 crescendo-decrescendo murmur in the right upper sternal border， hepatosplenomegaly，and petechiae scattered across the patient's bilateral lower extremities.\n\n【6】Complete Blood Count (CBC) with differential was ordered on arrival， which revealed the patient's hemoglobin， mean corpuscular volume， and platelets to be 9.2 grams per deciliter (g/dL)， 78.7 liters per cell， and 11，000 per microliter (uL)， respectively. Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP) was remarkable for a creatinine of 1.5 micrograms per deciliter (mg/dL)， which was increased from his baseline of 1.1 mg/dL. The patient was given one unit of platelets and the CBC was rechecked post-transfusion. The platelets had decreased from 11，000 per uL to 9，000 per uL. At this time， coagulation studies were ordered and found to the following： Prothrombin Time(PT) 17.1， Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) 36.5， D-dimer 1.67 micrograms per milliliter (ug/ mL)， fibrinogen 630 mg/dL， all of which were increased. Lactic Acid Dehydrogenase (LDH) and haptoglobin were both elevated at 605units per liter and 243 mg/dL， respectively. The patient's reticulocyte count was decreased at 0.008 cells per uL.\n\n【7】Non-contrast Computerized Tomography (CT) of the patient's abdomen featured non-specific hepatic nodules and splenomegaly. At this time， a peripheral blood smear was ordered， which was remarkable for 2%schistocytes without blasts.The patient underwent plasmapheresis treatment for suspectedThrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) for a total of five days. The patient did not respond to therapy， as his platelets continued to oscillate between 8，000 and 12，000 uL.\n\n【8】After the plasmapheresis was completed， the decision was made to proceed with a bone marrow biopsy and fluorescent in situ hybridization， which was remarkable for a long arm deletion on chromosome 5， which supported a formal diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes. Throughout the entire hospital course，thepatient was given 11 units of packed red blood cells and 12 units of platelets for sustained anemia and thrombocytopenia， respectively.Due to the patient's age and comorbidities， the decision was made to treat him with a five-day course of decitabine， a low-intensity chemotherapy drug. On day 13 of his hospitalization， the patient and family elected for supportive care. On the morning of day14， the patient was pronounced dead due to complications from AML and subsequent treatment.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】The case described above is an extremely rare presentation of a rare condition. This case highlights the importance of a high clinical index of suspicion for acute myeloid leukemia in patients who present with unexplained cytopenias and constitutional symptoms even when there are distracting symptoms and an absence of blasts on peripheral. Since the patient presented with the classic pentad of TTP symptoms (fever， anemia， thrombocytopenia， acute kidney injury， and altered mental status) and 2% schistocytes were seen on peripheral blood smear， diagnosis of AML was consequently delayed.\n\n【11】Relying on the classic presentation of TTP symptoms is unreliable， as only 20% to 30% of patients present with the pentad . Moreover， the presence of schistocytes is not specific for TTP. In fact， in TTP， schistocytes typically range between 3% to 10%.  Schistocytes may also be seen in Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation(DIC)， Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (HUS)， and malfunctioning heart valves . In our patient， increased haptoglobin， increased fibrinogen， and absence of bloody diarrhea made TTP，DIC，and HUS less likely， respectively. Moreover， the severely low reticulocyte count made malignancy or aplastic anemia much more likely. In retrospect， the patient's previously undiagnosed severe aortic stenosis was the likely etiology for the abnormal peripheral blood smear. Although the initial diagnosis of TTP was incorrect， the correct protocol was followed as plasmapheresis exchange transfusion is recommended in any patient with suspected TTP since mortality is as high as 90%without treatment.\n\n【12】Although AML is a relative rare disease， it is the most common acute leukemia in adults . Non-Hispanic white males have a higher incidence than other racial and ethnic groups and the median age at diagnosis is 65 years of age .\n\n【13】The etiologies of underlying chromosomal abnormalities in most cases of AML are largely unknown . The WHO 2008classification of AML categorizes the condition into subtypes， which aids in diagnosis and prognosis . Our patient was found to have a5q deletion， which most often occurs in elderly patients with prior Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and is associated with rapid deterioration and poor prognosis . Our patient's prognosis was especially poor considering he had metastatic lesions in his liver and spleen .\n\n【14】Treatment of AML is largely based on the patient’s age， comorbidities， current functional status， and goals of treatment at time of diagnosis， as treatment is highly variable and may actually decrease life expectancy . In patients with AML with deletions of chromosome 5g， there is insufficient data to predict the possibility of complete remission in elderly patients with comorbidities . However， delaying treatment has been associated with a decreased rate of complete remission and decreased life expectancy by 3 to 5months in select patient populations.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】There have been no reported cases of acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes presenting as thrombocytopenic thrombotic purpura. Early diagnosis of acute myeloid in elderly patients is especially important due to the rapid progression of this disease. In summation， this case shows that acute myeloid leukemia should be under consideration in elderly patients presenting with unexplained cytopenias and constitutionalsymptoms， even in the absence of blasts on peripheral blood smear. It is important to diagnose acute myeloid leukemia in its early stages and manage it appropriately in order to prolong survival and increase the chances of complete remission.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:42:23", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:42:36", "cost": 12.961}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:48", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:42:36", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:42:23"}

Prolonged use of corticoids can induce some specific side effects like iatrogenic Cushing syndrome(moon face， central obesity，plethora，buffalo hump). Sudden withdrawal ofcorticosteroids will lead to adrenal hypertrophy which releases insufficient cortisol into the blood and leads to adrenal crisis. Here， a 52 years old female patient experienced Cushing syndrome after taking dexamethasone tablet for prolonged period. She presented with all physical symptoms of Cushing syndrome. As patient is under adrenal crisis patient collapsed due to septic shock. The prominent ways to avoid these conditions are to provide patient counseling before initiating corticosteroids and warning the patient about sudden withdrawal of corticosteroids.\n\n【2】Keywords： Iatrogenic Cushing syndrome； Corticosteroids； Dexamethasone； Adrenal crisis； Cortisol\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Cushing's Syndrome (CS) was discovered in 1912 by the American neurosurgeon Harvey Cushing . CS is a relatively rare disease， with an annual incidence of 0.2 to 5.0 per million people.\n\n【5】It is a condition characterized by high blood levels of cortisol or other exogenous compounds of glucocorticoids .\n\n【6】It can be caused by either endogenous factors such as excess steroid production and secretion due to adrenal or pituitary tumors， or exogenously through prolonged use of corticosteroid medications(ex： Budesonide， Cortisone， Dexamethasone， Hydrocortisone， Methylprednisolone， Prednisolone， Prednisone， Triamcinolone) resulting in iatrogenic CS .\n\n【7】The clinical manifestations weight gain， usually presenting as central obesity with redistribution of body fat to truncal areas and the appearance of dorsocervical and supraclavicular fat pads and the classic moon face. Plethora， easy bruising， thin skin， striae， myopathy， and muscle weakness(particularly proximal muscles) can be seen， patients are susceptible to poor wound healing and increased incidence of infection . The aim of the current study is to present a rare case of oral corticosteroid induced iatrogenic CS in an 52 years old female patient.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 52 years old female patient was admitted to emergency department， of Vijayanagara Institute of Medical Sciences， Ballari，Karnataka.\n\n【10】The patient presented with complaints of abdominal pain and distension， breathlessness，pedal edema， rashes all over the body for 1 day.\n\n【11】On examination， patients BP was not recordable， as patient was obese， her PR was 83 bpm，SpO， was 93%.\n\n【12】Physical examinations： \n\n【13】Moon face (facial edema)\n\n【14】Central obesity\n\n【15】Pedal edema\n\n【16】Bruises all over the body\n\n【17】Abdominal stairs\n\n【18】On systemic examination\n\n【19】RS： Bilateral fine crept at intrascapular and intra axillary area.\n\n【20】CNS： Patient was conscious and disoriented to place and time CVS： S1 S2+no murmurs.\n\n【21】PA： Soft non tender no organomegaly\n\n【22】On enquiring patient attenders， the medical and medication history of patient as follows：\n\n【23】She was K/C/O Rheumatoid arthritis in the past 1 year； she was on treatment with TAB. Dexamethasone (4 mg) in the past 1 year. The tablet was discontinued 5 days back.\n\n【24】Patient was taking OTC tab. Diclofenac tab. Omeprazole along with dexamethasone since past 1 year.\n\n【25】Patient attenders reported that she gained weight significantly in the last 8 months and she got red colored bruises all over body in the last 3 months.\n\n【26】Blood withdrawal was not possible at time of admission as patient is very obese blood vessel detection was not possible so no preliminary tests like CBC RFT LFT cortisol levels was not checked. Canulation done to left lower limb after several attempts.\n\n【27】Patient was under 5 L oxygen as she was complaining of breathlessness and her SPo， on 5L O， was- 90% PR： 54bpm.\n\n【28】Patient treated symptomatically with 5 L O， therapies， 2-pint IV Fluids， inj. Noradrenalin， and inj. Ondansetron. Due to sudden discontinuing of dexamethasone the patient experiencing adrenal crisis and she diagnosed with sepsis with septic shock. Due to aspirational pneumonia the patient collapsed before initiating ventilator support.\n\n【29】Discussion\n\n【30】Glucocorticoids are commonly used in clinical practice for the management of various autoimmune， inflammatory and allergic diseases. Drugs like dexamethasone can cause Cushing syndrome， irrational administration of glucocorticoids iss most common particularly in chronic therapies which lead to many side effects like hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis suppression， Cushing's syndrome， increased risk of infections and changes in mental status. Before initiating steroid therapy， patients should be well informed about the possible side effects of steroids.\n\n【31】Otherwise， it may lead to severe systemic side effects including Cushing's syndrome， hypertension， dyslipidemia， and suppression of hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis， striae， glaucoma， skin atrophy， cataract and predisposition to life threatening infections .\n\n【32】Iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome was suspected if the patient had：AM Cortisol of ≤4 mcg/dL and ACTH of ≤ 10 pcg/mL. Iatrogenic Cushing's syndrome is the most common cause of hypercortisolism. Most patients with Cushing syndrome have round， red， full moon face， growth retardation in children， fat accumulation on the trunk along with weight gain， fat loss from the buttocks， legs， and arms (central obesity)， skin infections， purple marks (striae) on the skin of the breast， abdomen and thighs， thinly skin with easy bruising， backache while doing routine activities， fat deposit between the shoulders and above the collar bone， hips and shoulder muscle weakness， fracture of the rib and spine due to thinning of the bones.\n\n【33】Treatment is done by tapering the dose of corticosteroids which may take a year. Sudden stoppage corticosteroids after chronic intake can results in adrenal crisis . Slowly tapering the corticosteroid that is causing Cushing syndrome can help reverse the effects of adrenal gland atrophy .\n\n【34】In our case patient is under adrenal crisis as she stopped the drug suddenly and patient is in septic shock condition so before initiating steroid tapering therapy patient collapsed due to pneumonia.\n\n【35】Conclusion\n\n【36】In our case， we found that the Dexamethasone was a sole reason for occurrence of Cushing syndrome. The patient was prescribed with Dexamethasone for her rheumatic arthritis disorder， she had discontinued this drug suddenly， which lead her to adrenal crisis and eventually mortality. Hence this case report delineates us about the importance of patient counseling and early detection of symptoms. It is suggestive that she or her family members should have been enlightened about early symptoms of CS and the potential risk associated with the sudden withdrawal ofthis drug， so that impending severity of ADR is either prevented or reduced and expected mortality is hampered.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:09:01", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:09:20", "cost": 18.927}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:48", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:09:19", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:09:00"}

The majority of these paraproteins are IgG with less than 15% being IgM. In patients with peripheral neuropathy， particularly those with demyelinating neuropathies IgM monoclonal gammopathy are much more common. Optic neuritis is an inflammatory， demyelinating condition that causes acute， usually monocular， visual loss. Optic neuritis is the presenting symptom in 15% to 20% of multiple sclerosis patients， but it can also be a secondary presentation of some other disorders. We will describe the case of 37 year old woman who presented with retrobulbar pain and visual field disturbances of the left eye. Spinal tap revealed oligoclonal bands type 5 suggesting haematological disorder. Serum protein electrophoresis showed IgG kappa paraprotein. After diagnostic workup， diagnosis of subclinical Monoclonal Gammopathy (MGUS) was established. Retrobulbar neuritis was treated with corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolonum， 1 g) for 3 days with significant regression of pain and visual loss.\n\n【2】Keywords： Optic neuritis； Visual evoked response； IgG gammopathy； MGUS； Diagnostic workup\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Monoclonal gammopathies are caused by proliferation of monoclonal plasma cells or B lymphocytes. Clinical picture varies from the subclinical Monoclonal Gammopathy of Uncertain Significance(MGUS)， to malignant systemic disorders . IgM Monoclonal Gammopathy is much more common in patients with peripheral， particularly demyelinating neuropathies. Peripheral neuropathy associated with multiple myeloma can be due to perineural or perivascular IgG kappa deposition .Optic neuritis is an inflammatory，demyelinating condition that causes acute， usually monocular， visual loss. It can be a secondary presentation of ischemic optic neuropathy， infections， inflammation， genetic disorders， neoplasms，local compression， or a consequence oftoxic/metabolic disorders or the first symptom of multiple sclerosis (15% to 20% patients).\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】We would like to present the case of a 37 year old woman who was admitted to our department due to almost constant retrobulbar pain and visual field disturbances of the left eye. She noticed the first symptoms six months prior to overt clinical presentation. They were most conspicuous in the morning with regressive dynamic during the day. Her neurological examination showed no alterations apart from intermittent pain of the left eye， most prominent behind the eye， with decreased visual acuity and change in colour perception. In her personal history she reported occasional migraines associated with menstrual cycle from childhood that responded well to non-steroid analgesics. From family history： patient's mother died due to uterine cancer， her father died due to pancreatic cancer， and her daughter had already established MGUS diagnosis.\n\n【7】Standard laboratory workup was performed. Complete blood count and biochemistry analysis showed normal findings. MRI of the brain showed slight increase of signal in coronal STIR  sequence of the left optical nerve suggesting optic neuritis of the left eye. There was no gadolinium contrast enhancement. MRI of the cervical spine showed normal finding. Thyroid hormones and tumor markers were within the normal range. Spinal tap showed neither pleocytosis nor protein elevation， and oligoclonal bands were type 5 suggesting hematological disorder. Serum electrophoresis and immunofixation， serum free light chain assay， and quantification of immunoglobulins were performed to identify them as IgG kappa paraproteins.\n\n【8】Consequentially， abdominal ultrasound， breast ultrasound and chest X-ray was performed and showed normal findings. Metastatic bone survey was performed by means of X-ray and finding was highly suspicious for bone lesions in the neck region of the right femur as well as parietal region on craniogram. Therefore MRI of the pelvis and both femurs was performed and it did not prove any lytic bone lesions. MRI of the head， also， showed no bonelesions. Visual Evoked Response (VER) showed a delay in P100 response component  that is a manifestation of slowed conduction of the left optic nerve as a result of demyelination. Lastly， aquaporin-4-specifilc serum antibodies were negative.\n\n【9】After hematological workup， diagnosis of subclinical Monoclonal Gammopathy (MGUS) was established. Optic neuritis was treated with corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolonum， 1g) for 3 days with significant regression of pain and increase in visual acuity. At further follow up， 6 months after， our patient had no signs of visual disturbances. Visual field showed normal findings. Hematologic disorder was， also， under control requiring no active treatment. Control VER detected a normal finding .\n\n【10】Discussion and Conclusion\n\n【11】Monoclonal Gammopathy are heterogeneous group of disorders， ranging from MGUS， to malignant systemic disorders such as multiple myeloma， amyloidosis，Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemiaaand POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy，organomegaly， endocrinopathy， M-spike or monoclonal gammopathy and skin changes).\n\n【12】Monoclonal Gammopathy are caused by proliferation of monoclonal plasma cells or Blymphocytes， they are characterized by the proliferation and deposition of M proteins or paraproteins that are formed by a single heavy chain (M， G or A) and a light chain(kappa or lambda) . Monoclonal Gammopathy occur in 1% of healthy individuals older than 25 years， without an associated plasma cell disorder . The majority of these paraproteins are IgG with less than 15% being IgM. In patients with peripheral neuropathy， particularly those with demyelinating neuropathies IgM monoclonal gammopathy are much more common . Peripheral neuropathy associated with monoconal gammopathy is rare， but important cause of neuropathy because of serious， yet treatable underlying disease . IgG monoclonal gammopathy (35% of patients) and IgA monoclonal gammopathy (15% of patients) are rarely associated with specific neuropathies. However， usually IgM Monoclonal Gammopathy of uncertain significance (MGUS) is the most commonly found Monoclonal Gammopathy associated with neuropathy (50% of patients) ) . Peripheral neuropathy associated with multiple myeloma can be caused by either perineural or perivascular IgG kappa deposition . Underlying etiology of peripheral neuropathy in patients with monoconal gammopathy is not well understood. Some evidence suggests that the M protein cross-reacts with a neural antigen， such as 4-Methylumbelliferyl B-D-galactopyranoside(MUG)-a glycoprotein found in the myelin sheath of both the central and peripheral nervous systems， sulfurizing glucuronyl paragloboside and sulfatide resulting in activation of complement and nerve damage.Also，there is possible secondary toxic or metabolic influence on nerve damage， but this is still unclear . Additionally， the risk of developing MGUS appears to be higher among individuals with first degree relatives with either multiple myeloma (RR 2.0) or MGUS (RR3.3). Diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy is usually incidental and it is commonly established during evaluation of another disorder such as unexplained proteinuria， bone loss， elevated total protein in blood or peripheral neuropathy of undefined etiology . In evaluation of patients suspected for having monoclonal gammopathy， the following work up should be performed： complete blood count， serum and urine electrophoresis and immunofixation， serum free light chain assay， quantification ofimmunoglobulin's， metastatic bone survey (X-ray， computerized tomography-CT or magnetic resonance imaging-MRI evaluation and positron emission tomography-PET/CT) . According to the results of aforementioned workup， it is important to distinguish MGUS from more advanced plasma cells dyscrasia such as multiple myeloma (smouldering or symptomatic)， Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (smouldering or symptomatic)， idiopathic Bens Jones proteinuria or primary amyloidosis .\n\n【13】Optic neuritis is an inflammatory， demyelinating condition that causes acute， usually monocular， visual loss. Optic neuritis is the presenting symptom in 15% to 20% of MS patients， but it can be also be the presentation of ischemic optic neuropathy， infections， inflammation， genetic disorders， neoplasms， local compression， various demyelinating CNS disorders or a consequence of toxic/metabolic disorders. Visual deficits can present as changes in visual acuity， decrease in contrast sensitivity， colour vision reduction or various defects of the visual field . In general， optic neuritis is a clinical diagnosis based on medical history， and examination findings including ophthalmologic evaluation as well as MRI of the brain and orbits with gadolinium contrast. Spinal tap is not an essential diagnostic test in optic neuritis， but it should be performed in atypical cases. Patients with acute optic neuritis in 60% to 80% can have abnormalities in the Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) finding including elevated lymphocyte count  and elevated protein， and also myelin basic protein elevation in about 20% of patients， IgG synthesis can be found in 20% to 36% patients and oligoclonal bands in 56% to69% of patients . Other testing includes fluorescein angiography， visual evoked responses， optical coherence tomography， and aquaporin-4-specific serum antibodies .\n\n【14】From this case we have learned that optic neuritis can be the first sign of multiple sclerosis， but also a rare complication of a hematological disorder. In such cases wide diagnostic workup should be performed in order to establish the true diagnosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:49:05", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:49:15", "cost": 9.948}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:48", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:49:15", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:49:04"}

Thromboembolic complications such as Deep Venous Thrombosis， Pulmonary Embolism，Stroke and Acute Coronary Syndrome were described from the beginning of the pandemic as possible manifestations of this new virus. Priapism is a medical urgency that demands quick assessment and timely treatment.\n\n【2】A case of priapism is presented in a patient undergoing hospitalization for COVID-19. He was treated with cavernosal blood aspiration， irrigated with 0.90% w/v saline solution andintracavernosal injection of the sympathomimetic agent (adrenaline)， with favorable response.\n\n【3】Keywords： Priapism， COVID-19；Thrombosis\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Since 2019， the world has been under a global health crisis because of COVID-19， affecting over160 million people to date . As we alreadyknow， the respiratory system is the most compromised. Nonetheless， manifestations at gastrointestinal， neurological， dermatological， and cardiovascular levels have also been reported. Around 5% of the patients require Intensive Care Unit management， mainly due to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Within this group of patients， 31% suffer thromboembolic complications ， with potentially fatal consequences such as： Deep Venous Thrombosis， Pulmonary Thromboembolism， Stroke and Acute Coronary Syndromes.\n\n【6】This case report presents a patient on his second day after admission because of COVID-19infection， with priapism as a urogenital pathology. This finding aims at adding diagnostic and therapeutic evidence to the few cases already reported.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 62-year-old man with history of Arterial Hypertension， Mellitus Diabetes type 2， Grade 2Obesity， and no urological history was admitted to the emergency room with febrile syndrome， headache， non-productive cough， anosmia， dysgeusia， myalgia， and generalized arthralgia. He had developed an unfavorable response， including respiratory failure. Supplemental oxygen was supplied at 10 L/min with a reservoir mask， and Intensive Care Unit management was required. COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction on a nasopharyngeal swab specimen.\n\n【9】He then experienced hemodynamic failure， with supplemental O. at 15 L/min， unstable respiratory mechanics， tachypnea and respiratory failure； therefore， orotracheal intubation and mechanical respiratory assistance were established. (FIO2 60% and PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 85) .\n\n【10】Chest-Computed Tomography (CT) and CT angiography were performed at the initial admission and showed diffuse and bilateral involvement of the pulmonary parenchyma， with some areas indicating ground-glass opacity. No signs of proximal pulmonary embolism were identified.\n\n【11】After 24 h of admission into the ICU， the patient presented a 5-h episode of priapism. A consequent increase in D-dimer was observed， among other acute phase reactants， which expressed its maximum value on the fourth day with a level of 4，885， requiring anticoagulation， enoxaparin twice daily (BID) at a dose of 40 mg . The patient was sedated and unable to answer questions on his medical record and pain levels.

Given the persistence of the erection， the lack of response to local ice， and the inability to perform exercises to reduce priapism， it was decided to continue with the stepped care.\n\n【16】Two Abbocath 18 catheters， one in each corpora cavernosa， were placed at 3 and 9 oclock and dark blood with clots appeared. Thus，4ml of this dark blood were drawn and cavernosal blood gases analysis showed a venous sample with a pattern of metabolic acidosis . This finding served for a clinical diagnostic suspicion of Ischemic， Low flow or Veno-Occlusive priapism.\n\n【17】The patient was irrigated two times with 0.90% w/v saline solution at 20-min intervals， with no satisfactory response. The next therapeutic step was an injection in each corpora cavernosa with 1ml of adrenaline (dilution of 1/100 ml w/v saline solution) at 20-min intervals， with no satisfactory response.\n\n【18】The therapeutic process was repeated. After 20 min， a decrease in the erection was confirmed. A compressive bandage and local ice were placed to avoid bruising. The patient did not repeat episodes of priapism in the following days.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】Priapism is defined as a partial or complete erection， with or without sexual stimulation that persists for more than 4 h， which can be painful. According to its pathophysiology， it can be classified into3 types：\n\n【21】Ischemic，low-flow or veno-occlusive\n\n【22】Non-ischemic，high-flow， or arterial.\n\n【23】\"Stuttering， recurring or intermittent.\n\n【24】In this case， we will focus on Ischemic priapism. Ischemic priapism presents as rigidity of the corpora cavernosa associated with a flaccid state of the glans penis. It represents >95% of the cases. It is a urological emergency that requires quick assessment and timely treatment. If the erection persists over time， the smooth muscle cells suffer necrosis， producing fibrosis of the corpora cavernosa， leading the patient to permanent erectile sexual dysfunction. The most relevant data from the clinical history of a patient with priapism include： Duration of erection， presence and severity ofpain， previous episodes of priapism and treatment provided， whether the patient is undergoing any treatment for erectile sexual dysfunction， medication or related drugs， hematological diseases (sickle cell disease， aplastic anemia， agranulocytosis， thrombocytopenia， and paraneoplastic syndromes， among others).\n\n【25】Focusing on the physiopathology of this condition， we find different metabolic alterations depending on the time of evolution. The smooth muscle cells ofthe corpora cavernosa experience hypoxia， hypercapnia，glycopenia and metabolic acidosis .\n\n【26】A histological analysis with serial biopsies of the muscle cells of the corpora cavernosa during an episode of priapism shows predominantly interstitial edema at 12 o'clock. After 24 h，destruction of the sinusoidal endothelium is mainly observed， exposing the basement membrane and revealing adhesion of platelets. After 48 h， irreversible changes appear in the cells of the corpora cavernosa with necrosis and scar tissue .\n\n【27】In the case of the patient presented， the erection was maintained for over 5 h， the presence ofpain could not be verified (because of the patient's condition) and there was no etiological factor for priapism in the clinical history.\n\n【28】The type of erection， already described above， the color of the blood and the arterial gas blood test results strongly bring us closer to the clinical suspicion of ischemic priapism. The only finding that could be considered discordant was the presence of a partial pressure of O，>30 mmHg in the gases of the corpora cavernosa. There could be a correlation between this finding and the fact that the patient was intubated with 60% FIO2 at the time.\n\n【29】It is already known that COVID-19 causes a pro-inflammatory state in patients， which also favors a pro-thrombotic state； and this is evidenced by the presence of hyperviscosity， hypercoagulability， favored by leukocytosis and endothelial dysfunction generated mainly by the release of interleukins and nitric oxide. This leads to a prothrombotic state， plus endothelial dysfunction. Some of these factors may trigger priapism.\n\n【30】Conclusion\n\n【31】The existence of the pandemic pushes health care workers of all specialties to the limit， since it demands maximal physical and mental effort. The multidisciplinary approach to this medical emergency allows us to carry out a fast and effective treatment， which， if not established in a timely manner， may lead to permanent sequela.\n\n【32】Limitations\n\n【33】Due to the limited number of published cases， evidence to confirm that COVID-19 virus is an etiological agent of priapism is not conclusive.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:40:19", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:40:43", "cost": 24.567}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:48", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:40:42", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:40:18"}

Hence， it will be ignored and misdiagnosed in the clinical activities， especially for the remote districts without well-equipped medicine. The doctors can be misled by the clinical experience. In this case， a 31-years old patient with adult-onset T1DM complicated with obesity and serious insulin resistance suffering from ketoacidosis was treated as T2DM by insulin injection based on the adult-onset， high BMI and serious insulin resistance. However， the blood glucose was beyond normal level obviously even we gave her a large amount of insulin from the continuous injection pump to short-acting combining with long-acting insulin (0.95 U/kg/d). The pre-meal glucose level fluctuated at 9 mM and the post-prandial glucose concentration waved at 15 mM. This phenomenon confused us and made us doubt the diagnosis We examined the insulin and c-peptide at fasting and 1-h postprandial points. The insulin concentrations were 185.90 uIU/mL and 133.9 uIU/mL while the c-peptide was 0.48 ng/ml and 0.65ng/ml， respectively. After， the patient completed the related antibodies examinations which showed that glutamic acid decarboxylase was over 2000.0 IU/mL. We diagnosed the patient as adult-onset T1DM with serious insulin resistance rather than LADA or T2DM. This was the first time to report adult-onset obese T1DM with serious insulin resistance. This case indicates that it is necessary to detect the autoimmune antibodies and OGTT to identify diabetes.\n\n【2】Keywords： T1DM；T2DM；Adult-onset； Insulin resistance； Obesity\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Diabetes is one of the most popular diseases around the world and increases risk of mortality for its complications . It brings the heavy economic burden to the society . It is well known that Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) are the major types of diabetes. In the past， the much higher incidence of T2DM and its serious complications， such as metabolism diseases， nerve-system disease，cardiovascular and kidney disease and so on， earn more attention . T2DM is a metabolic disease featured with insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency， while without autoimmune antibodies . It usually happens to middle and elder-ages in the past several decades and is always progressed by pre-diabetes after several years or decades. However， it has been certified that the increasing incidence of T2DM occurs among young people called youth-onset T2DM with higher mortality than elder people . Whatever in the period of pre-diabetes or diabetes stage， optimizing lifestyle by enhancing activities and improving diets intake is well recommended and the patient can reverse abnormal glucose and prevent its progressing . When it fails to hypoglycemic after three months， it is time to take oral drugs. Ultimately， the exogenous insulin is utilized to achieve the glucose target after oral hypoglycemia drugs failing or emergent situation， such as glucose toxicity .\n\n【5】T1DM is featuredwith absolutely deficient insulin for the autoimmune attack and alwayshappens to children and adolescents . However， adult-onset T1DM should be paid more attention. In detail， adult-onset T1DM is divided into classic adult-onset T1DM and Latent Autoimmune Diabetes of Adults (LADA) which can be distinguished by injecting insulin immediately or not . To be specific， LADA shows the characteristics of both T1DM and T2DM， which is called 1.5 types of diabetes in the past. Its diagnosis criteria are following： the onset age is more than 30 years； one of the autoantibodies Including Antibodies to Insulin (IAA)， Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase (IA-2)，\n\n【6】Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase (GADA) or Islet Cell Autoantibodies(ICA) are positive at least； and insulin independence maintains 6months after diagnosis . Unlikely to T2DM， most T1DM patients should inject insulin or its analogs essentially and immediately once been diagnosed .\n\n【7】Based on the accumulated evidence， the differences between T1DM and T2DM include insulin-dependence or independence， symptoms，BMI Iand autoantibodies， complicationsSsuch as microvascular disease and metabolic syndrome . However，LADA make the differences vague and a further study has demonstrated that 5% to 10% LADA patients are misdiagnosed as T2DMl . This reflects that it is not always easy to clarify T1DM and T2DM in some cases. In addition， the increasing ofT2DM among children and teenagers and serious insulin resistance happening to T1DM patients make it harder to identified T1DM from T2DM in complicated situations . Consequently， the clinical doctors should conduct thoughtful laboratory examinations and inquiry medical history， especial for young adult-onset diabetes.\n\n【8】We described a case of confused diagnosis as LADA or adult-onset T1DM with serious insulin resistance or T2DM. This case may illustrate that the young adult-onset diabetes needs more convincing evidence to be diagnosed.\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\n【10】A 31 years old lady was delivered to emergency department for main complaint of thirsty for a half month as well as omitting and fatigue one day on 2：00 am of January 18h， 2021. The history of present illness was as following： The lady felt thirsty a half month ago without any reasons， she wanted to drink and urinate more than before at the same time. She ignored those symptoms and did not receive any treatment. Then， she had the omitting and fatigues a day before and was complicated with the dyspnea and restlessness and then was delivered to emergency department. The physical detection found that her BMI was 28.4 kg/m’ and she had a full moon face with coma and rapid breath (41 times/min). Some moist rale and rough respiration had been heard in the lung. The pupils were same size in round and the diameter was about 2.5 mm. The light reflex was normal. The past history included hypothyroidism with serum Antithyroglobulin Antibody (TGAb) ranging from 22.4 IU/mL to64 IU/mL and Antithyroid Peroxidase Antibody (TPOAb) ranging from 123 IU/mL to 440.8 IU/mL and she took euthyrox according to the doctors’ guideline by monitoring thyroid hormone. She delivered her second baby by cesarean section at April 2020. During the whole pregnant period， the blood glucose levels including FBG and 2hPG and urine glucose were normal. However， the random blood glucose was 28.4 mM by glucose monitor at emergency department. The doctor diagnosed as diabetic ketoacidosis and assigned her to the ICU. After， the detailed detections were carried out. The blood routine showed that the WBC and neutrophil were 13.51 ×10/L and 11.34x10/L，respectively. The monocyte was 0.76×10/L. The percentage of lymphocyte decreased to 10.1 %. The RBC was 5.51×10/Land hemoglobin was 156.0 g/L. The platelet was 369.0×10/L. The HbA1c was 13.2%. Based on arterial blood gas analysis， PH value was 6.958； partial Pressure of Carbon Dioxide (PCO2) and concentration of HCO3- were 8.1 mmHg and 1.8 mmol/L， separately. The routine biochemistry analysis showed that serum iron K decreased to 3.16mM while serum Na increased to 154.2 mM. At the same time， the concentration of HCO3- declined to 5.2 mM. Light liver damage had been found and blood ammonia rose up to 81 umol/L. The urine routine showed that red and white cells were strong positive. Additionally， both glucose and urine ketone bodies increased remarkably. The results of CT scanning of head and abdomen were normal. There was some gas in the mediastinum by CT scanning for the falling down during the transporting. The treatment in ICU focused on decreasing blood glucose by insulin injection pump and eliminating ketoacidosis by CRRT for 39 h and transfusing large liquid. When the situation was stable， she was transferred to our department for following therapy on January 20h， 2021. During this period， the patient never felt uncomfortable， except for high blood glucose. The patient was still treated by the insulin syringe pump (3U/h to 5 U/h) and the finger glucose was detected every 2 h until to morning on January 234. After that， the glucose was monitored by before and after meals and 9 pm because of transferring to use the short-time insulin and long-time insulin. According to the glucose status， we continually adjusted insulin dose. The blood glucose levels were showed in Figure 1. It demonstrated that the glucose levels were far from normal even treating with a large amount of insulin. Finally， we adjusted the pre-meal insulin from 8 U to 12 U，14U and 14 U. The insulin at 9 pm maintained 28 U. The glucose was still out of control. This phenomenon forced us to conduct deep detection of fasting and2 h post-meal insulin and c-peptide levels. The fasting and post-meal insulin concentrations were 185.90 uIU/mL and 133.90 uIU/mL， while the fasting and post-meal c-peptide levels were 0.48 ng/mL and0.65 ng/mL. Although it was essential to examine the antibodies， it was inconvenient in the branch hospital to conduct and the patient refused to detect immediately. Finally， she decided to leave hospital even with high blood glucose on January 28h. We advised her to detect the antibodies in our headquarters and change her lifestyle to lose weight. In addition， she must adjust the dose of insulin based on finger glucose levels. After 10 days later， she went to the headquarters for her seriously high glucose level. The antibodies were identified and the concentrations of GADA and ICA were beyond 2000.0 IU/mL and 34.4 COI while IAA was normal. As a result， she obtained an improved hypo-glucose schedule： Short-time and long-time insulin combining oral drugs. The detail was that she injected 8 U short-time insulin pre-meal and 28 U long-time insulin at 9 pm. At the same time， she took Kashuangping composing of pioglitazone and metformin for 1 pill twice as well as the Invokana for 1 pill once per day. The fasting and postprandial blood glucose was approximately decreased to 5 mM and 8 mM，respectively. Based on the fluctuating glucose level， the patient persisted taking oral hypo-glucose drugs and cut down short-time insulin to 5 U and long-time insulin to 24U. During this period， the glucose level fluctuated at 5 mM and she loses weight 5 kg successfully. Besides， the patient felt well， except for constipation. After two months， the patient decided to cease the pre-meal insulin and merely take oral drugs since the blood glucose was controlled well and stably by 4 U for every pre-meal. However， the glucose went up obviously after stopping the short-time insulin for a half of month. The patient continued injecting 10U insulin before meals and the blood glucose did not decreased ideally.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Age is just a big trap for differing T1DM and T2DM. It is well-known that most of T1DM are diagnosed at childhood and teenager and more than 85% of them are below 20 years . Besides， the increasing rate of pediatric T1DM is about 3% to 5% every year . It proves that incidence of T1DM among children and adolescents are serious and make pediatric experts nervous. Nevertheless， one clinical study demonstrates that adult-onset T1DM is also popular and the authors appeal that it is time to test islet antibodies for diabetes patients as a routine item . In further， LADA， a majority of adult-onset T1DM， which is characteristic with positive pancreatic antibodies， slower beta-cell lesion and some metabolic syndromes. The similarities between LADA and T2DM mislead investigators. A data shows that 2% to 12% of diagnosed T2DM belong to LADA . Concurrently， numerous evidences demonstrate that T2DM is more and more prevalent at childhood and adolescent . A large data analysis proves that the morbidity of young T2DM goes up 4.4 folds from 2002 to 2016 in Korea . Compared with adult-onset T2DM， T2DM in children and adolescents is more aggressive with rapid beta-cell deterioration， serious complicated diseases. Also， it is hard to distinguish from T1DM . Another study shows that there is an overlap between T1DM and T2DM and suggests that the diagnosed T2DM should be detected related antibodies and a new subtype of diabetes may be identified . In conclusion， it is not easy to apart T1DM from T2DM by age which is a weak principle for diagnosis.\n\n【13】Obesity and insulin resistance are prevalent complications for the T1DM. In the past， T1DM patients is lean and sensitive to insulin. In this case， we considered the patient as the T2DM at first depending on adult-onset age， high BMI and serious insulin resistance. However， the blood glucose did not decrease well； even we had up-regulated insulin injection to 0.95 U/kg/d. The outcomes astonished us for the extraordinary insulin and little c-peptide. The extensive exogenous insulin injection contributed to the outstanding serum insulin concentration. The poor c-peptide reflected actual terrible secretion function of pancreatic beta cell. Those meant that the patient suffered serious pancreas impairment and remarkable insulin resistance. It was weird for the new diagnosed“T2DM”since nearly entire loss of beta cell and woeful insulin resistance. In fact， obesity and insulin resistance are not any more the features for T2DM based on the existed evidence. A comprehensive analysis shows that the ratio of overweight and obesity increase 20.1% and 9.5% in children and adolescent T1DM， respectively. Besides， the metabolic syndrome grows up from 3.2% to 29.9%. Multiple researches illustrate that the incidence of overweight or obese T1DM ranges from 12.8% to20.2% in different countries and districts and there is a growing up trend in recent decades . A large scale of clinical study proves that adult-onset T1DM is 5.49% in 17，349 newly diabetes and LADA contribute 65%.Additionally， the ratio of overweight or obese T1DM is 5.84% and LADA patients account for 79.2% . In summary， obesity and insulin resistance are popular complications in both T1DM and T2DM.\n\n【14】Autoimmune diseases may be a great clue for T1DM diagnosis. T1DM has a close relationship with other Autoimmune Diseases(AID)， such as thyroid disease， rheumatoid arthritis， collagen vascular diseases， and autoimmune enteropathy (Crohn’s and Ulcerative Colitis) . There is an evidence illustrates that the additional autoimmune disease has been verified in 33% of new T1DM. It is relatively high rate and reminders us to detect other antibodies essentially . What’s more， the risk for additional AID for late-onset T1DM over 30 years is much higher than that of children and adolescent onset and it also reveals that the female prefers to have AID compared with the male . Moreover， Autoimmune Thyroid Disease (ATD)has higher incidence in patient with T1DM andLADA is an independent risk for it. A clinical study shows that 23% children and/or adolescent T1DM patients have been diagnosed as ATD . Another clinical investigation also proves that the patient with T1DM is susceptible to ATD which may attribute to susceptible genes . In this case， the young lady had been diagnosed as hypothyroidism with TPOAb positive. It is an important clue for T1DM diagnosis. In clinical practice， the physician should ask the history carefully and find hints.\n\n【15】Diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) would be more difficult than before for the changes of characteristics (age and complications) and it is time to combine insulin and oral hypo-glucose drugs to reverse uncontrollable glucose， regardless of whatever types of DM. Accumulating data show that the patient with T1DM have the features of T2DM which is called double diabetes， such as insulin resistance， metabolic disease . It also means that those people have higher risk for suffering from serious complications including kidney disease， cardiovascular lesions. Meanwhile， the change of onset age makes it hard to distinguish them by age. Regarding to the treatment， it is important to combine insulin and oral drugs to decrease glucoselevel. In this report， we just gave her insulin injection at first for protecting the pancreatic beta-cell function based on the recent studies . However， the high level of glucose was never be reversed due to extremely severe insulin resistance. After giving her insulin and oral drugs at the same time， the glucose can be controlled and maintained in target. In summary， considerate therapy schedule should be made based on the right diagnosis and insulin combing with oral drugs is the optimal choice for T1DM with insulin resistance.\n\n【16】Conclusion characteristics for T1DM. It is essential for every newly diagnosed patient to carry out OGTT and detect glucose， c-peptide and insulin levels in different time points， especially for young people. At the same time， autoimmune antibodies should be taken into consideration. Those measures will help doctors to diagnose correctly and make right treatment plan to assure patient to obtain effective medicine as soon as possible.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:07:42", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:08:04", "cost": 21.616}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:48", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:08:04", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:07:42"}

Among available exercise-testing protocols， constant work-rate exercise test， as cycle endurance test， is considered sensitive for detecting change in exercise capacity following intervention (both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic) . As previously demonstrated， 1 month LUM/IVA therapy did not increase exercise endurance or modify dyspnea or leg discomfort  and no data are available about the longer-term effects of such modulator therapy on exercise endurance and exertional symnptoms.\n\n【8】For this purpose， in this preliminary study， we used Constant Work-Rate Cycle Ergometry(CWRCE) to evaluate the efficacy of LUM/IVA (400 mg/250 mg administered orally every 12 h) in CF adults that initiated LUM/IVA as part of clinical care. Specifically， we examined the potential impact of LUM/IVA therapy on Exercise Endurance Time (EET) and exertional symptoms during CWRCE after 6 months of treatment.\n\n【9】Methods\n\n【10】In this prospective， observational， multicenter study， we recruited 5 stable adult CF patients (z18 years old， homozygous for Phe508del) who were about to initiate LUM/IVA in the study period limiting factor. V'E/V'CO2 slope and PETCO2 were weakly reduced. There was an increase in EET (416 sec vs. 635 sec) and an improvement in inspiratory capacity prior to exercise of 350 mL，+16% . The improvements in inspiratory capacity were sustained during exercise and end-exercise (540 mL， 23%). There was a reduction in breathing and leg discomfort as indicated by reductions in both the slope and intensity of breathing and leg discomfort .

The study was stopped in March 2020for the ongoing pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Patients were excluded if they had unstable medical conditions that could cause or contribute to breathlessness (i.e. cardiovascular， metabolic， or other respiratory diseases) or other disorders that could interfere with exercise testing， such as neuromuscular diseases or musculoskeletal problems. The study was approved by the ethics committee of Policlinico Umberto I Hospital， Sapienza University of Rome， Italy with the number 853/18 followed by the approval of the otherlocalethical committees. Allpatients provided written informed consent for this study. We used a protocol consisting of 2 visits： 3 to 4weeks prior to initiation ofLUM/IVA (visit1)and 6 months after (visit2). During each visit， in the morning patients performed spirometry and symptom-limited incremental Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test(CPET) on cycle ergometry to determine peak work rate (defined as the highest work rate maintained for >30 s). In the afternoon， all subsequent symptom-limited CWRCE tests were conducted at 80%of peak work rate. Inspiratory capacity and intensity of breathing discomfort and leg discomfort (Borg scale ) were measured prior to exercise， every 2 min during exercise and at the point of symptom limitation (end-exercise). Minute Ventilation (V'E) and Oxygen Uptake (V'02) were measured through calibrated metabolic system(Cosmed K5). Oxygen saturation， heart rate and blood pressure were also registered at baseline， at peak of the exercise and throughout. After completing each exercise test， patients identified the primary reason for stopping (due to leg and/or breathing discomfort or other reason). HRQoL was assessed by the adult version of the revised Italian CFQ-R questionnaire. Finally， at the end of the visit， patients wore a multi-sensor armband (SenseWear Pro3 Armband (SWA)， BodyMedia， Pittsburgh， USA) to assess daily habitual Physical Activity (PA) over seven consecutive days. The characteristics and the validation of the device in CF have been previously described . Patients were asked to continue any respiratory-related medications before the visits. Assessment was conducted at the same place and time of day for all subjects. The numbers of pulmonary exacerbations were prospectively collected through 6 months. Two of 5 participants were excluded from the analysis because the 6-months follow-up visit was prevented due to a strict lockdown during the COVID-19pandemic in Italy. For each patient we calculated the percentage of change between \"pre\" and \"post\" the start of LUM/IVA therapy for each variable.\n\n【14】Results\n\n【15】Patient 1 is a 28-year-old man of Caucasian origin diagnosed with CF at the birth. He has been colonized with Staphylococcus aureus and Aspergillus furigatus. He commenced LUM/IVA in May 2019. During six months of treatment， he presented with one pulmonary exacerbation treated with oral antibiotics. The change from baseline in BMI was +4%and ppFEV1 was +3%. He reached his peak exercise at a higher oxygen uptake (+3%) . Patient showed an improvement in oxygen pulse (V'02/HR) by +15%， slightly higher values of ventilation (V'Epeak)， mean maximal ventilation less than the predicted MVV (208 L) and lower Breathing Reserve (BR) were observed. Ventilatory efficiency (V'E/V'CO2 slope) and partial Pressure of End-Tidal CO2 (PETCO2) were weakly reduced. After six months oftreatment， there was an increase in EET (344 sec vs. 644 sec) and an improvement in inspiratory capacity prior to exercise of 520 mL， +17% . The improvements in inspiratory capacity were sustained during exercise and end-exercise (160 mL，+4%).

He has been infected with Staphylococcus aureus， Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Mycobacteriumabscessus. He commenced LUM/IVA in June 2019. During the 6 months， the patient had one pulmonary exacerbation requiring IV antibiotic therapy. The change from baseline in BMI was -0.9% and ppFEV1was -9%. He reached peak exercise at a lower oxygen uptake (-17%)， supplementary file Table 1. The patient showed an important reduction in V'02/HR by-29%. He showed lower values of V'Epeak and lower BR， with maximal ventilation less than the predicted MVV (107L).VE/V'CO2 slope was weakly improved. There was an increase in EET (371 sec vs. 460 sec). Although the patient showed dynamichyperinflation both before and after treatment (ICA pre -0.37 L， post -0.3 L)， there was an improvement in inspiratory capacity prior to exercise of 180 mL +6% and at end-exercise 250mL +10% . There was a reduction in breathing and leg discomfort as indicated by reductions in both the slope and intensity of breathing and leg discomfort . Duration of daily PA and number of steps decreased after treatment (-56% and-64%， respectively). His CFQ-R revealed higher scores indicating a higher patient-reported quality of life with regard to “health perception”+16%，“body image”+28%.\n\n【18】Discussion\n\n【19】In this preliminary study， we observed the long-term effects of LUM/IVA on exercise capacity. Results from these three CF patients demonstrate longer EET after six months of LUM/IVA. Improvements in exercise endurance were accompanied by improvements in inspiratory capacity prior to exercise and additional serial assessment ofinspiratory capacity during exercise demonstrated that these improvements were maintained at end-exercise. All three patients experienced less dyspnea and less leg discomfort， showing exercise limitation often related to peripheral muscle fatigue and not related to ventilatory constraints. Finally， we observed in two patients improvements in oxygen uptake values obtained during incremental CPET that is an important result as V'02 peak is an excellent general predictor of survival in CF .\n\n【20】Design a study with Constant Work-Rate Exercise Test(CWRET)tLIM to assess the efficacy of interventions is considered to be sensitive and clinically relevant . CWRCE is now often used in efficacy evaluations oflong-acting bronchodilators because it allows a thorough evaluation of the physiological response during exercise and due to its documented responsiveness to treatment . Improving dyspnea and exercise tolerance are recognized as important goals in the treatment of CF， with the measurement of exercise endurance also considered a valuable component of CF assessment， particularly in response to treatment interventions with new drugs as modulators.\n\n【21】In this study there is evidence that LUM/IVA can increase inspiratory capacity， reduce exertional breathlessness and improve EET in patients with CF. We have provided insights into the mechanistic factors responsible for reductions in exertional breathlessness and improvements in symptom-limited exercise endurance in CF followingLUM/IVAtreatment. Theseimprovements include sustained lung volume reduction as a result of improved tidal expiratory flow rates and lung emptying， with reduced resting and exercise lung hyperinflation as observed in patient 3 and a delay in the mechanical limitation to ventilation. Consequently， exertional dyspnea is alleviated， leading to increases in exercise endurance time. In addition to changes in dyspnea， our patients who had an increase in endurance time also experienced less leg discomfort. Although we recognize that both peripheral muscle dysfunction and deconditioning could be related to exercise limitation in CF， in this study we evaluate daily PA but not muscle function. When we observed PA measurements pre- and post-treatment， only one patient increased the number of steps during his daily life. Further larger studies are likely required in CF to observe effects of such therapy in PA.\n\n【22】The present study has important limitations. Firstly， recruitment was less than calculated due to ongoing pandemic of COVID-19. Secondly，only three of five enrolled patients were able to complete the six months follow-up due to nationwidelockdown. We recognize this is a case series with no control arm， so only interesting observations can be made.\n\n【23】Constant work-rate exercise test， as cycle endurance test， should be considered in clinical trials when assessing change in exercise capacity following longer-term therapy with modulators.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:13:33", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:13:56", "cost": 22.627}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:48", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:13:55", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:13:33"}

The incidence of perineal hernia is estimated to be up to 7% following APR . The most common symptoms of a perineal hernia include perineal bulging and discomfort with activity secondary to an increase in intra-abdominal pressure. However， the complications include urinary retention/incontinence，bowel obstruction，perineal tissue erosion and trauma to herniated viscera. Most perineal hernias remain asymptomatic. For patients presenting with perineal discomfort and urinary pathology following APR， a careful history and physical examination should be undertaken and treatment offered if one is present. Treatment of perineal hernias is mostly surgical， using a transabdominal，trans-perineal or laparoscopic approach . Here， we report a case of a perineal hernia repaired using a transabdominal approach with mesh and a trans-perineal repair using a gluteal myocutaneous flap.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】A 72-year-old woman with a history of rectal cancer underwent neoadjuvant chemo-radiation followed by laparoscopic APR and adjuvant chemotherapy for a T3N0M0 rectal cancer in 2012. Initial surgery was successful with no known complications. Pathology showed invasive well-differentiated adenocarcinoma with negative margins. The patient underwent a follow-up screening colonoscopy in 2014 that was normal， and her colostomy was also noted to be healthy， with good output and showed no signs of parastomal hernia. Four years later， the patient complained of a large bulge in her perineal incision and discomfort with walking. This became progressively larger over a period of several months that it was as if she carried a baby in her perineum. She was evaluated and an ultrasound was done， which showed multiple loops of small bowel. An abdominopelvic CT scan was obtained to further characterize the bulge and for further evaluation. The CT scan revealed a large perineal hernia containing multiple loops of small bowel. She was then referred to our institution for further evaluation and management. On examination at our facility， the patient was noticed to have a large apparent perineal bulge， as well as some minimal discomfort on palpation. Given her previous surgical history for rectal cancer and her symptomatic presentation， the patient was scheduled for repair of her perineal hernia. Plastic surgery was initially consulted to help with the closure of her gluteal incision following her perineal hernia repair. The pathology was discussed with the patient， and informed consent was obtained for a transabdominal perineal hernia repair with mesh and a trans-perineal wound repair using a gluteal myocutaneous flap.\n\n【4】Operative Technique\n\n【5】The patient was placed in the modified lithotomy position in Yellofin stirrups. She received preoperative Heparin subcutaneously for DVT prophylaxis. The colostomy was closed with 2-0 Silk suture. The abdomen and perianal areas were prepped and draped in standard fashion. A lower midline incision was made and an Alex is wound retractor was placed. Adhesiolysis was then done and the small bowel was freed up from the pelvis and retracted cephalad. The defect in the pelvic floor was then evaluated. There was essentially skin covering the herniated small bowel. Next， a biologic mesh (StratticeMRTM) was sized and placed to cover the perineal defect. The mesh was secured in place using 0-Prolene sutures in interrupted fashion. Next， attention was turned to the perineal portion of the procedure. The skin overlying the hernia was thinned out and effaced.\n\n【6】The central portion was resected. Next， gluteal myocutaneous flaps were raised on both sides in a double-house configuration. The flaps were then advanced towards the midline and sutured in place in multiple layers using 2-0 Vicryl sutures. The skin was closed with4-0 Monocryl subcuticular stitches and Dermabond was applied. The fascia of the abdominal incision was closed in standard fashion as per the surgeon's routine practice. The patient tolerated the procedure well without immediate complications.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Until recently， perineal hernias were considered to be a rare complication following abdominoperineal resection  with prevalence rates of 0.6% to 7% . Perineal hernias have become a known and recognized complication following APR in low-lying rectal cancers. The increased prevalence of these hernias after surgical resection of rectal cancers has been associated with the widespread endorsement of new surgical techniques including Total Mesorectal Excision (TME) and the more recent Extralevator Abdominoperineal Excision (eLAPE)， which has been associated with decreased circumferential resection margin involvement and intra-operative perforation . The excision of the entire pelvic floor muscle complex supporting the distal rectum as is done in eLAPE procedure creates a wider defect in the pelvic floor， leading to an increased incidence of perineal hernias in this group of patients. Recent rates of perineal hernia occurrences following a laparoscopic eLAPE have been reported to be between 26% to 45% . Perineal hernias therefore remain a common problem following surgical treatment of low-lying rectal cancers. The repair of these perineal hernias has been discussed in the literature. Indications for repair include pain， urinary dysfunction， bowel obstruction， strangulation or other patient-specific complaints that cause inability to perform their activities of daily living， resulting in a poor quality of life. Surgical approaches to perineal hernia repair include the laparoscopic， transabdominal， trans-perineal or combined approach with primary repair； mesh(synthetic vs. biologic) repair and the use of myocutaneous flaps. A pooled analysis of perineal hernia repair after abdominoperineal resection found that the use of a mesh confers a lower recurrence rate compared to primary suture repair .However， a recent systematic review of biologic mesh reconstruction following APRs found that although a promising technique， there is not enough evidence to support the use of biologic mesh given the low volume and quality of available data as well as the lack of any comparative studies .\n\n【9】The use of primary perinealwound closure aswell as myocutaneous flaps has also been reported， especially in patients with a prior history of irradiation to the pelvis. However， a recent systematic review with meta-analysis revealed that primary closure was more than twice as likely to be associated with major and total perineal wound complications compared with flap closure， thereby validating the use of myocutaneous flaps for reducing perineal morbidity following APRs . Most common flaps used after APR include the Rectus Abdominis Muscle (VRAM，TRAM) flap ， gracilis myocutaneous flaps  with the use ofVRAM flaps being more common than gracilis flaps. To our knowledge， this is the 3rd report of perineal hernia repair using a gluteal myocutaneous flap and the first to report the use of a trans-perineal biologic mesh repair with concomitant gluteal myocutaneous flap for reconstruction of perineal defect after APR. The two other reports using a gluteal muscle flap were both performed outside of the United States (Sweden and Singapore) and reported successful repair with lower risk of perineal wound complications， although one study utilized both a gluteal muscle flap as well as a buttock fasciocutaneous rotation flap for reconstruction.\n\n【10】The patient presented in this case report tolerated the procedure well. Operative time was about 140 minutes and the patient developed some mild urinary incontinence post-operatively which was managed conservatively. The patient was seen in follow-up in clinic at 2 and again after 3 months. The patient has continued to do well with no evidence of recurrence or other perineal complications.\n\n【11】At most surgery centers， the reconstructive portion of this operation is donebyplastic surgeons. It is our beliefthat myocutaneous flap reconstruction for perineal hernias can be performed by an experienced colorectal surgeon with the appropriate skill and training in reconstruction. For more complicated cases in which the perineal defect may be extremely large or for patients with previous perineal surgery， it may be important to have a plastic surgeon experienced in reconstruction on hand， should complications arise.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 15:02:22", "endTime": "2024/09/20 15:02:29", "cost": 7.048}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:48", "update_time": "2024-09-19 23:02:29", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 23:02:21"}

It is characterized by a rapid onset of interdental gingival necrosis， gingival bleeding and gingival pain. Other systemic factors such as malaise， fever and lymphadenopathy can also be found. The establishment of a rapid diagnosis is very important in order to avoid complications. The treatment of NUG is organized in successive steps and predisposing factors should be taken into account in order to obtain stable outcomes. The present case report describes the diagnosis approach and the treatment of NUG in a 21-year-old female patient.\n\n【2】Keywords： Necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis； Necrotizing periodontal diseases； Diagnosis； Treatment\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Necrotizing Ulcerative Gingivitis (NUG) is a severe form of acute inflammatory periodontal diseases. It is characterized by the necrosis of the interdental gingiva， gingival bleeding and gingival pain . Since this disease is found especially in military personnel， the true prevalence ofthe NUG is unknown because most of the studies are based on military recruits and are not representative of the general population . NUG is defined by some clinical symptoms such as edematous， hemorrhagic and inflamed dental papilla. This papilla is usually covered by a white layer with an ulcerated gingival margin surrounded by an erythematous halo. The lesion is limited to the gingival tissue and does not generate any periodontal attachment loss . Halitosis can be detected in the majority of patients， and some systemic symptoms like fever，lymphadenopathy and malaise can also be found. In 1999， the international workshop for the classification ofperiodontal diseases and conditions proposed a new category of periodontal diseases： Necrotizing periodontal diseases that included both necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis and necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis . According to the new classification of the last world workshop AAP/EFP 2017， necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis has been replaced by the term of necrotizing gingivitis. Also based on the location， necrotizing periodontal diseases have been subdivided into necrotizing gingivitis， necrotizing periodontitis and necrotizing stomatitis . The aim of this paper is to report the management of a case of a 21-year-old female patient diagnosed with NUG associated to stress.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 21-year-old female patient was referred to the periodontics department at the University of Hassan II of Casablanca， Morocco. Her main chief of complaint was gingival pain in the lower incisor’s region and also gingival bleeding during tooth brushing.\n\n【7】Clinical examination revealed evident halitosis， necrosis and ulceration of the interdental papilla’s covered by a pseudomembrane. The papilla was absent in some sites and generalized accumulation of oral biofilm was observed on dental surfaces. Large calculus deposits were detected on the right upper posterior teeth. It was due to her unilateral chewing habits . During the physical examination， we reported the presence of lymphadenopathy even if no systemic condition that could predispose the patient to NUG was found. However， we reported a psychological stress probably due to her studies. X-rays examination showed no interproximal bone loss . Laboratory HIV test was done with the patient's consent and the result was negative. Based on the clinical data obtained at the examination， NUG was diagnosed. The treatment was taken urgently：Application of chlorhexidine gluconate 0.12% using sterile swabs， associated with ultrasonic supra-gingival debridement. An oral administration of antibiotic (500 mg of metronidazole 3 times a day during 7 days)， chlorhexidine gluconate 0.12%+ Chlorhydrate Cetylpyridinium Chloride mouth rinse (twice a day for 15 days) were performed. A motivational approach to changing the patient’s oral hygiene habits was emphasized by the clinical team. Three days after， an ultrasonic sub-gingival debridement was performed to disorganize sub-gingival biofilm and to remove sub- gingival calculus. With regular and effective maintenance of oral hygiene habits by the patient， the inflammatory clinical condition was reversed and periodontalhealth was observed within a few weeks.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Necrotizing Ulcerative Gingivitis (NUG) involves only gingival tissue without periodontal attachment loss. This infectious disease is conditioned by several predisposing factors that compromise the host immune response . Many factors can contribute to NUG， such as psychological stress， poor diet， insufficiency sleep， alcohol， tobacco， poor oral hygiene， pre-existing gingivitis， and HIV infection. These factors seem to affect the host immune response and enhance the bacterial pathogenesis. Psychological stress can be responsible of the reduction of gingival microcirculation and also the salivary flow. It increases also adrenocortical secretions and modifies the function of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and lymphocytes. Hence， it can alter the immune response ， and increase the susceptibility to infections and bacterial proliferation . In the present case， the patient was suffering from stress caused by her studies. This factor is an important parameter that predispose to NUG.\n\n【10】The diagnosis of NUG is made clinically according to the presence ortheabsence of 3 important clinical symptoms that are interproximal necrosis often described by 《punched out》 ulcerated papillae，gingival bleeding and gingival pain . These clinical signs were all detected in the present case. Systemic signs as lymphadenopathy， fever and malaise have also been reported to occur in NUG . In the present case， fetid breath andlymphadenopathy were also detected at clinical examination.\n\n【11】Concerning the histological aspect， the observation ofthe gingival tissue with light microscopy shows the presence of an ulcer within the stratified squamous epithelium and the superficiallayer of the gingival connective tissue， surrounded by a nonspecific acute inflammatory reaction. In a classic electron microscopic investigation， four zones associated with the gingival lesion of NUG were identified ： A superficial bacterial area；  a neutrophil-rich zone；  a necrotic zone and  spirochetal infiltration zone. Additional findings included plasma cells in the deeper parts and IgG and complement factor C3 between epithelial cells. These observations have been confirmed by electron microscopy， adding areas of transition to a chronic stage of inflammation .\n\n【12】The microbiota composition associated with NUG includes Treponema sp.， P melaninogenicus sp. Intermedius， Fusobacterium sp.， Selemonas sp. and A. odontolyticus. The findings of Loesche in1982 confirm that these microorganisms are contributors to the pathogenesis of this disease . According to the last EFP/AAP workshop ， other bacterial types were also described in the NUG microbiota. The authors reported a microbiota containing 4 bacterial species that are P. intermedia， Treponema， Selenomonas and Fusobacteriur.\n\n【13】The diagnosis of NUG may be confused with primary herpetic gingivostomatitis， desquamative gingivitis， agranulocytosis， leukemia and ascorbic acid deficiency associated gingivitis .\n\n【14】The treatment of NUG should be approached in successive stages. This treatment includes the management of the acute phase， treatment of any pre-existing condition， treatment of abnormalities following the disease， and transition to supportive periodontal therapy phase. The first phase aims to control patient’s discomfort and to stop tissue destruction. This involves ultrasonic debridement of superficial gingival plaques and calculus along with oxygen therapyThe use of 0.12% Chlorhexidine Gluconate mouth rinse can be recommended twice a day for 15 to 30 days . Patients with severe or moderate NUG and local lymphadenopathy or other systemic symptoms are placed on antibiotic regimen of Penicillin (500 mg every 6 h)  and 250 mg of Metronidazole every 8 h for 7 days). Metronidazole is the appropriate choice of drugs because it is active against anaerobic bacteria's . Antibiotics should be continued until systemic complication subside .\n\n【15】Predisposing factors should be evaluated and also treated. Patient education is very important in order to maintain a good oral health.

On the other hand， penetrating facial injuries can be quite chalenging， as they may compromise airway integrity or， in rare cases， lead to life threatening massive bleeding if not controlled.\n\n【2】To our knowledge there are no guidelines or recommendations on how to approach such challenging situations.\n\n【3】In this case we present a patient with an initially stable deep facial injury that suddenly deteriorated requiring massive transfusion resuscitation and operative intervention. The situation was complicated by the presence of a Foreign Body (FB)， which limited the amount of pressure that could be applied.\n\n【4】Given the above， we reviewed the available literature on massive traumatic facial bleeding for possible alternative approaches to such a situation. Our findings can be summarized in a stepwise approach as follows： pressure， nasal packing， surgical ligation， and selective embolization of the external carotid artery or its branches.\n\n【5】Keywords： Penetrating facial trauma； Bleeding facial laceration； Massive bleeding； Novel oral anticoagulant\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】The incidence of life threatening facial haemorrhage， according to most studies， is reported to be approximately 1%. It is defined in the ATLS as a facial hemorrhage with a heart rate >100 bpm or systolic blood pressure<100 mmHg requiring resuscitation and blood transfusion.\n\n【8】Given the rich vascular supply of the face， it is usually challenging to identify the source of haemorrhage with exploration. The approach in most emergency situations is to protect the airway if its integrity is threatened， followed by direct pressure and hemostatic control sutures of bleeding vessels if identified. Depending on the site of injury， nasal packing may contribute to the initial management.\n\n【9】Given the absence of clear guidelines or recommendations， it was essential to review the literature and treatment options for such situations in order to effectively mobilize resources as early as possible.\n\n【10】At 10 pm on October 64 2015， a 73 year old man was transferred from another hospital to our trauma center due to a mechanical fall from his own height onto a broken plate 3 h earlier， resulting in a complex facial laceration. Initially， and on presentation to our institution the laceration was not activelybleeding， and the patient was hemodynamically stable. The patient had a past medical history of atrial fibrillation， treated on Rivaroxaban and Aspirin， as well as multiple other comorbidities. On examination， there was an isolated laceration of approximately 9 cm in length overlying the medial orbital wall and extending into the lacrimal duct system. His CT head was negative but his CT face revealed a 1.9 cm x0.9 cm radiopaque Foreign Body (FB) on the medial aspect of the left ocular globe， 3.3 cm deep from the skin， as well as a fracture of the left medial orbital wall. The left ocular globe appeared intact both clinically and radiologically. The patient was kept in the monitored care area of the emergency department for evaluation by oral and maxillofacial surgery and ophthalmology.\n\n【11】Approximately 3 h after presentation， the laceration began bleeding profusely， causing a drop in his systolic blood pressure from 138 mmHg to 60 mmHg. The patient was transferred to the resuscitation room and the massive transfusion protocol was initiated. He received a total of 2 units of PRBC， 5 units of platelets and 4 units of fresh frozen plasma， as well as intravenous tranexamic acid. Bilateral Foley catheters were placed as posterior nasal packing， followed by anterior nasal packing and the patient was taken to the Operating Room (OR). In the OR， awake intubation was performed with a GlideScope. The patient received an additional 3 units of PRBC and 2 units of fresh frozen plasma.\n\n【12】The FB was removed by the oral and maxillofacial team and under the observation of the ophthalmology team. Hemostasis was then achieved with bipolar cautery and vessel clips， and the laceration was repaired in 2 layers. Exploration of the canalicular system was deferred to a later time. The patient was then taken to the ICU where he spent 5 uneventful days； he remained intubated for the first few days and then was discharged to the surgical ward and was back to his baseline status. He remained on the ward for a total of 17 days where he had a recovery complicated by gastrointestinal bleed， pneumonia and gout flare-up. He was then discharged home without patient follow-ups.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】This was a case of an isolated complex facial laceration that was initially not actively bleeding but deteriorated suddenly .\n\n【15】Given the sharp FB， that was discovered on imaging， it made the initial step of hemorrhage control by direct pressure somewhat contraindicated， especially since， the FB was relatively large and located proximal and medial to the ocular globe . Bulk compression dressing was mentioned as an effective method for stabilization in complex gunshot facial wounds after securing the airway ， but given the FB location in our case， it was not a viable option.\n\n【16】A multicenter prospective review on maxillofacial hemorrhage concluded that the best management approach for penetrating facial injuries is to use a surgical approach in the OR both for airway control and hemostasis， while blunt injuries could benefit more by transarterial embolization .\n\n【17】As with other major trauma cases requiring massive transfusions for resuscitation， the use of Thromboelastometry (TEM) for resuscitation guidance has also been reported useful in cases of massive facial bleeding ， but this technology is still unavailable in most centers.\n\n【18】A literature review on life threatening facial hemorrhage was conducted and although the evidence was based mainly on case reports， it concluded that a stepwise approach was important，starting with the basic conservative measures (pressure， nasal packing)， followed by local surgical ligation and if unsuccessful Transarterial Embolization (TAE) .\n\n【19】Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?\n\n【20】The awareness of all possible options for controlling life threatening complex facial hemorrhage should result in early resource mobilization， especially that with the advances of technology， angiographyand embolization can be done in the OR in many centers.\n\n【21】Conclusion\n\n【22】A stepwise approach is followed when confronted with a complex massive facial hemorrhage， starting with the ABC’s of trauma evaluation and resuscitation， followed by applying direct pressure， nasal packing (anterior and posterior)，and surgical intervention with possible TEA. Finally， organizing an early transfer of the patient to a trauma center with mobilization of the above services is strongly recommended.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:12:08", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:12:26", "cost": 17.086}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:48", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:12:25", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:12:08"}

The peripheral nervous system may be involved in MGUS， causing a monoclonal gammopathy associated peripheral neuropathy. However， involvement of the Central Nervous System (CNS) in MGUS was rarely reported. Here we report a rare case of recurrent optic neuritis， as the first clinical presentation of MGUS， in an otherwise healthy male patient. He was treated with intravenous high-dose methylprednisolone for acute attacks and Rituximab as maintenance therapy. The patient’s vision was recovered， and he did not experience any other attack in one year of follow-up.\n\n【2】Keywords： MGUS； Optic neuritis； Rituximab\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance(MGUS)， which can be asymptomatic， is a premalignant proliferative disorder of plasma cells. It is defined by the presence of serum monoclonal immunoglobulin <3 g/dL， plasma cells in the bone marrow <10%，and absence of end-organ damage. There are three distinct types of MGUS based on the involved immunoglobulin：Non-IgM，IgM，and light-chain， each with a risk of progression to a malignant plasma cell dyscrasia or lymphoproliferative disorder. It is not rare for MGUS to be an incidental finding， but it can be correlated with shorter life expectancy even in the absence of malignancy .\n\n【5】Previous studies showed some associations between MGUS and increased fracture risk， renal impairment， secondary immunodeficiency， infections， thromboembolism， and cardiovascular diseases. The peripheral nervous system may be involved in MGUS， causing a monoclonal gammopathy associated peripheral neuropathy . However， involvement of the Central Nervous System (CNS) in MGUS was rarely reported. Here we report a rare case of recurrent optic neuritis， as the first clinical presentation of MGUS， in an otherwise healthy male patient.\n\n【6】A 54-year-old man was presented to the neurology clinic with a headache and Blurred vision in his left eye. The patient’s symptoms had begun following psychological stress. Headache was generalized and oppressive in nature and blurred vision was progressive and accompanied by eye pain. The patient underwent LASIK Eye Surgery four months ago due to hyperopia. He recovered from surgery and had normal visual acuity(10/10). He did not mention any other medical or surgical history. In fundoscopy papilledema was evident. Other neurological examinations were normal.\n\n【7】Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain and cervical spine and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans were normal. Increased latency of Visual-Evoked Potentials (VEPs) was found after stimulation of the left eye. All performed blood investigations and vasculitis panels were normal. Cell-based antibody assays for anti-Aquaporin-4 Antibody (AQP4-Ab) and antibody against Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein (anti-MOG-Ab) were also reported negative. The patient underwent a diagnostic lumbar puncture which determined a normal opening pressure of Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF). CSF examination showed albumin 28.2 mg/dl (normal values <30mg/dl)， IgG index 1.43 (normal values <0.65)， no pleocytosis and no elevated protein level. The oligoclonal band assay detected no heterologous band in CSF.\n\n【8】The patient was diagnosed with left optic neuritis and treated with three days of intravenous high-dose methylprednisolone(1000 mg daily). We performed serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation for further investigation. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed a peak in the gamma-globulin region. Serum Fractions levels were as follows： Albumin 4.8 g/dl (4 g/dl to 4.8 g/dl)， Alpha-1 0.2 g/dl (0.2 g/dl to 0.4g/dl)，Alpha-2 0.6g/dl (0.5 g/dl to 0.9g/dl)， Beta-1 0.4 g/dl (0.3 g/dl to 0.5 g/dl)， Beta-2 0.3 g/dl (0.2 g/dl to0.5 g/dl)， Gamma 1.6 g/dl (0.8 g/dl to 1.4 g/dl). In immunofixation， the Gamma-globulin band was highlighted in Kappa and IgG region that is compatible with monoclonal Kappa IgG. A Bone Marrow Aspiration (BMA) and Biopsy (BMB) showed the presence of normocellular marrow with trilineage hematopoiesis and 6% to7% polyclonal plasma cells. IHC staining showed CD138， Kappa， Lambda， and Pax5 positive. BMA immunophenotyping revealed a population in monocytes gates which express CD138，CD38，negative CD19， CD45 (Myeloma cell) about 1% to 1.5% of all nucleated cells. There was no increase in myeloblast and B-lymphoblast. There was no clinical manifestation associated with plasma cell myeloma such as lytic bone lesions， and the amount of monoclonal component was <3 g/dl. According to these results， he was diagnosed with optic neuritis with MGUS. The patient's vision improved after high-dose methylprednisolone therapy. Rituximab was started as maintenance therapy at a dosage of two intravenous infusions (2 weeks apart) of1，000 mg. Within one week of Rituximab induction， the patient had another optic neuritis attack in the opposite eye. Intravenous high-dose methylprednisolone therapy was repeated for acute attack and then Rituximab has been continued every six months upon results of CD19 flow-cytometry. After 12 months of starting rituximab， the patient had no new symptoms.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】The neurologic complications of MGUS have been reported rarely. Subclinical optic neuropathies with increased latencies of Visual Evoked Potentials (VEPs) were reported in MGUS patients with monoclonal anti-MAG M-protein antibodies ， MAG is a component of both central and Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) myelin. Hence， both CNS and PNS involvement in MGUS may be induced by monoclonal antibodies against anti-MAG M proteins. On the other hand， brain imaging abnormalities were also reported in some patients with MGUS associated Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP).\n\n【11】The CNS involvement of MGUSin form ofa chronic disseminated demyelinating disorder was previously described. Monoclonal IgM/A gammopathy， with anti-myelin and anti-nuclear reactivity ， and IgG/ monoclonal gammopathy  were reported in patients with MGUS and MS.Earlier reports showed that some MGUS patients with CNS involvement fulfill the latest diagnostic criteria of MS ， Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM) ， or Neuromyelitis Optical . Other studies have reported MGUS patients with CNS disorders such as cerebellar atrophy ， Parkinson's disease ， and multiple system atrophy . However， optic neuritis as the only presentation of an undiagnosed MGUS is very rare.\n\n【12】Conclusion\n\n【13】In this report， we presented a patient with recurrent optic neuritis diagnosed with MGUS. He was treated with intravenous high-dose methylprednisolone for acute attacks and Rituximab as maintenance therapy. The patient's vision was recovered， and he did not experience any other attack.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:33:35", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:33:41", "cost": 6.721}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:48", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:33:41", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:33:34"}

The quantity of people suffered with DR has been estimated to increase from 463million in 2019 to 700 million by 2045 . It has been reported that DR is a primary cause of preventable blindness in labor age population globally. During the stage of Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy(PDR)，the patients may experience severe vision impairment， which is irreversible and dramatically affects the life quality of diabetic patients. Therefore， early prevention and treatment of DR is essential. Current therapies for DR mainly aimed at PDR or diabetic macular edema， drugs intervention for early stage are still limited. Traditional Chinese Herbal Medicine may provide an alternative and complementary therapy for targeting the early and potentially reversible retinal damage . Qizhijiangtang capsule (QZJC)， a kind of traditional Chinese patent medicine， which has been approved in China. QZJC consists of Astragalus mongholicus Bunge， Rehmannia glutinosa(Gaertn.) DC.， Polygonatum cyrtonema Hua， and Terminalia chebula Retz. QZJC has been proven to regulate glucolipid metabolism， improve the insulin resistance， inhibit the glomerulosclerosis and renal interstitial fibrosis . However， its effect on DR is still unclear.

All the participants will be treated with conventional treatment， including a healthy low-fat diet， moderate physical activity， anti-hyperglycemic， lipid-lowering and anti-hypertensive drugs， to ensure access to steady levels of body weight， blood glucose， blood lipids and blood pressure. On the basis， the intervention group used 2.5 g QZJC three times per day， while the control group used 2.5 g QZJC placebo three times per day， both of them are recommended to be taken after meals with boiled warm water. The treatment duration will be 24 weeks， and we will follow up for another 2 years.\n\n【36】Outcomes\n\n【37】Primary outcome\n\n【38】The primary outcome of the study is the changes in the degree of retinal microaneurysm lesions assessed by fundus photography and fundus fluorescence angiography before and after treatment. This will be determined according to the following scale： None， mild non-proliferative phase， moderate non-proliferative phase， severe non-proliferative phase， and proliferative phase， which are divided into aggravated， stable， and improved conditions. The aggravated condition is defined as retinal microaneurysm lesions with a degree of severity> grade 1 after treatment. The stable condition was defined as a degree of retinal microaneurysm lesions before and after treatment that is unchanged， while the improved condition is defined as a degree off retinal microaneurysm lesions that is reduced by >1 grade after treatment.\n\n【39】Secondary outcomes\n\n【40】Secondary outcomes are listed as the corrected visual acuity， fasting blood glucose， 2-h postprandial blood glucose， glycosylated hemoglobin， urinary microalbumin excretion rate， the improvement ofTCM syndromes and TCM symptoms from baseline to 24 weeks.\n\n【41】Safety assessment and adverse events monitoring\n\n【42】Safety assessment outcomes are listed as vital signs， routine blood test， routine urine test and routine stool test， electrocardiogram， liver function， renal function will be performed at every 12 weeks from baseline. Adverse Events (AEs) will be documented at every visit， including the occurrence time， severity， duration， solution and transfer. AEs will be divided into three levels： Mild， moderate and severe， and the causality between TCPMs for trials and AEs will be judged. In case of any AEs， such as subjective discomfort of the patient and abnormal laboratory test， it will be taken measures immediately to protect the safety of the participants. Any serious AEs during the test must be reported to the Ethics Committee of the unit immediately，and notify the telephone number and contact person of the units listed in the CRF form. The “Severe Adverse Event (SAE)”form must be filled in. All AEs will be recorded， monitored， and treated until resolved.\n\n【43】Study Procedure\n\n【44】The study will include a 2-week washout period， a 24-week treatment period and a 2-year follow-up period. Subjects who are diagnosed with NPDR will be given a 2-week lifestyle intervention at run-in period， all of them will provide written informed consent prior to participation. After the intervention period begin， participant visits will conduct every 4 weeks. All data will be documented on the CRFs .\n\n【45】Sam ple Size Calculation\n\n【46】According to data from preliminary trial ， the rate of retinal microvascular disease was reduced by 2.9% in the placebo group， and we predicted that the rate of retinal microvascular disease would be reduced by 6.5% in the TCPM group. The standard deviation was set as 2.17. The superiority margin was assumed to increase 1.4percentage on the basis of placebo. The ratio of the two groups was set as 1：1. The significance level is targeted at 0.025 for one-sided test. The power achieved to detect a difference is set as 0.9. Sample size will be calculated the independent proportions power analysis using PASS 11.0 software，approximately 45 participants in each group will be needed. The sample size used in our study was increased by an additional 10% in case of loss of follow-up. Hence， the final sample size is estimated to be 50 in each group.\n\n【47】Data Collection and Management\n\n【48】The researchers will record original data into the Case Report Form (CRF)， the supervisor will check whether the trial is launched consistent with the protocol，and the data in the CRFs is identical with the original data， errors and inconsistencies will be timely corrected. Before data entry， the data administrators will check the CRFs again to ensure the accuracy of the data， the data administrator will also record the coding process in the coding book. Duplicate entry is adopted for inputting the data. If problems are found in the input process， they will be registered and reported in time， so as to deal with the problems quickly. The data administrator will write the computer programs and input data. After entering the data， the CRFs need to be filed and saved. The researchers will keep the clinical trial data until 5vears after the end of the clinical trial.\n\n【49】Statistical Analysis\n\n【50】Analysis subjects\n\n【51】Three analysis sets will be used in this trial， including Full Analysis Set (FAS)， Per Protocol Set (PPS) and Safety Set (SS). FAS includes all randomized subjects and drop-out subjects who have been treated at least once and excluded for reasonable reasons. For the subjects who failed to observe the efficacy， the principle of the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) will be applied to handle with the missing outcome data. PPS is a set of compliance protocol， including that the participants have good compliance of using 80% to 120% quantity of the study drugs； the baseline characteristics are not missing， and the data of the primary outcome can be obtained； and it does not run counter to the protocol. SS is a set that received at least one-time treatment and has data recorded with safety assessment.\n\n【52】Statistical method\n\n【53】Statistical analysiIsSwillbe completed by the third-party statisticians using SAS 9.3 software. Continuous data will be expressed as the mean， median， standard deviation， minimum value， and maximum value， while categorical data will be expressed as the number of cases and percentages. To compare baseline characteristics between the two groups， independent t tests will be used to analyze continuous data，and chi-squared test or Fisher exact test will be used for categorical data. With regard to outcome analysis， the classified variables will be performed using the chi-squared test or Fisher exact test， and continuous variables will be performed using t test for normally distributed data and Wilcoxon rank sum test for non-normal distribution data. Moreover， repeated measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) will be applied to determine to further investigate the effects of treatment and time course. A two-tailed test will be applied， and P<0.05 will be considered to indicate a statistical significance.\n\n【54】Discussion\n\n【55】In the UPLC-QE-Orbitrap-MS analysis， a total of 52 compounds were identified in QZJC capsules， many of the compounds have been proved by modern pharmacological studies to have the effect of improving related symptoms ofDM and its complications， reflecting the characteristics of synergistic action of multiple components in QZJC . In the previous experiments，QZJC has been demonstrated that ameliorated retinal vascular permeability and inhibited retinal neovascularization via up-regulating Prostacyclin 2 (PGI2) and down-regulating VEGF and von Willebrand Factor (vWF)； it also attenuated inflammation via promotion of Nitric Oxide (NO) and Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) expression . Currently， we therefore design a randomized and controled multicenter clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of QZJC. Wehypothesize that QZJC could have a potential retinal protective effect on NPDR patients. If successful， the findings of this trial may provide an alternative treatment for NPDR patients. It may also provide scientific evidence for delaying the progress of DR. This trial also has some limitations. Firstly， as the test instruments of each research center are different， the error of test results is inevitable. Secondly， there might be several individual differences in the subjects， possibly leading to different efficacy of the drug. The improvements need to be seen in the future.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【9】Ethics and permissions\n\n【10】", "content": "【0】Abstract\n\n【1】Background： Diabetic retinopathy remains a leading cause of vision loss globally.

The quantity of people suffered with DR has been estimated to increase from 463million in 2019 to 700 million by 2045 . It has been reported that DR is a primary cause of preventable blindness in labor age population globally. During the stage of Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy(PDR)，the patients may experience severe vision impairment， which is irreversible and dramatically affects the life quality of diabetic patients. Therefore， early prevention and treatment of DR is essential. Current therapies for DR mainly aimed at PDR or diabetic macular edema， drugs intervention for early stage are still limited. Traditional Chinese Herbal Medicine may provide an alternative and complementary therapy for targeting the early and potentially reversible retinal damage . Qizhijiangtang capsule (QZJC)， a kind of traditional Chinese patent medicine， which has been approved in China. QZJC consists of Astragalus mongholicus Bunge， Rehmannia glutinosa(Gaertn.) DC.， Polygonatum cyrtonema Hua， and Terminalia chebula Retz. QZJC has been proven to regulate glucolipid metabolism， improve the insulin resistance， inhibit the glomerulosclerosis and renal interstitial fibrosis . However， its effect on DR is still unclear. We will carry out a clinical trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of QZJC targeting NPDR.\n\n【8】Methods\n\n【9】Ethics and permissions\n\n【10】The protocol has been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Guang 'anmen Hospital of the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences .(The protocol has registered at http：//www.chictr.org.cn/showprojen.aspx?proj=39622.

All the participants will be treated with conventional treatment， including a healthy low-fat diet， moderate physical activity， anti-hyperglycemic， lipid-lowering and anti-hypertensive drugs， to ensure access to steady levels of body weight， blood glucose， blood lipids and blood pressure. On the basis， the intervention group used 2.5 g QZJC three times per day， while the control group used 2.5 g QZJC placebo three times per day， both of them are recommended to be taken after meals with boiled warm water. The treatment duration will be 24 weeks， and we will follow up for another 2 years.\n\n【36】Outcomes\n\n【37】Primary outcome\n\n【38】The primary outcome of the study is the changes in the degree of retinal microaneurysm lesions assessed by fundus photography and fundus fluorescence angiography before and after treatment. This will be determined according to the following scale： None， mild non-proliferative phase， moderate non-proliferative phase， severe non-proliferative phase， and proliferative phase， which are divided into aggravated， stable， and improved conditions. The aggravated condition is defined as retinal microaneurysm lesions with a degree of severity> grade 1 after treatment. The stable condition was defined as a degree of retinal microaneurysm lesions before and after treatment that is unchanged， while the improved condition is defined as a degree off retinal microaneurysm lesions that is reduced by >1 grade after treatment.\n\n【39】Secondary outcomes\n\n【40】Secondary outcomes are listed as the corrected visual acuity， fasting blood glucose， 2-h postprandial blood glucose， glycosylated hemoglobin， urinary microalbumin excretion rate， the improvement ofTCM syndromes and TCM symptoms from baseline to 24 weeks.\n\n【41】Safety assessment and adverse events monitoring\n\n【42】Safety assessment outcomes are listed as vital signs， routine blood test， routine urine test and routine stool test， electrocardiogram， liver function， renal function will be performed at every 12 weeks from baseline. Adverse Events (AEs) will be documented at every visit， including the occurrence time， severity， duration， solution and transfer. AEs will be divided into three levels： Mild， moderate and severe， and the causality between TCPMs for trials and AEs will be judged. In case of any AEs， such as subjective discomfort of the patient and abnormal laboratory test， it will be taken measures immediately to protect the safety of the participants. Any serious AEs during the test must be reported to the Ethics Committee of the unit immediately，and notify the telephone number and contact person of the units listed in the CRF form. The “Severe Adverse Event (SAE)”form must be filled in. All AEs will be recorded， monitored， and treated until resolved.\n\n【43】Study Procedure\n\n【44】The study will include a 2-week washout period， a 24-week treatment period and a 2-year follow-up period. Subjects who are diagnosed with NPDR will be given a 2-week lifestyle intervention at run-in period， all of them will provide written informed consent prior to participation. After the intervention period begin， participant visits will conduct every 4 weeks. All data will be documented on the CRFs .\n\n【45】Sam ple Size Calculation\n\n【46】According to data from preliminary trial ， the rate of retinal microvascular disease was reduced by 2.9% in the placebo group， and we predicted that the rate of retinal microvascular disease would be reduced by 6.5% in the TCPM group. The standard deviation was set as 2.17. The superiority margin was assumed to increase 1.4percentage on the basis of placebo. The ratio of the two groups was set as 1：1. The significance level is targeted at 0.025 for one-sided test. The power achieved to detect a difference is set as 0.9. Sample size will be calculated the independent proportions power analysis using PASS 11.0 software，approximately 45 participants in each group will be needed. The sample size used in our study was increased by an additional 10% in case of loss of follow-up. Hence， the final sample size is estimated to be 50 in each group.\n\n【47】Data Collection and Management\n\n【48】The researchers will record original data into the Case Report Form (CRF)， the supervisor will check whether the trial is launched consistent with the protocol，and the data in the CRFs is identical with the original data， errors and inconsistencies will be timely corrected. Before data entry， the data administrators will check the CRFs again to ensure the accuracy of the data， the data administrator will also record the coding process in the coding book. Duplicate entry is adopted for inputting the data. If problems are found in the input process， they will be registered and reported in time， so as to deal with the problems quickly. The data administrator will write the computer programs and input data. After entering the data， the CRFs need to be filed and saved. The researchers will keep the clinical trial data until 5vears after the end of the clinical trial.\n\n【49】Statistical Analysis\n\n【50】Analysis subjects\n\n【51】Three analysis sets will be used in this trial， including Full Analysis Set (FAS)， Per Protocol Set (PPS) and Safety Set (SS). FAS includes all randomized subjects and drop-out subjects who have been treated at least once and excluded for reasonable reasons. For the subjects who failed to observe the efficacy， the principle of the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) will be applied to handle with the missing outcome data. PPS is a set of compliance protocol， including that the participants have good compliance of using 80% to 120% quantity of the study drugs； the baseline characteristics are not missing， and the data of the primary outcome can be obtained； and it does not run counter to the protocol. SS is a set that received at least one-time treatment and has data recorded with safety assessment.\n\n【52】Statistical method\n\n【53】Statistical analysiIsSwillbe completed by the third-party statisticians using SAS 9.3 software.

DiagnosisilsSbased on determining the presence of hemolyticanemia， thrombocytopenia， and the presence of schistocytes in the peripheral blood smear and damage to internal organs - most commonly the kidneys. Liver involvement as the main symptom of the disease is rare， making it difficult to recognize.\n\n【2】Case Presentation： We present a case of a 65 year old woman whose clinical picture was dominated by weakness， vomiting， jaundice， disturbances of consciousness， as well as characteristics of liver and kidney damage. Laboratory tests showed typical features of hemolytic anemia Hgb 9.3g%， high LDH， low haptoglobin， thrombocytopenia 116x109/l， signs of renal damage： creatinine3.6mg/dl， and elevated bilirubin level 5.5mg/dl. Manual differential blood smear stated 6% to8% schistocytes. Establishing a diagnosis was possible after genetic testing， which showed only a heterozygous polymorphism in the promoter of the factor H gene. Eculizumab was not an option(lack of registration in Poland)， thus other methods of treatment were sought (infusions of plasma， plasmapheresis and corticosteroids).\n\n【3】Conclusion： Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome is not always acute. For carriers of the mutated gene， the image of the disease may be incomplete and precede in a chronic way that delays diagnosis. Hepatic manifestation of aHUS is casuistic in medicine and probably results from damage to the vascular endothelial cells in small hepatic vessels.\n\n【4】Keywords： Thrombotic microangiopathy； Atypical hemolytic-uremic syndrome； Complement factor H mutation； Case report\n\n【5】Abbreviations aHUS： Atypical Hemolitic-Uremic Syndrome； STEC-HUS： Diarrhea-Associated Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome； TTP： Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura； HGB： Hemoglobin； HCT：Hematocrit；RBC： Red Blood Cell Count； ALT： Alanine Transaminase； AST： Aspartate Transaminase； PLT： Platelets； INR： International Normalized Ratio； DD： Dimer D； ATIII： Antithrombin III； anti-LKM1： Anti-Liver-Kidney Microsome 1； ANCA： Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody； ANA： Antinuclear Antibody； SMA： Smooth Muscle Antibody； antidsDNA- anti-double stranded DNA； MRI： Magnetic Resonance Imaging； PET： Positron Emission Tomography； LDH： Lactate Dehydrogenase； CC3： Complement Component 3； FFP： Fresh Frozen Plasma； anti-MASP2； CFH：Complement Factor H； MCP： Membrane Cofactor Protein； CFI： Complement Factor I； CFB：Complement Factor B；THBD： Thrombomodulin； ADAMTS 13： Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif； member 13； MLDPA： Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification； DGKE： Diacylglycerol Kinase ； SLE： Systemic Lupus Erythromatosus； HELLP：Syndrome Hemolytic Anemia； Elevated Liver Enzymes； Low Platelet Count； DIC： Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation； TMA： Thrombotic Microangiopathies； anti-CFH： Autoantibodies against Complement Factor H； EMA： European Medicine Agency\n\n【6】Background\n\n【7】Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a rare disease associated with excessive complement activation . Subsequent endothelial damage and disseminate coagulation lead to hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. These symptoms lie at the center of thrombotic microangiopathies： aHUS， diarrhea-associated hemolytic uremic syndrome (STEC-HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Eculizumab， a monoclonal antibody against compliment component 5， is the new standard of care for aHUS. As eculizumab was not registered in1Poland during patient’s hospitalization， other methods of treatment were sought (plasma infusion， plasma exchange and glicocortycosteroids). Following case of aHUS is unique for the predominance of liver symptoms and the chronic clinical course.\n\n【8】Presentation Case\n\n【9】We present a case of a 65-year old woman，Caucasian race， body weight of 56 kg， who was admitted to Tertiary Nephrologic Center with postprandial vomiting， recurrent vertigo and general asthenia. Clinical examination revealed xanthochromia and liver enlargement(5 cm beneath the ribcage). Three years prior to first hospitalization a routine examination during a surgical provision of left arm fracture revealed a bilirubin level of 2 mg/dl. No chronic diseases in patient medical history. At the age of 31 patients gave birth to a healthy daughter， with no complications during pregnancy and childbirth. During present hospitalization laboratory tests showed： anemia(hemoglobin HGB 9.3g/l， hematocrit HCT 27%， red blood cell count RBC 2.84x1012/l)， kidney and liver dysfunction (creatinine3.6 mg/dl， urea 72 mg/dl， bilirubin 5.5 mg/dl， alanine transaminase ALT 20 U/l， aspartate transaminase AST 46 U/l， moderate thrombocytopenia (platelets PLT116x109/l) and the following coagulation disorders： prolonged international normalized ratio(INR)， an increased D-Dimer and a decreased antithrombin 3 value(ATIII). Abdominal ultrasonography revealed an oval focal lesion in the left liver lobe (decreased echogenicity， 14 mm in diameter) and numerous cysts in the right liver lobe. In CT scan， in both lobes of the liver visible several outbreaks of ~8mm in diameter. Liver was slightly enlarged， with a reduced coefficient of extinction (approx. 45J.H.)， Figure 1. During the diagnostic process no biopsy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was conducted due to thrombocytopenia and the presence of a metal plate in the left arm， Figure 2. A whole body Positron Emission Tomography (PET) showed no intensified glucose uptake. Tests for viral and autoimmune hepatitis and other autoimmune disorders were carried out (for systemic lupus erythematosLS， dermatomyositis，antiphospholipid syndrome， systemic vasculitis)： anti-doublestranded DNAA(anti-dsDNA) antibodies， lupus anticoagulant， Antinuclear Antibody (ANA) anti-liver-kidney microsome1(anti-LKM1)， Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody (ANCA)， Smooth Muscle Antibody (SMA). No antibodies were found. Moreover， the patient suffered from recurrent episodes of impaired consciousness during hospitalization. A computer tomography of the head visualized a fresh cerebral ischemia in the right cerebral hemisphere， Figure 3. Furthermore， despite blood transfusions anemia and thrombocytopenia intensified. The presence of schistocytes in the blood smear (6% to 8%)， an increased level of Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) and reticulocyte count and an almost undetectable level of heptoglobin suggested hemolytic microangiopathic anaemia. Considering the entire clinical picture， a diagnosis of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura TTP of unknown origin was considered. Blood serum was collected and showed a decreased complement component 3 (CC3) activity 80 mg/dl (90 to 180)； and normal ADAMTS13 activity - 93% (N 40% to 130%). Shiga toxin was negative. Because of the deteriorating clinical condition，therapy was started. The infusions of 500 mg methylprednisolone for 3consecutive days were followed by 40 mg of oral prednisone bringing a temporary improvement. Additionally， a total of 24 units of Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) were infused. The clinical state improved， without renal replacement therapy a diuresis of over 2 liters per day was achieved with a slight deterioration ofliver function.\n\n【10】The patientWas repeatedly hospitalized foorr impaired consciousness accompanied by anemia and a decline of kidney and liver function manifested by hepatic encephalopathy and dehydration. The patient received repeated therapeutic plasma exchanges. Three plasmaphereses were performed， each exchanging4 liters of plasma with FFP bringing no improvement to the clinical state. Due to the ineffectiveness of treatment (plasmapheresis， steroids， FFP transfusion)， recurrent relapses of aHUS and lack of targeted therapy with eculizumab， (not available in Poland at that time)， the patient was offered a participation in a phase 2 clinical trial examining the safety of the monoclonal antibody anti-MASP 2(OMS721-TMA-001，NCT02222545). Change in levels of creatinine， haemoglobin， bilirubin and platelets over time are shown on Figure 4. Genetic testing was performed to assess the most common mutations associated with HUS/TTP development . Testing was performed in The Clinical Research Center for Rare Diseases“Aldo e CeleDacco”， Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research， in Italy. No cerebral ischemia in the right cerebral hemisphere. mutations were found by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) of Complement Factor H (CFH)， Membrane Cofactor Protein(MCP)， Complement Component 3 (CC3)， Complement Factor I(CFI)， Complement Factor B (CFB)， Thrombomodulin (THBD)， a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1motif， member 13 (ADAMTS13)， diacylglycerol kinase e (DGKE) genes. A heterozygous polymorphism c-332T>C in the promoter of complement factor H gene was found by Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA). The mutation is associated with aHUS development.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome is a rare disease with a prevalence of 2.1 cases per million . Various complement abnormalities and excessive coagulation lead to consumptive thrombocytopenia. Hemolytic anemia is caused by damage to erythrocytes caused on their way through the narrowed vessels. The disease is associated with renal function impairment： 60% of children and 80% of adults eventually require renal replacement therapy. Neurological (impaired consciousness， stroke， focal deficits and epileptic seizures) and cardiac involvement is present in 10%to 30% of cases . The main symptom in our patient was liver malfunction， renal involvement. Hepatic manifestation of aHUS may have been a result of hemolysis in the endothelium of hepatic vessels and subsequent organ ischaemia. Only about half of the patients with typical presentation of aHUS have identifiable complement factor mutations. Our patient had no mutation of complement factor H but was heterozygous for the polymorphism c.-332C>T in the promoter of CFH gene. Such abnormality has already been identified in other patients with aHUS . Patient was a carrier of the mutated gene， and this could be a reason for a milder and more chronic course of disease and subsequent difficulty in establishing diagnosis of aHUS. In order for the syndrome to develop a combination of factors must coincide：a mutation， predisposing haplotype and a triggering factor . Around 50% of aHUS cases are preceded with a gastrointestinal or upper respiratory tract infection . Other triggering events include pregnancy， cancer and use of medications . No associated trigger was found in the presented case.\n\n【13】Diagnosis of aHUS must be differentiated with other thrombotic microangiopathies. Hemolytic anemia， thrombocytopenia and acute renal insufficiency， fever and a possible central nervous system involvement are associated with HUS in the course of E. coli O157infection. No gastroenteritis was present in the described case and Shiga toxin in stool was negative.

Furthermore， thrombotic microangiopathies must be differentiated with Systemic Lupus Erythromatosus (SLE)， syndrome of Hemolytic Anemia， Elevated Liver Enzymes， Low Platelet Count (HELLP)， Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) and Thrombotic Microangiopathies (TMA)) secondary to drugs likeequinine， simvastatin， interferon or calcineurin inhibitors.\n\n【17】If plasmapheresis， is unavailable then FFP transfusion remains the first line of aHUS treatment. The treatment provides the lacking complement factors . Exchange of 1-2 plasma volumes in each plasmapheresis is recommended as was the case in our patient . Immunosuppressive therapy has a limited utility in the treatment of aHUS showing some effect only in cases related to the development of autoantibodies against complement factor H anti-CFH . However，FFPinfusions， 3 therapeutic plasma exchanges and steroids provided only a temporary improvement.\n\n【18】In the 2009 European Medicine Agency (EMA) approved eculizumab for aHUS therapy. It is a monoclonal antibody against C5complement factor. Its use is highly effective with 80% ofthe patients achieving long term remission， as opposed to 5% of patients treated with plasmaphereses . Due to lack of approval eculizumab was unavailable in Poland at that time. That was the reason the patient started experimental therapy as a part of phase 2 clinical trial.\n\n【19】Conclusions\n\n【20】Liver manifestation of aHUS is rare. Final diagnosis was established after thorough， extensive diagnostics incuding genetic testing. Treatment was ineffective， thus other methods of treatment were sought. The main limitation of our manuscript was the inability to treat with eculizumab at that time.\n\n【21】Summary\n\n【22】The above described case presents the difficulty of diagnosing an atypical clinical course of aHUS. Treatment of aHUS presents an even greater challenge， especially if plasma exchanges are ineffective. It is advisable to search for new genes associated with aHUS/TTP. In justified cases， specific diagnosis is possible only after genetic testing， especially for a long period of illness when the symptoms are not spectacular. aHUS is rare syndrome with poor prognosis.

DS is associated with a mutation in the SCN1A gene in80% to 90% of cases. The EEG in DS is usually non-specific， while the brain MRI is generally normal at onset. Sodium channel blocking Anti-Seizure Medications (ASM) exacerbates seizures in DS and should be avoided. About 80% of children with DS survive to adulthood， 92% of whom continue to have seizures. While the diagnosis of DS is easily made in early childhood， it can be challenging in older children and adults and missed in ~33% patients， at times misdiagnosed with common mimickers such as Lennox Gastuat Syndrome (LGS).\n\n【2】I present a 19-vear-old female with intractable epilepsy and presumed LGS with seizure onset at three months of age，“multiple\" and at times prolonged febrile seizures， worsening convulsions with sodium channel blocking ASM and cognitive limitations. A routine EEG showed diffuse slowing， while brain MRI was suggestive of right mesial temporal sclerosis. Genetic testing done revealed SCN1A pathogenic variant. Her ASMs were adjusted， leaving her with Zonisamide and Epidiolex and ~70% seizure reduction.\n\n【3】It is never too late to consider DS as well as other SCNIA related epilepsies； if found， it allows for optimal seizure management， a decrease in seizure burden， improving the social-economic dynamics of patients， caregivers， and the health care system.\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】DS is among a spectrum of SCN1A seizure disorders that range from “simple febrile seizures and Generalized Epilepsy with Febrile Seizures plus (GEFS+) at the mild end to Dravet syndrome and Intractable Childhood Epilepsy with Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures (ICE-GTC) at the severe end . DS is a specific early-life epilepsy that is believed to make up 33% to 90% of Seizure phenotypes on SCNIA seizures disorders  and with an incidence as high as 1 in. The classic presentation includes frequent， prolonged seizures often triggered by elevated body temperature beginning between 1 to 18 months， developmental delay， speech impairment， ataxia， hypotonia， sleep disturbances， and multiple comorbidities， including intellectual disability and behavioral problems. Approximately 80% to 90% of patients with DS have variants in the SCN1A gene， notable for encoding the a-1 submit of the neuronal voltage-gated sodium channel ， however， when found in isolation， it does not endorse the diagnosis， nor does its absence exclude it. Early diagnosis of DS is crucial to the timely utilization of the best available treatments and avoiding exacerbating medications， costly and invasive testing， as well as futile therapies such as resective epilepsy surgery and giving closure for families， wondering about the cause of their loved one's condition. Despite a reasonablyclassic presentation， a 4.8-year delay in diagnosis has been reported； with delays or misdiagnosis seen in as many as 33% of patients . Patients may be presumed to have other syndromes such as LGS， leading to improper management. The highest priority in the management of DS is avoiding prolonged convulsive seizures and obtundation， which impact the developmental outcome and morbidity . Seizure control is typically not achievable； however， seizures can be significantly reduced with appropriate treatment. Clobazam and valproic acid are considered first-line medications， while Stiripentol and topiramate second line. Other options include diet therapy， clonazepam， levetiracetam， and zonisamide， as well as Epidiolex. Sodium channel blocking agents such as Carbamazepine， oxcarbazepine， lamotrigine， phenytoin， and vigabatrin often exacerbate seizures and should be avoided. Surgical options， such as Vagus nerve stimulation and Callosotomy， may be considered in certain situations.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 19-year-old right-handed female with significant cognitive impairment， intractable epilepsy， and presumed Lennox Gastuat Syndrome referred for the management of her epilepsy.\n\n【8】The patient is a 35-Ex-weeker with “multiple” febrile convulsive seizures， delayed development， and a history of seizures in a brother. Seizures began at three months of age before prolonged status epilepticus ~3 h were seen at 18 months. She later developed afebrile seizures； the family insists on only one seizure type during which she becomes agitated， eye deviated to the right or left， extension of both legs and the right arm with flexion of the left arm followed by generalized tonic-clonic activity lasting about 1 to 2 minutes. There is associated tongue biting， urine incontinence， and 20 min to 40 min of postictal confusion. She had 4-5 seizures per month， results of a prior EEG are unknown， and a head CT scan was unremarkable. She was diagnosed with LGS and， despite several seizure medication trials， including but not limited to phenytoin， Oxcarbazepine， lamotrigine， Valproic acid， Zonisamide， Topiramate， and Phenobarbital seizure persisted. At the time she was seen at our center， she was taking Zonisamide/Depakote as well as Lamictal， the later used for at least12 years. She had optimal levels of Lamictal， ranging from 3.5 to 8.1mcg/mL and Depakote 33.0 to 164.6 mcg/mL from 2/28/2007 to2/19/2019.\n\n【9】Other than her history of epilepsy and Intellectual disability， as well as a family history of epilepsy， she had not undergone surgical procedures， had no different reported family history， nor use of drugs， alcohol， or tobacco products. She lived home with her parents requiring full-time care.\n\n【10】On examination： Vital signs： Height 144.8 cm (49\")， weight37.1 kg (81 lb. 12.8 oz)， blood pressure 99/54 mmHg， and a pulse of 84 beats/min. The head was normocephalic and atraumatic； neck supple with no tenderness. Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally. Cardiovascular： Regular rate and rhythm. The abdomen was soft， non-tender with normal bowel sounds.\n\n【11】She was awake， reaching for a book， flipping through pages， making noises without intelligible speech， and could not consistently follow commands. Pupils were equal reactive to light. She had reduced muscle tone； cortical thumb bilaterally left>right. Face grossly symmetric， moved all four extremities well， although she was unable to participate in dedicated muscle testing. Deep tendon reflexes were present in the bilateral upper and lower extremities with a slightly crouched， grossly stable gait.\n\n【12】Based on her history of seizure onset， response to medications， there was high suspicion for Dravet in this patient. Lamotrigine was tapered off alongside obtaining miscellaneous DNA testing， which later showed a pathogenic variant， in SCN1A； c.4224G>A . She had diffuse slowing on a routine EEG while her brain MRI showed mild atrophy of the right hippocampus and associated FLAIR signal concerning for mesial temporal sclerosis.\n\n【13】The patient was cross titrated to Epidiolex and Zonisamide with significant improvement in seizures， four seizures in 3 months，as well as being more alert and interacting more with her environment. Her family has been pleased with the seizure control and quality oflife.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】Dravet syndrome， a severe form ofepilepsy with typical diagnostic criteria， confirmatory test， and proven effective therapies . About80% of children with DS survive to adulthood， with 92% of patients continuing to have seizures . Diagnosing DS in older children and adults can be more challenging ； at times， patients misdiagnosed with conditions such as Lennox Gastuat Syndrome (LGS)， genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures， focal epilepsies， myoclonic epilepsy in infancy among other . A consensus panel suggests that“in young children as well as older previously undiagnosed children and adults if details of the early childhood history are not available， findings of persisting seizures， hyperthermia as a seizure trigger， seizure exacerbation with the use of sodium channel agents， intellectual disability， abnormalities on neurological examination， a crouched gait， hypotonia， incoordination， and impaired dexterity a diagnosis of Dravet syndrome should be considered”. The presented patient had all itemslisted above， raisingthe suspicion on herinitial evaluation even 17 years after seizure onset. The suspicion of Dravet syndrome should prompt adjustment of management， including genetic testing as feasibly possible， which may show a pathologic variant in SCNIA in 85% of patients with Dravet . In the patient discussed， tested positive for this mutation， helping confirm the diagnosis. It should， however， be noted that a positive test in isolation does not confirm the diagnosis， nor does the absence of the mutation exclude it， as such clinical suspicion should still guide management .\n\n【16】Generally， the commonly used tests， notably EEG and brain imaging， do not have a “typical signature\" in DS. The patient’s brain MRI that was suggestive of right mesial temporal sclerosis could have easily led one to a different path， including continued use of sodium channel blocking seizure medication presumed the medication of choice in focal onset seizures； however， this finding insolation did not explain the patient's clinical presentation. It has also been previously reported that in Dravet syndrome， \"brain MRI is typically normal but may show mild generalized atrophy and/or hippocampal sclerosis”； the same authors note that the “EEG might show diffuse background slowing， often with multifocal and/or generalized interictal discharges.\"\n\n【17】Early diagnosis of DS is critical for initiating the appropriate treatment， avoiding unnecessary medical tests as well as seizure exacerbation if the wrong medication is used as well as providing an as giving closure to the patient's family . In the US， the recommended anti-seizure medications include Clobazam and valproic acid as first-line； Stiripentol and topiramate second line while other options include diet therapy， clonazepam， levetiracetam， and zonisamide， Epidiolex， as well as neurostimulation and Callosotomy. It is well known thatanti-seizure medications with sodium channel capabilities exacerbate seizures in DS and should be avoided. In the patient presented， her anti-seizure medications were adjusted， leaving her with zonisamide and Epidiolex and ~70% seizure reduction. While the long-term outlook is not likely for complete seizure control， the decrease is undoubtedly one can pursue.\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】Dravet syndrome is a severe form of epilepsy with typical diagnostic criteria； however， some patients will elude diagnosis for years or even decades. Health care providers need tobe mindful of this possibility， given the management implications. It is never too late to make the right diagnosis and adjust management that could improve seizure control considerably as well as improving the social-economic dynamics of patients， caregivers， and the health care system.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:42:38", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:42:52", "cost": 13.797}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:47", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:42:52", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:42:38"}

We report a 67-year-old female presented with Acute Coronary Syndrome(ACS) and cardiogenic shock. The coronary angiogram showed the LM originating from the right coronary sinus， with a thrombotic lesion in the ostium of the circumflex artery and a chronic total occlusion of the Left Anterior Descending artery (LAD) and the Posterior Descending artery(PD). After percutaneous implantation of a circulatory support with Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) the patient was fully revascularized. The procedure was very difficult regarding the complex coronary anatomy and the presence oftwo chronic occlusion but the clinical evolution was favorable. This case highlights the benefits of complete revascularization in this particular situation and the importance of an appropriate circulatory support.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Congenital Coronary Anomalies (CCA) are very rare. They are only present in 0.15% of the population， 0.5% for patients referred to catheterization diagnostic and 1.5% after cardiac computed tomography .\n\n【4】Coronary artery originating from contralateral sinus of Valsalva is a potentially serious anomaly with a risk of sudden cardiac death depending most of the presence of an aortic intramural segment or of an inter arterial course (where the anomalous artery passes between the pulmonary artery and the aorta).\n\n【5】Thus， anomalous coronary arteries do not appear to be associated with an increased risk for development of coronary atherosclerosis . There are very limited numbers of cases reports with patients treated by percutaneous interventions for severe stenotic lesion in the anomalous coronary artery in stable condition or even in acute phase.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 67-year-old female patient with a past medical history of arterial hypertension， dyslipidemia， diabetes and chronic severe renal failure was admitted at our hospital for acute coronary syndrome. The echocardiography showed a severe bi ventricular failure with a left ejection fraction of 20%. The patient developed a complete atrio-ventricular block and becomes hemodynamicallyinstable despite the placement of a temporary pace lead and fluids administration. A percutaneous mechanical circulatory support by veno-arterial Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) was needed before starting the angiogram.\n\n【8】The patient has a moderate disease ofthe middle part of the right coronary artery and a chronic occlusion of posterior descending artery . The left system couldn't be engaging despite the use of multiples guiding catheters like (Extra Back Up 3.5/3.75， Judkins Left 4， Amplatz Left 1) .\n\n【9】A non-selective injection of the right coronary artery by Judkins Right 4 catheters allowed us to visualize an anomalous origin of the left main arising near the ostium of the right coronary artery. The interventricular artery was occluded in the proximal part and the circumflex artery presented an ostial non-occlusive thrombotic lesion . After the initials pictures was difficult to establish if the LAD occlusion was chronic. We decided to attempt a complete revascularization regarding the high surgical risk and in presence of an acute coronary syndrome with refractory cardiogenic shock.\n\n【10】The PCI of the distal left main was performed with a Judkins Right guiding catheter. The crossing of the total occlusion of the LAD was difficult， after a first try with a workhouse guide wire Sion Bleu and a Fielder XTA an intermediate stiff guidewire Gaia second could penetrate the hard tissue (reflecting the presence of a chronic occlusion). After exchange the Gaia with a work house guide wire， the lesion was prepared by multiple dilatations and an everolimus drug eluting stent (2.5 mm×28 mm) was implanted .\n\n【11】Another drug eluting stent (3x24) was placed from the left main to circumflex artery followed by a POT (proximal optimalisation technique). The wires were exchanges and after the opening of the cell struts toward LAD a drug elution stent (2.5×24) was implanted from the ostium using the TAP technique (T- stenting and small protrusion) .\n\n【12】With the same guiding catheter Judkins Right and by a Corsair microcatheter a Gaia second crossed the posterior descending occlusion after multiple tries with more soft wires like Sion Black and Fielder XTA. The lesion was prepared by balloon dilatation and a everolimus drug eluting stent (2.75×20) was implanted with a good final result.\n\n【13】The clinical evolution was favorable with ECMO been successfully stopped after 48 h and a total length of 10 days in intensive care unit. After 3 months of clinical follow up the patient was free from hospitalization.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】The percutaneous interventions in the presence of anomalous coronary arteries are very rare. The others particularities of our case are the presence of multivessel complex coronary artery disease with two CTO and a distal LM plaque in a patient with cardiogenic shock and considered inoperable by our surgical team.\n\n【16】The early implantation of ECMO before starting the procedure was very helpful in our opinion. The decision to perform a complete revascularization was related to a very poor left ventricular function and the high risk of been unable to stop the ECMO in case of PCI only of the culprit vessel.\n\n【17】Another reason to treat all three vessels was the difficult interpretation of the coronary angiogram due to 《unusual》 anatomy and the possibility that the occlusion of the LAD or the PD could be acute. The behavior of the wires and the passage only by stiff CTO wires proved that the occlusion was chronic.\n\n【18】The PCI to anomalous coronary arteries is technical difficult considering the poor stability and support of the guiding catheter. The microcatheter and the guiding extension was very helpful for enhance the support ofthe wire and to deliver the balloons and stents.\n\n【19】In ouropinion inthisparticular casethecomplete revascularization was essential for the improvement of the hemodynamics and for the favorable clinical evolution.\n\n【20】Conclusion\n\n【21】We report a very rare case of anomalous coronary arteries associated with complex lesions in a context of cardiogenic shock. In this particular situation in our opinion the treatment ofthe 2 chronic total occlusion and the distal left main protected by the mechanical circulatory support was determinant for the outcome of the patient.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:41:19", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:42:03", "cost": 44.107}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:47", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:42:03", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:41:18"}

EAML are often difficult to diagnose as they mimic Renal Cell Carcinoma due to similar clinical symptoms and imaging . There are few anecdotal reports on liver metastasis from renal EAML highlighting the fact that the patients should be followed up with imaging so that any metastasis can be picked up in time and treated on its merit. Here we report a case of EAML of kidney with liver metastasis.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 20 year old male presented with pain in left lumbar region for 6 weeks. His abdominal examination was unremarkable but his CT scan abdomen showed left renal tumor involving upper& middle poles with areas of calcification， extending beyond renal fascia， abutting left flank with no evidence of renal vein or inferior vena cava thrombosis， no abdominal or pelvic lymphadenopathy. Left radical nephrectomywas carried outand on histopathology a diagnosis of EAML was confirmed.\n\n【7】He was followed up with yearly imaging with no evidence of recurrence for 3 years. CT scan at4 years showed a lobulated primarily solid hypodense mass with central necrosis in segment VI and VII ofliver having maximum dimension of 57 mm .\n\n【8】The patient underwent ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration cytology of the liver lesion which was consistent with metastatic Epitheliod Angiomylipoma， Decision in the multidisciplinary team meeting was to rule out tuberous sclerosis (TS) and perform liver resection of the metastatic deposit. MRI brain was performed which was negative for any features of TS. He underwent liver resection to remove the tumor. Histopathology confirmed 6.0 cmx5.5 cm x 4.6cm metastatic EAML with clear resection margins. Microscopic evaluation revealed cellular neoplasm with proliferation ofepithelioid cells having abundant granular and pigmented cytoplasm. Tumor cells were arranged in sheets and numerous dilated vessels with perivascular cuffing was present. Individual cells were polygonal with vesicular nuclei and prominent nucleoli. There were multiple areas with clear cell morphology and mitotic figures were present with strongly positive HMB45 . He has been doing well 6 months after surgery with no evidence of recurrence in follow-up imaging\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】EAML is a subtype of angiomyolipma which is characterized by epitheloid cell proliferation. It is most commonly sporadic， however association with T'S has been reported in 22% of cases . These tumors are of mesenchymal origin with typical perivascular epithelioid cell differentiation.EAML show female predominance with a ratio of 6.5：1.\n\n【11】Patients in EAML are younger as compared to AML (38.6 years versus 52.3 years) whereas age of our patient is 20 years. EAML is found to be associated with advanced disease atpresentation including extension into the vena cava and right atrium， and metastasis but without lymph node involvement. Nese et al.  reported that approximately one half of patients ultimately develop metastatic lesions and one-third of them die because of disease progression. Metastatic sites included liver (63%)， lung (25%)， peritoneum/mesentery (18.8%)， colon (6.3%)， pelvis (6.3%)， and diaphragm(6.3%).\n\n【12】EAML is difficult to differentiate from RCC clinically and radiologically， it has been described that renal AML is markedly hypoechoicrelative to the renal parenchyma. This finding is consistent with presence of fat within the tumor and on CT imaging is thought to be confirmatory for AML. Microscopically， immunohistochemistry can differentiate EAML from RCC， EAML frequently presents with necrosis， hemorrhage， nuclear atypia， and mitotic activity. Different histological criteria's are defined to predict malignant potential like large tumor size， presence of necrosis， frequent mitoses， and atypical mitotic figures. Whereas metastasis may be the only definite stigmata of malignancy .\n\n【13】Liver is the most common reported site of metastasis with EAML followed by lungs . The definitive treatment of EAML is excision of the tumour. No adjuvant treatment has been proven to be effective. Doxorubicin has been tried and newer agents like rapamycin which is mTOR inhibitor have shown promising results  but no robust data is available to prove the efficacy of any chemotherapeutic agent. Because of potential for metastasis， patients with renal EAML should be followed up with regular imaging.\n\n【14】Conclusion\n\n【15】All patients with renal EAML should be carefully followed up with radiological imaging after resection of the primary tumour as this tumour can metastasise to other organs including liver.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:13:11", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:22:53", "cost": 581.869}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:47", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:22:53", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:13:10"}

Early and accurate diagnosis of gossypiboma plays very important role for delivering proper treatment. However， the diagnosis of gossypibomas is challenging as the symptoms are usually nonspecific， may appear years after surgery， and may be misdiagnosed as a tumor  or abscess  in the abdomen and pelvis.\n\n【5】Depending on the retained time of foreign bodies or sponge， exudative and aseptic fibrous alterations may occur，leading to early abscess or late fistulas  as well as clinically silent for many years . Thus， medical imaging is important in giving accurate diagnosis. Ultrasonography is a cheap and easy imaging modality for gossypiboma diagnosis； however， it may not be sufficient to evaluate the abdominal or pelvic organs in the cases of suspected gossypibomas in women after cesarean resection . Thus recognizing computed tomography and MR features of gossypibomas after varied foreign body retain time in this population is very important.\n\n【6】In this study， we retrospectively enrolled 3 women who developed gossypibomas at varied time after cesarean resection and correlated their imaging features with the pathological findings.\n\n【7】Case 1. Gossypiboma in a woman at 4 months after cesarean resection\n\n【8】A 29-year oldfemale was admitted to the hospital due to intermittent abdominalpain， abdominal distension， and anal cessation ofexhaust and defecation for more than1 month and getting worse for 2 weeks. More than 1 month before admission， intermittent abdominal pain occurred without obvious reason， mainly in the upper abdomen. The pain became worse after eating， with occasional nausea and vomiting. Recently， she has lost about 15 Kg of body weight. She underwent a cesarean section 4months ago. A 10-cm transverse surgical scar was observedat the lower abdomen， together with the whole abdomen tenderness， especially the middle and lower abdomen. Abdomen plain radiograph revealed high density fold line of the lower abdomen . Plain CT scan revealed tortuous and coiled soft tissue density shadows in the right middle and lower abdominal small intestine， and circular high-density shadows at the edge. Multiple gas shadows were observed with \"segmental honeycomb\" changes. Edema and thickening of the intestinal wall and mesentery， dilation， fluid accumulation and gas accumulation in the upper intestinal layer were also observed. MRI showed that the right middle and lower abdominal small intestine was dilated， with short T2 signal shadows along the intestinal canal lumen， and low DWI signal of metal artifacts on the edge， corresponding to the thickened intestinal wall. Besides， high T2WI-FS and DWI signal， and multiple enlarged lymph nodes were observed around the intestine and at the mesenteric roots . During the laparotomy operation， the small intestine was found to have clumps ofadhesives at 150 cm from the ileocecal part， and the adhesive bowel was about 40 cm long. An enveloped internal fistula was formed locally. Pathological examination revealed intestinal wall tissue， mucosal tissue degeneration and necrosis， submucosal vascular dilation， congestion， inflammatory cell infiltration . Based on the patient history and examinations， the diagnosis of intestinal ulcer and perforation with foreign body (gauze) was made.\n\n【9】Case 2. Gossypiboma in a woman at 18 months after cesarean resection\n\n【10】A 38 years old female was admitted in our hospital due to the intermittent abdominal pain and discomfort for 6 months. Physical examination showed an old surgical scar in the middle of the lower abdomen， and a soft mass about 8 cm×5 cm in size was palpable in the left abdomen， with low mobility. She had a caesarean section18 months ago and had a history of massive bleeding and blood transfusion. MRI examination showed a round long T1 mass with mixed T2 signal (\"swirl-like\" sign) about 5.5 cm x 4.4 cm on the left middle-lower abdomen， uneven high signal on DWI， complete capsule at the edge of the mass. Furthermore， obvious ring enhancement in the capsule and no enhancement in the center were observed on enhanced MR scan . Laparotomy revealed that the mass in the left middle-lower abdomen was closely adhered to the intestinal canal and mesangium， with a gray yellow surface. A cystic cavity was visible on the cut surface， and there were pale yellow turbidity fluid and gauze masses in the cavity. Pathological examination revealed subserosal foreign body (gauze mass)， surrounding mesangial and omental tissue， and foreign body granuloma formation in the small intestine .\n\n【11】Case 3. Gossypiboma in awoman at 5 years after cesarean resection\n\n【12】A 30-year old female with intermittent abdominal pain for2 months and abdominal mass for 1 week was admitted. She underwent cesarean section 5 years ago， tubal ligation 4 years ago and myomectomy 1 year ago. MRI examination showed a round long T1 mass (about 13.1 cm ×9.7 cm) with mixed T2 signal  in the right middle and lower abdominal cavity. Slightly lower“swirling”sign was observed in T2WI and T2WI-FS images， and isoT1-short T2 signal envelope at the edge of the mass . Slightlylower vortex signal shadow andlower strip band signal can be seen within high signal background . On the other layer of DWI， magnetic sensitivity artifacts can be seen around the low-signal shadow . Laparotomy revealed a cystic mass at 50 cm away from the ileocecal part， which encapsulated the ileum and adhered to the adjacent small intestine. The section was cystic， containing yellow fluid and gauze mass， and granulation tissue formation was observed V on the cyst wall. Pathological examination confirmed the gauze retention and fibrous tissue wrap， with foreign body granuloma\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Gossypiboma developed after cesarean section is the most common one among all gossypibomas ， however， its diagnosis remains challenging and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a mass or neoplasm， abscess， lymphocele， or nonspecific imaging findings in a postoperative patient . lmagingis the mostefficientdiagnosticapproachfor gossypiboma after cesarean section. Plain radiography is the most common technique but with a relatively high false-negative rate . Because of its higher sensitivity， computed tomography is the first-choice diagnostic imaging technique for excluding gossypibomas . Depending on the clinical situation， magnetic resonance imaging and other relevant radiological techniques such as barium contrast studies may also be used .\n\n【15】In the current study， we presented typical \"honeycomb sign\"and\"vortex like sign\" for all 3 gossypibomas after cesarean section， which is consistent with previous studies showing a spongiform pattern with a radiodense linear structure . Besides， based on the temporal development and location of gossypiboma， varied imaging features such as cyst， solid soft tissue， or well circumscribed capsulated mass， can be observed. However， these features were not closely related with the disease duration， making the diagnosis of gossypiboma after cesarean section still a clinical challenge. Combining patient histories as well as symptoms with imaging features are important to make the accurate diagnosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:32:50", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:33:03", "cost": 12.719}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:47", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:33:03", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:32:50"}

It usually occurs as a direct extension of infection from the mediastinal lymph nodes and usually involves the middle third of the oesophagus at the level of carina . We report a case of pulmonary tuberculosis with extension to the middle third of the oesophagus from the right middle lobe as evidenced on gastroscopy，bronchoscopy and Computer Tomography (CT) scan.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 36-year old male presented with one-week history of dysphagia and odynophagia. He also gave a three-week history of dry cough without any fever， shortness of breath or night sweats. He immigrated to New Zealand four years ago from India. He was a non-smoker with no other significant background medical history.\n\n【7】On examination， there was no peripheral lymphadenopathy. Auscultation revealed normal vesicular breath sounds.\n\n【8】Investigations\n\n【9】Blood tests on admission showed normal full blood count， but a raised C-reactive protein (CRP) of 20 mg/L and normal liver function tests. He was HIV negative.\n\n【10】Gastroscopy showed a large 5 cm cratered oesophageal ulcer with an appearance of a fistula， 25 cm from the incisors. Extensive biopsy sampling repeated twice showed focal ulceration with actively inflamed chronic granulation tissue. No Acid Fast Bacilli (AFB) noted anda PCR did not detect Mycobacterium species. There was no dysplasia or malignancy. Induced sputum did not show AFB and PCR did not detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex DNA.\n\n【11】A CT scan of his neck， thorax and abdomen showed a 40 mm ×29 mm×44 mm， peripherally enhancing soft tissue abnormality in the middle third of the oesophagus， with the mass broadly in contact with the carina . There was also sub carinal and right hilar lymphadenopathy. Bronchoscopy showed a lesion in the bronchus intermedius and in the right middle lobe (Figure 3). Bronchial washings and endobronchial biopsy showed only non-necrotising granulomatous inflammatory cells without any AFB. However， bronchial aspirate culture isolated Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Gastrografin swallow showedno extravasation of contrast into the mediastinum and no evidence of fistula or communication with the bronchialtree.\n\n【12】This was a case of pulmonary tuberculosis with extension to the middle third of the oesophagus from the right middle lobe. He was started on Anti-Tuberculosis Therapy (ATT) and has ongoing follow up with Infectious Disease specialists.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】The global burden of tuberculosis remains high. Gastrointestinal tuberculosis is a rare condition， even in countries with a high incidence of tuberculosis . Involvement of the gastrointestinal tract occurs through ingestion of infected sputum or haematogenous spread1from primary pulmonary tuberculosis5.Most casesof oesophageal tuberculosis are secondary to direct extension from adjacent structures. It can involve any segment of the oesophagus， but most often involves the middle third because of its proximity to the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes surrounding the bifurcation of the trachea. Oesophageal tuberculosis is almost always associated with mediastinal lymphadenopathy with or without a trachea-oesophageal fistula . The symptoms usually depend on the degree and type of oesophageal involvement. Dysphagia is the most common presenting symptom， which occurs in about 90% of the cases and was present in our patient . Other symptoms incude odynophagia， retrosternal chest pain， fever， weight loss and anorexia. Complications include bleeding， perforation， fistula formation， aspiration pneumonia， fatal haematemesis and oesophageal strictures . The most common macroscopic finding on gastroscopy is oesophageal ulcer. Other findings include hypertrophic growth as an oesophageal polyp， tumour like lesions， strictures and external compression. The differential diagnosis includes oesophageal carcinoma， crohn’s disease， syphilis and strictures due to ingestion of caustic material. Diagnosis is usually made by gastroscopywith cytological，histological， microbiological examination of tissue biopsy. The definitive test is to recover Mycobacterium tuberculosis by culture.\n\n【15】Most of the patients respond well with ATT (Isoniazid， Rifampicin， Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol). Severe stenosis will often require repeated endoscopic dilatation. Surgery is usually reserved for complications such as tracheoesophageal， aorto-oesophageal fistulas and perforation.\n\n【16】Conclusion\n\n【17】Oesophageal tuberculosis though a rare condition should be considered in patients presenting with dysphagia， especially in high risk populations such as immunocompromised patients (co-existing nature of M. tuberculosis and HIV) and immigrants from high risk countries.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:39:06", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:39:16", "cost": 9.891}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:47", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:39:16", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:39:06"}

The Reunion， a French island located in the Indian Ocean， has an extremely diverse population in terms of its ethnicity， culture， and religion. The island is also characterized by large socioeconomic and environmental disparities.\n\n【2】According to the data from French Congenital Malformation Registry， the prevalence of DS(live births and medical termination of pregnancy) in Reunion Island was the lowest in France in2017 (23.04 per 10，000 births)， notably due to the young maternal age . However， in terms of live births， Reunion Island has the highest prevalence of DS in France (12.24 vs. 5.81 per 10，000 births) despite well-organized PND. In fact， the use of Termination of Pregnancy for Fetal Abnormality(TOPFA) is the lowest in France (10.8 vs. 26.3 per 10，000 births) . Thus， this first exploratory retrospective study aimed to identify the predictive factors of TOPFA in mothers of fetuses with a PND of DS living on Reunion Island to better understand this Reunionese paradox\n\n【3】Methods\n\n【4】This retrospective study included all women living on Reunion Island with a positive PND of DS during their pregnancy from 2002 to 2015.\n\n【5】These data are taken from the official database of the Reunion Registry of Congenital Malformations (REMACOR)， approved by the French Public Health Agency， which continuously and exhaustively registers cases of malformations and chromosomal anomalies on Reunion Island. Cases can be identified through active searching or reporting from various sources： Maternity and hospital wards as well as the Medical Informatics Department. All data were retrieved from medical records. A midwife trained in clinical research and data collection entered the data into the software Eurocat Data Management Program.\n\n【6】Pregnancy Termination Following a Prenatal Diagnosis of Down Syndrome. Experience from the Reunion Registry of Congenital Malformations from 2002to 2015. Ann Clin Case Rep.2022；7.\n\n【7】Variables available in REMACOR included the characteristics of the pregnancy and fetus(TOPFA， gestational age at diagnosis， length of gestation， sex， birth weight)， characteristics of the parents (age， mother’s place of residence)， and gynecological history of the mother. The maternal place of residence was determined based on five inter communal territories of Reunion Island . Continuous variables were described using median and inter quartile range values and categorical variables as percentages. Comparisons between TOPFA and no TOPFA used the Mann-Whitney U test or Chi? or Fisher’s exact test， as appropriate. Two-sided tests and a significance threshold of p≤0.05 were used. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with TOPFA. Variables were selected based on the literature (two forced variables)，those with a low rate of missing data (<20%) or a low correlation. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS'(v9.4， SAS Institute， Cary，NC， USA， 2013) software.\n\n| Table 1： Characteristics of pregnancies， fetuses with DS， parents， and factors associated with TOPFA in the REMACOR (n=321， Reunion Island， 2002-2015).  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | n (%) or median(IQR)N=321  |  | No TOPFA N=89n(%) Qrmedian (IQR)  | TOPFA N=232n(%)Qrmedian (IQR)  | p-value  | ORa (95% CI} Multivariate  |\n| Characteristics of pregnancies and fetuses with DS by PDN  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Gestational age at diagnosis， weeks  | n=318  | 16.0(13.0)  | 17.0(15.0)  | 15.0(13.0)  | <0.001  | 0.89(0.95)  |\n| ≥ 15 weeks  |  | 206(64.8)  | 70(79.5)  | 136 (59.1)  | 0.001  |  |\n| Length of gestation， weeks  | n=320  | 22.0(19.0)  | 38.0(36.0)  | 20.0(18.0)  | <0.001  |  |\n| ≥15 weekst  |  | 297(92.8)  | 89(100.0)  | 208(90.0)  | 0.001  |  |\n| Male sex  | n=320  | 178(55.6)  | 46(51.7)  | 132(57.1)  | 0.379  |  |\n| Birth weight， grams  | n=310  | 495   | 2710  | 330.0(198.0)  | <0.001  |  |\n| ≥500 gramst  |  | 155(50.0)  | 86(96.6)  | 69(31.2)  | <0.001  |  |\n| Characteristics of parents  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Mother's age at delivery， years  | n=321  | 38   | 38.0(33.0)  | 38.0(33.0)  | 0.667  | 1.06(1.11)  |\n| Father's age at delivery， years  | n=238  | 39   | 39.0(31.0)  | 39.0(34.0)  | 0.751  |  |\n| Mother's place of residence  | n=320  |  |  |  | 0.266  |  |\n| CINOR  |  | 78(24.4)  | 18(20.2)  | 60(26.0)  |  | 1  |\n| CASUD  |  | 60(18.8)  | 21(23.6)  | 39(16.9)  |  | 0.44(0.03)  |\n| CIREST  |  | 39(12.2)  | 8(9.0)  | 31(13.4)  |  | 1.18(0.38)  |\n| CIVIS  |  | 84(26.2)  | 28(31.5)  | 56(24.2)  |  | 0.43(0.96)  |\n| TCO  |  | 59(18.4)  | 14(15.7)  | 45(19.5)  |  | 0.77(0.89)  |\n| Maternal gynecological history  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Number of previous pregnancies  | n=314  | 2.0(1.0)  | 3.0(1.0)  | 2.0(1.0)  | 0.014  |  |\n| 0  |  | 50(15.9)  | 13(14.9)  | 37(16.3)  |  |  |\n| 1-3  |  | 176(56.1)  | 41(47.1)  | 135(59.5)  | 0.05  |  |\n| 24  |  | 88(28.0)  | 33(37.9)  | 55(24.2)  |  |  |\n| Number of previous spontaneous abortions  | n=314  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|  |  | 218(69.4)  | 61(70.1)  | 157 (69.2)  |  |  |\n| 1  |  | 59(18.8)  | 18(20.7)  | 41(18.1)  | 0.63  |  |\n| 22  |  | 37(11.8)  | 8(9.2)  | 29(12.8)  |  |  |\n| Previous induced abortionst  | n=315  | 20(6.3)  | 3(3.4)  | 17(7.5)  | 0.3  |  |\n| Number of previous live births  | n=318  | 1.0(1.0)  | 2.0(1.0)  | 1.0(0.0)  | <0.001  | 0.69 (0.82)  |\n| 0  |  | 78(24.5)  | 16(18.2)  | 62(27.0)  |  |  |\n| 1  |  | 84(26.4)  | 16(18.2)  | 68 (29.6)  |  |  |\n| 2  |  | 65(20.4)  | 15(17.0)  | 50(21.7)  | <0.001  |  |\n| 3  |  | 41(12.9)  | 15(17.0)  | 26(11.3)  |  |  |\n| 24  |  | 50(15.7)  | 26(29.6)  | 24(10.4)  |  |  |\n\n【9】p-value refers to comparisons between no-TOPFA and TOPFA using a Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables and Chi? test or Fisher's exact test () for categorical variables CASUD： Intermunicipal Community of Southemn Area； CINOR： Intermunicipal Community of Northern Reunion； CIREST： Intermunicipal Community of Eastern Reunion； CIVIS： Intermunicipal Community of the Solidarity Cities： 95% Cl： 95% Confidence Interval； DS： Down Syndrome， IQR： Interquartile Range， ORa： Adjusted Odds Ratio；PDN： Prenatal Diagnosis； REMACOR： Reunion Registry of Congenital Malformations； TCO： West Coast Territory； TOPFA： Termination of Pregnancy for Fetal Abnormality (ORa=0.69； CI 95%：(0.82).\n\n【10】Results\n\n【11】Between 2002 and 2015， 404 DS were registered in the REMACOR database. Among these 404 DS cases， 83 did not have a PDN， resulting in 82 live births and 1 fetal death. Thus， 321 DS with PDN were included in the study. Among them， 232 women (72.3%) chose to Terminate Their Pregnancy (TOPFA). Results are presented in Table 1. In the Reunionese population，TOPFA was associated with early gestational age at DS diagnosis (ORa=0.89；CI95%： (0.95)， higher maternal age at delivery (ORa=1.06； CI95%：(1.11)，living in the CINOR compared to the CIVIS intermunicipal community(ORa=0.43； CI 95%：(0.96)，and having fewer previous live births\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】On Reunion Island， approximately three-quarters of women chose to terminate their pregnancy when DS was diagnosed， which is close to the rate observed in England and the Netherlands but verylow compared to mainland France . Factors associated with TOPFA in our population were very similar to those reported in the literature. Our results highlight that the mother's place of residence has an impact on TOPFA in Reunion Island. However， we believe that the information delivered during prenatal and preconceptional genetic counseling is performed identically between the two physical sites (north and south) ofthe island's university hospital， because these two entities are part of the same hospital center that uses homogeneous procedures， regardless of the physical site of the institution. On the other hand， the north of the island， which includes the island's capital(Saint Denis)， has many jobs in the tertiary sector， whereas the south of the island is much more marked by jobs in the primary sector(agriculture) and the active practice of ancestral cultural traditions. Thus， the CIVIS territory is marked by a high level of precarity， which indirectly highlights the influence of socioeconomic level on the TOPFA . Other variables such as ethnicity， religion， support network， perceived family approval， and perceived burden of care would be interesting to explore， although they are not collected in the registry. In fact， solidarity within Creole families and high religiosity may promote the acceptance of a child with DS in Reunion Island. However，quantitative studies do not explain decision-making， which is a complex， multifactorial， and individualized process， nor do they explore why and how certain factors are important and may have different meanings in different contexts. For this reason， we intend to conduct a qualitative study of couples to explore their reasons and motivations for not undergoing a TOPFA .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:15:00", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:15:31", "cost": 31.349}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:47", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:15:30", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:59"}

The extent of damage caused depends on the type firearm， bullet used， velocity& trajectory. Management can range from observation and local wound care to urgent surgical intervention. We report a case of a 19 year male patient with thoracic gunshot injury sustained over the left side of chest and presented in state of shock， hypoxia with altered mental status and his successful management using ATLS protocols and one lung ventilation using single lumen tube intubation， fluid resuscitation， ICD insertion and other supportive measures.\n\n【2】Keywords： Thoracic gunshot wound； One lung ventilation； Traumatic hemopneumothorax； ICD placement\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Gunshot injuries occur when someone is shot by a projectile object from a firearm. Thoracic gunshot injury is amongst the most fatal form of chest injury leading to high number of deaths worldwide. Campbell et al.  found 94% patients with penetrating thoracic injury die before reaching the hospital. Immediate management of these patients is the most important for survival of these patients. Clinical presentation may differ and so does the treatment plan. The risk of injury to heart， greater blood vessels and the lungs should be evaluated immediately in all patients and surgical intervention should never be delayed.\n\n【5】Objective\n\n【6】Managing a gunshot injury to left lung in ED by one lung ventilation using a single lumen tube.\n\n【7】Methodology\n\n【8】ATLS guidelines， one lung ventilation， ICD placement. One Lung Ventilation (OLV) is the term used in thoracic anaesthesia to describe the ability to ventilate one of a patient’s lungs， allowing the other one to collapse.\n\n【9】There are 3 indications for OLV：\n\n【10】1. Improving surgical access\n\n【11】2. Lung protection\n\n【12】3. Intensive Care ventilation\n\n【13】Techniques for OLV-There are 3 devices that can be inserted to achieve one lung ventilation： 1. Double lumen tubes 2. A bronchial blocker 3. Endobronchial intubation， with standard Endo tracheal tube The quickest and easiest way to isolate an individual lung is to introduce a standard endotracheal tube into one of the main bronchi.

There are lot of controversies with the tube size selection， methods of insertion， isolation and confirmation， optimization of FiO. before and during OLV .\n\n【16】Case Presentation\n\n【17】A 19 years old male patient wasbrought to ED with alleged history of firearm injury over left side of chest， having sustained 30 min before arrival. On examination patient was found to be stuporous， hypoxic， hypotensive， tachycardic with signs of hypovolemic shock. A 0.5 cm x 0.5 cm firearm entry wound was found on posterior aspect of left side of chest below the scapula with blood oozing from the wound. Exit wound was over 3 and 4h intercostal space on left side of chest lateral to the sternum. Examination revealed trachea was central， diminished breath sound on left side with few audible rales， rest examination was normal. Case managed as per ATLS guidelines， assisted breathing with Ambu-bag followed by RSI， as blood was spurting from the wound site， the ET was inserted further and pushed into the right main bronchus and the placement was confirmed bedside by auscultation， waveform capnography and one lung ventilation was given to prevent the unaffected lung from getting contaminated with blood.\n\n【18】He was resuscitated with IV fluids， CT chest revealed Hemopneumothorax and ET in right main bronchus ， thus ICD was placed on left side of chest with 400 ml of blood drained. Patient received antifibrinolytic to control bleeding. He was further treated with antibiotics and other supportive care. The ET tube was repositioned 4 h later . He responded well to resuscitation and his ICU stay was uneventful， extubated on 4h day and had a near complete recovery.\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】Successful management of thoracic gunshot injury depends on identification of danger signs， proper resuscitative measures， timely intervention and use of one lung ventilation in patient where only one lung is affected and to protect the normal lung. Immediate ICD placement， volume restoration and blood transfusion whenever necessary. Use of antifibrinolytics， antibiotics， analgesics forms the mainstay of supportive care . We found that in this case the recovery was good without any adverse effect on the diseased lung with the use of onelung ventilation. This method of blindly intubating one lung can be adopted for an isolated injury to left lung where right lung is unaffected& may provide better outcomes in centres located peripherally or lacking advanced interventional procedures.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:44:45", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:44:56", "cost": 10.63}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:47", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:44:56", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:44:45"}

Their most common symptoms are unilateral nasal obstruction， rhinorrhea and nasal bleeding.

In this report we present a case of a large antrochoanal polyp mistaken for a nasal carcinoma.\n\n【2】Case Report： A 52-year-old women was admitted to the clinic because of a tumor in the left nasal cavity. Her symptoms were nasal obstruction， nasal bleeding and cachexia. On examination a fragile mass in the left nasal cavity was found which was confirmed by nasal endoscopy. The CT scan showed a hypo-attenuating mass filling the nasal cavity with a marginal bone destruction. Several biopsies did not allow for making a diagnosis.

Once they reach the natural sinus ostium they may protrude to the nasal meatus. Usually， the growth of antrochoanal polyps causes a destruction of a medial wall of a maxillary sinus. As a consequence， an additional ostium of a maxillary sinus develops and a polypoid mass may be found in a nasal cavity . Most common symptoms are unilateral nasal obstruction， rhinorrhea， nasal bleeding， dyspnea， dysphagia， obstructive sleep apnea， nasal speech and even cachexia . Antrochoanal polyps represent 4% to 6% of all nasal polyps and usually respond well to a surgical treatment . Although benign， these lesions may sometimes be taken for malignant tumors due to their unusual presentation. In this report we present a case of an unusuallylarge antrochoanal polyp which was mistaken for a nasal carcinoma. A false diagnosis despite findings suggesting an opposite and eventuallyleading to a different treatment plan is an example of an anchoring bias .\n\n【7】A 52-year-old Caucasian women was seen in a Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic of the National Institute of Oncology in Warsaw with a six-month history of a left-sided nasal obstruction. Other symptoms reported were rhinorrhea， odynophagia， nasal speech，left-sided headache and cachexia. Her past medical history was not significant for tobacco use. On examination with a nasal speculum a fragile soft-tissue large polypoid mass in the left nasal cavity was found. It was causing nasal septum deviation and an enlargement of a left nasal cavity. On pharyngoscopy it was noticed that the mass was hanging from the nasopharynx to the meso-pharynxlevel. Nasal endoscopy revealed a mass coming from the left nasal cavity passing to the nasopharynx and partially oropharynx . A computed tomography showed a large hypo-attenuating mass filling the left nasal cavity， left maxillary sinus， left frontal sinus and sphenoid sinus what is presented on Figure 2. A marginal bone destruction was seen but no regional metastases were noticed. Histopathological findings of several biopsies conducted during fiberoscopy revealed inflammatory cells and fibrosis. Subsequently， the procedure of the open biopsy under general anesthesia was performed as the previous histopathological results were uncertain. Due to the strong suspicion of a cancerous diagnosis as well as the bone destruction displayed on CT scan， an access through a lateral rhinotomy was used. Once the intranasal component of the mass was removed， the contents of a maxillary sinus were excised through the sinus ostium. Following this， the nasopharyngeal portion of the mass was excised through the oral cavity access. Once a homeostasis was achieved， a nasal pack consisting of cotton gauze was placed in the nasal cavity and removed two days after the surgery. Histological results of a sample examined postoperatively supported the diagnosis of antrochoanal polyp instead of a nasal carcinoma. Four days after the procedure there was a wound infection as well as nasal bleeding occurred. The patient was given antibiotics and the bleeding stopped as the nasal tamponade was made. Subsequently， the patient was discharged home on the seventh day after the procedure without nasal packing and with antibiotic regimen to proceed with a couple of days after the discharge. Eventually， the patient's recovery was satisfactory as she experienced a relief of her nasal obstruction.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Anchoring bias refers to physician tendency to prioritize medical findings that support their initial diagnosis although the first impression is wrong. Similarly， a confirmation bias occurs once a medical practitioner refuses to take alternative diagnoses into consideration when the first diagnosis is already made despite contradicting data. The presented case is an example of an anchoring bias which led to the incorrect diagnosis and inappropriate treatment plan. The Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS) remains a gold standard procedure of nasal polyps and should have been considered as a first line treatment. Nevertheless， this patient underwent a lateral rhinotomy as the suspicion of a cancerous diagnosis was almost certain . Some of the patient’s symptoms such as one-sided nasal mass， nasal bleeding and cachexia caused by dysphagia were those incentives that resulted in performing an open biopsy instead of an endoscopic surgery at first. Although rare， nasal polyps may easily mimic cancerous nasal tumors especially when they are large. While characteristic for malignant tumors a marginal bone destruction is also common for ACP. In this case scenario in addition to the CT scan other investigations such as PET scan or MRI should have been performed. Those steps would have probably ruled out a cancerous origin of a tumor and would have pointed to a correct diagnosis.\n\n【10】Frosini et al. indicate that ACP may sometimes display pseudosarcomatous features and maylead to weight loss and cachexia. It should also be distinguished from other bone destroying tumors such as lymphoma， rhabdomyosarcoma or Wegener granulomatosis. It seems that dealing with malignant tumors on a daily basis keeps the doctors alert but it can also rarely cause a false assumption. Steps must be taken to avoid this way of thinking as maintaining one's in itial impression despite evidence pointing to a different disease increases a risk of unnecessary procedures and patient’s complications as well An algorithm of detailed physical exam followed by endoscopic exam and CT scan together with MRI or PET scan should be performed always when there is a suspicion of malignancy. In this case several non-diagnostic biopsies of the nasal tumor and the lack of PET scan or MRI due to the strong conviction of malignancy based on CT scan have eventually resulted in the open biopsy procedure although endoscopic surgery is the first line treatment. Scheduling this patient to the open biopsy procedure put her in the risk of suffering from serious complications such as bleeding， face deformation and wound infection as well. It appears obvious that if the above-mentioned tests had been conducted the patient health would have not been jeopardized.\n\n【11】Conclusion\n\n【12】While nasal polyps are quite common and benign findings， antrochoanal polyps account for only 4% to 6% of them. FESS remains a gold standard treatment of nasal polyps. However， bone destruction， nasal bleeding and cachexia caused by large masses in nasal cavities may suggest a cancerous origin of a tumor. A detailed assessment including physical exam， endoscopic exam and PET scan or at least MRI should be performed to dispel doubts about the origin ofa tumor. Sticking to an initial diagnosis despite findings pointing to a different disease may lead to the unnecessary procedures associated with severe complications.

It presents as transudativepleural effusion， in the absence of pleural or cardiopulmonarypathology. The occurrence of hepatic hydrothorax is mainly due to presence of defect at the diaphragm， which leads to passage of the ascitic fluid into pleural cavity via this pleural-peritoneal communication. Management of hepatic hydrothorax include conservative measures such as dietary salt restriction and diuretics； as well as surgical interventions such as Transjugular Intrahepatic Portal Systemic Shunt (TIPS)，liver transplant， and surgical repair of the diaphragmatic defect by doing Videothoracoscopy (VATS). We illustrate a case ofhepatic hydrothorax due to autoimmune hepatitis and its successful treatment by conservative measures.\n\n【2】Keywords： Hepatic hydrothorax； Liver cirrhosis； Pleural effusion； Ascites\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Hepatic hydrothorax presents with transudative pleural effusion， commonly with an effusion of more than 500 ml. It is associated with liver cirrhosis without any pleural or cardiopulmonary disease. It is a rare complication of liver cirrhosis due to portal hypertension with a prevalence of 4% to 12% among patients with liver cirrhosis . Most of the hepatic hydrothorax located at right sided which is about 85% of the cases， rarely occurred at left sided which is about 13%， and the remaining 2% occur bilaterally . Here， we illustrate a case of hepatic hydrothorax and our treatment experience.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 65-years-old lady presented with progressively worsening dyspnea and abdominal distention for 1 month. Clinically， she had a right sided pleural effusion and ascities. Chest radiography showed a right sided massive pleural effusion and diagnostic thoracocentesis was performed. Pleural fluid analysis showed a transudative picture based on total protein of 20 g/L and LDH 87U/L； and the peritoneal fluid analysis showed a Serum-Albumin-Ascites-Gradient (SAAG) of 1.6 g/dl. An abdomen ultrasound showed a cirrhotic liver with ascites. She had a Child-Pugh score B on her liver function test and clinical presentation. Her viral hepatitis screening was negative. Other chronic liver disease work-up had been sent tolook for the etiology of her liver cirrhosis. Her serum Anti-Smooth Muscle Antibody was positive with a raised of Immunoglobulin Glevel 33.12 g/L. Her anti-mitochondrial antibody and anti-liver-kidney-muscle antibody were negative. Other workup such as serum ferritin， thyroid function test， Wilson disease screenings were normal. Computed tomography of thorax did not show any evidence of mediastinal or lung mass. Echocardiogram showedpreserved left ventricle systolic function without any valvular abnormalities. An Oesophago-Gastro-Duodenoscopy (OGDS) done showed a grade 2 esophageal varices with no sign of recent hemorrhage. She had recurrent hospitalization due to her right sided pleural effusion and had multiple thoracocentesis performed for symptomatic relief in three-month duration. Hence， right sided hepatichydrothorax was suspected due to recurrent pleural fluid accumulation and the pleural fluid analysis persistently showed transudative picture. A peritoneal scintigraphy was arranged in order to confirm with our diagnosis. It was performed by injecting 5.03 mCi Technetium-99labeled macro aggregated albumin (99mTc MAA) to the peritoneal cavity. The results showed there was an increased uptake of radio-tracer in her right lung within 5 min after the tracer injected into her peritoneal cavity and we concluded that there was a right sided pleuro-peritoneal communication. She had been managed with low salt diet and optimization of her diuretics. Steroid was not initiated in view of her imaging scan showed a cirrhotic liver and her aminotransferase level was within normal limit. Liver transplants option had been discussed with her， however she was not keen for it. Fortunately， she remains asymptomatic for the past 1 year and a recent chest radiography showed her right sided pleural effusion has improved .\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Hepatichydrothorax is one ofthe rare complications occurs inliver cirrhosis. The exact mechanism of hepatic hydrothorax is unknown. However， it believes that presence of the defect at the diaphragmatic muscles causing the fluid travel across the diaphragm from peritoneal cavity to thoracic cavity. During inspiration， the intrapleural pressure will become negative and there will be increasing of intraabdominal pressure， causing the free fluid being ‘sucked' into the pleural cavity. Normally， patients with chronic liver disease who have ascites may remain asymptomatic as peritoneal cavity can contain up to 10L of the fluid. In patient with hepatic hydrothorax， patient tends to become symptomatic such as dyspnea or pleuritic chest pain even the fluid is as minimal as 500 mls in the pleural cavity. Treatment of hepatic hydrothorax involves multidisciplinary approach. Restriction of salt in daily dietary intake and optimization of diuretics become the initial treatment of hepatic hydrothorax. The diuretic regimes consist of oral Frusemide 40 mg once a day with oral Spironolactone100 mg once a day and titrate up accordingly. However， there are about 25% of the patients remain symptomatic with refractorypleural effusion despite optimal medical therapy given . Hence， liver transplant should be considered as the next treatment option and it is the definitive treatment for hepatic hydrothorax. In reality， especially in Malaysia， liver transplantation is limited and most of the patients might not a suitable candidate to undergo this major operation. Next treatment modality will be Transjugular Intrahepatic Portal Systemic Shunt (TIPS). A study done by Rossle et al.  total of 60patients with refractory hydrothorax were randomized to either TIPS or repeated thoracocentesis. The follow up outcome showed that those who received TIPS procedure have a better survival rate . Besides repeatedly large-volume thoracocentesis， another alternative treatment is surgical repair by doing Videothoracoscopy (VATS) to close the defect in the diaphragm muscles. In a study done by Milanez et al. ， there were 18 patients undergone VATS to repair the defect， the mean hospital stay was 15 days and the mortality rate was 30%within 3 months post procedure. Pleurodesis remains the last resort of the treatment for refractory hydrothorax. A total of 189 patients in11 case series were subjected to pleurodesis， the overall success rate was only 50% with the mean chest tube drainage duration of 9 days.\n\n【9】Conclusion\n\n【10】Hepatic hydrothorax is a rare complication of liver cirrhosis where the treatment is similar to ascites treatment. In suitable candidates，liver transplantation should be offered.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:32:25", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:32:33", "cost": 8.28}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:47", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:32:33", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:32:24"}

Histological investigation has revealed that it becomes integrated into the aortic adventitia thus providing additional strength. This procedure has been performed in 325patients worldwide. Our centers established a PEARS program in 2016 and have undertaken 14cases to date. We report an iatrogenic aortic dissection at the right coronary ostium in case 9 in our series in a patient with Elhers Danlos. We herein report this case to assist other centers considering PEARS and to disclose the important learning points encountered through our experience.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Personalized External Aortic Root Support (PEARS) is a novel technique designed to prevent aneurysmal dilation and subsequent dissection of the root and ascending aorta in patients with connective tissue disorders. A3D printed model ofthe patients aorticroot is created from Computed Tomography (CT)images and an individualized polyethylene terephthalate mesh sleeve constructed to intimately fit the patient’s aortic contours . The size can be individually specified and as a default， 100% and 95% stents are supplied for each patient. Performed via a median sternotomy， the PEARS is placed around the aortic root and ascending aorta after off-pump dissection of the aortic root down to the valve annulus and underneath the coronary arteries with two defects to accommodate the coronary ostia and preserve flow . It is reconstituted by a combination of continuous and interrupted sutures with typically 4/0 Ethibond (Ethicon). Animal studies suggest the mesh subsequently incorporates into the aortic wall to both thicken it and prevent any further aneurysmal change . Compared with the traditional treatment； aortic root replacement， proposed benefits of PEARS include avoidance of lifelong anticoagulation in the case of a mechanical aortic valve implantation or fear of failure with valve conserving surgery . The majority of PEARS to date have been carried out on patients with Marfan syndrome and a paucity of data regarding other connective tissue disorders exists .\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 34-year-oldfemale with Loeys Dietz Syndrome (LDS) SMAD3 variant was referred for PEARS. She had a family history of sudden death in two young relatives two generations removed. Her daughter was found to carry the same genetic variant. Clinical examination demonstrated tall stature， bifid uvula， arachnodactyly and skin striae. Cardiac gated Computed Tomography(CT) of the aorta demonstrated aortic root dilation， 4.5 cm with normal coronary anatomy and a right dominant circulation . The patient was counseled regarding operative options including valve sparing root replacement， a Bentall and a PEARS and chose to undergo PEARS. The procedure was performed via using the 100% pears graft. Sternal closure resulted in ST changes in the inferior leads and hypotension. The sternum was reopened and a series of radial cuts in the Right Coronary Artery (RCA) orifice made to ensure no compression was occurring. A small bleb-like hematoma was noted to arise from the anterior aspect of the proximal RCA at this time. The patient entered ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest requiring cardioversion three times then stabilized. Closure was achieved and she was transferred to intensive care in a stable condition. CT on day one post-surgery demonstrated a small pseudoaneurysm close to the ostium of the RCA. The patient was recovering well and planned for discharge home when a further CT was a right coronary artery pseudoaneurysm. Left main stem is widely patent. performed on day six which demonstrated a significant pericardial effusion and pseudoaneurysm of the right coronary measuring 3 cm x3 cm .\n\n【6】Urgent reoperation was undertaken. A large amount of blood was drained from the pericardial cavity. Cardiopulmonary bypass was instituted and following cross-clamp and arrest a localized dissection identified at the site of concern on the RCA . The RCA was divided from the aorta and a pericardial patch applied with double layer 4-0 and 5-0 proline sutures used to cover the ostial defect. A section of the unused 95% PEARS graft was then taken to patch the defect in the original PEARS graft. Right Internal Mammary Artery (RIMA) was harvested and anastomosed to the mid RCA using 7-0proline. The patient weaned from bypass without difficulty and made an uncomplicated recovery. She represented three weeks post-surgery with chest wall pain and was investigated. Cardiac investigations were normal and a further CT confirmed the RIMA-RCA graft was patent. She remains well on most recent follow up at one year.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】PEARS are a novel procedure and experience in patients with connective tissue diseases affecting the aortic root other than Marfan syndrome is limited. One previously documented PEARS case had a ventricular fibrillation arrest in intensive care and the emergency team released the closing sutures thus allowing restoration of output. Coronary complications are recognized with PEARS but this case is the first reported localized aortic dissection. As a result， there is a number of learning points the authors feel are of value.\n\n【9】Firstly， the case confirms existing knowledge regarding tissue integrity in LDS is fragile and represents an aggressive and problematic issue peri-operatively . LDS is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder characterized by aortic aneurysm， arterial tortuosity， hypertelorism and bifid uvula/cleft palate. The TGF-B super family mediates normal cellular growth and development. Derangement in LDS results in elastin disarray， loss of elastic fiber architecture and increased collagen expression in the arterial wall . Significant consideration was given at the time of surgery to suture repair of the small hematoma arising from the right coronary artery. On balance it was felt this would likely result in further problems as there was no active bleeding from the site at that time. A case report describing a right coronary artery dehiscence and resultant pseudo-aneurysm arising in a patient with two successive aortic root replacements first for root enlargement and then for left coronary pseudo-aneurysm and dehiscence has been described . This confirms the tissue fragility and proclivity for dissection and aneurysmal change in LDS. We made every reasonable effort to avoid applying the aortic cross clamp but ultimately felt this was unavoidable and did so with a larger broader clamp than usual. We elected to carry out a RIMA to RCA graft with closure of the RCA ostium by patching the aorta with autologous pericardium supported by a patch of PEARS as it was not felt possible to preserve the native vessel due to the degree of damage to the coronary arterial wall.\n\n【10】Authors suggest that the index of suspicion of coronary issues must be high in patients with connective tissue disorders undergoing PEARS especially in the setting of cardiac arrhythmia post procedure. The decision to undertake the second CT scan was based purely on suspicion as opposed to anyclearclinical indication. These patients are typically young and will have significant capacity for hemodynamic compensation in the context of a significant pericardial effusion. The patient was preparing for discharge and had in no way demonstrated clinical symptoms resultant from her pericardial hematoma and coronary disruption. There are currently no guideline documents pertaining to follow up imaging in the PEARS cohort， which is an issue that should be addressed going forward.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:51:58", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:55:34", "cost": 215.954}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:47", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:55:34", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:51:58"}

Most victims of foreign body aspiration are older infants and toddlers. Children <3 yr age account for 73% of cases. One third ofaspirated objects are nuts， particularly peanuts. Fragments of raw carrot， apple， dried beans， popcorn， and sunflower or watermelon seeds are also aspirated， as are small toys or toy parts. The most serious complication offoreign body aspiration is complete obstruction of the airway. Globular or round food objects such as hotdogs， grapes， nuts，and candies are the most frequent offen ders .\n\n【7】Impaction of foreign bodies in the upper digestive tract is a very severe pathologic condition that occurs in ear， nose， and throat practice and is particularlycommon in children， and psychiatric patients. Commonly found objects include fish bones， dental prostheses， coins， and needles. The first step of patient assessment are to recognize the type ofobject， its exact location in the gastrointestinal tract， the presence of any complications that associated with foreign body， and the presence of any underlying esophageal conditions . Palatal masses in infants are very rare； the differential diagnose includes： leukemic infiltrates， eosinophilic granuloma， congenital lipomas， and melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy， sarcomas， and other malignancies that occur in palate. Foreign bodies should also be included in the differential diagnosis of palatal masses in the infant and may be more usual than pathogenic lesions only 12 cases of foreign body in the hard palate was reported. The presence of a foreign body in the infant and neonatal palates is rare and among them one case of foreign body had been reported in the palate of 9 months baby .\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A nine month old female child was admitted to hospital with hard plate Lesion. At first palate lesion was recognized with the child's mother and she was referred to a physician in the city of Sabzevar (North east of Iran) and he referred patient to a pediatric surgeon with suspected to palate Tiimor.\n\n【10】The surgeon was requested CT for her. CT report lesion size was 1.85 ×1.05×0.63 that was covered by a thin bony structural lesion and is localized in the anterior ofhard palate in the midline. The area was covered with soft tissue. Bubbles of air were inside the lesion. Destructive bone lesions were not seen and lesions were associated with oral cavity. Follow up study was recommended in CT report .\n\n【11】The surgeon recommended biopsy and surgery. The infant was referred to a neonatologist for consultation.\n\n【12】There werent any problems in the past medical history， pregnancy， delivery and the neonatal period. Child's weight at birth was 3，200g. The child was used breast feeding Iron and multivitamin and used supplementary food from 5 months of old. The child's immunization was complete. In examination baby weight was 8，500g， head 44/5 cm and height was 73 cm. Review of system was normal. Dimensions of mass in the oral cavity examination were 2.5 cmx0.5 cm in the anterior midline of the palate. It was Yellow in color and hard consistency on palpation and not removable. Wound wasn’t seen in location of foreign body. The differential diagnosis we noticed was included foreign body， such as a candy， congenital or malignant tumors， of the oral cavity. Noticed to the first differential diagnosis patient was sent home and asked parent to come back tomorrow. After attending in the next day mass was in the same size and at the same location. On mass reexamination there was removed with a little pressure. Which was pistachio shell with little bleeding occurred in the location of the lesion that stopped soon . And the child was discharged from clinic.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Foreign bodies in the hard palate are uncommon findings but must be noticed as differential diagnosis of palatal lesions especially in children. Various things reported as foreign body include candy nut shells， clothing buttons， rubber， screw head and false fingernails. There was a similar case report in Indian， a nine month old female child admitted to hospital with history of a chronic ulcer over the hard palate， which was noticed incidentally by parents three months back. Patient was admitted for biopsy under general anesthesia， after scrapping the lesion and removal of slough， foreign body was seen imbedded into the tissue with granulations covering the edges， it was a circular transparent plastic disc (Bindi) used by Indian woman on forehead but in our case there wasn’t non healing ulcer on location and in our case with good physical examination we could save child from operation and general anesthesia . Another case report was from college of medicine the University of Illinois at Chicago， USA was about a 10-month-old male infant presented with an asymptomatic mass of the anterior hard palate. And look like our patient the lesion appeared suddenly approximately six weeks before the visit. The infant was sent to the operating room for an incision biopsy but he was lucky because similar to our patient before making an incision they could recognized， a periosteal elevator was used to palpate the lesion.

Once removed， it was clear that the lesion was a foreign body (fingernail) because the mother frequently allowing the infant to suck on her fingers and she loosed a fingernail. Two weeks later another case was about the impaction of a plastic screw head cap in the palate of an infant in Great Britain .

TAIRS is often caused by mutations in the INSR gene， which leads to insulin receptor dysfunction . The condition usually presents at post puberty and is characterized by insulin resistance， acanthosis nigricans and hyperandrogenism， but without obesity or lipodystrophy. A number of different mutations in the insulin receptor gene have been reported in patients with TAIRS. Although this syndrome is inherited as autosomal recessive traits， a clear correlation between genotype and phenotype has not yet been established.\n\n【5】In this report， we describe a girl who presented with severe acanthosis nigricans， along with high levels of fasting insulin with normal plasma glucose， suggested severe insulin resistance. An INSR mutation  was identified in the proband and his father， grandfather and little aunt. Interestingly， her family members shared the same mutation but showed different clinical course.\n\n【6】The proband， a girl of 12 years old， was referred to our hospital because of acanthosis nigricans and hirsutism more than 11 years and change voice for 4 months. She was born with birth weight of 2，650 g (-1.65 SDS)， without significant past medical or developmental concerns. The parents are Chinese and nonconsanguineous. With age， hirsutism and acanthosis nigricans were more pronounced. Her pubic hair appeared and increased rapidly eight months ago and began to change voice 4 months ago. No symptoms of polydipsia and polyuria. At presentation， she was not obese， but showed severe skin pigmentation and hirsutism. She also existed acanthosis nigricans at the neck and axilla. Pigmented spots were seen on the lateral side oftheleft thigh and the rightlower abdomen. Body Mass Index (BMI) was 16.21 kg/m² (height 149 cm and weight 36 kg)， Blood Pressure was119/78 mmHg. Her breasts were Turner 4 and pubic hair was Tanner 4. Laboratory tests revealed the following； Hemoglobin A1C(HbA1C)，6.9%(normal： <6.3%)；Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) 4.3mmol/L； serum insulin 258.9 mIU/L； C-peptide 3.47 ng/mL；Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) and insulin， c peptide release test suggested that children with diabetes and severe hyperinsulinemia (insulin resistance) . Islet associated autoantibodies were absent. Urine testing showed no ketonuria， proteinuria or glucosuria. Blood routine， blood gas analysis， thyroid function， liver function， Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG) were normal. Her serum levels of cortisol， adrenocorticotropic hormone， growth hormone and prolactin were normal. Gonadotropin baseline values， including Luteinizing Hormone (LH)， Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH)， and Estradiol (E2) are normal levels. Testosterone (T)， 128.7 ng/dl； Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate (DHEAS)， 76.45 ug/ml； Androstenedione， 5.03 ng/ml were significantly higher than girls of the same age. Bone age is about 13 years old. Pelvic ultrasound showed the size of uterus is about 3.3 cm’x2.1 cm’×3.0 cm'，and the thickness of endometrium is about 0.5 cm； the left ovary is 3.8cm’x2.0 cm×2.8 cm’， the right ovary is 4.2 cm²x 3.1 cm×2.2cm. Ultrasound scan revealed findings of polycystic ovary syndrome(PCOS) with bulky ovaries and small peripheral follicles.\n\n【7】Table 1： OGTT， insulin and C peptide releasing test of proband.\n\n|  | 0 min  | 30 min  | 60 min  | 90 min  | 120 min  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Blood glucose (mmol/L)  | 4.3  | 9.3  | 11.7  | 12.9  | 13  |\n| Insulin (mlU/L)  | 259  | 874.5  | 1219  | >1500  | >1500  |\n| C peptide (ng/mL)  | 3.47  | 9.42  | 13.33  | 18.05  | 18.77  |\n\n【9】Based on the clinical manifestations and laboratory findings of hirsutism， acanthosis， severe insulin resistance， hyperglycemia， hyperandrogenism， we clinically diagnosed TAIRS. We first gave metformin hypoglycemic therapy. As a result of drug-induced diarrhea in patient， we changed to pioglitazone treatment. To controlhyperandrogenism， we administered flutamide tablets. Because of concerns about drug side effects， flutamide was changed to spironolactone. After 6 months of treatment， the patient’s neck acanthosis nigricans and lower voice were better than before. Review fasting blood glucose fluctuation in 3.8 mmol/1~4.0 mmol/l， fasting insulin reduced to 79.5 mIU/L， HbAlc 6.5%. After 9 months of treatment， the child menstruation menarche， but rare and irregular.

At present， the control of blood glucose is stable， but the control of hyperandrogenism is poor.\n\n【10】Consent for genetic investigation was obtained and results confirmed heterozygous c.3614C>T/p.P1205L mutation in INSR gene mutation. The family map shown in Figure 1. The proband’s mother (II-7)， maternal grandfather (I-3)， grandmother (I-4)， uncle(II-9) and half-sisters (III-4， III-6) have no history of diabetes . Her father (II-6) and grandfather (I-1)， with the P1205L mutation， had impaired fasting blood glucose for 4 and 3 years respectively. Older aunt (II-2) has a 10-year history of DM and is currently treated with Metformin and Acarbose. The proband's little aunt (II-3)， a lean 46-year-old woman， also carries the P1205L mutation. Whereas she exhibited an exaggerated increase in serum insulin levels during the OGTT， she manifested neither common clinical features of type A insulin resistance， including dermatologic or gynecologic disorders， nor glucose intolerance . The basic clinical information and blood glucose and insulin values of 6 core family members are shown in Table 2. Father family of three generations all live in Zhejiang Shengzhou rural areas， similar living environment， eating habits and the same way， birth weight in the normal range， with no special hobby.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】The child is adolescent girl with typical clinical manifestations of TAIRS， namely， severe insulin resistance， acanthosis，hairy，polycystic ovary， hyperandrogenism. The detection of INSR gene revealed a heterozygous mutation of c.3614C>T/p.P1205L， and the diagnosis of TAIRS was clear. The Insulin Receptor (IR) is a transmembrane receptor that is activated by insulin， IGF-I， IGF-II and belongs to the large class of tyrosine kinase receptors . Metabolically， Binding of insulin or other ligands to this receptor activates the insulin signaling pathway， which regulates glucose uptake and release， as well as the synthesis and storage of carbohydrates， lipids and protein. The insulin receptor is encoded by a single gene INSR， from which alternate splicing during transcription results in either IR-A or IR-B isoforms . Downstream post-translational events of either isoform result in the formation of a proteolytically cleaved a and B subunit， which upon combination are ultimately capable of homo or hetero-dimerisation to produce the =320 kDa disulfide-linked transmembrane insulin receptor . The binding of ligand to the a-chains of the IR ectodomain induces structural changes within the receptor leading to autophosphorylation of Table 2： Basic clinical information in family members.\n\n|  | Age  | FG (mmol/L)  | 2h PG (mmol/L)  | HbA1C (%)  | FINS (mlU/L)  | CP (ng/ml)  | INSR gene mutation  | Phenotype  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Grandfather  |  | 6.4  |  | 6.2  | 46.5  | ND  |  | IFG  |\n| Father  | 49  | 6.1  | 6.5  | 6.1  | 48  | 1.4  |  | IFG  |\n| Proband  | 12  | 4.3  | 13  | 6.9  | 258.9  | 3.5  |  | DM  |\n| Mother  | 50  | 5.17  | ND  | 6.1  | 8  | 0.9  |  |  |\n| Elder aunt  | 51  | 11.5  | ND  | 8.5  | 7.5  | ND  |  | DM  |\n| Little aunt  | 46  | 4.6  | 5.4  | 5.5  | 32.3  | 1.1  |  |  |\n\n【14】FG： Fasting plasma glucose； 2hPG： 2 hours after OGTT； HbA1C： Glycosylated hemoglobin； FINS： Fasting insulin； IFG： Impaired fasting glucose； CP： C peptide； DM：Diabetes mellitus； ND： Not done. various tyrosine residues within the intracellular TK domain of the B-chain， eventually promoting downstream processes involving blood glucose homeostasis . The Insulin Receptor is a type of tyrosine kinase receptor， in which the binding of an agonistic ligand triggers autophosphorylation of the tyrosine residues. The addition of the phosphate groups generates a binding site for the insulin receptor substrate (IRS-1)， which is subsequently activated via phosphorylation. The activated IRS-1 initiates the signal transduction pathway and binds to phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)， in turn causing its activation.\n\n【15】TAIRS can be expressed as autosomal recessive inheritance or autosomal dominant inheritance . The INSR gene c.3614C>T/p.1205L heterozygous mutation was found in 4 individuals in this family， which was autosomal dominant. The phenotype of heterozygous P1205L differed substantially among the current family members. Although the proband showed hirsutism， acanthosis， severe insulin resistance， and newly discovered diabetes. Her father andgrandfather only presented impaired fasting glucose and relatively mild hyperinsulinemia. In addition， her little aunt did not show insulin resistance after fasting. Takahashi I et al.  consider this difference may be conditioned by heredity and environment. The lifestyle for children has changed over the last few decades in Japan. However， we report that the three generations of the family are living in the rural areas of Zhejiang. Living environment， eating habits and manners are similar. The birth weights were all within the normal range， and no special habits were found. Therefore， it has not been found that living environment and dietary changes are closely related to the differences in clinical phenotypes； this view is not supported.\n\n【16】In this study， we found that the fasting insulin levels of 4individuals with INSR gene c.3614 C>T/p.1205L heterozygous mutation increased， especially in probands. The proband insulin levels (OGTT 0 min， 90 min， and 120 min) were 258.9 mIU/L，>1500mIU/L，and>1500 mIU/L，respectively. Testosterone from the ovaries and body tissues， as well as androgen (DHEAS and androstenedione) from the adrenal reticularis are significantly elevated. She showed severe hairy and black echinoderms. Grandpa and his father's fasting insulin were 46.5 mIU/L and 48.0 mIU/L， and had 3 and 4 years of impaired fasting glucose， respectively. Fasting insulin in little aunt was 32.3 mIU/L and the age was relatively small. All patients with insulin resistance syndrome have hyperinsulinemia . We found that the degree of insulin resistance is closely related to the heterogeneity of the clinical phenotype of the INSR gene mutation. Under the same genetic background and environment， the higher the serum insulin level， the more serious the clinical performance.\n\n【17】Mutations in the insulin receptor gene lead to insulin and its receptor binding disorders， the target organ response to insulin decreased， causing feedback hyperinsulinemia. High insulin levels in turn reducethe synthesis of sex hormone-bindingglobulin in the liver， and at the same time stimulate the synthesis of androgen in ovarian follicle endometrial cells， adrenal glands， and peripheral tissues， resulting in hyperandrogenism. The higher the serum androgen level， the more severe the insulin resistance and metabolic abnormalities. The finding that DHT exposure to cultured islets up-regulates Insl and Ins2 mRNA suggests insulin is a physiological target for DHT and that androgens can directly regulate the transcription of insulin . Therefore， insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism promote each other in the development of disease in TAIRS. Hyperinsulin promotes the synthesis of androgen and metabolic disorders， and high androgen can also promote insulin secretion and increase insulin resistance and metabolic abnormalities， causing a vicious circle. Based on the above view， we treated rosiglitazone， an insulin sensitizer. After treatment， our patient， the level of insulin was significantly decreased， blood glucose was stable， but the level of androgen was not significantly reduced， which was consistent with many other reports . This suggests that the TAIRS induced by the INSR gene mutation may be different from the polycystic ovary syndrome in the metabolic pathways between the insulin resistance and hyperandrogenemia， even if the patients have PCOS.\n\n【18】Management of patients with severe IR should aim to prevent long-term complications from diabetes and reduce the effects of hyperandrogenism . Wei  considered that beta-cell function ultimately deteriorates and patients are at risk of long-term complications of diabetes， although the timeframe is unclear. After treatment， our patient， the level of insulin was significantly decreased， blood glucose was stable，but thelevelofandrogen was not sign ificantly reduced， which is consistent with Wei report . Although many reports suggest that TAIRS can present in early adolescence and is more frequently diagnosed in young adult women with features of hyperandrogenism . However， ourpatients developed clinical manifestations of insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism(pigmentation and hirsutism) in early childhood， which is aggravated during adolescence. Impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes is often asymptomatic and only recognized through subsequent biochemical screening. The presence of severe hyperandrogenism in the non-obese patient should alert pediatricians to consider severe IR as a possible diagnosis. Management of patients with severe IR should aim to preventlong-term complications from diabetes and reduce the effects ofhyperandrogenism . In addition， maintenance of healthy weight and BMI play a significant role in glucose homeostasis .\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】We report a family of TAIRS for the heterozygous mutation in the INSR gene. Although there are also heterozygous mutations in the INSR gene in the four members of the paternallineage， the clinical manifestations are very heterogeneous. Phenotypic heterogeneity correlates with insulin levels. The treatment of hyperandrogenism in children with TAIRS is still difficult. Further study ofthe pathogenesis and metabolic pathways of TAIRS may lead to a new therapeutic target ofhyperandrogenism.\n\n【21】Com peting Interest\n\n【22】The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest relevantto this manuscript.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【21】Com peting Interest\n\n【22】The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest relevantto this manuscript.", "content": "【0】Abstract\n\n【1】Background： Type A Insulin Resistance Syndrome (TAIRS) is a rare genetic disease， mainly caused by insulin receptor defects， characterized by a series of pathophysiological manifestations caused by severe insulin resistance.

Based on the above view， we treated rosiglitazone， an insulin sensitizer. After treatment， our patient， the level of insulin was significantly decreased， blood glucose was stable， but the level of androgen was not significantly reduced， which was consistent with many other reports . This suggests that the TAIRS induced by the INSR gene mutation may be different from the polycystic ovary syndrome in the metabolic pathways between the insulin resistance and hyperandrogenemia， even if the patients have PCOS.\n\n【18】Management of patients with severe IR should aim to prevent long-term complications from diabetes and reduce the effects of hyperandrogenism . Wei  considered that beta-cell function ultimately deteriorates and patients are at risk of long-term complications of diabetes， although the timeframe is unclear. After treatment， our patient， the level of insulin was significantly decreased， blood glucose was stable，but thelevelofandrogen was not sign ificantly reduced， which is consistent with Wei report . Although many reports suggest that TAIRS can present in early adolescence and is more frequently diagnosed in young adult women with features of hyperandrogenism . However， ourpatients developed clinical manifestations of insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism(pigmentation and hirsutism) in early childhood， which is aggravated during adolescence. Impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes is often asymptomatic and only recognized through subsequent biochemical screening. The presence of severe hyperandrogenism in the non-obese patient should alert pediatricians to consider severe IR as a possible diagnosis. Management of patients with severe IR should aim to preventlong-term complications from diabetes and reduce the effects ofhyperandrogenism . In addition， maintenance of healthy weight and BMI play a significant role in glucose homeostasis .\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】We report a family of TAIRS for the heterozygous mutation in the INSR gene. Although there are also heterozygous mutations in the INSR gene in the four members of the paternallineage， the clinical manifestations are very heterogeneous. Phenotypic heterogeneity correlates with insulin levels. The treatment of hyperandrogenism in children with TAIRS is still difficult. Further study ofthe pathogenesis and metabolic pathways of TAIRS may lead to a new therapeutic target ofhyperandrogenism.\n\n【21】Com peting Interest\n\n【22】The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest relevantto this manuscript.", "index": 15469, "show": true, "start": 15469, "end": 15583, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:43:48", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:44:17", "cost": 29.097}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:47", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:44:16", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:43:47"}

Histochemical studies have shown similarities between oncocytes and intercalated duct reserve cells in oxidative enzyme concentrations . Oncocytes can be found in the salivary glands， kidney， thyroid， parathyroid， pituitary， adrenal glands， liver， pancreas， fallopian tubes， testes， stomach， and bronchi . These cells may occur as metaplasia or age related degeneration， or may occur as a lesion in neoplastic or hyperplastic processes . Within the salivary glands， oncocytic lesions can be classified into four groups： 1. Malignant oncocytic tumors， 2. Oncocytic variants of other salivary gland tumors， 3. Oncocytic hyperplasia， 4. Oncocytomas .\n\n【4】Oncocytic variants have been reported in almost all salivary gland tumors， including：mucoepidermoid carcinoma， acinic cell carcinoma， adenoid cystic carcinoma， adenocarcinoma， lipoadenoma， salivary duct carcinoma， and myoepithelioma .\n\n【5】Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma (MEC) is the most common salivary gland malignancy (10% of all major gland tumors)， most commonly found in the parotid gland . MEC arises from salivary gland ducts and is characterized by mucous cells， intermediate cells， and epidermoid(squamoid) cells . Low grade lesions are characterized by cystic spaces with many mucous cells， while high grade lesions are characterized by solid areas of intermediate and epidermoid cells with necrosis and neural involvement . There are many different variants of MEC， including：sebaceous， clear， spindle， melanocytic， goblet， sclerosing， psammomatous， unicystic， and oncocytic.\n\n【6】Oncocytic Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma (OMEC) is a very rare tumor (less than 40 reported cases in the literature) that has been reported in salivary glands (most often parotid) as well as in lacrimal gland， bronchus， palate， neck， and trachea . This tumor is characterized by predominantly oncocytic cells， epidermoid cells， and mucous goblet cells . While there is Table 1： Staining to aid in the diagnosis of OMEC.\n\n| Stain  | Finding  |\n| --- | --- |\n| PTAH  | (+) in oncocytes；  in acinic cell carcinoma  |\n| Alcian blue  | (+) in mucous cells  |\n| Mucicarmine  | (+) in mucous cells  |\n| PAS-D  | (+) in mucous cells  |\n| Anti-mitochondrial ab-1  | (+) in oncocytes  |\n| Anti-S-100  |  in oncocytes  |\n| Anti-vimentin  |  in oncocytes  |\n| Anti-Smooth muscle actin  |  in oncocytes  |\n| p63  | (+) in oncocytes， nuclear positivity in OMEC， peripheral positivity in oncocytoma， oncocytic carcinoma in acinic cell carcinoma， salivary duct carcinoma  |\n| CK 5/6  | (+) in oncocytes  |\n| AE1/AE3  | (+) in mucous cells  |\n| Androgen receptor  | (+) in salivary duct carcinoma  in OMEC  |\n| GATA3  | (+) diffuse staining in salivary duct carcinoma； (+) positive but not diffuse staining in other salivary gland tumors  |\n| SOX10  | (+) in acinic cell， adenoid cystic， epithelial-myoepithelial， myoepithelial carcinomas and pleomorphic adenoma  |\n| GCDFP  | (+) in salivary gland carcinoma  |\n| CK20  | (+) in small cell carcinoma of major salivary glands  |\n| CK903  | (+) in myoepithelial carcinoma  |\n| CK14  | (+) in salivary gland tumors except acinic cell carcinoma  |\n| CK7  | (+) in salivary gland carcinoma  |\n\n【8】no well-defined proportion of oncocytes for making a diagnosis of OMEC vs. MEC with oncocytic metaplasia， a review of previously reported cases finds that almost all authors describe>50% oncocytes when making a diagnosis of OMEC . OMEC usually presents as a low or intermediate grade tumor with a good prognosis . It is unknown if oncocytic differentiation has any effect on prognosis. The age range of reported OMECs is 20 to 80 years， with a slight male predominance . The differential diagnosis of OMEC includes： oncocytosis， oncocytoma， oncocytic carcinoma， Warthin’s tumor， pleomorphic adenoma with oncocytic change， and oncocytic lipoadenoma .\n\n【9】The diagnosis of OMEC can be challenging due to overlapping histological features； distinguishing this tumor from an oncocytoma， oncocytic carcinoma， or other oncocytic neoplasms requires adequate sampling， detailed histologic study， immunohistochemical stains， special stains， and possibly Florescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) testing or Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) .Transmission electron microscopyandimmunoelectron microscopy have also been used . The most important histological feature ofOMEC may be the presence of mucous cells； mucous gland cells can rule out oncocytosis， oncocytoma， and oncocytic carcinoma. Stains that have been used to help diagnose OMEC include：Phosphotungstic Acid Hematoxylin (PTAH)， Alcian blue， antibody to mitochondria AB-1， anti-S-100， anti-vimentin， anti-smooth muscle actin， p63， CK5/6， AE1/AE3， androgen receptor (details listed in . Staining to aid in the diagnosis of OMEC) . The detection of MECT1-MAML2 or CRTC1-MAML  fusion transcript can be identified by RT-PCR or FISH； the presence of a MAML2 translocation can help identify the MEC component of OMEC . The accurate diagnosis of OMEC is important for patient management .\n\n【10】This case report aims to raise awareness of the very rare tumor\n\n【11】OMEC and the different stains that can be used to aid in its diagnosis.\n\n【12】Case Presentation\n\n【13】This was a case of oncocytic mucoepidermoid carcinoma in a 26year old Vietnamese male. The timeline of the patient management is detailed in . Timeline of Events， He initially presented with a painless mass over his left jaw that he first noticed 9 months ago. He denied pain， intermittent swelling， foul taste， paresthesia， facial nerve weakness and redness to the area， exposure to pet cats， travel outside of the country， fever， chills， cough， weight loss， dysphagia， or dyspnea. He was recently diagnosed with essential hypertension. He denied any prior surgeries. He reported no known allergies. He denied any history of cancer in his family. He denied tobacco and alcohol use. His only medication was carvedilol. Review of systems was unremarkable.\n\n【14】On physical exam there was facial asymmetry with left sided facial swelling. There was no erythema. Palpation over the left parotid gland revealed a 3 cm somewhat well-defined mass. There was clear salivary flow from both Stensen’s ducts. The remaining physical exam was unremarkable. A CT soft tissue neck with contrast showed a rounded somewhat ill-defined in homogeneously enhancing mass involving the anterior aspect of the left parotid gland and posterior aspect of the adjacent masseter muscle， measuring 3.9 cm × 3.1cm ×3.6 cm. Multiple nonspecific cervical lymph nodes were also evident including inferior left periparotid nodes， left submandibular nodes， and internal jugular nodes more on the left， all of which demonstrated homogenous density and well-defined margins. An ultrasound guided aspirate biopsy (multiple with 18 gauge needle) of the left parotid mass was performed； the imaging showed an enlarged hyperemic left parotid gland demonstrating multiple solid and single6 mm × 6 mm cystic masses. The biopsy pathology showed lesion cells with no high-grade features identified； complete excision was recommended for further classification.\n\n【15】Table 2： Timeline of Events.\n\n| Date  | Event  | Outcome  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1/14/2019  | Presented to ED for evaluation of painless leftjaw mass for past 9 months  | lmaging ordered  |\n| 1/14/2019  | CT Soft Tissue Neck with Contrast  | 3.9 cm x 3.1 cm x 3.6 cm ill-defined in homageneously enhancing mass along anterior aspectleft parotid gland and posterior aspect of adjacent masseter muscle  |\n| 1/20/2019  | Initial consult with oral & maxillo-facial surgery  | Recommended US guided biopsy of parotid mass  |\n| 1/30/2019  | US guided aspirate biopsy left parotid mass  | Pathology：lesional cells present with no high-grade features identified - recommend completeexcision  |\n| 2/13/2019  | Seen by general surgery clinic  | Complete excision recommended  |\n| 03-01-19  | Left subtotal parotidectomy  | Intraoperative frozen section was not diagnostic for malignancy.  |\n\n【17】Table 3： Immunohistochemical Stains & Special Stains.\n\n| Immunohistochemical/Special Stain  | Result  |\n| --- | --- |\n| CK5/6  | Positive  |\n| CK7  | Positive  |\n| CK14  | Weak positive  |\n| p63  | Diffuse nuclear positivity  |\n| Ki-67  | <10%  |\n| CK903  | Positive  |\n| CK20  | negative  |\n| GCDFP  | Negative  |\n| SOX10  | Negative  |\n| Androgen receptor  | Interpreted as negative  |\n| GATA3  | Interpreted as negative  |\n| PAS-D  | Positive intracytoplasmic globules  |\n| Mucicarmine  | Intracellular positivity in mucocytes  |\n\n【19】The decisionnwas made to proceed with a left subtotal parotidectomy to achieve complete excision. Subcutaneous flaps were made over the parotid capsule and platysma， and the superficial parotid gland was bluntly dissected out. There was a firm， suspicious mass present in the gland which involved the masseter； deeper parotid tissue， en bloc with part of the masseter muscle， was excised in order to remove the suspicious tissue. The facial nerve was identified and preserved， with the exception of the buccal branch， which coursed straight into the lesion. Intraoperative frozen section was not diagnostic for malignancy； neck dissection was not performed.\n\n【20】Materials and Methods\n\n【21】Grossly the specimen was a left parotid gland weighing 65 g and measuring 10 cm x7 cm x2 cm. Sectioning revealed a tan firm lobular mass measuring 4 cm x 3 cm x3 cm that appeared to be partially encapsulated and surrounded by normal appearing parotid parenchyma. Representative sections were sampled and submitted in 17 cassettes， including frozen sections and normal uninvolved parotid gland. Two left parotid lymph nodes were also resected； grossly these appeared as irregularly shaped fragments of tan-brown tissue measuring 1 cmx1 cm x 0.5 cm and 1 cm x 0.3 cm x0.2 cm； each fragment was bisected and submitted in a single cassette.\n\n【22】Results and Discussion\n\n【23】Microscopic examination showed an ill-defined infiltrative tumor composed predominantly of solid sheets and nests. Focal(<20%) areas of the tumor showed cystic and microcystic areas. The tumor cells were predominantly oncocytic characterized by abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm， round nudei， and prominent nucleoli with focal pleomorphism. Scattered monocytes were present.\n\n【24】Mitotic figures were not identified. Intermixed and peripheral chronic inflammations were present； Sialaden itis was present. Focal lymphovascular invasion and perineural invasion were present. Adjacent to the tumor was uninvolved parotid gland tissue and uninvolved fibro connective tissue including skeletal muscle. Results of immunohistochemical stains and special stains performed are detailed in . Immunohistochemical Stains and Special stains. One surgical margin was involved by carcinoma. No metastatic carcinoma was identified in two lymph nodes (0/2). The overall findings supported the diagnosis of mucoepidermoid carcinoma， intermediate grade (modified Healy and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center's grading schemes used)， 4 cm， oncocytic variant； pathologic TMS staging was pT2N0.\n\n【25】Based on the pathologic diagnosis of intermediate grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma， oncocytic variant，pT2N0， the patient will receive cervical neck dissection and radiation therapy， and likely chemotherapy. A rare case of oncocytic mucoepidermoid carcinoma in a 26 year old male was presented. To aid in this diagnosis， the following stains were done： CK5/6， CK7， CK14， p63， Ki-67， CK903， CK20， GCDFP， SOX10， Androgen receptor， GATA3， PAS-D， mucicarmine. The stains CK5/6 and p63 were performed to identify oncocytes. PAS-D and mucicarmine were performed to identify mucin and mucous cells. Androgen receptor and GATA3were performed to rule out salivary duct carcinoma. CK7，CK14，and GCDFP were performed to rule out salivary gland carcinoma. CK20was performed to rule out small cell carcinoma.CK903 wasperformed to rule out myoepithelial carcinoma. SOX-10 was performed to rule out acinic cell， adenoid cystic， epithelial-myoepithelial， myoepithelial carcinomas and pleomorphic adenoma. Ki-67 was performed to evaluate mitotic activity. Based on the histological evaluation and results ofthe immunostains and special stains， the diagnosis ofOMEC was made. In this case it was not necessary to order RT-PCR or FISH to test for MAML2 translocation. However， if the results of staining were equivocal MAML2 testing would have been the next step.\n\n【26】Conclusion\n\n【27】This case report provides a comprehensive list of stains that are useful in the diagnosis of OMEC. The main limitation of this report is that all stains presented were not used in this case； therefore they were not all compared for usefulness in making the diagnosis (stains were chosen based on pathologist preference). The main lessons of this case report are： 1. OMEC is a rare tumor found most commonly in the parotid gland and 2. Although diagnosis can be challenging， the use of proper histological evaluation， immunostains， and special stains can lead to an accurate diagnosis ofOMEC.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:44:17", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:44:43", "cost": 26.617}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:47", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:44:43", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:44:16"}

Pembrolizumab，ahumanizedIgG4monoclonal antibody， binds PD-1 and blocks the interaction of PD1-PDL1 and 2， resulting in enhanced activity of the immune system against tumor cells. Pembrolizumab has shown activity in PMBCL and in some cases of primary and Secondary Central Nervous System (CNS) and testicular lymphomas. We report 4 patients with advanced refractory PMBCL， who were treated with Pembrolizumab and achieved complete remission， 3 patients prior to Autologous Bone Marrow Transplantation(ABMT) and 1 after ABMT relapse with reasonable median remission duration of 13.25 months(range： 8 to 28 months).\n\n【2】Keywords： Primarymediastinal lymphoma； PMBCL； Pembrolizummab； Autologous transplantation\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Primary Mediastinal Large B-Cell Lymphoma (PMBCL) is rather infrequent aggressive lymphoma of thymic origin， shares some clinical， pathologic， and genetic features with classical Hodgkin’s Lymphoma， and accounts for 5 percent of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas . PMBCL is characterized by type 2 T-Helper Cell (TH2)-skewed cytokine profile and constitutive activation of Nuclear Factor kB (NF-kB)， resulting in the inhibition of cytotoxic T lymphocytes via the PD-1-PD-L1 axis .\n\n【5】PD-L1 is expressed in 36% to 100% of PMBCL cases . Chromosome 9p24.1 copy number gains are also frequently detected in PMBCL (29% to 55%) . Though， PD-L2 protein rare in Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL)， it is robustly expressed by most PMBCL cases and is often associated with PDCD1LG2 copy gain ， chromosomal rearrangements involving 9p24.1 were detected in 20% PMBCL samples . The presence of genetic alterations enhances the expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2\n\n【6】Although the majority of newly diagnosed patients can be cured with multiagent chemoimmunotherapy with or without consolidative radiation ， the outcome for patients with relapsed or refractory PMBCL (rrPMBCL) is poor， especially for patients who are ineligible for or relapse after second-line Autologous stem-cell Transplantation (ABMT) . Axicabtagene ciloleucel， anti CD30 immunoconjugate brentuximab vedotin have non-significant activity in PMBCL.\n\n【7】Frequent amplification of 9p24.1 in PMBCL result in an enhanced tumor expression of the Programmed cell Death-1(PD-1) ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2， increase susceptibility of PMBCL to PD-1 blockade. In the phase IB KEYNOTE-013 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier： NCT01953692) on 21 patients with rrPMBCL， and phase II KEYNOTE-170 (ClinicalTrials. gov identifier： NCT02576990) study on 53 patients， the ORR was48% and 45% (CR 33%，18%)， median PFS was 10.4 and 5.5 months and overall survival of 31.4 months and not reached in Keynote 170， respectively . The magnitude of abnormality in the 9p24 region in 42 evaluable patients in keynote 170 trial was associated with PD-L1 expression， which in turn was significantly associated with PFS. Based on keynote 170 study， in June 2018， pembrolizumab was granted accelerated approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) for use in rrPMBCL patients， who have progressed after two or more lines of prior therapy . The activity of PD-1 blockade in classical Hodgkin lymphoma  prompted us to evaluate this approach in rrPMBCL.\n\n| Disease  | Patient 1  | Patient 2  | Patient 3  | Patient 4  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Age， years  | 37  | 43  | 20  | 41  |\n| Female/Male  | M  | M  | F  | F  |\n| B-Symptoms (Yes/No)  | Yes  | Yes  | Yes  | Yes  |\n| Objective response  | Complete remission  | Complete remission  | Complete remission  | Complete remission  |\n| Prior lines of therapy  | 3  | 3  | 5  | 4  |\n| Prior radiation (Yes/No)  | No  | Yes  | Yes  | No  |\n| Prior rituximab (Yes/No)  | Yes  | Yes  | Yes  | Yes  |\n| N of Pembrolizumab cycles  | 6  | 5  | 4  | 5  |\n| Progression-free survival (mo)  | 8.5+  | 8+  | 28+  | 18+  |\n\n【9】Patients，Treatment and Results\n\n【10】Here， we report 4 patients with rrPMBCL， who were treated with Pembrolizumab， a human immunoglobulin G4 monoclonal antibody that targets PD-1 and blocks engagement of the PD-1 ligands. Informed written consent for off-label use of Pembrolizumab was obtained from all 4 patients. This is a consecutive series of 4 patients， from King Hussein Cancer Center-Amman-Jordan between first of August 2016 and 24h of January 2017. Patients details illustrated in Table 1. Median follows up of 13.25 months (range： 8 to 18 months).\n\n【11】The median age at the time ofrecurrent/refractory disease was 39years (range， 20-43)， and the median Karnofsky Performance Status(KPS) was 70% (range， 60 to 90). Four patients had stage IVB disease associated with disease bulk， and pleuropericadial involvement in 2 patients； one patient had thyroid gland and localized bone involvement (T11 vertebrae).\n\n【12】All patients were treated with standard-of-care regimens and had no other available options. All 4 patients were Refractory to First Line Treatment (RCHOP)，andhad multiply recurrent disease； one patient relapsed with diffuse bone and pulmonary involvement. All 4 patients received a median of 4 previous chemotherapy lines (range： 3-5)， 1patient required re-irradiation to mediastinal disease bulk due to recurrent mediastinal disease associated with compressive pulmonary symptoms. Salvage treatments including GDP， ICE， and DHAP chemotherapy regimens. All 4 patients received pembrolizumab at fixed dose of 200 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks at a median of 5 cycles(range： 4-6). All 4 patients had objective response and achieved complete remission at a median of 4 cycles (range： 3-4). Three patients received high dose chemotherapy consolidation (BEAM) conditioning after Pembrolizumab (patients 1-3) and patient 4relapsedafterABMT received salvage Pembrolizumab andplanned for allogeneic Hematopoietic Transplantation (allo-HCT) consolidation. He achieved complete remission and continued in remission at 18months of follow up after the last dose of pembrolizumab.\n\n【13】All 4 patients were symptomatic prior to start of Pembrolizumab. All patients improved clinically with improved KPS. Objective metabolic and radiological responses (PET-CT) to treatment with Pembrolizumab were achieved in 4 patients . Responses were confirmed by PET CT and no disease recurrence identified at last follow up. The median number of pembrolizumab treatments to objective radiographic response was 4 (range， 3-4)， .\n\n【14】The median duration of follow-up was 13.25 months. At last follow up， 3 patients after ABMT were alive and continued in complete metabolic remission at 8+， 5+ and 28+ months； 1 patient who relapsed after ABMT， received 5 doses of pembrolizumab， achieved complete remission， but unfortunately discontinued due to pulmonary toxicity grade 3. He declined allo-HCT fairing of complications. He continued to have complete metabolic remission at 18 months follow up.\n\n【15】Pembrolizumab was well tolerated in 2 patients. The toxicities of pembrolizumab， including grade 2 pneumonitis， that may have exacerbated by previous radiation in 1 (patient 4) with moderate to severe restriction and decreased diffusion capacity， which prompted discontinuation of Pembrolizumab after the fifth cycle and improved with inhalers and steroid treatment； grade 2 fatigue in another patient， both thought to be drug-related. One patient developed thyroiditis-like picture with normal thyroidfunction， which improved spontaneously.\n\n【16】Discussion and Conclusion\n\n【17】Relapsed/refractory PMBCL remains a major unmet need in lymphoma. In this report， 4 patients with primary refractory disease following standard therapies， responded to off-label treatment with pembrolizumab and remain progression-free at a median of 13.25months. Our data supporting reports of others that pembrolizumab is active in rrMBCL and support further investigation of PD-1 blockade in this rare entity.\n\n【18】Contribution\n\n【19】All authors have the concept of the study， Dr. KH collected the data， data analysis， wrote the initial and final typescript. Dr. AA arranged the PET CT images； Dr. OA arranged the CT images. I.M and H.L helped in data curation and draft editing.

Hypercalcemia in RBD is a relatively rare finding， with very few cases reported. Hypercalcemia is likely explained by systemic release of calcium phosphate salts deposited in the muscle following injury. Hypercalcemia can be very severe and symptomatic - as in present case and needs management on an urgent basis-especiallyto prevent arrhythmias and sudden death. It may need giving calcitonin，bisphosphonates， loop diuretics， aggressive hydration or hemodialysis - but is self-limiting， and in majority of casesS-returns to normal within 8 to 10 days.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 25 Year Male patient without any comorbidity presented to emergency ward with complains of excessive nausea， vomiting， reduced appetite， oliguria and bipedal edema since last 4 days. There was no history of fever， flank pain， pyuria， hematuria， periorbital puffiness， any episode of upper respiratory tract infection in recent past， pain in upper or lower limbs. He was a habitual tobacco chewer， but did not have history of intravenous drug abuse and was not on any alternative medications.\n\n【4】General Examination revealed multiple abrasions and contusions over upper and lower back， which -on further probing were found to be due to alleged history of multiple blunt traumas over back- following a local fight.\n\n【5】Routine Laboratory investigations with CPK Total were sent .\n\n【6】Patient was subjected to hemodialysis immediately on admission in view of uremic features and severe acidosis on blood gas analysis. Patient remained anuric till 4h day post admission， with a total of 2 cycles of hemodialysis done till then， after which urine output gradually increased from150 ml/day on 5th day post admission to 3 liters per day by day 15. Electrolytes were sequentially followed - except for serum calcium levels， other electrolytes were normal. There was mild hypokalemia during polyuric phase， which was corrected with oral potassium chloride. Initially there was mild hypocalcemia with S. Calcium of 7.7 mg/dl. By day 10， it was within normal limits9.7 mg/dl. As polyuric phase of AKI progressed， patient began to develop hypercalcemia with S. Calcium reaching a level of 15 mg/dl by day 15， urine output at this time was about 3 liters per day. Serum phosphate levels were normal at 3.8 mg/dl. Intact parathormone levels were appropriately suppressed at this time with value of 17 units/ml.25-Hydroxy Vitamin D was mildly low at 25 ng/ml. Both these reports ruled out possibility of primary hyperparathyroidism or hypervitaminosis D- which as such- was also expected to be the case， as calcium levels were mildly low at the beginning. Considering that the event was quite acute， malignancy also seemed less likely a possibility. Still， workup for multiple myeloma was done -which was negative. CT scan of thorax did not reveal prominent lymphadenopathy or mass lesion in thorax. Ultrasound examination of Whole Abdomen was also normal. One cycle of hemodialysis was done again on day 15 in view of severe symptomatic hypercalcemia and subcutaneous calcitonin and loop diuretics were given， which helped bring back calcium to a level of 10.7 mg/dl on discharge.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is seen in 15% to 50% of cases following Rhabdomyolysis (RBD).\n\n【9】Table 1： Various laboratory parameters and their course during indoor stay.\n\n| Parameters  | S.

Physiologically， ionized calcium levels in sarcoplasm are 10，000times lower than serum ionized calcium， and this is maintained by Ca-ATPase pump in sarcoplasmic reticulum and 2 Na/Ca exchanger on sarcolemma. Both these are energy intensive processes needing ATP for Ca mobilization. In RBD - muscle necrosis/ischemia leads to loss of ATP leading to increased cytosolic calcium in muscle， which triggers activation of cytosolic proteases that denatures muscle proteins and cell membrane leading to release of intracellular phosphate， potassium， myoglobin， creatinine and creatinine kinase.\n\n【13】AKI is likely due to release of these myoglobin's that precipitate in glomerular tubules and form casts that obstruct tubular lumen. Myoglobin also causes direct toxic effect on tubular epithelium， causing tubular necrosis .RBD damages cell membrane of muscles and loss of Na/K ATPase pump-leading to increased permeability to fluids. Shift of large amount of sodium and intravascular fluid leads to muscle edema - which in severe cases can lead to Compartment Syndrome. This further leads to muscle ischemia - worsening the ongoing RBD. Depletion of intravascular volume is another factor leading to AKI .\n\n【14】After RBD， initially there is hypocalcemia during oliguric phase of AKI. This is due to calcium chelation by the released intracellular phosphate. Normally， 85% phosphate is in bones and teeth， 14% is present intracellularly and about 1% is in extracellular fluid . RBD leads to release of large amount of phosphate which forms chelation salt with calcium and gets deposited locally leading to hypocalcemia. During the recovery phase of AKI， these sequestered salts are released back into the systemic circulation. This probably leads to hypercalcemia during polyuric phase. Case reports by Akmal and Bisop  as well as by Zerr and Durand  suggests elevated levels of Vitamin D， probably due to its extra renal production， and poor regulation in its synthesis by kidneys， as likely explanation of hypercalcemia.\n\n【15】Overall， very few cases have been reported with hypercalcemia following RBD and AKI. One of the studies by Olazo and Dolores in 2012 ， as well as another study review by Lisa and Ali Sadjadi， suggested that only about 60 published cases of hypercalcemia following RBD were found till date since 1970. The highest level of hypercalcemia associated with rhabdomyolysis that has been published was 20 mg/dL .\n\n【16】Conclusion\n\n【17】AKI is a common complication of Rhabdomyolysis and in majority of cases， needs supportive treatment and hemodialysis - as and when required. But the present case shows that falling creatinine levels and risingurine output is not the end game. Vigilant monitoring of electrolytes and prompt intervention - especially during polyuric phase - is ofutmost importance. It also shows that - hypercalcemia in such a clinical context - does not need to be over investigated in the initial 8 to 10 days of polyuric phase.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:31:58", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:34:39", "cost": 160.663}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:47", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:34:39", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:31:58"}

However， obesity may aggravate PVT and in duce a high mortality rate. Herein， we present a case of a 66 years old woman with obesity who presented with fever and progressively worsening abdominal pain. Diagnostic workup resulted in Computed Tomography (CT) scan and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) showed PVT extends to the superior mesenteric vein. A diagnosis of PVT was made，and antibiotic as well as anticoagulant were administrated. However， obesity retard the recovery in this patient compare to general patients with normal weight. In addition to presenting risk factors of obesity in PVT， we offer a review of literature and draw important precise mechanisms to assist in the diagnostic workup and treatment of PVT in obesity.\n\n【2】Keywords： Portal Vein Thrombosis (PVT)；Obesity； Abdominal infection\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Portal Vein Thrombosis (PVT) refers to the development of thrombus within the portal vein and can extend to splenic and the superior mesenteric veins. PVT， a well-known complication of cirrhosis， mainly due to rebalance of coagulation-anti-coagulation system and reduction of portal venues velocity (<15 cm/s). Acute PVT in non-cirrhosis patients is of low incidence while with a high mortality. Risk of non-cirrhosis related PVT including inherited gene mutation， like Factor V Leiden or Prothrombin G20210A mutation . Moreover， other causes of intraabdominal inflammation (colitis， pancreatitis， cholecystitis， appendicitis) and myeloproliferative disorders(thrombocythemia， polycythemia Vera， myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia) may as risk factors for PVT development. Obesity， which will cause cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases via induction of atherosclerosis， now has been a public health challenge worldwide . Several studies have observed obesity as a risk factor for venous thromboembolism， abdominal obesity in particular， due to visceral fat accumulation， appears to be a major risk factor for VTE . However， risk of obesity on PVT is still controversial. Here we present a case of portal vein thrombosis in obesity，and review the available mechanisms of obesity involved in PVT.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 66-year-old female presented with persistent mild abdominal pain for 4 days. Four days before her admission， she had mild pain in the right upper abdomen without any obvious cause， accompanied by diarrhea， and passed yellow loose stools twice， accompanied by nausea and vomiting. She took berberine and Montmorillonite powder as symptomatic treatment， but without success. The patient reported aggravated abdominal pain and persistent fever up to 39.3℃ with chills and rigor. For this reason， she was admitted to our hospital.\n\n【7】Her past medical history was one of asthma and hypertension， but her blood pressure was well controlled. On physical examination， the patient is obese with a weight of 78 kg， a height of 158cm， and a BMI of 31.24 kg/m . Abdominal palpation suggests right upper abdominal pain. No enlargement of the liver or spleen was found during inspiration.\n\n【8】Laboratory tests showed an elevated white blood cell count (WBC： 13.75×10/L)，predominantly neutrophils (94.1%)， a marked increase in c-reactive protein (CRP： 286.22 mg/L)， and a marked increase in D-dimer concentration (D-D， 18.64 ug/ml). Liver and kidney function tests showed no significant abnormalities (AST 44 U/L， ALT 56 U/L， BUN 8.32 mmol/L， creatinine 99 umol/L). Fast serum glucose test of 6.5 mmol/L indicated impaired fasting glucose. Serology tests for hepatitis A，\n\n| Table 1： Summary of clinical features of acute PVT reported.  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Reference  | Age  | Gender  | Past medical historyirisk factor  | Clinical presentation  | CECT findings  |\n| Cecchini et al.   | 45  | Female  | Hereditary spherocytosis status post remote splenectomy，gastroesophagealreflux disease， abstructive sleep apnea， nonalcoholic steatohepatitis，hypertensian， previous cholecystectomy，and morbid obesity  | Severe abdominal pain，nausea，vomiting，  | A complex loculated fluid callection withscattered air pockets and thrombosis ina branch of the superior mesenteric veinfound in a surgical specimen.  |\n| Shirai et al.  | 22  | Male  | Acute pancreatitis.  | Abdominalpain  | Massive PVT extending to the SV andSMV.edematous thickening of the intestinal wall with bloody ascites.  |\n| Shirai et al.   | 48  | Male  | No significantpast illness  | Abdominal pain andnausea  | PVT extending ta the SMV and SV，edematous thickening of the intestinalwall with bloody ascites.  |\n| Martin et al.  | 44  | Female  | Irritable bowel syndrome， hypertension，hyperlipidemia， abstructivesleep apnea， and anxiety， MTHFR A1298Cpolymorphism  | Abdominal pain， diarrhea，nausea， and anorexia  | An acute right portal vein thrombasisthat was likely occlusive， with partial thrombosis of the left portal vein andmain portal vein.  |\n| Shyam et al.   | 35  | Male  | Alcohol-associated pancreatitis  | Epigastric pain withintermittent fever  | Multiple microabscesses in the left lobeof the liver with portal vein thrambasisextending inta the splenic and superiormesenteric vein.  |\n| Shyam et al.   | 60  | Male  | Alcohol-associated pancreatitis  | Epigastric pain， fever andloss of appetite  | A small microabscess in the right lobe of the liver and portal vein thrombosisextending into the spleen and superiormesenteric vein.  |\n| Kalbitz et al.  | 60  | Male  | Escherichia cof and Bacteroides uniformiswere detected in the blaad culture， positivefor Leptospira lgM  | High fever， acute renalfailure， elevated liver transaminases  | Initiated， extensive PVT.  |\n| Benmassaoud andRodger   | 53  | Male  | Obesity  | Abdominal pain  | Acute portal vein thrombosis withcomplete occlusion of the intrahepatic portal veins， main PV， superior mesenteric vein and splenic vein.  |\n| Setaka et al.   | 30  | Male  | Hereditary antithrombin deficiency  | Abdominal pain，fever  | Thrombotic abstruction of the mainportal vein and the lumen of the superiar mesenteric vein.  |\n| Our case  | 66  | Female  | High blood pressure， asthma， obesity Blood culture showing Enterobacter avium  | Abdominal pain， fever， nausea， vomiting  | PVT extends into the superior mesentericvein and splenic vein.  |\n\n【10】B， C， and E， and the Cytomegalovirus， Epstein-Barr， and HIV viruses were negative. Oncological indices CEA， AFP， CA19-9， and CA12-5 were normal， as were autoimmune-related indices. The stool liver fluke count was negative. Blood culture was suggestive of Enterococcus avium. Color Doppler ultrasound suggested extensive thrombosis of the main trunk and right andleft branches of the portal vein， superior mesenteric vein， and splenic vein. Abdominal CT scan and enhanced MRI scan showed a non-enhancing filling defect within the lumen of the portal and superior mesenteric vein， which indicated portal vein thrombosis extended to the superior mesenteric venous . Moderated liver steatosis without neoplasm was found in the liver. Endoscopic examination showed no evidence of gastroesophageal varices and inflammatory bowel diseases .\n\n【11】She was treated conservatively with intravenous imipenem and cilastatin sodium 1 g q8h and the anticoagulant rivaroxaban 20 mg/day. After 4 days of the above treatment， the patient still had mild abdominal pain， loss of appetite， and nausea， and the infection was considered not significantly controlled， so intravenous vancomycin1 g q12h was added as a combination anti-infection. After a week of continued treatment， her clinical symptoms of diarrhea disappeared， but her temperature was between 37.5℃ to 38.0°℃. Color Doppler ultrasound showed echogenic， organized thrombotic material in the lumen of the portal vein and superior mesenteric vein. She was continued treated with intravenous imipenem and Cilastatin sodium1 g q8h and vancomycin 1 g q12h and oral anticoagulant rivaroxaban at 20 mg/d. On day 14 of treatment， the patient was downgraded from imipenem and cilastatin to moxifloxacin 0.4 g QD and metronidazole0.5 g q12h. After 18 days oftreatment in the hospital，her temperature got too normal， and relief of clinical symptoms such as abdominal pain， poor appetite， and nausea. After that， she was treated with rivaroxaban at 20 mg/d for six months. At the 9-month follow-up，the patient's repeat Doppler ultrasound showed that the main trunk and the left and right branches of the portal vein were thin， but the blood flow was smooth and there was no thrombosis， while the splenic vein and superior mesenteric vein were suspected of thrombosis and there is portal vein spongiosis . At the 4-year follow-up， the patient has no symptoms， but Doppler ultrasound showed patent portal venous flow and spongy portal veins.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Acute Portal Vein Thrombosis (APVT) is defined as thrombosis of the main portal vein and/or the left and right branches of the portal vein， with or without mesenteric and splenic vein thrombosis. Acute portal vein thrombosis can lead to serious adverse outcomes such as mesenteric ischemia and even intestinal necrosis， with a mortality rate of up to 50% . A large study found a 1%population prevalence of PVT， with most cases associated with cirrhosis and hepatobiliary malignancy， and a low incidence of portal vein thrombosis in non-cirrhotic livers . Another Japanese study showed that the incidence of PVT was 0.05% in patients without cirrhosis . We report a case of a 66-year-old obese female patient with abdominal pain and fever as the main symptoms and review the available literature. The clinical characteristics of these 10 PVT cases are summarized in Table 1. Bv reviewing the literature， we found that these 10 patients were aged 22to 66 years， with a 7：3 male-to-female ratio， and 2 of them presented with intestinal infarction and underwent emergency surgery. However， one of these patients developed short bowel syndrome after surgery because of the extent of the intestinal infarction.\n\n【14】There are three elements to portal vein thrombosis， including a hypercoagulable state， endothelial injury， and stasis of blood flow， known as Virchow s triad. Any one of these elements may be affected to promote portal vein thrombosis. In our case， the main risk factors considered for portal vein thrombosis were obesity and abdominal infection. Obesity is a worldwide health problem that induces cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases， such as coronary syndrome， cerebral embolism， and encephalorrhagia. The contribution of obesity to vein thrombosis is large evaluated and obesity is a known risk factor in venous thrombosis . Obese individuals have nearly doubled the risk of both pulmonary embolism and Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and obese patients less than 40years of age have nearly a five-fold risk than those with normal weight.\n\n【15】However， there is limited knowledge about the risk of PVT in obese patients. Previous studies mainly focus on risk factors for PVT development in liver disease patients with obesity. A cohort study in a single center indicated that obesity was an independent risk factor for pre-transplant portal vein thrombosis .\n\n【16】Mechanisticaly， severall pathways could underlie a causal relationship between obesity and increased risk of DVT. Studies showed upregulation of inflammation factors， such as IL-6，TNF-a， and IL-1B were observed in obese individuals. These inflammation factors， which trigger the upregulation of procoagulant activity by promoting the synthesis of tissue factors， and suppressing fibrinolytic function via increased PAI-1 expression， facilitate the formation of DVT.\n\n【17】Furthermore， adipose tissue is not only a storage site for excess energy but also a multifunctional organ that secretes numerous hormones and cytokines， thus influencing cell functions and gene expression. As a consequence of overnutrition， adipose tissue undergoes remodeling： Adipocytes grow in size and number， accompanied by altered secretion， angiogenesis， and inflammation. Adipocytes are stimulated to secrete tissue factor (the trigger for blood coagulation)， plasminogen activator inhibitor (which impairs fibrinolytic function)， and substances responsible for local vessel degradation， all of which may promote clot initiation and formation and increase the risk of developing DVT. It has been found that leptin receptors are expressed on platelets and endothelial cells and can accelerate thrombosis by inducing platelet activation， inhibiting vasodilation， and increasing oxidative stress . From previous studies， it appears that obesity is a prothrombotic factor， favoring chronic inflammation， impairing coagulation and fibrinolysis， increasing hypercoagulability， and thus promoting the formation of venous thrombosis .\n\n【18】Infections may induce three factors of the Virchow's triad. Pathogenic microorganisms or their endotoxins can activate monocytes， vascular endothelial cells， etc.， causing them to release a variety of inflammatory factors， and the local inflammatory response can form portal phlebitis， which promotes endotoxin entry into the blood and damage vascular endothelial cells， thus promoting thrombosis.\n\n【19】According to a review of the literature ， acute portal vein thrombosis can be symptomatic or asymptomatic， with the most common clinical presentation being mild to severe abdominal pain and fever， but also bloating， diarrhea， nausea， vomiting， anorexia， and ascites， with the severity of symptoms depending on the extent of the thrombus. Acute extension of the thrombus into the superior mesenteric vein is more likely to produce intestinal ischemia and infarction， and the development of intestinal infarction is associated with high morbidity and mortality if there is persistent severe abdominalpain， organ failure (shock， renal failure， metabolic acidosis， and elevated arterial lactate)， massive ascites and rectal bleeding all suggest infarction. The diagnosis of APVT is made clinically primarily based on clinical presentation and imaging examinations. A severely obese patient with no specific history who suddenly presents with mild to severe abdominal pain with fever should not be missed as a suspicion for APVT.\n\n【20】Its diagnosis is often delayed due to non-specific abdominal symptoms， low incidence， and low awareness among clinicians. However， portal and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis are being increasingly diagnosed due to the improvement and widespread use of the Computed Tomography (CT) scan technique. The typical abdominal ultrasound presentation of acute portal vein thrombosis is hypoechoic or isoechoic material occupying the lumen of a mildly dilated vein. Enhanced CT or MRI of the abdomen shows an unenhanced filling defect in the lumen of the vein. The presence of features associated with cavernous hemangiomas， venous collateral circulation， or portal hypertension suggests a prolonged period of vessel formation.\n\n【21】The differential diagnosis of acute portal vein thrombosis focuses on differentiating benign from malignant PVT. The first thing to consider is portal vein thrombosis due to malignant tumors in the abdomen (most commonly such as hepatocellular carcinoma)， and secondly， tumor encapsulation or compression of the portal vein (such as pancreatic or bile duct cancer)， both of which can be secondary to malignant intraportal thrombosis. Imaging can help to differentiate between benign and malignant PVT.\n\n【22】Treatment includes subcutaneous anticoagulant injections or direct oral anticoagulant therapy and intravascular thrombolysis or surgical intervention. EASL recommends anticoagulation as the first-line treatment for acute non-cirrhotic non-malignant PVT . The AASLD guidelines also recommend that all patients with acute PVT， whether symptomatic or not， should be given conventional anticoagulants. Anticoagulation is usually availabllee with low molecular heparin， vitamin K antagonists， and new Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOACs). Recent data  suggest that the oral anticoagulant rivaroxaban is a reliable and safe treatment for abdominal vascular thrombosis and is increasingly used in patients with abdominal vascular thrombosis. Early anticoagulation is used on the one hand to prevent the thrombus from extending into the mesenteric vein and thus leading to mesenteric vein infarction； on the other hand， to achieve portal vein recanalization，but if intestinal ischemia and intestinal infarction develop， surgical intervention is required.\n\n【23】In Figure 4， we summarize our diagnosis and treatment process based on available guidelines and literature. In our case， the patient was an older obese woman for whom obesity and abdominal infection may have been risking factors for her morbidity， with significant abdominal symptoms and systemic inflammatory manifestations， supported by imaging findings， we diagnosed APVT. She opted for conservative treatment and the patient was discharged after 18 days of combined anti-infective and rivaroxaban anticoagulation therapy.\n\n【24】Conclusion\n\n【25】Portal and superior mesenteric vein thrombosis is a serious but relatively less common complication associated with intraabdominal infection in non-cirrhosis patients. CT scan is an accurate method with excellent sensitivity for the diagnosis of abdominal vein thrombosis， especially as clinical presentation is emergency but vague.Oral anticoagulant rivaroxaban is a reliable and safe treatment for abdominal vessel thrombosis. What is more， endovascular thrombolysis is also a viable option and emergency surgery is required in case of patients with intestinal infarction.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:15:56", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:16:34", "cost": 38.331}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:47", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:16:34", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:15:55"}

This is a 27-year-old female， who presented with headache， right-sided body weakness， dysarthria， blurred vision， and progressive altered level of consciousness over a course of 2 days， preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection 7 days prior to the onset of the above - mentioned symptoms. Brain MRI showed extensive abnormal white matter lesions which appear hyperintense， involving occipital， parietal， and temporal lobes， more on the left side. CSF exam showed high protein. According to the clinical and MRI findings， she was diagnosed as severe ADEM. She was started on high dose steroids and plasma exchange. Unfortunately， her condition deteriorated rapidly with sudden drop in her level of consciousness with fixed dilated pupils. Urgent imaging showed uncal herniation. Lifesaving urgent left decompressive hemicraniectomy was performed with subsequent resolution of herniation radiologically and clinically. She was kept on steroid and plasmapheresis， followed by Intravenc Immunoglobulin (IVIG) with gradual improvement. After one month， she completely recovered and became independent in her activities， with significantly improved MRIlesions. In conclusions， severe ADEM complicated by uncal herniation is an extremely rare presentation of the disease. Urgent and aggressive interventions， including decompressive surgeries， can save lives and lead to favorable outcomes.\n\n【2】Keywords： ADEM disease；Decompression； Craniectomy；IVIG\n\n【3】Abbreviations\n\n【4】ADEM： Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis； IVIG： Intravenous Immunoglobulin； GCS：Glasgow Coma Scale； FLAIR： Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery； ICP： Intracranial Pressure\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】ADEM (Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis) is an autoimmune disease， characterized by demyelination of the CNS， which is commonly preceded by viral disease or vaccine administration， with a latent period of 4 to 21 days before the onset of symptoms， although the inciting event could not be found in many cases . This disease occurs more commonly in children and adolescents than adults. It’s a rare disease and its actual incidence is still unknown . Typically， ADEM is monophasic， and patients usually present with an acute onset of multifocal neurologic symptoms with encephalopathy. Motor deficit is the main presenting symptom . The diagnosis of ADEM disease is clinical and supported by neuroimaging. MRI usually shows demyelinating lesions in the white matter of the brain . CSF analysis usually shows non-specific changes . Management of ADEM disease includes high dose steroid， Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG)， and plasmapheresis， with no definite guidelines regarding the optimal therapeutic approach.\n\n【7】Rarely， ADEM disease can be complicated by significant Increased Intracranial Pressure (ICP) due to massive brain edema， brain herniation and death. After reviewing the literature， we found that only very few cases of severe ADEM disease complicated by uncal herniation that required surgical hemicraniectomy were reported . Herein， we report a case of a 27-year-old female， who was diagnosed with severe ADEM， complicated by significant brain edema， and uncal herniation， that was managed by left decompressive hemicraniectomy with full recovery within one month of therapy.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 27 year old female patient， with unremarkable past history， was admitted to our hospital with a history of headache， nausea， vomiting， right-sided body weakness， dysarthria， blurred vision， and progressive altered level of consciousness over a course of 2 days. These symptoms were preceded by upper respiratory tract infection(dry cough and general weakness) 7 days prior to the onset of the above mentioned symptoms.\n\n【10】At presentation， her examination was remarkable for altered sensorium with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 13/15， preserved pupillary response， right sided hemiplegia with a power of 0/5， weakness of her left side with a power of 1/5， extensor plantar reflex bilateral. Brain MRI showed extensive abnormal white matter intensities which appear hyperintense on T2/Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR)， involving occipital， parietal， and temporal lobes， more on the left side， associated with local edema but with no herniation or significant midline shift . Laboratory investigations were unremarkable. CSF analysis was normal except for high protein levels. Coronavirus PCR test was negative. All other viral serology and PCR were negative.\n\n【11】Due to her acute presentation and the MRI findings， severe\n\n【12】ADEM disease was diagnosed. She was started on medical treatment with IV Methylprednisolone 1 gram daily for 5 days， and anti-edema medications (IV Mannitol and PO Acetazolamide) to decrease the ICP. As the presentation was severe， plasmapheresis was started as an additional therapeutic approach.\n\n【13】Unfortunately， on the next day， her condition deteriorated as she developed a sudden onset drop in her level of consciousness with fixed dilated pupils. Intubation was done to secure the airways； an urgent brain CT scan showed midline shifting to the right and uncal herniation. Urgent left decompressive hemicraniectomy was performed. After the procedure， pupils returned to be reactive， and controlbrain CT scan showed resolution ofthe midline shift and uncal herniation， with the same finding of brain edema. She was continued on medical treatment that included 7 sessions of plasmapheresis， and5 days of pulse steroid， followed by tapering oral prednisolone.\n\n【14】Two weeks after the procedure she was fully conscious， power in the left side improved to 3/5， but her right-sided hemiplegia did not improve. She was successfully weaned from the ventilator and extubated. Control Brain MRI done atthat time showed improvement in the brain edema and the intensity of the previously mentioned lesions .\n\n【15】As patient’s right sided hemiplegia did not improve， she was given IVIG 1 gm/Kg/dose for 3 days as a third -line medical treatment. The patient showed good clinical response after IVIG， manifested by a gradual improvement in her right side power (around 3 weeks after the decompression) with a gradual return to her activities of daily livings. After then， the patient was discharged home after 50 days of hospitalization， in good general condition， ambulating without assistance， and with full power in her four extremities.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】As ADEM is an autoimmune disease， immunosuppressive therapy is widely used as a first line management， including high dose steroid.Other treatment modalities include IVIG and plasmapheresis in patients who show poor response to steroid . Severe forms of ADEM with a fatal outcome despite optimal medical therapy have been described. ADEM can rarely be complicated by massive brain edema， with life threatening increased ICP， and brain herniation that may not respond to the standard edema medical management(osmotherapy， hyperventilation， and sedation).TTheCoptimal management of such an extreme presentation is not yet clear.\n\n【18】Our patient had severe ADEM presentation according to the clinical and MRI findings. Her condition continued to deteriorate and she developed uncal herniation， despite optimal medical therapy with high dose steroid and plasmapheresis. Lifesaving decompressive hemicraniectomy was urgently performed to reduce the ICP， and the patient has fully recovered after that with no residual deficits. Surgical decompression for elevated ICP is a well-established neurosurgical intervention in other diseases like infarction， infection， and trauma.

Genetic aberrations of the tumor suppressor gene VHL cause it. Based on the reports in VHL， the most common initial presentation tumors are hemangioblastoma in the CNS and retina. In addition， patients can be present with signs and symptoms of other visceral organ involvement， such as the CNS，adrenal gland， the kidney， pancreas tumor and others.\n\n【2】Here we report a 34 years old woman presented with signs and symptoms of ICSOL secon dary to hemangioblastoma， confirmed after the patient’s surgery. After years of the smooth postoperative period， she developed a carcinoid tumor at the head of the pancreas and left supra renal mass， for which she was operated and improved. Subsequent follow up detected recurrence and proper Whipple surgery was done and confirmed the diagnosis of VHL.\n\n【3】From this case report easily can observe， regular and proper follow up lead early recognition and on-time appropriate treatment remain the mainstay of management in this group of patients.\n\n【4】Keywords： Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) disease； Hemangioblastoma； Multiorgan involvement\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Von Hippel-Lindau(VHL)syndrome is an autosomal dominant，multi-organ， familial neoplastic syndrome caused by genetic aberrations of the tumor suppressor gene VHL located on chromosome. The prevalence of VHL is estimated to be between 1： 35，000 to 1：. The mutation of the VHL gene leads to develop benign and malignant tumors of several visceral organs like the central nervous system， kidneys， pancreas， adrenal， and reproductive organs. The most common VHL associated tumors are hemangioblastomas involving the brain， spinal cord， and retina； clear cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)； pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas of the adrenal gland and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor. The current case report is a young woman with VHL disease involving hemangioblastoma of the posterior fossa followed by visceral multi-organ involvement.\n\n【7】Here I am presenting a 34-year-old woman， a mother of two presented with a history of progressive global headache followed by nausea and vomiting of months duration. The intensity of the headache has increased， and it started to have an imbalance， followed by blurring of vision on and off， vertigo and ataxia of one week duration. She gave a history of long-standing dyspepsia and abdominal discomfort. After having an MRI of the brain， hemangioblastoma in the posterior fossa of the brain was diagnosed， and surgery was performed  .\n\n【8】After eleven months of a smooth postoperative period， she started to experience dyspepsia， abdominal discomfort on the right side， anorexia， and weight loss. After investigation， a CT scan of the abdomen revealed a pancreatic head and suprarenal mass with multiple intra-abdominal lymphadenopathies with the impression of a carcinoid tumor and poorly controlled hypertension. She has been referred abroad (India)， where the Whipple procedure was done. Histopathology confirmed pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm PT2N1； all margins are negative one out of 12LN+ve. She had regular follow-ups for almost two years， her blood pressure was well controlled， and after a while， she started to have anorexia， abdominal discomfort， itching sensation all over the body，and right-side abdominal swelling. On physical examination，poorly controlled hypertension(160/112mmHg) and right upper quadrant abdominal tenderness were observed. Whole body PET-CT images were obtained with few somewhat defined enhancing lesions in the right suprarenal-retrocaval region showing mild tracer uptake； a tiny sub-centimetric enhancing lesion involving the medial limb of the left adrenal gland- the possibility of multiple pheochromocytomas is considered. Clinically relevant laboratory tests revealed as follows： Urine metanephrine/creatinine -141 ug/g Cret (Nr. 29-158)， normetanephrine/creatinine - 22526 ug/g Crea(Nr 53-6590)， serum serotonin (HPLC) 796++ ng/ml (Nr 68-232)，5-HIAA (5-Hydroxy Indole Acetic Acid)， 24 h Urine 4.94 mg/24 h(WNL)， Chromogranin A 185.5 ng/ml (Nr <98.1)，urine Epinephrine2.57 ug/day (Nr. 1.4)， Norepinephrine 647.39 pg/day (Nr. 12=.5)， and Dopamine 211.56 ug/day (Nr.52.00). Considering the recurrence of the carcinoid tumor， she was reoperated with adrenalectomy，lymphadenectomy， and omentectomy was done. The pathology result and immunohistochemistry show's morphological diagnosis of neuroendocrine neoplasm， synaptophysin - all the tumor cells show cytoplasmic positivity， chromogranin - most of the cells show positivity， MIB-1-less than 1% of tumor cells and all consistent with neuroendocrine neoplasm grade I with proliferation index less than 1%.\n\n| Table 1： VHL subtypes.  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Type  | Clinical findings  | Mutations  |\n| Type 1 (decreased risk for PCC)  | Retinal and CNS HB， RCC， pancreatic cysts， and neuroendocrine tumors  | Truncating or missense mutations  |\n| Type 2 (increased risk for PCC)  |  |  |\n| Type 2A (low risk for RCC)  | PCC， retinal HB， CNS HB  | Missense mutation  |\n| Type 2B (high risk for RCC)  | PCC， RCC， Retinal HB， CNS HB， pancreatic cyst， and neuroendocrine tumors  |  |\n| Type 2C  | PCC only  |  |\n\n【10】Shehad asmoothpostoperativeperiod without anycomplications； currently， almost five years after the patient's last surgery， the blood pressure， as well as all symptoms， are well controlled， and she has been on regular follow up for the last five years without any sign of recurrence or progressive disease.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Von Hippel-Lindau is a rare disease that is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and causes multi-system involvement in the form of the development of hemangioblastoma of the Central Nervous System (CNS)， retinal hemangioblastoma， renal cell carcinoma or renal cyst， endolymphatic sac tumor， neuroendocrine tumors and cyst of pancreatic gland， pheochromocytoma，epididymal cyst adenoma.\n\n【13】Hemangioblastoma of the CNS usually develops from childhood at any age of 10 or early teen until 30. These are benign tumors. Some hemangioblastomas remain unchanged in size over several years，and if they do not cause symptoms， their surgical removal may not be necessary. The symptoms of hemangioblastoma are usually caused by the expansion of tumors in the intracranial space and spinal cord. Asymptomatic small tumors are carefully watched until the onset of symptoms. Surgical resection is the best treatment modality for this tumor； in cases of enormous tumor burden where surgical resection is not possible， gamma knife surgery can substitute the treatment modality. The most common sites for hemangioblastoma development are the cerebellum and spinal cord， as evident in our patient. Our patient presented with signs and symptoms of Cerebellar Hemangioblastoma (CHb) and was operated on time. Pathological confirmation was done， and routine investigationslike organ function tests， abdomen ultrasound， and chest X-ray showed no abnormality. Unusual sites of hemangioblastomas in VHL include the anterior lobe of the pituitary， pituitary stalk， hypothalamus， optic nerve， corpus callosum， wall of the third ventricle， the temporal horn of the lateral ventricles， frontal and temporal lobe， meninges .\n\n【14】In VHL， Renal cysts are much more common than Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC)， with an incidence of 60% and 24% to 45%subsequently.Renalinvolvement in VHL is multi-centric and bilateral in at least 75% of patient's microscopic solid tumors identified within the renal parenchyma of patients with VHL， which progress into giant macroscopic tumors. The renal tumor observed， on average， grow at the rate of 1.6 cm/year， which is somewhat faster than those in sporadic renal cell carcinoma .\n\n【15】In the VHL pancreas， different types of lesions like cysts， serious micro-cystic adenomas， and even malignant pancreatic lesions(adenocarcinoma) can be involved. The pancreatic cyst is the most common among the above lesions. Adrenal gland involvement in VHL having pheochromocytomas occurs only 7% to 18%. There are multiple case reports and involvement of different organs with VHL lesions like malignant lesions on the thyroid (Medullary and papillary type)， liver and pulmonary hemangioblastoma， ovarian and omental cysts， hemangioma of skin， and skeletal muscles .\n\n【16】Patients can have variable presentations depending on the primary site； the diagnosis is often confirmed by positive family history and the presence of one VHL-associated tumor. In cases with no known history of VHL， multiple tumors are needed for diagnosis since approximately 20% of cases result from de novo mutations. Specific genotype-phenotype correlations in affected families led to the classification of VHL subtypes into types 1 and 2 ， primarily based on the presence of a pheochromocytoma. Type 1disease has a shallow risk of pheochromocytomas. Type 2 VHL is further categorized into type 2a (low risk of RCC)， type 2b (high risk ofRCC)， and type 2c， which only presents with pheochromocytomas.\n\n【17】Based on the above classification， our patient belongs to type 1because she had CNS HB，pancreatic cystic mass， and neuroendocrine tumor. The sex and genotype of the patient influence survival. Female patients have a significantly higher risk of VHL-related death than male patients (HR=2.25，95% CI 1.20 to 4.20，p=0.011).Overall，79%(53 of 67) of deaths were VHL-related， but the risk of VHL-related death has decreased over time， as has the frequency of Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) -related death. Surveillance is especially beneficial for truncating mutation carriers with the greatest RCC and Central Nervous System (CNS) hemangioblastoma risk .\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】The current study reinforces the importance of regular follow-ups with proper evaluation by appropriate diagnostic modalities. As we observed from our patient， these tumors often have multiple periods of tumors growth separated by periods of arrested growth， and different kinds of literature informed us the possibility of many untreated tumors might remain static for several years， yet follow-up of VHL patients must not be discontinued after their initial diagnosis and treatment. Advisable to make maximum effort to analyze the chromosomal mutation of the patient， which will help and lead us to offer the option ofpre-symptomatic gene testing and early treatment. The advantage of regular follow-ups and checkups lead to early detection， which emphasizes better treatment outcomes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:44:37", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:44:58", "cost": 21.814}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:47", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:44:58", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:44:36"}

Among the patients， convexal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (cSAH) caused by CVST is relatively rare， accounting for only 0.5% to 0.8% of all CVST patients. Convexal SAH is a subtype ofnon-aneurysmal SAH， characterized by the limitation of bleeding in one or several convex cortical sulci. The pathogenesis of CVST is challenging to find but valuable for subsequent treatment. We report a patient with CVST caused by primary Sjogren Syndrome (pSS) and secondary “Non-criteria\" antiphospholipid syndrome， whose first manifestation was cSAH. After diagnosis， the patient was given long-term anticoagulation to treat CVST and \"Non-criteria\" antiphospholipid syndrome. The case aims to discuss the diagnosis， pathogenesis， personalized treatment plan， and the risk of recurrence.\n\n【2】Keywords： Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis； Sjogren syndrome； Convexsal subarachnoid hemorrhage\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Cerebral venous thrombosis accounts for 0.5% of all types of strokes ， with the estimated annual incidence of 3 to 4 cases per 100，000 populations . The common cause of CVST included infections， dehydration， pregnancy， trauma， and inherited hematopathy， and the autoimmune disease， but more than 12.5% of cases remained idiopathic . The Sjogren syndrome-associated CVST or \"Non-criteria\" antiphospholipid syndrome-associated CVST is scarcely reported . It reminds us of the importance of seeking etiologies for afterward therapeutic anticoagulation. It also illustrates that the CVST as the cause of cSAH can be vital for subsequent anticoagulant therapy， which contradicts in SAH of other reasons.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 32-year-old Asian female presented with sudden headache with extremities spasms and loss of consciousness lasting for hours with nausea， vomiting， blurred vision， diplopia， aconuresis， and left extremities numbness for more than eleven days. The patient denied dysphasia， dysphagia， photophobia， gait disturbance， or sensory loss. Mild xerostomia and saprodontia were also spotted via inquiry of history. The patient had diabetes but denied hypertension or hyperlipidemia， thrombophilia， malignancy， or dehydration. She also denied usage of oral contraceptives or repetitive miscarriages. On admission， her vital signs， including blood pressure， heart rates， and respiration were stable with a Glasgow Coma Scale of 15/15. Central nervous examination revealed left extremities weakness with muscle strength grade 4 and mild ataxia on the left side. The cranial nerves， sensory functions， and deep reflexes were normal. Meningeal irritation signs and nuchal rigidity were negative.\n\n【7】Emergency Brain Non-Enhanced CT (NECT) showed linear hyperdensity in bilateral frontal lobe sulcus on day 2. Subsequent NECT on day 8 revealed subcortical edema and parenchymal hemorrhage ，and Computed tomographyangiography detected no aneurysm or stenosis while computed tomography venography showed filling defect in the Superior Sagittal Sinus (SSS) and right Transverse Sinus (TS) . DSA was made to rule out aneurysmal SAH and show the filling defect in SSS and right TS .\n\n【8】Blood tests showed elevated estimated sedimentary rate of 100mm/h， elevated C reactive protein was 16.99 mg/L， autoantibody spectrumsrevealed anti-SS-relateddantigen1A (anti-Ro/SSA) antibodies (+++)， anti-SS antigen B (anti-SSB) antibodies (+++)， anti-Ro-52 (+++)， Antinuclear Antibodies (ANA) 1：3200 and anti-nuclear RNP/Sm antibodies . The antiphospholipid antibody test showed positive IgA Anti-B2 glycoprotein I antibody (IgA anti-B2GPI antibody) (54.11 RU/ml) positive， negative IgG and IgM anti-B2GPI， and negative anti-cardiolipin. A 12 weeks reexamination also revealed positive IgA anti-B2GPI (40.77RU/ml) with the negative IgG and IgM. The Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody (ANCA)， complement，\n\n【9】Immunoglobulin G and Immunoglobulin G subtype 4， rheumatoid factor were normal. The prothrombin time， partial thromboplastin time， and International Normalized Ratio (INR) were within normal ranges (11.4s， 29.6s， and 0.99s). The activity of Protein S is 39.9%(63.50% to 149.00%)，antithrombin III is 63% (83.00% to 128%)，and coagulation factor VIII is 191% (50% to 150%). The thyroid functions test showed the thyroxine 36.88 nmol/L (69.97 to 152.52)， Thyroid Stimulating Hormone 18.08 ulu/mL(3.28to 6.47)，anti-thyroglobulin and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody were strongly positive， which indicated the Hashimoto thyroiditis. The liver function tests with liver and gall ultrasounds and urinalysis were normal. The labial gland biopsy showed that the cluster of lymphocytes infiltrates the small salivary gland tissue of 4 mm； Leukocyte Common Antigen(LCA)highlights the lymphocyte (+)， which confirmed a diagnosis of Sjogren syndrome .\n\n【10】The Low Weight Molecular Heparin (LMWH) was given after CVST was diagnosed and warfarin was delivered four days later， bridging with LMWH. The clinician adjusted warfarin dose to maintain the INR of the patient at 2 to 3 in 12 weeks.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】In CVST-associated SAH， nearly 90% of patients first appeared as sudden and thunderclap-like headaches  that mimic the aneurysmal SAH. The seizure occurs in 35% to 90% in 2 case series as in our case. The mechanism may be the stimulation of the convexalcerebral cortex caused by cSAH，leadingtoabnormal cortical discharge. The NECT is often the preliminary examination for SAH for its high sensitivity but a suboptimal tool for CVST. A case series revealed that the circumscribed convexity SAH localized to the dural sinuses or cortical veins with sparing of the basal cisterns might point to an underlying CVST . Compared with NECT， the MRI is more sensitive as 21/22 was spotted by the MRI FLAIR sequence in that case series . Digital subtraction Angiography is the gold standard\"for the diagnosis ， which can show the filling defect and blood drainage of the venous and venous sinus. Different hypothesizes can explain the causal relationship between CVST and SAH. Sinus thrombosis increases the adjacent venous pressure， causing the dilation and rupture of cortical veins . The occlusion of the cerebral vein also leads to venous infarction presenting as elevated intracranial pressure， brain tissue edema， and brain infarction .\n\n【13】The patients also complained of xerostomia and xerophthalmia with anti-Ro/SSA and anti-Ro/SSB positive. The labial glands biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of Sjogren syndrome . Among SS patients， the common neurological manifestations are peripheral neuropathy， autonomic nervous disease， and myelitis . To our knowledge， there are only five Sjogren syndrome-induced CVST reported in literature， and none of them had secondary cSAH . A theory declared that the pSS-induced autoimmune vasculitis could cause the vasculitic necrosis and leads to thrombosis ，may explain the etiology.\n\n【14】The IgA anti-B2GPI antibody-positive on day 1 and 12 weeks with the sinus thrombosis， the \"non-criteria antiphospholipid syndrome “or\" Seronegative Antiphospholipid Syndrome (SNAPS)\"can be diagnosed . Though the Sapporo standard did not include IgA anti-B2GPI antibody ， it certainly strongly correlates with thrombosis events and recurrent miscarriage . IgA aB2GPI positivity alone is associated with an increased risk of arteriovenous and venous thrombosis and all types of thrombosis .\n\n【15】Since the concurrence of Sjogren syndrome and APS and the presence of anti-SSA， we believed the APS has occurred secondary to Sjogren syndrome . Secondary APS can occur in nearly 3%to 4% pSS patients . Antiphospholipid syndrome can lead to thrombosis by affecting coagulation via increasing the expression of thromboxane A2  and tissue factor  or activating the classic complement pathway . The APL-associated CVST presenting as cSAH has been reported in many cases . In conclusion， The SS that caused the seronegative APS that leads to the CVST and associated cSAH.\n\n【16】The thyroid dysfunction is the third most relevant risk factor for CVST ， and Grave's disease-associated CVST presenting as cSAH cases were reported . Hashimoto thyroiditis-related CVST was also revealed . In general， hyperthyroidism leads to thrombosis due to the endothelial activation and decreased fibrinolytic activity， while the hypothyroidism is often associated with bleeding. Hashimoto thyroiditis relates with APS antibodies present， but no relations of HT with a thrombotic manifestation of APS . Our patients presented anti-thyroglobulin and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody， thus， multiple factors may contribute to the onset of CVST， and including SS associated vasculitis，hypercoagulable state stemmed from anti-phospholipid1antibody y syndrome andautoimmune thyroiditis.\n\n【17】The therapeutic dose of LMWH was given after CVST was confirmed by MRand DSA  to prevent the potential of elevated intracranial pressure and herniation. Warfarin was given for long-term anticoagulation in the heparin bridging phase to prevent CVST recurrence， affecting 2 to 7 percent of patients . As for this case， since the CVST was caused by Sjogren-induced APS，the priority is the APS treatment which mainly includes antiplatelet， anticoagulant， and immunomodulatory therapy . The standard treatment for APS in the first venous thrombotic event is an oral vitamin K antagonist with a target INR of 2 to 3 . Due to the high recurrence rate of thrombotic events in APS， a lifetime anticoagulant is recommended. New anticoagulants lack evidence of efficacy in the APS treatment. APS also requires immunomodulatory therapy， especially in patients secondary to other rheumatic immune system diseases. Glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants shall be considered for the management of pSS， but there is no specific treatment so far due to lack of data on efficacy and safety trials. Hydroxychloroquine， methotrexate， azathioprine， and cyclophosphamide can be used with ESSDAI taken .\n\n【18】The prognosis of CVST is favorable， with more than 80% good outcomes，but the prognosis of CVST-related SAH depends on early diagnosis and treatment. In 2 cases series ， the mortality rates are 2/10 and 1/22， though the sample size limited， we can conclude that the cSAH was not related to bad outcomes， the occurrence of parenchymal infarcts， raised intracranial pressure， and extensive deep venous thrombosis may worsen outcome. As for the prognosis of APS， a large cohort study  confirms that APS patients who survive their first episode are still at risk for recurrent events. Because warfarin and aspirin reduces but do not eliminate the risk of recurrent thromboembolic or obstetric complications， which can sometimes be fatal. So a regular follow-up visit is needed to evaluate the coagulation status and succeeding treatment.\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】Cerebral venous thrombosis should be considered when convexal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients presented with neurological deteriorations and new onsets of headache and seizure. In this case， the Sjogren syndrome and secondary antiphospholipid caused hypercoagulation and leading to thrombosis in venous sinuses， presenting as the convexal subarachnoid hemorrhage. The CTV， MRV， or DSA should be used to confirm the presence of CVST therefore make a precise therapeutic regime.

Here， we present a case of cervical pregnancy complicated with placenta increta， and the following treatment and plan Case Report： A 33-year-old woman， gravida 2， para 1， was diagnosed with cervical pregnancy at an estimated gestational age of 6+6/7 weeks. Local methotrexate was given initially with good response but subsequent abdominal pain with persistent vaginal bleeding was noted， and total abdominal hysterectomy was performed eventually. The pathology confirmed cervical pregnancy with placenta increta.\n\n【2】Conclusion： We present clear and diagnostic ultrasound images of cervical pregnancy， as well as our experience of the management ofthis rare condition.\n\n【3】Keywords： Cervical pregnancy (ectopic pregnancy)； Conservativetreatment：Doppler ultrasonography； Placenta Accrete Spectrum (PAS)； Case report\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Cervical pregnancy is defined as the implantation of the pregnancy within the endocervical canal. Cervical pregnancies are rare， accounting for less than 1% of ectopic pregnancies， and the incidence is one in 2，500 to 18，000 pregnancies. It may be more common in pregnancies conceived via reproductive technologies .\n\n【6】Cervical pregnancycombined with Placenta Accreta Spectrum (PAS) disorders can be explained by the absence of protective decidua basalis in the cervical stroma， which results in trophoblastic invasion into the cervical tissue . Either the implantation of a gestational sac or placenta into the cervix can cause disastrous consequences as the relatively non-contractile cervical stroma may not cease bleeding when the trophoblast tissue detaches .\n\n【7】Cesarean Scar Pregnancy (CSP) is another clinical scenario which may sometimes be confused with cervical pregnancy. In cases with positive fetal cardiac activity， the higher number of maternal morbidities requires more than just expectant management . The combination of cervical pregnancy with Abnormally Invasive Placenta (AIP) could be detected as early as the first trimester via sonography. Low anterior implantation of the placenta and gestational sac close to or within the scar are the most common signs suggestive of AIP .\n\n【8】There are only a few case reports on this situation， and some even required magnetic resonance imaging for diagnosis . Given the rarity of this condition， we would like to share one such case with clear sonographic images and our experience of the subsequent management. From our case， we learned that Transvaginal Ultrasonography (TVUS)， which is accessible in most clinical settings， is capable of detecting hints of this rare disease. Also， even though Uterine Artery Embolization(UAE) and topical injection of Methotrexate (MTX) could lead to a noticeable decrease in beta-Human Chorionic (B-HCG) level， swelling of the necrotic gestational tissue could still cause troublesome pain and persistent bleeding.\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\n【10】The patient was a 33-year-old woman， gravida 2， para 1， with a previous cesarean delivery due to twin pregnancy 5 years ago. A small amount of vaginal bleeding was noted at the time when her menstrual cycle was supposed to begin， and she went to a local gynecologic clinic， where abnormal pregnancy implantation was noted during a TVUS exam.\n\n【11】She was then referred to our hospital on March 04h， 2017 at the estimated gestational age of 6+6/7 weeks. Cervical ectopic pregnancy was noted by TVUS . Findings of TVUS were summarized as follows. A gestational sac， accompanied by fetal pole and cardiac activity， was located in the endocervical canal. The external cervical orifice was closed， and the internal cervical orifice was slightly dilated. The placenta was extremely swollen. Either the endometrial cavity (especially over the previous cesarean section scar) or the bilateral adnexa revealed signs of heterotopic pregnancy. The B-HCG level was 46，305 mIU/ml initially. Progressive growth of the mass was noted two days later on March 064， 2017， along with persistent fetal cardiac activity.\n\n【12】07h， 2017. Because the residual cervical wall was too thin to allow hysteroscopic excision or dilatation and evacuation， local MTX injection into the gestational tissue was performed on March 08，2017 (day 0). One week after the MTX injection， we saw only a minimal decrease in her B-HCG level， from 37，683 mIU/ml before injection to 35，000 mIU/ml， on March 15h， 2017 (day 7). She received another MTX local injection on March 17\"h， 2017 (day 9). Her β-HCG level dropped to 12，175 mIU/ml on March 24， 2017 (day 16) and decreased further to 3，755 mIU/ml on March 315， 2017 (day 23). Throughout the treatment course， she reported no vaginal bleeding or abdominal pain. However， serial TVUS demonstrated enlargement and edematous change of the cervical lesion， from 2 cm×2 cm before treatment to 4 cm ×4 cm on March 315， 2017 (day 23).\n\n【13】On April 064， 2017 (day 29) after the 1MTX injection，persistent lower abdominal throbbing pain which radiated to her back and vaginal bleeding were noted. TVUS revealed enlarged ectopic mass with hypervascularity . Sterile Speculum Exam (SSE) revealed that the cervix was engorged and the cervical stroma was so thin that it appeared transparent. Tenderness was noted when the lesion was lightly touched. At our ER， vital signs were stable， but mild tachycardia， 104 bpm， was noted. Hemoglobin level was as low as9.7 g/dl compared with her previous record， which was 11.0 g/dl and adequate fluid resuscitation was given.\n\n【14】Considering the unbearable pain and uncertainty of the conservative treatment， and the patient and her husband had no desire to have more children， the patient agreed to hysterectomy.\n\n【15】The second UAE was performed on April 07h， 2017 (day 30) in an attempt to prevent excessive surgical bleeding， and total abdominal hysterectomy was carried out subsequently. A 4 cm lesion consisting of necrotic gestational tissue and hematoma was found within the endocervical canal over the posterior wall， which was inseparable from the cervical stroma grossly. The whole surgery was performed smoothly， and the total blood loss was 150 ml.\n\n【16】The final histopathology report confirmed the diagnosis ofcervical pregnancy with placenta increta： The gestational tissue was attached to the posterior wall of the cervix， with almost total penetration of trophoblasts， where only 1 mm of the residual serosa was identified.\n\n【17】The postoperative care of the patient was uneventful， and she was discharged on the 4h day after the surgery. Her B-HCG level plummeted to 10.62 mIU/ml on April 215， 2017， 14 days after the hysterectomy .\n\n【18】Discussion\n\n【19】We treated a rare case of cervical pregnancy in combination with PAS disorders. Only three similar cases have been reported in the literature . Using TVUS， cervical pregnancy could be identified by several features， which include：  hourglass shape of uterus and ballooned endocervical canal；  visible gestational tissue within the cervix below the level of internal cervical os； absence of intrauterine pregnancy and presence of endocervical canal between the gestational tissue and the endometrial canal .\n\n【20】The ultrasonographic diagnostic criteria of PAS disorders with concomitant cervical pregnancy have not been established. Some commonly used markers， such as vanished clear zone and interrupted bladder line， are not applicable. Based on our experience and other case reports ， abnormally increased vascularity over the implantation site may be the only sign suggesting the possibility of PAS.\n\n【21】There is still no consensus on the treatment of ectopic cervical pregnancy. Physicians may offer options such as hysteroscopic resection， localOIsystemic MTX1injection， transabdominal surgical intervention， and expectant management. Individualized management is crucial， based on the fertility desire of the patient， the patient's general condition， and whether conservative treatment is an available option .\n\n【22】There are severalcasereports regardingMTX treatment for cervical pregnancy， whether it is given systemically or locally. Yamaguchi et al.  reported that in 15 cases with cervical pregnancies， ultrasound-guided local MTX injection successfully normalized their B-HCG levels after a mean duration of 43.8 days. Three patients， in whom a poor initial response was achieved， required a second dose. Our approach， inspired by Yamaguchi's work， showed a rather good response at first. However， despite a proper decrease in the B-HCG level after the second MTX injection， the patient suffered from pain and bleeding resulting from excessive swelling of gestational tissue. In hindsight， the result seemed predictable considering the co-existence of placenta increta that allowed trophoblastic tissues to penetrate deeply into the cervical stroma. Necrosis and swelling of these tissues might even rupture the cervix. In our case， only 1mm of cervical tissue remained， which prevented possible excessive bleeding from a ruptured cervix.\n\n【23】Uterine Artery Embolization (UAE) serves as another treatment option， especially in patients desiring future fertility. In one case report， UAE alone was able to treat cervical pregnancy successfully. It can also be provided alongside with MTX injection or intra-amniotic Potassium Chloride (KCL) injection ， or as a prophylactic vascular control before surgical interventions. However， UAE presents complications， including tissue necrotic change， uterine ischemia， sciatic nerve injury， and bladder or rectum injury.\n\n【24】Conclusion\n\n【25】Cervical pregnancy complicated by PAS disorders is challenging with regard to both diagnosis and management. This presentation of the clinical course， ultrasound images， and our experience from initial conservative management to hysterectomy could， hopefully， help other physicians who face similar conditions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:14:29", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:14:47", "cost": 17.994}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:47", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:47", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:28"}

Most commonly，amebiasis can seed through the portal tract and result in the formation of a liver abscess . Initial presentation is significant for abdominal pain and hepatomegaly. Diagnosis is made with negative blood cultures but positive amebic serology. On the contrary， pyogenic hepatic abscess (PHA) is a result of bacterial infection stemming from the bloodstream， biliary tract， abdominal cavity， or portal system. It commonly presents as fever， chills， nausea， vomiting， and often， jaundice. Diagnosis is made with positive blood and/or abscess cultures. We report a unique case of a patient with a massive ALA initially presenting as PHA.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 66-year-old Hispanic man was well until he presented with three days of malaise， productive cough， and right flank pain. Initial examination was notable for fever (temperature 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit)， tachycardia， tachypnea， tender hepatomegaly， encephalopathy and jaundice. Blood work was remarkable (sodium 114 mmol/L， bicarbonate 17 mmol/L， alkaline phosphatase 488 U/L， albumin 2.4 g/dL， aspartate amino transferase (AST) 241 U/L， alanine transaminase 208 U/L， total bilirubin 5.1 mg/dL， direct bilirubin 4.0 mg/dL， lactate 5.5 mmol/L， white blood cell count 57.7 x10 with 97% neutrophils， hemoglobin 11.1 g/dL， platelets 65 x 10，INR 1.62). Upon presentation， he was intubated， admitted to the intensive care unit， and initiated on intravenous antibiotics with vancomycin， cefepime， and metronidazole.\n\n【9】Initial Chest CT revealed two large non-arterially enhancing， ill-defined， hypo attenuating lesions within the right hepatic lobe， the largest measuring up to 11.7 cm . A follow-up abdominal ultrasound revealed two hypoechoic lesions with hyperechoic rims； the first lesion measured 10x 9.3 x 9.2 cm while the second measured 11.2x8.2x 10.7 cm .\n\n【10】Infectious Disease was consulted and antibiotics were switched to vancomycin， meropenem and metronidazole to cover for other etiologies of hepatic abscesses. Initial blood cultures wer negative. Stool analysis was negative for infection. A percutaneous drain of the inferior lobe abscess emptied 600 milliliters ofthick anchovy paste-like material . Gram stain and culture of this aspirate were negative. He had another drain placed into the superior lobe abscess， which appeared to rupture into the pleural space； both drains were subsequently extracted after adequate drainage. He was extubated after clinical improvement on antibiotics. Eventually， E. histolytica IgG serology returned positive， and metronidazole alone was continued. The right-sided pleural effusion secondary to a rupture of the abscess was managed successfully with serial drain placements. He was maintained on metronidazole for 10 days with the addition of diiodohydroxyquin for adjuvant luminal therapy for a total of 21 days.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】While ALA is predominant in males， it is usually a disease of younger adults when compared to PHA . Several case series have reported that those in their fifth decade or older were more consistent with PHA . Our patient was a male in his sixth decade of life. PHA is associated with variable complaints， such as cough or chest pain . Our patient did have complaints of a productive cough. Lab abnormalities are more noteworthy in PHA， particularly hyperbilirubinemia， which is rare in ALA .Otherlab abnormalities more typical of PHA include elevated lactic dehydrogenase， low albumin， increased AST， and leukocytosis with a marked shift to the left (>89% neutrophils) . However， as illustrated in our case， the distinction between ALA and PHA can be very challenging and aspiration of the abscess is needed both for diagnosis and for prevention of rupture of strategically located abscess.\n\n【13】Definitive diagnosis of ALA is by demonstrating amebic trophozoites in the aspirate of the liver abscess. Due to the cellular response to invading trophozoites occurring mostly in the periphery of the lesion， a microscopic evaluation may be low yield due to imprecise sampling. Aspirate evaluation has higher yield in PHA where microorganisms and polymorphonuclear cells are more evident. The fluid aspirate in this case was not tested for trophozoites but rather for gram stain and cultures in order to definitively rule out PHA. Given the low yield of fluid aspirate analysis， serologies for E. histolytica remain instrumental in the diagnosis and differentiation of ALA from PHA. The ELISA remains the most sensitive assay in detecting circulating antibodies specific for E. histolytica. It is important to note that serology may not be apparent in the first 7-10days of infection .\n\n【14】Although treatment is distinctive for each individual disease， it is prudent to initiate treatment for both， especially in the early management of severe illness until the diagnosis is confirmed.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:38:43", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:38:53", "cost": 10.399}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:47", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:38:53", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:38:42"}

The role of this disease and its complications on the patient's sleep is not clear yet.\n\n【2】Case Report： The patient was a 20-year-old female with a history of congenital sternum cleft referred to the Sleep Clinic of Rasoul Akram Hospital in Tehran for a split-night polysomnography test due to daytime sleepiness，morning headache，and insomnia.\n\n【3】Conclusion： This case report aimed to investigate the parameters and sleep disorders in a patient with asternia. Considering the complications of this rare disease， it is essential to pay more attention to sleep disorders， especially sleep-related breathing disorders， in these patients.\n\n【4】Keywords： Asternia； Sleep disorder； Obstructive sleep apnea；Iran\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Asternia or complete sternal cleft is a very unusual chest wall deformity caused by a sternal fusion deficiency during embryonic development. This anomaly can cause serious consequences and，like other congenital anomalies， can be linked to other birth disorders .\n\n【7】Asternia carries several risks， including mediastinal injury， hypothermia， and insensible fluid losses. Also， respiratory and dynamic complications may occur. Paradoxical breathing pattern can lead to cyanosis and recurrent chest infections due to impaired gas exchange and inadequate secretion clearance. In addition， changes due to intrathoracic pressure can decrease venous return.\n\n【8】Another sternal cleft abnormality includes Pentalogy of Cantrell (POC)， which involves abnormalities of the sternum， pericardium， heart， diaphragm， and abdominal wall. Seemingly unrelated processes such as PHACE (posterior fossa anomalies， hemangioma， arterial anomalies， cardiac anomalies， and eye anomalies) syndrome can also be present .\n\n【9】The optimal time to conduct sternal cleft repair is during infancy， when the chest wall is extremely malleable and can therefore be initially closed without considerable cardiac constraint. As the patient ages and the chest wall stiffens， closure might become progressively more challenging as venous return and lung flexibility are reduced .\n\n【10】Given that respiratory disorders induced by defects in the chest wall muscles during sleep are likely to worsen and no study has been conducted on sleep disorders in patients with sternal defects， this study aimed to evaluate sleep parameters in patients suffering from this rare disease.\n\n【11】Case Presentation\n\n【12】The patient was a 20-year-old female with a history of congenital sternum cleft and repair in childhood. The patient referred to a pulmonologist and complained of daytime shortness ofbreath. The patient was referred to the Sleep Clinic of Rasoul Akram Hospital in Tehran， Iran to be assessed for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). All necessary tests were performed and paraclinical parameters， including spirometry were normal.\n\n【13】According to the patient’s records， she complained of fatigue， excessive daytime sleepiness，and morning headaches. The patient did not report snoring or breathing problems during sleep and complained of frequent inability to sustain sleep， which raised the possibility of OSA. The patient got into bed at 12 AM， fell asleep in about half an hour， and woke up at 10 AM in the morning. She did not report such symptoms and disorders as restless legs syndrome， sleep paralysis， cataplexy， hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations， sleepwalking， nightmares， and other parasomnias.\n\n|  | TST (Total Sleep Time)=380min SE (Sleep Efficacy)=85% W]TH 3 sleep cycles Sleep Latency=16 min REM Latency=141 min PLM index= 2/hr sleep Average Heart Rate=57 bpm Without SPO2<90% AH]=7/hr sleep Duration of Sleep Stage： REM=27 min (7%)/N1=19 min (5%)/N2=207 min (54%)/N3=127 min (34%)  |\n| --- | --- |\n\n【15】There was no history of psychiatric disorder， suicidal ideation， delirium，hallucinations， or medical conditions. In her childhood，she had sternal reconstructive surgery and tonsillectomy. Also， there was no history of using medications， smoking cigarettes， using drugs， or a family history of sleep or psychiatric disorders.\n\n【16】The patient’s blood pressure was normal (80/110)， Body Mass Index (BMI) was 18 kg/m， neck circumference was 34 cm， the distance between the thyroid cartilage and the chin was 9 cm， and Mallampati score was 2.\n\n【17】Herscores in the Restless Legs Syndrome Screening Questionnaire， STOP-BANG Questionnaire， Insomnia Intensity Index， Epworth Sleepiness Score， and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were zero， one， nine， four， and three， respectively .\n\n【18】In polysomnography， various sleep parameters were assessed. ： The sleep parameters， including total sleep time， sleep latency， REM latency (the time between the onset of sleep and the first stage of REM sleep)， and Periodic Leg Movement index (PLMS； average frequent movements of the lower limbs in one hour of sleep) were normal. Heart rate was also normal and no snoring was reported. The number of sleep cycles， including both the REM and non-REM sleep， was also normal for the age of the patient. However， sleep efficacy (the ratio of a person's total sleep time to bed time) decreased slightly. AHI (the average of apnea and hypopnea per hour of sleep) was equal to seven， which is classified as mild OSA syndrome.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】The present study examined sleep parameters in a patient with asternia， which is an extremely rare condition that can develop alone or in conjunction with other malformations of abdominal wall， diaphragm， pericardium， or heart. The baby will have the highest chance of survival if diagnosed and treated early . The prevalence of asternia has been reported as one per 100，000 live births .\n\n【21】In fetal life， the sternum develops from the mesoderm's outer surface. In the tenth week， the cells from the two mesoderm bands on either side of the anterior chest wall migrate to the midline and fuse together to form the sternum. Primordia between the ventral ends of the growing clavicle produce the manubrium. The sternum columns fuse in a cephalocaudal manner. The sternal columns do not always unite in the middle， resulting in a complete sternal cleft . The etiology of the sternal cleft is unknown.\n\n【22】External clefts can be classified into three main groups： (A) sternal cleft without associated abnormalities； (B) thoracic or true ectopia cordis with varying degrees of sternal cleft where the heart is outside the thoracic wall； and (C) thoracoabdominal ectopia cordis， also known as POC .\n\n【23】In her childhood， the patient under study had her congenital sternal cleft corrected by posterior sternal wall plus chondral grafts plus total correction surgery.\n\n【24】During infancy and youth， the chest wal and upper airway alter to accommodate the growing organism's physiological needs. Compression is possible in the newborn's chest wall， which aids in the removal of pulmonary fluid. The adaptation rate of the chest wall in infants is three times that of the lung . This causes paradoxical movement ofthe chest inward， especially during Rapid Eye Movement(REM) sleep， which is associated with increased respiratory activity and decreased intercostal muscle activity during inhalation. The sternum and vertebrae ossify in the womb and continue until the age of 25， resulting in chest wall rigidity.\n\n【25】In our patient， the look of the chest was unaffected and there were no paradoxical chest motions. Children with upper airway obstruction sleep with more inconsistency compared to adults. Normal adolescents do not experience paradoxical internal chest movement during inhaling. The form of chest might also change during childhood. The ribs are placed horizontally in babies， resulting in a circular chest with limited expansion potential. As a result， at one month of age， the share of chest breathing current in non-REM sleep is just one-third of that in adults .\n\n【26】Tomohisa Nagasao et al. concluded that when the full length of the sternum is missing， chest breathing is substantiallyhampered，and that correction of the defect is required to treat the disorder. However， since the upper half of the sternum is more crucial for respiration， the upper part should be prioritized in reconstruction .\n\n【27】There are some limited studies on the respiratory disorders associated with sternal cleft. However， no studies have been carried out on sleep disorders in patients with asternia so far. Although some respiratory illnesses， such as sleep apnea， exclusively occur during sleep， practically all respiratory disorders， including upper airway obstruction， central hyperventilation， and chronic lung disease， get worse during sleep than wakefulness. Thus， the impact of sleep on breathing is a crucial concern because when we are awake， we breathe more deeply than sleeping； also， ventilation is reduced during sleep.\n\n【28】Respiratory drive is reduced and breathing becomes irregular， especially during the REM sleep. The respiratory rate and current volume are variable and are associated with recurrent central apnea. REM sleep is also associated with decreased intercostal and upper airway muscle tone. Therefore， breathing is impaired during sleep compared to wakefulness， and REM is more impaired during sleep. This is especially important in children， as they sleep more than adults and have relatively more REM sleep.\n\n【29】The patient under study was diagnosed as having normal sleep parameters， except for sleep efficacy and Apnea-Hypopnea Index(AHI). The patient’s AHI was indicative of mild OSA .\n\n【30】OSA is the most common sleep disorder characterized by recurrent collapse of the soft tissue in the rear of the throat during sleep. According to the latest research， its prevalence is 17% in women and 35% in men . These intermittent collapses reduce airflow， which lead to two consequences： Arousal in sleep to resume airflow， and gas exchange disorders caused by hypopnea (decreased breathing) or apnea (stopped breathing) . Frequent arousals in OSA lead to neurological cognitive consequences， such as decreased memory， daytime drowsiness， and decreased quality of life. However， the mechanisms contributing to these adverse outcomes are complex and not yet fully understood.\n\n【31】Also， Mallampati score was equal to 2 in our patient. This has been identified as an independent risk factor for OSA in previous studies， so that for each degree of increase in Mallampati score， the chance of OSA doubles ； this should be considered in the analysis of results.\n\n【32】Conclusion\n\n【33】This case report evaluated the parameters and sleep disorders in a patient with asternia. Considering the complications of this rare disease， it is essential to pay more attention to sleep disorders， especially sleep-related breathing disorders， in these patients. Further studies are needed to investigate the chest anatomy defects causing OSA syndrome in patients with congenital sternum cleft.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:41:54", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:42:13", "cost": 18.424}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:47", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:42:12", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:41:53"}

Although there are many treat options， they can only relieve symptoms， but not can modify the disease. Moreover， conventional treatment has limitations because of its adverse events. Therefore， it is necessary that development of Disease Modifying OA Drugs (DMOADs) with low adverse effects. To evaluate the effects of Membrane-Free Stem Cell Extract (MFSCE) on the clinical signs and cartilage regeneration of OA dogs. Thirty privately owned dogs with OA were separated into two groups；placebotreated group (n=6)， MFSCE treated group (n=22). All dogs were injected MFSCE or placebo once a week for 4 weeks in intra-articular. To evaluate the symptoms， dogs and owners were visit hospital at day 0， 7，14，21， and 28. The effect of MFSCE on pain relief was evaluated using pain score and pain at palpation score. Both symptoms were improved in MFSCE treated group while no significant changes in placebo treated group after 4 weeks treatment. The effect of MFSCE on physical function improvement was evaluated using behavior score， standing score， walking score， lameness score， and weight bearing score. All symptoms were improved in MFSCE treated group while no significant changes in placebo treated group after 4 weeks treatment. The effects of MFSCE on joint structure were evaluated using radiographic score. Joint structure was improved in MFSCE treated group while no significant changes in placebo treated group after 4 weeks treatment. There were no changes on general symptoms， symptoms of lesion， adverse events or general symptoms that can be occurred by injection，hematological parameter， and urinal parameters. Overall， these results， MFSCE could be the first-in-class DMOAD.\n\n【2】Keywords： Osteoarthritis； Membrane-free stem cell extract； Adipose-derived stem cells； Anti-inflammatory drugs\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Arthritis， defined as the disease affect to joints， is commonly occurred in both human and animals . Clinical symptoms of arthritis are included swelling， deformities， pain and stiffness of joint . Dogs show high prevalence of arthritis due to excessive exercise， injury， and genetic predisposition. It was reported that 25% of 77.2 million dogs has arthritis in United States . Arthritis is separated via etiology to Osteoarthritis (OA)， Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)， Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA)， Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) and Septic Arthritis (SA) . It is reported that， OA， chronic joint degenerative disease， is most common disease among the arthritis in dogs . Pathological symptoms of OA shown to be various symptoms such as progressive loss and destruction of articular cartilage， inflammation of synovium， and degeneration of ligaments and menisci of the knee etc.，.\n\n【5】There are some treatment options to treat the OA in dogs . Weight loss， exercise modification， and physical therapy can use as non-pharmaceutical therapy . In the severe dogs， surgery can be used for treatment. For the pharmaceutical therapy， Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs(NSAIDs) were used as standard therapy. However，NSAIDs has some limitations because of its adverse effects such as gastrointestinal ulceration . There are other pharmaceuticaloptions such as diacerein， corticosteroids，and hyaluronic acid. However，these pharmaceuticals also had limitations because they had also adverse effect and they been only relieving symptoms but not modifying disease . Therefore， many studies are conducted to development of alternative products which enhanced efficacy and safety.\n\n【6】The stem cell， which considered for new therapeutic strategy of OA， defined as undifferentiated multipotent cell . Among the various stem cells， Adipose-Derived Stem Cells (ADSC)， which divided from human adipose tissue， has been gotten attention because of its various advantages such as accessibility and abundance compared with other stem cells . Recent studies have provided some evidence that ADSCs are effective in the treatment of OA. Kriston-Pal et al. reported that intra-articular injection of allogenic ADSC with hyaluronan into OA dog shown the effect of lameness improvement and hyaline-type cartilage regeneration. However， there are some limitations such as instability of chondrocyte-like phenotypes， limited replicative lifespan， etc.，To overcome these limitation， various studies in progressed.\n\n【7】To overcome limitation of stem cell therapy， we developed Membrane-Free Stem Cell Extract (MFSCE)， which consist with252 peptides using patented technology about removing the cellular membrane of ADSC and purifying the peptides. In the previous studies， we identified the anti-inflammatory effect and cartilage regenerative effect of MFSCE in Interleukin-1a (IL-1a) induced OA in vitro model using rat primary cartilage cells . Moreover， MFSCE has shown the anti-inflammatory and regenerative effect in golf-injury patients . However， the effect of MFSCE on OA in canines not yet identified. In the present study， we evaluated the effect of MFSCE on OA through change of clinical sign in dogs. We also evaluated the adverse effects of MFSCE through change of general sign， hematological sign and urinalysis in dogs.\n\n【8】Materials and Methods\n\n【9】Preparation of MFSCE\n\n【10】The MFSCE was provided from T-Stem Co.， Ltd. (Changwon， Korea). The preparation was manufactured as previously described. Human ADSCs were separated from human adipose tissue which donated from healthy female aged twenties. All donors had to complete blood test for check compatibility. ADSCs were cultured in5% CO2 and 37°C condition. ADSCs were harvested at the passages of 5 to 7 to using for MFSCE. Cells membranes were removed using ultra sonication and centrifugation，and intracellular peptides，named MFSCE， were collected using filtration. The aqueous solution of MFSCE was further lyophilized and stored in powder form. Non-toxicity of MFSCE， the final product， was identified via 9 safety tests performed by the Good Laboratory Practice accreditation authority.\n\n【11】Experimental design\n\n【12】The study was conducted in compliance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. All owners were required to sign an informed consent form for the clinical trials before enrolling their animals in the study. The protocol was approved by the Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency of Korea.\n\n【13】Twenty-eight dogs with spontaneous occurred OA were enrolled in the study. To OA was evaluated using radiographic and clinical sign. Dogs that had other knee disease， treated with NSAIDs or corticosteroids within 14 days before enrolment， or pregnancy or likelihood of becoming pregnant during the study were excluded. For ethical reasons，dogs were analgesictreated or excluded from the study according to change of general symptoms or symptoms of lesion， and occurring infectious disease and adverse events. Characteristics of dogs which completed the study were shown in Table 1. There are no significant differences of characteristics between placebo and MFSCE groups at TO.\n\n【14】Dogs were separated into two groups； placebo treated group (n=6)， MFSCE treated group (n=22). The MFSCE treated group was injected with 100 mg/2 mL of MFSCE (dissolved with phosphate buffer solution (PBS)) in intra-articular while placebo treated group was injected with 2 mL of PBS in intra-articular. All dogs were treated once a week for 4 weeks. To evaluate the symptoms， dogs and owners were visit hospital at day 0， 7，14，21，and 28.

Pain score of MFSCE treated group was significantly decreased after 28 days treatment (0.41±0.11) compared with 0 day (2.09 ±0.13) while no changes was shown in placebo treated group (1.50±0.22 at 0 dayand1.67 ±0.21 at 28 day) as shown in Figure 2.\n\n【52】We also evaluated the pain reliefeffect for palpation via behavioral changes in response to palpation. Pain at palpation score of MFSCE treated group was significantly decreased after 28 days treatment(0.18±0.08) compared with 0 day (1.41±0.11)while no changes was shown in placebo treated group (1.00±0.02 at 0 day and 1.00 ±0.02at 28 day) as shown in Figure 3.\n\n【53】The effect of MFSCE on physical function improvement\n\n【54】To identify the effect of MFSCE on the OA， we evaluated the physical function improvement effect via behavioral changes. Behavior score of MFSCE treated group was significantly decreased after 28 days treatment (0.91±0.15) compared with 0 day (2.05±0.23) while no changes was shown in placebo treated group (1.50 ±0.22 at 0 day and 1.50 ±0.22 at 28 day) as shown in Figure 4.\n\n【55】Next， we evaluated the physical function improvement effect via behavioral changes in the situation at standing. Standing score of MFSCE treated group was significantly decreased after 28 days or MFSCE was injected in intra-articular once a week for 28 days (Placebo； n=6；MFSCE：n=22). The data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation of the mean (P<0.05). mean (P<0.05).\n\n【56】treatment (0.27±0.10) compared with 0 day (1.82 ± 0.16) while no changes was shown in placebo treated group (1.00±0.01 at 0 day and1.00±0.01 at 28 day) as shown in Figure 5. of MFSCE treated group was significantly decreased after 28 days treatment (0.45±0.13) compared with 0 day (2.23 ±0.24) while no changes was shown in placebo treated group (1.17±0.17 at 0 dayand1.33±0.21 at 28 day) as shown in Figure 6.\n\n【57】We also evaluated the physical function improvement effect via behavioral changes in the situation at walking. Walking score\n\n【58】Next， we evaluated the physical function improvement effect via or MFSCE was injected in intra-articular once a week for 28 days (Placebo： n=6；MFSCE：n=22). The data are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation of the mean (P<0.05).\n\n【59】(B). Placebo or MFSCE was injected in intra-articular once a week for 28 days (Placebo： n=6； MFSCE： n=22).

Lameness score of MFSCE treated group was significantly decreased after 28 days treatment (0.50±0.14) compared with 0 day (2.55± 0.23) while no changes was shown in placebo treated group (1.16±0.17 at 0 day and1.33 ±0.21 at 28 day) as shown in Figure 7.\n\n【60】Weight bearing score of MFSCE treatedgroup was also significantly decreased after 28 days treatment (0.55±0.14) compared with 0 day (2.41±0.18) while no changes was shown in placebo treated group (1.83±0.17 at 0 day and 1.67 ±0.21 at 28 day) as shown in Figure 8.\n\n【61】The effect of MFSCE on joint structure\n\n【62】To identify the effect of MFSCE on the OA， we evaluated the joint structure using X-ray. Radiographic score of MFSCE treated group was significantly decreased after 28 days treatment (1.27± 0.13) compared with 0 day (2.73±0.15) while no changes was shown in placebo treated group (2.00±0.37 at 0 day and 2.00±0.37 at 28 day) as shown in Figure 9.\n\n【63】Adverse effect of MFSCE\n\n【64】There were no changes on general symptoms， symptoms oflesion， adverse events or general symptoms that can be occurred by injection， hematological parameter， and urinal parameters. Therefore， MFSCE has no adverse effects.\n\n【65】Discussion\n\n【66】This is the first study that demonstrated the treatment effect of MFSCE on OA without adverse effects in dogs. All clinical symptoms related with OA such as pain， physical function and radiography were significantly improved after 28 days treatment. Even so， no changes in any general symptoms， adverse events， hematological parameters， and urinalysis parameters were seen after 28 days treatment.\n\n【67】In the present study， we evaluated the various clinical symptoms with reference of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities(WOMAC) osteoarthritis index for identify the effect of MFSCE on OA. WOMAC which is consist with 24 questions for evaluate the pain， stiffness， and physical functioning of joint， is the most widely identified in OA. Matrix Metalloproteinase (MMP) is the proteolytic enzymes whichare occurred cartilage destruction through degradation of collagen，aggrecan，and various proteoglycans in OA . It was reported that MMP-3andMMP-13were increased in OA.MMP-13 is the main proteinase which is directly related with degradation of collagen， aggrecan and proteoglycans in OA cartilage ， while MMP-3 can help the MMP-13 to degrade cartilage components . In the previous study， it was identified that MFSCE decreased MMP-3 and MMP-13 gene and protein level in IL-1a induced OA in vitro model . Furthermore， we also identified that MFSCE inhibited the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-KB) and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs) signaling pathway which are regulated the MMP levels . Therefore， it was suggested that MFSCE may inhibit the progress of OA through inhibition of MMPs. Another molecular mechanism which related with cartilage formation is SRY-type high-mobility group box-9 (SOX-9) which is control chondrogenesis. SOX-9 expressed in pre-chondrogenic mesenchyme and fully differentiated chondrocytes . It was reported that the expression level of SOX-9 was lower in OA chondrocytes . Moreover， overexpression of SOX-9 in explant cultures of OA articular cartilage increased collagen and proteoglycan expression level similar with normal cartilage . Therefore， it was considered that increasing SOX-9 expression is important treat target for cartilage regeneration. In the previous study， MFSCE increased SOX-9 gene and protein level in IL-1a induced OA in vitro model . Therefore， it was suggested that MFSCE may promote cartilage regeneration through increasing SOX-9 level. In conclusion， MFSCE may improve the OA through not only inhibit the progress of OA but also increase the cartilage regeneration.\n\n【68】Many researches for the Development Disease-Modifying OA Drug (DMOAD) were progressed； however， it was still not developed because OA has complex pathogenic mechanism . It was reported that， stem cell can promote cartilage regeneration by various mechanisms . It also has been reported that transplanted stem cells can replace the damaged cartilage through differentiate to target cell . Recently， it was identified that stem cells can be affect to cartilage regeneration through release the paracrine molecules such as growth factor and thrombospondin . Furthermore， stem cells can modulate the immune response through release the cytokines . However， although the stem cell had attention as a new DMOAD， there are still some limitations . To treat OA using stem cells， it has to be attached on the lesion， and has to be differentiated and proliferated. However， these processes are affected by various factors such as cell condition， growth condition， amount of stem cell and other endogenous factors . Moreover， stem cell can be differentiated unexpected cell because of its multi-potentiality. Because of these various limitations， stem cell therapy has been difficulties to development. In the present study， we evaluated the cartilage regenerative effect using radiography. As shown in Figure 10， joint structure was improved and cartilage was regenerated28 days after MFSCE treatment. We suggested that MFSCE may act as paracrine factor released from stem cell to regulate cartilage regeneration and immune response. Moreover， we identified that MFSCE did not shown any toxicity performed at the GLP institution(data not shown). Therefore， MFSCE may alternate the stem cell therapy because it overcomes the limitations of stem cell therapy.\n\n【69】In this study， we found that 4 weeks treatment of MFSCE not only improve clinical sign of OA but also regenerate cartilage with no significant adverse effects. In addition， previous studies have confirmed the mechanism of action of MFSCE on OA， and the non-toxicity. Therefore， MFSCE could be the first-in-class DMOAD.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:44:48", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:45:29", "cost": 40.701}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:47", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:45:28", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:44:47"}

Large defects in adult patients with pulmonary hypertension need careful anatomic studies before making decisions for treatment， because small rims may result in device embolization. We present the case of a female patient， 43 years old， who came to our hospital for having progressive shortness of breath. The study revealed a large ostium secundum ASD with significant left to right shunt and pulmonary hypertension. Transesophageal echocardiography showed small posterior and inferior rims. We performed a retrospective-ECG gated cardiac CT study and asked for 3D printing of the whole atria . Figure 1 shows the right and left atrial views of the septum. Figure 2 shows the right view together with a classical scheme of atrial remnants. Posterior and inferior rims were considered small but we thought in mind that it could adjust adequately to the device. To prove this， we performed on the 3D printing a virtual closure with a24 mm Amplatz device . Once in place， we performed manual maneuvers of pulling and pushing to test the stability of the device which resulted firmly attached. After this test we decided to try percutaneous closure in the patient.\n\n【2】Under mild anesthesia we performed cardiac catheterization with trans-esophageal echo monitoring in given moments. Two venous and one arterial femoral access allowed simultaneous pressure recordings . The QP/QS was 2， 3 and the pulmonary artery pressure was 60 de Lezo.

Figure 2： Anatomic details of the septum. mmHg/40 mmHg. Figure 5 shows sequential angiograms during the procedure. Then， we implanted a 24 mm Amplatz device. Before deployment， under echo and radiological monitoring， we performed pull and push maneuvers  that confirmed an adequate stability of the device. Finally， the device was deployed and remained stable. Figure 7 shows the echographic final result. After closure， the systemic pressure increased slightly and the pulmonary pressure did not initially decreased.

For large ASD closure in adult patients with pulmonary hypertension， the study of septal anatomy is crucial. Small remnants of the atrial septum may recommend surgical treatment as a first choice. However， conventional image techniques not always are as precise as needed for a firm decision. This patient is a good example of how cardiac CT-derived 3D printing may help in decision making. The 3D printing allowed us to touch the rims， select the size of a possible percutaneous device and test， with a virtual closure， how would be after deployment the stability of the device and the degree of accommodation and attachment to the septum. Following this experiment， we became convinced that percutaneous closure was our first choice for treatment. During the procedure， all maneuvers performed before deployment confirmed the good stability of the implanted device.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:42:07", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:42:16", "cost": 9.167}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:47", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:42:16", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:42:06"}

Major bleeding， including pericardial bleeding with PT， is a known adverse effect of antithrombotic therapy， e.g.， heparin， thrombolytic agents， and anticoagulants. Pericardial bleeding (hemopericardium) with subsequent Pericardial Tamponade(PT) is a rare but life-threaten ing condition that requires emergency pericardiocentesis.\n\n【2】Case Report： We describe a 44-year-old woman who was admitted to our Emergency Department(ED) after syncope. Eleven days before， she was treated for Pulmonary Embolism (PE) with low molecular weight heparin，recombinant plasminogen activator，and apixaban and had an uneventful course. The patient was promptly diagnosed with PT by use of transthoracic echocardiography and treated with acute pericardiocentesis.\n\n【3】Conclusion： We aim to highlight this delayed and potentially fatal complication of anticoagulant and/or thrombolytic treatment. PT should be considered in patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with circulatory shock， while receiving antithrombotic therapy. Rapid diagnosis of PT is of paramount importance and echocardiography should be immediately available in the ED as well as access to acute pericardiocentesis. Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE) is the most important imaging modality for assessing the presence of pericardial effusion and its severity and in the case of severe effusion leading to PT.\n\n【4】Keywords： Cardiac tamponade； Pulmonary embolism； Apixaban； Reteplase\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Major bleeding is an adverse effect of heparin， thrombolytics， and anticoagulants. Pericardial bleeding (hemopericardium) with subsequent Pericardial Tamponade (PT) is a rare but life-threatening condition that has been described after thrombolytic treatment， primarily in patients with ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction or stroke . Major bleeding during the use of vitamin K antagonists or Direct Oral Anticoagulants (DOAC) is also a well-established risk and for several therapeutic indications， e.g. non-valvular atrial fibrillation， deep venous thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism (PE)， DOACs have become preferred anticoagulation agents owing to lower risk of major bleeding， availability of fixed dosages， fewer drug interactions， faster onset of action and shorter drug half-lives . Heparin， thrombolytic agents， and anticoagulants all have indications for treatment of PE where their use is associated with improved survival . However， use of these agents entails risk of major bleeding including rare cases of pericardial bleeding with PT.\n\n【7】We here report a case of PT caused by pericardial bleeding eleven days after treatment ofPE with unfractionated heparins and thrombolytic therapy， followed by a DOAC. This case underscores that in patients receiving antithrombotic therapy and presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with circulatory shock， PT should be considered. Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE) is the most important imaging modality for assessing the presence of pericardial effusion and its severity and in the case of severe effusion leading to PT； emergency pericardiocentesis is a life-saving procedure.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 44-year-old woman was evaluated at our ED because of a sudden and unannounced syncope. Her medical history included endometriosis treated with hormonal IUD and desogestrel， and infrequent migraine.\n\n【10】Eleven days before admission， the patient was diagnosed with a large saddle PE at another hospital. TTE at that time showed a dilated Right Ventricle (RV)， D-shaped left ventricular cavity，with abnormal Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion (TAPSE) of 1.1 cm. The ECG revealed new-onset incomplete right bundle branch block. She received tinzaparin 175 IE/kg subcutaneously. The following day the patient was tachycardia with increased shortness of breath and decreased systolic blood pressure to 90 mmHg to100mmHg. Accordingly， thrombolytic therapy was administered with two intravenous boluses of 10 E reteplase over 5 min administered in a peripheral vein. The rest of the hospital course was uneventful and during the admission， there were only slightly abnormal liver tests . The patient was discharged after five days with apixaban 10mg twice per day.\n\n【11】On evaluation in our ED after the syncope， the patient was awake and alert in moderate distress with dyspnea and chest pain. Heart rate was 119 beats per minute， blood pressure 118/97 mmHg， respiratory rate 17 per minute， and oxygen saturation 98% while the patient was breathing ambient air. The ECG showed sinus rhythm with low voltage of the QRS-complexes .\n\n【12】The patient was initially treated with a rapid infusion of intravenous fluids and antibiotics for suspected septic shock， possibly induced by a post-hospital-acquired infection. However， after four hours the condition quickly deteriorated with signs of hemodynamic collapse with a rapid drop in blood pressure， increased dyspnea， and acute hypoxemic respiratory failure with an oxygen saturation of 85% and arterial blood metabolic acidosis despite conventional oxygen therapy . Therefore， high-flow nasal oxygen 50 L/min was started. Abnormal liver biochemical tests were also apparent suggestive of acute liver failure .\n\n【13】Acute TTE showed PT with a massive circumferential pericardial effusion measuring up to 3 cm to 4 cm and compressing cardiac chambers and the RV in particular . Apixaban was discontinued and the patient was immediately transferred for emergency pericardiocentesis at the Trauma Centre in the Capital Region of Denmark. Here， 1200 ml of blood-containing fluid was drained leading to immediate improvement of the condition. During the next four hours， another 400 ml of pericardial fluid was drained. Two days later， the pericardial sac was re-drained for another 1，150ml of blood-containing pericardial fluid. On day three， no signs of bleeding from the pericardium were apparent on repeat TTE. Therefore， tinzaparin 7000 IE twice daily was administered. A CT pulmonary angiogram revealed small remnants of arterial thrombosis in segmental arteries of both lungs and a segmental pulmonary infarction in the right lung. The patient remained hospitalized for ten days and was discharged with tinzaparin treatment. Further evaluation in the outpatient clinic showed normalization ofliver tests and no signs of malignancy or thrombophilia. Forty-two days after discharge， the patient's tinzaparin was discontinued and rivaroxaban20 mg daily was administered with subsequent uneventful complete recovery.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】Eleven days before the present admission with PT， the patient received heparin， thrombolysis， and DOAC for PE， with subsequent\n\n| Timeline  | Description  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Day -11  | Diagnosed with a large saddle pulmonary embolism.Echocardiography.

In PE， thrombolytic therapy leads to faster improvement of pulmonary artery obstruction compared with heparin alone . The indication for thrombolysis in PE is determined by clinical instabilityand RV dysfunction . Therefore， thrombolytic treatment for PE was well-indicated in the current case at the first admission and this condition quickly improved hereafter.\n\n【21】Major bleedingincludingintracranialhemorrhageafter thrombolysis for PE is a rare albeit well-known complication . Various risk score systems have focused on major bleeding risk factors after thrombolysis after PE including advanced age， recent major bleeding， ongoing antithrombotic therapy， cancer，syncope，and renal dysfunction . The major bleeding event in the present case was PT. This complication of thrombolytic therapy has been described in patients with myocardial infarction within 1 to 2 days after treatment . On the other hand， in patients with PE the occurrence of PT was not reported in the last Cochrane review of the safety and efficacy of thrombolytic therapy . Also， reports on risk score to predict major bleeding in PE patients receiving systemic thrombolysis did not report PT . After the admission with PE， the patient was discharged with a DOAC (apixaban) according to current treatment guidelines. PT during treatment with DOACs is a rare complication and elderly males with renal and coagulation abnormalities appear to be at highest risk .\n\n【22】Our patient was diagnosed with PT eleven days after treatment of PE with pharmacological thrombolysis (reteplase) and subsequent administration of DOAC (apixaban). Major bleeding complications usually occur 24 h to 48 h after thrombolytic treatment in patients with acute myocardial infarction or stroke .\n\n【23】Randomized comparisons of DOACs are not available but after treatment of PT， the patient received low molecular weight heparin for weeks and then another DOAC-rivaroxaban without recurrent bleeding or other complications.\n\n【24】Conclusion\n\n【25】In patients receiving antithrombotic therapy， PT should be considered among the rare causes of circulatory shock. Immediate access to TTE and pericardiocentesis remains a clinical imperative in these cases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:45:01", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:45:19", "cost": 18.182}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:47", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:45:18", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:45:00"}

Clinical presentation of abdominal localization is variable especially when it occurs in children and may represent a rare cause of secondary arterial hypertension.\n\n【2】Case Report： We report a case of abdominal aortic coarctation diagnosed precociously in a 9 years old girl， who had showed non-specific symptoms. She complained dyspnea， retrosternal pain just before to fall asleep and palpitations and night fears， suggesting a diagnosis of anxiety attacks due to restarting of school time. We found accidentally increased blood pressure values in one evening ieasurement and confirmed by ambulatory blood pressure recording. So we started diagnostic process for differential diagnosis of hypertension causes and diagnosed abdominal coarctation， first suggested by an abnormal upper/lower extremities ratio and confirmed by CT and then by Angio-MRI.\n\n【3】Discussion： Aortic coarctation has a variable clinical presentation， depending on the severity and the site of obstruction. Abdominal aortic coarctations usually cause signs or symptoms during the second decade of life； the mean age of diagnosis is 22 years while our patient was just 9 years old. In our case， clinical presentation was not initially typical for aortic coarctation， because symptoms might suggest a generic diagnosis of anxiety attacks. Hypertension is not a frequent condition in children； when it is present， it’s often a secondary form， so it needs a deep differential diagnosis process.\n\n【4】Conclusion： Abdominal aortic coarctation is a rare pediatric clinical condition， very difficult to identify because of its rarity and its variable symptoms. Essential was the occasional discovery of high blood pressure levels confirmed with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. This element guided the diagnostic process to the research of causes ofhypertension and allowed us to obtain the correct diagnosis.\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Abdominal aortic coarctation is a rare localization，the most common site of aortic coarctation occurs immediately distally to the origin of the left subclavian artery， while abdominal localization represents quite a an infrequent form that can be on a congenital basis ， but may also be acquired.\n\n【7】Clinicalpresentation ofabdominallocalization is variable and may include arterialhypertension， heart failure， murmur， claudication， diminished femoral pulses and a leg blood pressure equal to or lower than arms We report a rare case of abdominal aortic coarctation diagnosed in a child who had showed apparently non-specific symptoms： anxiety attacks.\n\n【8】When patient was admitted in our hospital，parents signed consent to the processing of personal data of the children.\n\n【9】A 9 years old girl was referred to our hospital for dyspnea and retrosternal pain just before to fall asleep. The patient had a more recent history of recurring similar episodes， characterized by palpitations and night fears， in addiction to mild chest pain and short breathing difficulty； these symptoms should have suggested to run cardiac clinical and instrumental examinations but remote pathological anamnesis was characterized by transient patent ductus arteriosus with six-monthly cardiologic follow-up until the age of 5years. For this reason only electrocardiogram was performed and a generic diagnosis of anxiety attacks due to restarting of school time had been the first diagnosis. Parents decided to ask a second opinion.\n\n【10】On admission， her general conditions were good. Heart auscultation noted a 1/6 systolic murmur at base of heart. Laboratory exams， spirometry， electrocardiogram and echocardiography were normal. During the first day of hospitalization we found an increased arterial blood pressure value in the evening and for this reason an ambulatory blood pressure recording was performed that finally revealed a before now undiagnosed hypertension. We completed diagnostic process for differential diagnosis of hypertension causes. The exams showed a normal renal function， aregular circadian rhythm of plasmatic cortisol levels and normal aldosterone blood levels； higher renin levels were found in clinostatism and in orthostatism(respectively 47，10 uUI/ml and 125，40 uUI/ml). In the while we assessed an abnormal difference in blood pressures between the upper and lower extremities： arterial blood pressure was 120/84 mmHg at right arm and 90/73 mmHg at right leg. A new Echocardiography excluded isthmic aortic coarctation； in effect there was a much rarer， especially in child， abdominal localization of aortic coarctation. Doppler vascular abdominal echography and contrasted-enhanced CT of chest and abdomen showed an isolate significant stenosis of abdominal aorta， with the stenotic tract originating vertebral arteries； this picture was confirmed by MRI and Angiography .\n\n【11】Once made the diagnosis， the patient has started a Ca-antagonist treatment to manage hypertension， while waiting for the choice of when and which kind of bypass correction.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Coarctation of aorta comprises 5% to 10% of congenital cardiac lesions  but if we consider only coarctation involving the abdominal aorta they are much rarer with a rate of 2% of all coarctations.\n\n【14】Abdominal aortic coarctations clinical presentation is variable， depending on the severity and the site of obstruction. Usually cause signs or symptoms during the second decade of life； the mean age of diagnosis is 22 years while our patient was just 9 years old. If untreated， this condition has been associated with stroke，progressive left ventricular hypertrophy with congestive heart failure and flash pulmonary edema， and less often with renal insufficiency. In one review， 55% ofuntreated patients died at a mean age of 34 years .\n\n【15】Symptoms of aortic coarctations are related to the kind and site：in the neonatal isthmic severe localization there are early symptoms and signs of heart failure and respiratory distress such as tachypnea， grunting， retractions，pale skin ，heavy sweating，diminished or absent lower extremity pulses， increased upper extremity pulses， difficulty in feeding But in the adult post isthmic form patients may remain for long time almost asymptomatic or may present headache， systemic hypertension， nose bleeding， muscle weakness， cold feet， leg cramps and claudication； in effect our patient after diagnosis realized to have suffered of leg cramps. Physical examination can note strong upper body pulses and diminished or absent leg pulses， which are corroborated by a difference in blood pressures between the upper and lower extremities. After infancy， the systolic blood pressure in the lower extremities is usually higher (5 to 20 mm Hg)  than in the upper extremities as a result of the standing wave effect. If the leg systolic blood pressure is equal to or lower than the arm pressure， the diagnosis of aortic coarctation should be considered ， like in our patient， who presented a systolic pressure gradient of about 30mmHg in legs.\n\n【16】In our case， clinical presentation and the history of frequent“normal Echocardiograms\"contributed to mislead an early diagnosis also because specific symptoms began to be evident just before school restarting suggesting a generic diagnosis of anxiety attacks that， according to parents’ feelings， conformed with the irritable disposition of the preadolescent girl. Panic or anxiety disorders may be characterized by recurrent unexpected episodes of severe anxiety， which typicaly reach their peak within 10 minutes and last around30-45 minutes . These symptoms can look similar to those referred by our patient， who lamented an anxiety state associated to dyspnea and heart rate acceleration. Luckily in this case a new complete extended evaluation of the patient， including blood pressure ambulatory monitoring， thanks to the individuation of high blood pressure quickly redirected the diagnosis： in fact hypertension is not a frequent condition in children with a prevalence ranging from 4% to17%. The probability of a secondary hypertension is inversely proportional to the age of the patient and directly proportional to blood pressure levels ； but a rare abdominal aortic coarctation caused just an apparently mild hypertension in this girl.\n\n【17】Regarding abdominal coarctation， we can suppose to have diagnosed a congenital form. Considering the acquired forms， they have been associated with pathologies such as Takayasu syndrome， William’s syndrome， neurofibromatosis， fibromuscular dysplasia， retroperitoneal fibrosis， and mucopolysaccharidosis . In our case we could exclude neurofibromatosis， mucopolysaccharidosis and Williams’s syndrome because of absence of typical stigmata； so the differential considerations are limited to Takayasu arteritis and non-inflammatory aorto-arteriopathy， such as fibromuscular dysplasia . Takayasu arteritis usually is multi distrectual and it can be differentiated from fibromuscular dysplasia for the general inflammatory state and by histologic examination . The only therapeutic differences between the two conditions would be the use of anti-inflammatory therapy in Takayasu arteritis. D'Souza et al.  with a study in 1998 conclude that differentiating between Takayasu arteritis and fibromuscular dysplasia may not be as important as the management itself of aortic coarctation .\n\n【18】Management decisions for patients with coarctation of the aorta depend upon patient age， presentation， and the severity of the lesion. Medical therapy consists in hypertension management with antihypertensive drugs (beta-blockers， ACE inhibitors， angiotensin-receptor blockers or Ca Antagonist)， waiting to choose the best surgical option. There are different methods for the treatment of aortic coarctation， including surgical repair or percutaneous balloon angioplasty with or without stent placement . Surgical repair of coarctation can be achieved by several techniques： resection with end-to-end anastomosis， subclavian flap aortoplasty in infants with long-segment coarctation， a bypass graft across the area of coarctation when the distance to be bridged is too long for an end-to-end repair or prosthetic patch aortoplasty. Balloon angioplasty has been recommended as the preferred treatment for children andadults with native coarctation or recoarctation after surgery . It has been suggested that stenting after balloon angioplasty lowers the risk for complications and has a beneficial effect on long-term survival. However， primary stenting has an important limitation which is the failure to adapt to the growing vessel in a child. To overcome this problem， redilatation during follow-up has been described . In our case stent implantation can’t be realized because vertebral arteries originate from the stenotic tract， so we have to exclude this option. She will need to bypass the stenotic tract with the addition of all the implications connected with the growth of the girl. In this while the patient has begun antihypertensive therapy with Ca-antagonists， in order to manage arterial blood hypertension.\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】Abdominalaortic coarctation is a rare pediatric clinical condition that can be quite difficult to identify because of its rarity and its variable symptomatology. Anamnesis and physical examination are the first steps to approach any patient. Our case presented initially non-specific clinical features.

Once Streptococcus and Bacteroides fragilis were found positive in the cultures obtained from the paracentesis， exploratory laparotomy was done to determine source infection however yielded no new additional findings. Post-operation， patient was found to have fecal matter draining in her pigtail catheter and right Jackson-Pratt drain from her abdomen， possibly due to enteric fistula formation. Patient continued to have ascites and fecal matter drainage despite interventions and antibiotics， leading to a diagnosis of chronic peritonitis.\n\n【2】Keywords： Chronic peritonitis； Peritonitis； Cryptogenic cirrhosis\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Chronic peritonitis is a disease manifested by chronic toxemia that may be infectious or chemical. It has been shown to be prevalent in about 10% ofpatients with cirrhotic ascites  similar to our patient with cirrhosis. Clinically，patients with chronic peritonitis will present with bouts of colic due to an accumulation of exudate. This may cause a visible distension of the stomach.\n\n【5】Chronic peritonitis increases risk and can also be caused by infection. Infection can be from Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP)， defined as an infection of ascitic fluid (PMN>250/mm²in ascitic fluid and positive bacterial cultures in blood， urine or sputum). The presence of SBP is typically linked to patients with cirrhosis and ascites who develop symptoms of fever， abdominal tenderness and hepatic encephalopathy . Our patient of interest presented with signs， symptoms， and evidence that eventually led the diagnosis of chronic peritonitis.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】The patient is a 78-year-old Hispanic female with a past medical history of cryptogenic cirrhosis with ascites， congestive heart failure， atrial fibrillation， chronic respiratory failure and type 2 diabetes mellitus who presented to the emergency department on with abdominal pain after a fall. The patient was walking on the stairs 6 days prior and fell off the second stair after a bout of dizziness，striking the left side of her body. There was no head trauma or loss of consciousness， shortness of breath or palpitations. The patient also denied any chest pain prior to the fall. Nevertheless， subsequent lower left quadrant pain ensued and worsened on Valsalva maneuver. Patient was on Lasix and Spironolactone with last paracentesis two weeks before presentation at the emergency department.\n\n【8】Patient's review of systems was unremarkable except for abdominal pain， her chief complaint. The patient denied any allergies and had a previous surgical history of a cesarean section. She occasionally used tobacco but denied drug and alcohol usage.\n\n【9】On physical examination， the patient was tachycardic with mild increased work of breathing at rest. The patient had a non-tender， distended abdomen with trace bilateral lower extremity pitting edema. All other physical exams were unremarkable.\n\n【10】Initial X-ray of the patient's chest showed no significant changes indicating no acute events. Following initial work up， Computed Tomography (CT) scans of the patient’s abdomen and pelvis without contrast showed cirrhotic morphology of the liver with evidence of portal hypertension and moderate diffuse ascites. There was no evidence of acute intra-abdominal hemorrhage or organ damage and an indeterminate 7 mm hypodense lesion in the right lower lobe.\n\n【11】Based on the patient's presentation and workup， we began to consider a diagnosis of recurrent ascites secondary to cryptogenic cirrhosis or hepatorenal syndrome.\n\n【12】The following day， patient had a paracentesis procedure which drained 900 cc of cloudy fluid. Patient still reported continued abdominal pain. The clinical picture remained the same as she was still able to ambulate on her own. We considered other causes of her pain upon initial management of the patient however they were lower on our differentials. Patient's electrolytes continued to remain imbalanced during this time， likely due to her having AKI. Three days later a paracentesis was performed draining 1500 cc of fluid and as she continued to be distended other procedures were done to drain1080 and 800 cc of fluid. Bacterial cultures were drawn from the ascitic fluid which yielded positive for Streptococcus anginosus and Bacteroides fragilis.\n\n【13】After bacterial cultures tested positive， this shifted our reasoning to SBP. Patients with SBP typically present with severe constant pain； this pain in our patient could have been originally masked with the heavy ascitic fluid burden. Upon admission， patient was originally on Rocephin， however was switched to Zosyn for added Pseudomonas coverage. This was supported by the infectious disease physician on the case. Her condition did not improve despite prolonged antibiotic therapy and her pain continued to fluctuate. This led us move away from the SBP differential.\n\n【14】Another differential that was considered because of the patient's age and inconclusive imaging was peritoneal carcinomatosis. We ordered CA-19-9， CA-125， and CEA to gain a better clinical picture. CA-125 was found to be elevated in this patient. However， this tumor marker is not specific enough to lead to a conclusive diagnosis. This was supported the oncologist on the case.\n\n【15】During this time general surgery was consulted as the patient reported an increase in her baselineabdominal pain as well as a general decline in her overall health. Surgery was considered as patient had an acute abdomen. Exploratory laparotomy revealed many adhesions along with localized inflammations however no evidence of bowel perforations. Two Jackson-Pratt drains were placed on the right and left side of her abdomen. After surgery， the patient’s symptoms however did not improve.\n\n【16】We continued to monitor her laboratory values and her vital signs however they showed no improvement. Patient showed no overall improvement leading us to a final diagnosis of chronic peritonitis. Patient was switched from Intravenous Zosyn to Augmentin PO and was transferred to hospice.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】Ascites is the most common complication of cirrhosis， has mortality rate of 40% at 1 year and 50% at 2 years， indicating a poor prognosis . There are many causes of cirrhosis and ascites， including cryptogenic cirrhosis.\n\n【19】Cirrhosis affects more than 600，000 people in US； cryptogenic cirrhosis likely accounts for 5% to 30% of these cases 1. The word“Cryptogenic”originates from the Greek word “kryptos\"meaning something hidden or secret . Its name describes that cryptogenic cirrhosis is rare and a diagnosis of exclusion . Cryptogenic cirrhosis and NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis) have a high correlation. Cryptogenic cirrhosis and NASH are predominantly seen in women between 55 to 60 years of age that are obese (45% to 48%) and have diabetes (40% to 50%). Similar to our patient， who also had diabetes and obesity (BMI 30.73). Once cryptogenic cirrhosis is diagnosed， prognosis is often poor； in study by Rinaldi et al.  the median survival was 60 months.\n\n【20】Peritoneal carcinomatosis can also be a cause for ascites. Malignant ascites is a grave prognostic sign and is associated with ovarian， colorectal， pancreatic and uterine cancer . Peritoneal carcinomatosis is a type of malignancy that allows other tumors to spread into the peritoneal tissue. Common symptoms typically seen in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis is abdominal distension， abdominal pain， fatigue， and weight gain due to fluid overload. We initially considered this differential diagnosis as primary imaging studies did not reveal a localized source of infection. The patient also had worsening abdominal distension even after numerous paracentesis. Ultimately， our team moved away from this differential when bacterial cultures came back positive for S. anginosus and B. fragilis in the ascitic fluid.\n\n【21】SBP is another risk associated with ascites. It is one of the leading causes of death in patients with cirrhosis. SBP is a primary cause of peritonitis； other causes include iatrogenic contamination without macro defect in the GI tract . This iatrogenic contamination was also seen in our patient postlaparoscopic surgery because of persistent fecal material drainage present in only one oftwo Jackson-Pratt drains and pigtail catheter. We had SBP high on our differential list because of our patient's past medical history of cirrhosis and abrupt onset of clinical symptoms. After our patient's paracentesis procedure， bacterial cultures were drawn from the ascitic fluid. Cultures were positive for Staphylococcus anginosus， which is not commonly isolated from patients who have SBP. The patient had an elevated WBC count during this time as well as being hemodynamically unstable. Treatment was initiated with IV antibiotics for SBP. The patient however did not respond to the antibiotic treatment and remained distended with diffuse abdominal pain throughout hospital course \n\n【22】Conclusion\n\n【23】After working through our differentials of cryptogenic cirrhosis， malignancy， and SBP， the patient was deemed to have chronic peritonitis with persistent ascites. This was a diagnosis of exclusion. Patient was stabilized and transferred to hospice care.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:43:00", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:43:20", "cost": 19.691}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:47", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:43:19", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:42:59"}

It frequently involves the scalp and face. Wilson-Jones in itially described a separate subgroup of angiosarcoma involving scalp of elderly patients and confined to skin and soft tissues only . Various etiologic factors have been suggested， however many patients are not found to be associated with any pre-existing conditions . The presentation of patients is variable . As it possesses a relatively benign nature and rarity of incident it is diagnosed late and in advanced stages. We are reporting a case of 70 yr female presented with angiosarcoma ofthe scalp.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 70 yr female patient presented to the outpatient department with the scalp swelling with occasional episodes of bleeding. The patient noticed this swelling 6 months back during combing of her hair when some bleeding took place. The patient went to some quack for treatment where the patient received periodic dressing after which it subsided. But later it again reappeared and then increased in size with more frequent episodes of bleeding， even with minor trauma.\n\n【7】On examination， a 6 cm x5 cmx1 cm lesion was seen over left parieto-occipital region of the scalp. It was brownish black in color， firm to feel with central part oflesion showing ulceration with irregular margins and bleeding was noticed on palpation . Rest of the scalp was normal. There were no cervical lymph nodes palpable. Contrast enhanced CT head was done. It showed a heterogeneously ill-defined soft tissue lesion over left parietal area with areas of necrosis within it. No evidence of underlying bony erosion was noticed. No other evidence of metastasis was noticed.\n\n【8】Patient underwent wide local excision of the lesion along with underlying pericranium with cover of the raw area by transposition flap . Histopathology of the specimen showed atypical vascular spaces lined by spindle to plump epithelioid shaped atypical endothelial cells with multi-layering and intra cytoplasmic lumina having RBG formation. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed diffuse strong positivity for CD31. Ki-67 proliferation index was ~15% to 20%. Overall morphology and IHC findings were consistent with cutaneous angiosarcoma. All margins and base were free from tumour cells.\n\n【9】Sutures were removed on 10h post-operative day and wound healed well . Post-operative radiotherapy was given to local area. Total dose of 70 Gy in 2 Gy fractions was given. The Patient tolerated radiotherapy well. No evidence of local or distant recurrence noticed in 6 month follow up.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Angiosarcomas of the skin are aggressive tumors of vascular endothelial origin with high rates of recurrence and metastasis. Various factors have been found to be associated with increased risk of angiosarcomas. Previous exposure to radiation， exposure to various chemicals (polyvinyl chloride，arsenic)， chronic lymphedema， increasing age remains some factors among them. Most of the patients don’t have any underlying factor. In our patient also， no underlying predisposing factor was noted. Angiosarcoma ofthe scalp occurs more frequently in elderly patients with male to female ratio being 2：1 . Our patient， however， was a female.\n\n【12】The diagnosis of early angiosarcoma is difficult as it presents as a bruise like lesion or purplish macule causing confusion with hemangioma . Ulcerated， fungating masses or hemorrhagic lesions represent signs of advanced diseases. The 5-year survival rate for patients with cutaneous angiosarcoma of the head and neck region ranges from 10% to 54%.\n\n【13】Surgical wide excision of the lesion to achieve tumor free margins is considered to be first line of treatment. If the underlying pericranium remains intact， raw area created after excision can be grafted. In our case as the pericranium was also excised， it was covered with the local flap (transposition flap). The free flap is also an option in cases of extensive lesions involving whole scalp.\n\n【14】Post-operative radiotherapy is indicated in patients to decrease chance of local recurrences and improve 5-year overall survival . Recently researchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Centre， New York had reported paclitaxel to be active against angiosarcoma of the scalp due to its antiangiogenic properties .\n\n【15】In our case we have managed the patient with wide local excision and post-operative radiotherapy.\n\n【16】Conclusion\n\n【17】Angiosarcoma being a rare and aggressive tumor needs prompt diagnosis and aggressive treatment. In elderly patients having scalp lesions， suspicion of angiosarcoma should be kept in mind. It will help in managing them in the early stage of disease. Timely treatment increases chances ofbetter outcomes and prognosis. Due to aggressive nature of disease life-long， to follow up is required for detecting local recurrence or distant metastasis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:42:17", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:42:28", "cost": 10.615}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:47", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:42:28", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:42:17"}

Maternal pregnancy complications would not affect fetal head shape as our results demonstrated.\n\n【5】Keywords： Fetus； Cephalic index； Antenatal diagnosis； Fetal sonographic soft marker\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Antenatal ultrasonography screening of the second trimester is the most comprehensive fetal assessment throughout pregnancy. The main object of this screening is to detect fetal abnormalities. The assessment of fetal head size is the most basic measurement ofeveryantenatal ultrasonography， which includes Biparietal Diameter (BPD) and Head Circumference (HC). According to some former literature，abnormal skull shape associates with fetal trisomy 21 because of a smaller frontal lobe would lead to a shorter frontal occipital brain length . Moreover， fetal brain morphology， volume and growth had strong associations with skull shape . Anomalies which may affect cerebral development could also lead to skull malformations .\n\n【8】But in sonographic clinical practice， evaluating fetal skull morphology relies more on the sonographers'subjective judgements， which might lead to higher incidence of misdiagnose. Some scholastics suggested the Cephalic Index (CI) as a method to evaluate the variations of fetal skull shape. The definition of CI is the ratio of BPD to Occipitofrontal Diameters (OFD)， and multiplies by 100. According to former research， CI is gestational age-independent which remains 78.3±4.4between 14 to 40 weeks' gestation . In a clinical practice， CI is used as a reliable indicator of dolichocephaly and brachycephaly . The association between CI and adverse fetal outcomes is still controversial. Recently， Kenneth et al. studied 597 fetuses retrospectively， a trend of CI towards significance was seen in21-trisomy fetuses， but no statistical difference was detected between study and control group . However， Kenneth Lim presented that there might be interethnic differences in CI between fetuses. Another recent study stated that a progress reduction in CI from the second trimester sonographic screening into the third trimester should be a hint of a thorough scanning of fetal cranial morphology.\n\n【9】Our research aims to investigate if the fetal head CI has any association with fetal sonographic soft markers. This research mainly studied the relevance between fetal head CI and the fetal sonographic soft markers. The secondary outcomes include the associations between fetal head CI and fetal structural abnormalities， fetal karyotype anomalies and/or Copy Number Variation (CNV) anomalies.\n\n【10】Materials and Methods\n\n【11】Participants\n\n【12】This retrospective study was approved by the ethical committee of Wuhan Tongji hospital (No.TJ-IRB20211147). This study analyzed pregnant women who came to Wuhan Tongji hospital for prenatal counselling from January 15， 2021to December 31s， 2021. One thousand eighteen pregnant women had their second trimester screening ultrasonography in our hospital were eligible for this study. Women were excluded because of multiple gestation (n=51)， taking Nuchal Translucency (NT) screening in other hospitals (n=576)， delivering in other medical institutions (n=587) or losing to follow-up. 425 women were included and analyzed in our study .\n\n【13】All the fetuses were examined by pediatricians and obstetricians afterbirth，and followed up from the first trimester to 42 days after birth. All UEs were done using Voluson E10 and Voluson E8 ultrasound machines (GE Healthcare， Kretz Ultrasound， Zipf， Austria) with a 4MHz to 8MHz transabdominaltransducer as defaultanda5MHz to 9MHz or 6 MHz to 12 MHz transvaginal transducer for cases in which transvaginal brain evaluation was needed. Clinical Gestational Age(CGA) was adjusted using the Crump-Rump Length (CRL) during11+0 weeks'and 13+6 weeks’ gestation . Fetal growth parameters were measured in each antenatal UE， which includes CRL， BPD， HC， abdominal circumference， femur length. The Ultrasonographic Gestational Age (UGA) was determined according to the growth parameters， and compared to CGA to assess whether the fetus has intrauterine growth restriction. The fetal CI was calculated using the formula described by Hadlock et al.  BPD/Occipito Frontal Diameter (OFD)×100.BPD and OFD were measured at the level of the thalamus and cavum septi pellucidi plane， from the outer edge of the parietal skull (outer to inner) at the widest or longest part. BPD， OFD，HC，HC deviation of each fetus were recorded.\n\n【14】Grouping and analyze\n\n【15】All the women included in our study were grouped according to the CI of the second trimester screening ultrasonography. The woman was assigned into group 1 to 6 if the CI was less than 64.0， between 64.1 and 67.9，between 68.0 and 71.9， between 72.0 and 75.9， between 76.0 and 79.9 or more than 80.0. All the research data were compared between 6 groups . To get comparable group size of each study group， we set group intervals of 4.0 according to the maximum (91.6) and minimum (57.7) CI of our study. The demographic characteristics were compared between groups， which include women's age， gravidity and parity history， and pregnancy complications.\n\n【16】Continuous variables were presented using means ± standard deviations， median and range. Categorical variables were presented with frequencies and percent's. Correlations of continuous variables between each two study groups were examined using a t-test. For categorical variables， Chi-square was used. The relative risks along with 95% confidence intervals were presented. Statistical analysis and data management were performed using GraphPad Prism 5(La Jolla， CA).\n\n【17】Results and Discussion\n\n【18】Demographic characteristics\n\n【19】From January 1， 2021 to December 315， 2021， a total of 425pregnant womenwere retrospectively analyzed in our study. Table 1 presented the overall demographic characteristics. And the demographic characteristics of each study group were listed in Table 2. The maternal age， gravidity and parity history， CGA did not show statistical significance among groups. Statistical differences were found in UGA among 6 groups (p<0.05)， which increases with increasing CI. The value of (CGA-UGA) reduced with increasing fetal CI and were statistically different among groups (p=0.0006).\n\n【20】Fetal and maternal outcomes of each group a： biparietal diameter；b： occipitofrontal diameters； c： head circumference； d： cephalic index\n\n【21】Table 3 presented the main results of our study. We compared BPD among the six study groups. Fetal BPD and OFD seems to increase with CI and statistical differences were detected in fetal BPD and OFD among groups. Fetal Sonographic Soft Markers (SSM) in our study include thickened nuchal fold， echogenic bowel， mild ventriculomegaly， echogenic focus in the heart， choroid plexus cyst， single umbilical artery， enlarged cisterna magna， and pyelectasis. Fetal SSM and maternal gestational complications did not show statistical difference. Group 5 has the lowest fetal SSM rate (8.2%). Maternal complications did not show any statistical differences among 6 study groups or each two study groups.\n\n【22】Of all the women in our study， 38 had amniocentesis for fetal chromosomal/gene screening. And no serious chromosomal/gene defect was found in chromosomal/gene screening. Five women in this study chose induced labor due to serious fetal abnormalities which include fetal kidney malformation，hydrocephaly， hypospadias or multi-malformation. The CIs of the 5 induced fetuses were below71.9. The ratio of fetal gender in each study group did not show statistical differences. All the live birth fetuses complain of no serious congenital anomalies or other defects during the period of follow-up.\n\n【23】Table 1： Demographic characteristics of all the participants in our study.\n\n| Maternal age (years)  | 31.1±4.1  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Gravidity history  | 2.1±1.4  |\n| Parity history  | 0.4±0.6  |\n| CGA of second-trimester screening UE (days)  | 162.3±5.8  |\n| UGA# of second-trimester screening UE& (days)  | 160.6±1.0  |\n| CGA-UGA (days)  | 1.8±4.1  |\n| BPD=(cm)  | 5.5±0.3  |\n| OFDF(cm)  | 7.7±0.4  |\n| HC(cm)  | 20.7±1.1  |\n|  | 71.9±3.7  |\n\n【25】Clinical gestationalage；#； Ultrasonographicgestational age；&：Ultrasonographic examination；a： biparietal diameter；b： occipitofrontal diameters c： head circumference；d： cephalic index\n\n【26】Results of the fetal SSM between each two study groups\n\n【27】Table 4 presented the results of the fetal SSM between each oftwo study groups. Statistical differences were found between group 2 and5(p=0.002)，3 and5(p=0.02)，4and5(p=0.03). Fetal abnormality risk seems to be obvious when fetal CI is below 76.0， and the risk increases significantly if CI is less than 68.0.\n\n【28】Discussion\n\n【29】Many sonographers had impressions of abnormal fetal head shapes that might indicate of higher incidence of fetal aneuploid or other abnormalities. Those abnormal head shapes were described as “strawberry\" shaped or “lemon” shaped cranium. The judgement of fetal cranial shape relies more on sonographers’ subjective perception. Hadlock et al. proposed CI for evaluation of variations of skull shape .During clinical practice recently， CI was used to assess craniosynostosis  and fetal head shape . But the limited former researchers of CI drew different conclusions of the predictive value of CI during pregnancy. A study presented a case of rapidly decreased CI during 16 days and stated that CI could be a predictor of fetal demise . Kenneth et al.  Retrospectively analyzed 46 fetuses with 18-trisomy or 21-trisomyand comparedto 551 normal controls. The CIs of 18-trisomy/21-trisomy fetuses and controls did not show statistical difference in their study. But their research found a trend towards statistical differences in Caucasian and Oriental ethnic fetuses. Similarly， another literature found no statistical association between fetal CI and Down syndrome In recent studies， CI was used to evaluate cranial shape and antenatal diagnosis of craniosynostosis. The cranium is diagnosed as brachycephaly if the CI is more than 85.0 and dolichocephaly if less than 75.0 . Those anomalies can possibly lead to cranium deformations， which could increase intracranial pressure and cause neurodevelopmental constrain and cognitive deficiency . The morphology of cranial vault depends on the development of brain volume， morphology and growth . Abnormalcranial morphology is usually a clinical manifestation of genetic or chromosomal disorders， infection， exposure to toxins， metabolic errors or intrauterine growth restriction ， and could possibly lead to adverse gestational outcomes. An article of last year stated that the mean CI of fetal with sagittal craniosynostosis was 74.5 in the third-trimester， statistically different from the mean CI of normal controls . A Japanese article studied fetal brain volume by Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging as a method of antenatal evaluation . Fetal CI was calculated using BPD and OFD measured in MR images， and a statistical correlation was detected between CI and total brain volume. Therefore， CI could be an evaluation method of not only variations of cranial shape， but also fetal brain growth.\n\n【30】The generally accepted fetal normal CI is 78.3± 4.4， which was reported by Hadlock et al.  and remains constantly from 14 to 40weeks' gestation . However， some scholars held different opinions. Diana et al.  studied 1，361 normal fetuses and found a variation in CI with advancing gestational age . They found fetuses of14-weeks'gestation has the highest value for CI (81.5)， and the lowest value appears at 28 weeks’ gestational age (78.0).

Ethnicity， gender， heredity and geography are the main factors causing the differentiation of CI . According to recent Korean research， the cranial shape of Koreans had changed rapidly from mesocephalic to brachycephalic in the last century until early twenty-first century . However，the changing pattern has reversed to debrachycephalization in recent decades due to improvements in nutrition and health. A similar changing pattern was also detected in other countries or ethnicities， such as Japan， Mexico， Croatia， Hungary and American. A Nepal study reported that the common cranial shape of Tharu population was dolichocephaly . The mean CI of the Nepal population was 75.99±4.97， different from the mean value reported by Hadlock et al. In our study， the mean CI of the 324 normal fetuses was 71.9 ± 3.7， which is lower than the value reported by Hadlock. Moreover， 253 (78.1%) of the normal fetuses were dolichocephaly because their CIs were below 75.0. And none of the normal fetuses were brachycephaly. It appears that dolichocephaly was more popular in the second-trimester of gestation. The reason for disparity of mean CI value might be ethnicity or gestational age. Large-scale research is required to verify the hypothesis.\n\n【39】In our 6 study groups， we found that the fetuses in group 5have the lowest incidence (8.2%) of fetal SSM， the differences have statistical significances compared with group 2 (32.8%， p=0.002)，3\n\n【40】(24.2%，p=0.02)and 4 (21.7%，p=0.03). Six women in our study chose to have induced labor because of serious fetal malformations. The CIs of the 6 induced-labor fetuses were all below 71.9. It seems like that fetus with a lower CI was more likely to have serious fetal structural abnormalities， which might lead to an induction of labor. The rest of fetuses in our study did not develop other abnormalities till births， and no serious neonatal complication was detected after birth. Thirty-eight women in our study had amniocentesis for fetal chromosomal/gene screening， and nonpathogenic DNA copy number variations were found in chromosomal/gene screening. However， the limited proportion of amniocentesis in this study might not be enough to analyze the statistical association between fetal CI and chromosomal/gene abnormality.\n\n【41】The UGA of brachycephalic fetuses are more likelytoconform with CGA. We suppose that dolichocephalic fetuses of second-trimester have a higher risk of developing intrauterine growth restriction(IUGR). However， recent research by Dana  studied the fetal head shapes of 65 preterm infants and deduced that dolichocephaly of the third-trimester is not associated with low birth weight of infants . Further study is required to discover the association between fetal CI and IUGR\n\n【42】Ourstudywas conducted in Wuhan TongjiHospital. Overall， fetal CI in our study was less than the value reported by Hadlock. The fetal CI seems to have no statistical associations with fetal abnormalities. However， the fetus with a CI ranges between 76.0 and 79.9 has the lowest incidence of fetal abnormalities when compared to fetus whose CI ranges between 64.0 and 75.9. Dolichocephalic fetuses are more likely to be small for CGA. Maternal pregnancy complication would not affect fetal head shape as our results demonstrated.

Anomalies which may affect cerebral development could also lead to skull malformations .\n\n【8】But in sonographic clinical practice， evaluating fetal skull morphology relies more on the sonographers'subjective judgements， which might lead to higher incidence of misdiagnose. Some scholastics suggested the Cephalic Index (CI) as a method to evaluate the variations of fetal skull shape. The definition of CI is the ratio of BPD to Occipitofrontal Diameters (OFD)， and multiplies by 100. According to former research， CI is gestational age-independent which remains 78.3±4.4between 14 to 40 weeks' gestation . In a clinical practice， CI is used as a reliable indicator of dolichocephaly and brachycephaly . The association between CI and adverse fetal outcomes is still controversial. Recently， Kenneth et al. studied 597 fetuses retrospectively， a trend of CI towards significance was seen in21-trisomy fetuses， but no statistical difference was detected between study and control group . However， Kenneth Lim presented that there might be interethnic differences in CI between fetuses. Another recent study stated that a progress reduction in CI from the second trimester sonographic screening into the third trimester should be a hint of a thorough scanning of fetal cranial morphology.\n\n【9】Our research aims to investigate if the fetal head CI has any association with fetal sonographic soft markers. This research mainly studied the relevance between fetal head CI and the fetal sonographic soft markers. The secondary outcomes include the associations between fetal head CI and fetal structural abnormalities， fetal karyotype anomalies and/or Copy Number Variation (CNV) anomalies.\n\n【10】Materials and Methods\n\n【11】Participants\n\n【12】This retrospective study was approved by the ethical committee of Wuhan Tongji hospital (No.TJ-IRB20211147). This study analyzed pregnant women who came to Wuhan Tongji hospital for prenatal counselling from January 15， 2021to December 31s， 2021. One thousand eighteen pregnant women had their second trimester screening ultrasonography in our hospital were eligible for this study. Women were excluded because of multiple gestation (n=51)， taking Nuchal Translucency (NT) screening in other hospitals (n=576)， delivering in other medical institutions (n=587) or losing to follow-up. 425 women were included and analyzed in our study .\n\n【13】All the fetuses were examined by pediatricians and obstetricians afterbirth，and followed up from the first trimester to 42 days after birth. All UEs were done using Voluson E10 and Voluson E8 ultrasound machines (GE Healthcare， Kretz Ultrasound， Zipf， Austria) with a 4MHz to 8MHz transabdominaltransducer as defaultanda5MHz to 9MHz or 6 MHz to 12 MHz transvaginal transducer for cases in which transvaginal brain evaluation was needed. Clinical Gestational Age(CGA) was adjusted using the Crump-Rump Length (CRL) during11+0 weeks'and 13+6 weeks’ gestation . Fetal growth parameters were measured in each antenatal UE， which includes CRL， BPD， HC， abdominal circumference， femur length. The Ultrasonographic Gestational Age (UGA) was determined according to the growth parameters， and compared to CGA to assess whether the fetus has intrauterine growth restriction. The fetal CI was calculated using the formula described by Hadlock et al.  BPD/Occipito Frontal Diameter (OFD)×100.BPD and OFD were measured at the level of the thalamus and cavum septi pellucidi plane， from the outer edge of the parietal skull (outer to inner) at the widest or longest part. BPD， OFD，HC，HC deviation of each fetus were recorded.\n\n【14】Grouping and analyze\n\n【15】All the women included in our study were grouped according to the CI of the second trimester screening ultrasonography. The woman was assigned into group 1 to 6 if the CI was less than 64.0， between 64.1 and 67.9，between 68.0 and 71.9， between 72.0 and 75.9， between 76.0 and 79.9 or more than 80.0. All the research data were compared between 6 groups . To get comparable group size of each study group， we set group intervals of 4.0 according to the maximum (91.6) and minimum (57.7) CI of our study. The demographic characteristics were compared between groups， which include women's age， gravidity and parity history， and pregnancy complications.\n\n【16】Continuous variables were presented using means ± standard deviations， median and range. Categorical variables were presented with frequencies and percent's. Correlations of continuous variables between each two study groups were examined using a t-test. For categorical variables， Chi-square was used. The relative risks along with 95% confidence intervals were presented. Statistical analysis and data management were performed using GraphPad Prism 5(La Jolla， CA).\n\n【17】Results and Discussion\n\n【18】Demographic characteristics\n\n【19】From January 1， 2021 to December 315， 2021， a total of 425pregnant womenwere retrospectively analyzed in our study. Table 1 presented the overall demographic characteristics. And the demographic characteristics of each study group were listed in Table 2. The maternal age， gravidity and parity history， CGA did not show statistical significance among groups. Statistical differences were found in UGA among 6 groups (p<0.05)， which increases with increasing CI. The value of (CGA-UGA) reduced with increasing fetal CI and were statistically different among groups (p=0.0006).\n\n【20】Fetal and maternal outcomes of each group a： biparietal diameter；b： occipitofrontal diameters； c： head circumference； d： cephalic index\n\n【21】Table 3 presented the main results of our study. We compared BPD among the six study groups. Fetal BPD and OFD seems to increase with CI and statistical differences were detected in fetal BPD and OFD among groups. Fetal Sonographic Soft Markers (SSM) in our study include thickened nuchal fold， echogenic bowel， mild ventriculomegaly， echogenic focus in the heart， choroid plexus cyst， single umbilical artery， enlarged cisterna magna， and pyelectasis. Fetal SSM and maternal gestational complications did not show statistical difference. Group 5 has the lowest fetal SSM rate (8.2%). Maternal complications did not show any statistical differences among 6 study groups or each two study groups.\n\n【22】Of all the women in our study， 38 had amniocentesis for fetal chromosomal/gene screening. And no serious chromosomal/gene defect was found in chromosomal/gene screening. Five women in this study chose induced labor due to serious fetal abnormalities which include fetal kidney malformation，hydrocephaly， hypospadias or multi-malformation. The CIs of the 5 induced fetuses were below71.9. The ratio of fetal gender in each study group did not show statistical differences. All the live birth fetuses complain of no serious congenital anomalies or other defects during the period of follow-up.\n\n【23】Table 1： Demographic characteristics of all the participants in our study.\n\n| Maternal age (years)  | 31.1±4.1  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Gravidity history  | 2.1±1.4  |\n| Parity history  | 0.4±0.6  |\n| CGA of second-trimester screening UE (days)  | 162.3±5.8  |\n| UGA# of second-trimester screening UE& (days)  | 160.6±1.0  |\n| CGA-UGA (days)  | 1.8±4.1  |\n| BPD=(cm)  | 5.5±0.3  |\n| OFDF(cm)  | 7.7±0.4  |\n| HC(cm)  | 20.7±1.1  |\n|  | 71.9±3.7  |\n\n【25】Clinical gestationalage；#； Ultrasonographicgestational age；&：Ultrasonographic examination；a： biparietal diameter；b： occipitofrontal diameters c： head circumference；d： cephalic index\n\n【26】Results of the fetal SSM between each two study groups\n\n【27】Table 4 presented the results of the fetal SSM between each oftwo study groups. Statistical differences were found between group 2 and5(p=0.002)，3 and5(p=0.02)，4and5(p=0.03). Fetal abnormality risk seems to be obvious when fetal CI is below 76.0， and the risk increases significantly if CI is less than 68.0.\n\n【28】Discussion\n\n【29】Many sonographers had impressions of abnormal fetal head shapes that might indicate of higher incidence of fetal aneuploid or other abnormalities. Those abnormal head shapes were described as “strawberry\" shaped or “lemon” shaped cranium. The judgement of fetal cranial shape relies more on sonographers’ subjective perception. Hadlock et al. proposed CI for evaluation of variations of skull shape .During clinical practice recently， CI was used to assess craniosynostosis  and fetal head shape . But the limited former researchers of CI drew different conclusions of the predictive value of CI during pregnancy. A study presented a case of rapidly decreased CI during 16 days and stated that CI could be a predictor of fetal demise . Kenneth et al.  Retrospectively analyzed 46 fetuses with 18-trisomy or 21-trisomyand comparedto 551 normal controls. The CIs of 18-trisomy/21-trisomy fetuses and controls did not show statistical difference in their study. But their research found a trend towards statistical differences in Caucasian and Oriental ethnic fetuses. Similarly， another literature found no statistical association between fetal CI and Down syndrome In recent studies， CI was used to evaluate cranial shape and antenatal diagnosis of craniosynostosis. The cranium is diagnosed as brachycephaly if the CI is more than 85.0 and dolichocephaly if less than 75.0 . Those anomalies can possibly lead to cranium deformations， which could increase intracranial pressure and cause neurodevelopmental constrain and cognitive deficiency . The morphology of cranial vault depends on the development of brain volume， morphology and growth . Abnormalcranial morphology is usually a clinical manifestation of genetic or chromosomal disorders， infection， exposure to toxins， metabolic errors or intrauterine growth restriction ， and could possibly lead to adverse gestational outcomes. An article of last year stated that the mean CI of fetal with sagittal craniosynostosis was 74.5 in the third-trimester， statistically different from the mean CI of normal controls . A Japanese article studied fetal brain volume by Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging as a method of antenatal evaluation . Fetal CI was calculated using BPD and OFD measured in MR images， and a statistical correlation was detected between CI and total brain volume. Therefore， CI could be an evaluation method of not only variations of cranial shape， but also fetal brain growth.\n\n【30】The generally accepted fetal normal CI is 78.3± 4.4， which was reported by Hadlock et al.  and remains constantly from 14 to 40weeks' gestation . However， some scholars held different opinions. Diana et al.  studied 1，361 normal fetuses and found a variation in CI with advancing gestational age . They found fetuses of14-weeks'gestation has the highest value for CI (81.5)， and the lowest value appears at 28 weeks’ gestational age (78.0). Their research also\n\n【31】Table 2： Demographic characteristics of each study group.\n\n|  | 1(n=6)  | 2(n=58)  | 3(n=153)  | 4(n=152)  | 5(n=49)  | 6(n=7)  | p  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Maternal agefyears)  | 32.5±2.2  | 31.3±4.3  | 31.3±4.0  | 30.8±4.2  | 31.1±4.0  | 30.9±5.3  | 0.87  |\n| Gravidity history  | 2.5±1.0  | 2.4±1.5  | 2.2±1.4  | 2.0±1.3  | 1.9±1.2  | 2.6±2.8  | 0.35  |\n| Parity history  | 0.7±0.5  | 0.5±0.6  | 0.3±0.5  | 0.3±0.6  | 0.2±0.5  | 0.4±0.8  | 0.16  |\n| CGA of second-trimester screening UE (days)  | 162.8±4.5  | 160.9±5.0  | 161.8±4.8  | 163.0±7.2  | 162.9±4.3  | 162.1±3.8  | 0.09  |\n| UGA of second-trimester screening UE (days)  | 157.2±4.5  | 158.3±6.0  | 159.4±5.6  | 162.0±7.8  | 162.5±6.4  | 161.3±5.6  | 0.0001  |\n| CGA'-UGA(days)  | 5.7+4.2  | 2.5±5.6  | 2.4±3.6  | 1.1±3.7  | 0.4±3.6  | 0.9±1.9  | 0.0006  |\n\n【33】： Clinical gestational age；#： Ultrasonographic gestational age： &； ultrasonographic examination\n\n【34】Table 3： Fetal and maternal outcomes of each group.\n\n|  | 1(n=6)  | 2(n=58)  | 3(n=153)  | 4(n=152)  | 5(n=49)  | 6(n=7)  | P (t-test)  | P (Chi-square)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| BPD(cm)  | 5.1±0.3  | 5.3±0.3  | 5.5±0.3  | 5.7±0.3  | 5.8±0.3  | 5.8±0.3  | <0.0001  |  |\n| HCb(cm)  | 20.7±0.9  | 20.6±1.1  | 20.6±1.0  | 20.9±1.2  | 20.7±1.2  | 20.2±1.2  | 0.34  |  |\n| OFDF(cm)  | 8.2±0.3  | 7.9±0.4  | 7.8±0.4  | 7.7±0.4  | 7.5±0.4  | 7.1±0.6  | <0.0001  |  |\n| Cd  | 61.8±2.3  | 66.8±1.0  | 70.2±1.1  | 73.7±1.2  | 77.4±1.1  | 82.2+4.2  | <0.0001  |  |\n| Fetal abnormalities  | 2(33.3%)  | 19 (32.8%)  | 37(24.2%)  | 33 (21.7%)  | 4(8.2%)  | 1(14.3%)  |  | 0.09  |\n| Induced labor  | 1(16.7%)  | 1(1.7%)  | 4(2.6%)  |  | 0  | 0  |  |  |\n| Maternal complications  | 2(33.3%)  | 22 (37.9%)  | 30(19.6%)  | 43 (28.3%)  | 17(34.7%)  | 2(28.6%)  |  | 0.09  |\n| Fetal gender (Male/Female)  | 3/4  | 32/17  | 89/63  | 77/76  | 30/28  | 3/3  |  | 0.42  |\n\n【36】Table 4： Results of the fetal abnormality between each two study groups.\n\n|  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 2  | 1.00  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 3  | 0.61  | 0.21  |  |  |  |  |\n| 4  | 0.50  | 0.10  | 0.61  |  |  |  |\n| 5  | 0.06  | 0.002  | 0.02  | 0.03  |  |  |\n| 6  | 0.66  | 0.32  | 0.55  | 0.64  | 0.50  |  |\n\n【38】： Statistical difference revealed that the normal range of CI was broad and might be affecting by other factors which might influence cranial shape. Ethnicity， gender， heredity and geography are the main factors causing the differentiation of CI . According to recent Korean research， the cranial shape of Koreans had changed rapidly from mesocephalic to brachycephalic in the last century until early twenty-first century . However，the changing pattern has reversed to debrachycephalization in recent decades due to improvements in nutrition and health. A similar changing pattern was also detected in other countries or ethnicities， such as Japan， Mexico， Croatia， Hungary and American. A Nepal study reported that the common cranial shape of Tharu population was dolichocephaly . The mean CI of the Nepal population was 75.99±4.97， different from the mean value reported by Hadlock et al. In our study， the mean CI of the 324 normal fetuses was 71.9 ± 3.7， which is lower than the value reported by Hadlock. Moreover， 253 (78.1%) of the normal fetuses were dolichocephaly because their CIs were below 75.0. And none of the normal fetuses were brachycephaly. It appears that dolichocephaly was more popular in the second-trimester of gestation. The reason for disparity of mean CI value might be ethnicity or gestational age. Large-scale research is required to verify the hypothesis.\n\n【39】In our 6 study groups， we found that the fetuses in group 5have the lowest incidence (8.2%) of fetal SSM， the differences have statistical significances compared with group 2 (32.8%， p=0.002)，3\n\n【40】(24.2%，p=0.02)and 4 (21.7%，p=0.03). Six women in our study chose to have induced labor because of serious fetal malformations. The CIs of the 6 induced-labor fetuses were all below 71.9. It seems like that fetus with a lower CI was more likely to have serious fetal structural abnormalities， which might lead to an induction of labor. The rest of fetuses in our study did not develop other abnormalities till births， and no serious neonatal complication was detected after birth. Thirty-eight women in our study had amniocentesis for fetal chromosomal/gene screening， and nonpathogenic DNA copy number variations were found in chromosomal/gene screening. However， the limited proportion of amniocentesis in this study might not be enough to analyze the statistical association between fetal CI and chromosomal/gene abnormality.\n\n【41】The UGA of brachycephalic fetuses are more likelytoconform with CGA. We suppose that dolichocephalic fetuses of second-trimester have a higher risk of developing intrauterine growth restriction(IUGR). However， recent research by Dana  studied the fetal head shapes of 65 preterm infants and deduced that dolichocephaly of the third-trimester is not associated with low birth weight of infants . Further study is required to discover the association between fetal CI and IUGR\n\n【42】Ourstudywas conducted in Wuhan TongjiHospital. Overall， fetal CI in our study was less than the value reported by Hadlock. The fetal CI seems to have no statistical associations with fetal abnormalities. However， the fetus with a CI ranges between 76.0 and 79.9 has the lowest incidence of fetal abnormalities when compared to fetus whose CI ranges between 64.0 and 75.9. Dolichocephalic fetuses are more likely to be small for CGA. Maternal pregnancy complication would not affect fetal head shape as our results demonstrated. Because of the limited data of amniocentesis in our study， no statistical associations were detected between fetal CI and chromosomal/gene abnormality.", "index": 17338, "show": true, "start": 17338, "end": 18364, "province": ["格式规范性", "多余换行"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/20 16:10:24", "endTime": "2024/09/20 16:11:29", "cost": 64.631}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:47", "update_time": "2024-09-20 00:11:29", "grab_time": "2024-09-20 00:10:24"}

The ELF-EMF is Non-Ionizing Radiation (NIR) and does not carry enough energy per quantum to ionize atoms or molecules. The ELF-EMF are generated by electrical devices and power systems (1 Hz to 300 Hz). In recent decades， exposure to ELF-EMF has emerged potential concerns on public health. Exposure to ELF-EMF has an adverse biological effect depending on the current intensity， strength of the magnetic field， and duration of exposure. Accumulated epidemiologic evidence indicates a correlation between exposure to ELF-EMF and childhood cancer incidence， Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)， and miscarriage . Data on the effects of Extremely Low Frequency Electromagnetic Fields (ELF-EMF) on pregnancy outcomes (Condition of the fetus or newborn after termination of pregnancy， including preterm birth， stillbirth， low birth weight， miscarriage， small for gestational age， etc.) are inconclusive . For example， a report showed ELF-EMF has been studied as a potential risk factor for miscarriage (pregnancy loss at<20 weeks of gestation) and other adverse reproductive health outcomes. This research priority arose from reports of miscarriage and birth defect clusters among Video Display Terminal (VDT) operators in the U.S. and Canada. Although several studies have demonstrated that ELF-EMF is associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes， other studies have shown no evidence of associations . A recent study by Wilson reports that personal magnetic fields exposures were not associated with fertility treatment outcomes or pregnancy outcomes . Prematurity or small for gestational age is a leading cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity in developed countries， and also increase the risk of chronic diseases in adult life. Both are multifactorial phenomena associated with fetal， maternal， placental and environmental factors， and though several risk factors are now well known，the effect ofELF-EMF on it remains unidentified . In this context， we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effect of ELF-EMF on pregnancy outcomes and provide evidence-based medicine evidence on the need for epidemiological research.\n\n【10】Methods\n\n【11】Search strategy\n\n【12】Inclusion and exclusion criteria\n\n【13】Inclusion criteria：  The protocol was pre-specified to include cohort studies conducted in pregnant women and had reported on primary pregnancy outcomes， including preterm birth， SGA， fetal death， stillbirth or LBW.  Included studies are pregnant women who live near extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields caused by power lines.\n\n【14】Exclusion criteria：  Irrelevant to the subject of the meta-analysis， such as studies that did not use ELF-EMF as the exposure； Insufficient data to calculate the Risk Ratio (RR) or assess the pooled effect of ELF-EMF on pregnancy outcomes；  Duplicate studies or overlapping participants；  Reviews， editorials， conference papers， case reports or animal experiments；  Studies that did not provide details on the identification of ELF-EMF on pregnancy mothers. Mobile phone， TV， X-ray， nuclear radiation， daily microwave oven， electric blanket， etc.  The definitions of exposure factors are very different，and the exposure conditions cannot be combined，including grading by exposure time， etc.\n\n【15】Literature screening and data extraction\n\n【16】Literature was screened by 2 independent reviewers according to pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. First， read the full text by reading the titles and abstracts of the articles， after screening out obviously irrelevant articles. while discrepancies were resolved with a third investigator. If the information is incomplete or the full text cannot be obtained， the authors of the literature should be contacted for consultation. Those who have not yet obtained the information will be excluded. Data were extracted using a predesigned form that had been piloted. The following data were extracted independently by two investigators (WNL and FFZ) from the selected studies：  Basic information of the studies， including first author， publication year and research type；  characteristics of the study population， including sample sizes and locations；  primary outcomes： The number of ELF-EMF-exposure and non-exposure pregnant women in the total cohort and by different outcomes (preterm birth and non-preterm birth， SGA and non-SGA， fetal death and live birth， stillbirth and live birth， low birth weight and normal birth weight)； definitions of pregnancy outcomes： preterm birth was defined as birth at <37 weeks Gestational Age (GA)； SGA was defined as a birth weight of <10h percentile for GA and sex； LBW was defined as a birthweight of <2500 g； stillbirth was defined as fetal death after24 weeks of pregnancy； fetal death was defined as a corporation of abortions (at 13 to 21 weeks gestation) and stillbirth (at ≥ 22 weeks gestation). We applied these definitions as provided by the included studies.\n\n【17】Quality assessment\n\n【18】We evaluated the methodological quality of included studies using the tool developed by Hoy et al.， which is used in assessing the risk of bias in non-randomized studies and has been used in previous meta-analyses . We assigned each item a score of 1(yes) or 0 (no) and summarized scores across items to generate an overall quality score that ranged from 0 to 10. According to the overall scores， we classified studies as having a low (>8)， moderate or high (≤ 5) risk of bias. Two investigators (WRT and YWX) independently assessed study quality， with disagreements resolved by a third investigator (DM).\n\n【19】Data synthesis and statistical analysis\n\n【20】All the statistical analyses were performed using RevMan 5.3software. For dichotomous variables， relative risk (RR) and 95%Confidence Interval (CI) were used as effect indicators. A value of P<0.05 was considered significant. Heterogeneity analysis was performed on the results of the included studies (test level a=0.1). If P>0.1 and I<50%， it means that there is no statistical heterogeneity among the studies， and a fixed-effects model is used， otherwise， a random-effects model is used for analysis. Ifsubstantial heterogeneity was observed， we conducted subgroup analyses and sensitivity analysis to investigate the possible sources ofheterogeneity.\n\n【21】Patient and public involvement\n\n【22】No patient involved.\n\n【23】Results\n\n【24】Literature search\n\n【25】A total of 1，021 records were retrieved from the four databases. Before screening， 360 other irrelevant literatures such as systematic reviews， reviews， repeated literatures， animal experiments， etc. were excluded. After screening of titles and abstracts， we excluded 627studies irrelevant to the subject. Among the 34 articles assessed based on full texts， 12 articles were excluded for duplicates or did not meet inclusion criteria， 2 articles full text were not found， 13 articles were excluded for lacking specific data. A total of 7 studies were finally included in the review.

It may be associated with neurodegenerative diseases， specifically Alzheimer’s disease； however， limited evidence was found to suggest that ELF EMFs are associated with several types of cancer， CVD， and reproductive outcomes . Many research studies regarding the impact of low frequency electromagnetic fields on residents living close to very high voltage overhead power lines were carried out. A review study has shown that childhood leukemia is associated with exposure to magnetic field. Many other studies suggest the role of this exposure and the increased risk of birth defect. In addition， the results from some studies have indicated that exposure to magnetic field may be associated with the increased risk of adverse birth outcomes such as low birth weight and miscarriages. Some studies， however， did not find a statistically significant increased risk of preterm birth and low birth weight in relation to exposure to electro-magnetic field during pregnancy reproductive outcomes . Most residents living in close proximity to overhead power lines are more concerned about the outcome of their pregnancy. The scientific evidence for other outcomes of pregnancy such as preterm birth is quite weak. A total of 7 studies were included for meta-quantitative analysis. Miscarriage， stillbirth， birth defects， and preterm birth were included in the analysis as bad pregnancy outcomes. there was no statistically significant between the exposed group and the non-exposed group. Birth defects， preterm births， miscarriages and stillbirths were analyzed separately， and no statistically significant differences were found. The results showed that there was no statisticaly significant in pregnancy outcomes among pregnant women who lived near electromagnetic fields compared with those who lived far away from magnetic fields. We conducted subgroup analyses by European region and non-European region. The results suggest that different regions may be one of the sources of its heterogeneity. Sensitivity analysis suggests that the source of heterogeneity in combined effect sizes for bad pregnancy outcomes is KG Blaasaas 2004. Sensitivity analysis showed that the KG Blaasaas 2004  study had a greater impact on the heterogeneity of combined studies. However， after careful evaluation， there was no sufficient reason to exclude this literature study， so it was included. The limitations in this study are listed as follows. First， the definition of magnetic field exposure was not consistent across studies included in the meta-analysis. Second， the distance assessment method used is not completely consistent. Third， birth defects are also defined differently， for example， Elisabeth Robert 1993  and Nathalie Auger 2019  have a more comprehensive description of birth defects. While Manoochehr Mahram 2013  only mentioned congenital malformations. The population of birth defects included in the original literature may vary， which may have some impact on the pooled results. Due to the small number of included studies， the publication bias ofthe studies could not be fully evaluated. In addition， most of the maternal and neonatal conditions are not clearly recorded in the literature， so it is impossible to explore confounding factors such as birth defects and preterm birth through multivariate analysis ofother influencing factors of pregnant women. Electromagnetic field exposure is flowing everywhere， and wherever there are wires， motors and electronic equipment， electromagnetic fields are generated. This is one of the reasons why it is difficult to assess the effects of electromagnetic fields on human health. For research consistency， this study pooled mainly electromagnetic exposures to residential high-voltage lines. Eventually， larger sample size and higher quality studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms ofthese magnetic fields. Although there is no direct evidence from the current study that ELF-EMF has an effect on pregnancy outcomes， studies， empirical observations， and patient reports clearly indicate interactions between EMF exposure and health problems. On the one hand， there is strong evidence that long-term exposure to certain EMFs is a risk factor for diseases such as certain cancers， Alzheimer's disease， and male infertility. On the other hand， the Emerging Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity (EHS) is more and more recognized by health authorities， disability administrators and case workers， politicians， as well as courts of law. It is very important to take the individual susceptibility into account. The primary method of treatment should mainly focus on the prevention or reduction of EMF exposure， that is， reducing or eliminating all sources of high EMF exposure at home and at the workplace. The reduction of EMF exposure should also be extended to public spaces such as schools， hospitals，public transport， and libraries to enable persons with EHS an unhindered use (accessibility measure). At the same time， individuals should strengthen their physique and maintain homeostasis in order to increase their ability to resist disease and thus resist the bad effects of exposure to electromagnetic fields .\n\n【29】Table 1 evaluates the cohort studies using the coding manual for cohort study. The quality of the included articles was evaluated from ten aspects in the following table. The total score of the coding manual is 10 points. If the total points are greater than or equal to8， it is considered as a high-quality article. As is shown in Table 1， 6articles are high-quality literature.\n\n【30】Basic information of the included literature\n\n【31】A total of 7 studies were finally included in the review， and comprised a total of 3055，644 total sample. All of the literature are cohort studies. Information obtained from each full-text study included first author， publication year， area， primary outcomes and so on. Basic information extraction is shown in Table 2.\n\n【32】Analysis results\n\n【33】Adverse pregnancy outcomes： Miscarriage， stillbirth， birth defects， and preterm birth were included in the analysis as bad pregnancy outcomes. A total of 7 studies were finally included. P<0.00001，I=97%，A random effects model was used. Total effect Z=1.35， P=0.18，[RR=1.30， 95% CI (0.90)]. The results showed that there was no statistically significant between the two groups. There was no significant increase in bad pregnancy outcomes among pregnant women who lived near electromagnetic fields compared with those who lived far away from magnetic fields .\n\n【34】Birth defect： A total of 4 studies were included. P<0.00001， I=99%， A random effects model was used. Total effect Z=0.85， P=0.39，[RR=1.29，95% CI (0.33)]. The results showed that there was no statistically significant between the two groups. There was no significant increase in newborn birth defect risk among pregnant women who lived near electromagnetic fields compared with those who lived far away from magnetic fields .\n\n【35】Preterm birth\n\n【36】Atotal of2 studies were included.P=0.95，P=0%，Arandom effects model was used. Total effect Z=0.74，P=0.46，[RR=1.08，95%CI (0.35)]. The results showed that there was no statistically significant between the two groups. There was no significant increase in preterm birth risk among pregnant women who lived near electromagnetic fields compared with those who lived far away from magnetic fields.\n\n【37】Miscarriage and stillbirth\n\n【38】The outcomes of miscarriage and stillbirth were similar. So， analyze it as one situation， and a total of 2 studies were included. P=0.001， I=84%， A random effects model was used. Total effect Z=0.93， P=0.35， [RR=1.48， 95% CI (0.65， 3.33)]. The results showed that there was no statistically significant between the two groups. There was no significant increase in miscarriage and stillbirth risk among pregnant women who lived near electromagnetic fields compared with those who lived far away from magnetic fields .\n\n【39】Subgroup analysis we conducted subgroup analyses by European region and non-European region (Asia and North America). The results showed pooled effect size for the European region Z=0.74， P=0.46， [RR=1.30，95% CI (0.63)]，non-European region Z=1.04，P=0.30，[RR=1.13，95% CI (0.90， 1.43)]， Between subgroups P=0.71，I2=0%，there was no statistically significant， but the heterogeneity is significantly reduced.\n\n【40】Sensitivity analysis\n\n【41】Sensitivity analysis was performed by excluding each study in turn. After omitting the article KG Blaasaas 2004， Heterogeneity was significantly reduced， P=0.07， I=50%， however， there was no significant change in heterogeneity after omitting the other articles. This suggests that the source of heterogeneity in combined effect sizes for bad pregnancy outcomes is KG Blaasaas 2004 .\n\n【42】Discussion\n\n【43】Epidemiologic studies have provided inconsistent results on the association between exposure to ELF-EMF and various health\n\n| Author  | Publishvear  | Location  | Primary outcomes  | Exposure conditions definitions  |  | Total samplesize (person)  | Year ofinclusion  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Elisabeth Robert  | 1993  | France  | chromosomal aberrations， central nervous system anomalies， skeletal malformations，cardiac defects， facial clefts， hypospadias anomalies of the digestive system， and anomalies of the urinary system  | maternal residence in a municipality inwhich at least one point of habitation waslocated within 500 meters (0.5 cm on the1/100，000 scale map) of 225 or 400 kVoverhead power lines  | 5925  |  | 1988-1989  |\n| ManoochehrMahram   | 2013  | Iran  | preterm labor，neonatal birth weight，length，head circumference and congenitalmaltormations  | the areas under the ELF-EM elds wereregistered on the maps.  | 380  |  | 2011  |\n| KG Blaasaas   | 2004  | Norway  | Birth defects： Central Nervous System(CNS) defects， cardiac defects， respiratorysystem defects， esophageal defects， and clubfoot  | the estimated magnetic field was 0.1 pTor above.  | 744324  |  | 1980-1997  |\n| Nathalie Auger| 2019  | Canada  | Nine major categories of birth defects wereincluded， covering the central nervoussystem， sense organs (eye， nose， ear)，orofacial clefts， heart， respiratory， digestive，abdominal wall or diaphragm (gastroschisis， omphalocele， diaphragmatic hernia)， genitourinary， and musculoskeletal systems.  | calculated the distance between thepostal code centroid and the nearesttransmission line and transformer stationin meters.(<200).  | 2164246  |  | 1989-2016  |\n| Frank de Vocht| 2014  | England  | Low Birthweight (LBW)， Small forGestational Age (SGA) and Preterm Birth(PTB) (included spontaneaus preterm birth)  | linear residential proximity of 200 m or less based on measurement dataindicating that magnetic field strengthsfrom overhead power lines would notexceed normal domestic backgroundlevels at cistances of more than 200m from high voltage lines.  | 140356  |  | 2004-2008  |\n| Nathalie Auger Qiang Wang   | 2012 2013  | Canada China  | stillbirth miscarriage  | The referent was defined as 2 100 m，The straight-line distance between pastalcode centroids and the nearest power line werecalculated with Maplnfo Professional 8.0.the estimated magnetic field was 0.1 pT or above.  | 516685 413  |  | 1998-2007 2010-2012  |\n\n【45】Conclusion\n\n【46】This meta-analysis shows that no correlation has been found between maternal ELF-EMF exposure and miscarriage， stillbirth， neonatal birth defects and preterm delivery， while the effects on small gestational age and low birth weight are still uncertain.

The case of our patient is proof of this with a 5-year therapeutic errancy on chronic pain of the right shoulder for which medical treatments by rehabilitation and glenohumeral， subacromial and acromioclavicular infiltrations remained ineffective.\n\n【3】Case Presentation\n\n【4】This is a 39-year-old female patient， with no history of upper limb trauma， followed up between2013 and 2018 for right scapular pain labeled \"tendinopathy and subacromial impingement\"\n\n【5】Medical treatments never relieved her pain： Physiotherapy，infiltrations of the acromioclavicular joint (very moderate effectiveness of xylocaine， ineffectiveness of corticoids) and scapulohumeral joint， analgesics， rest.\n\n【6】She was referred to the department for pain resistant to medical treatment： On examination， the shoulder was supple but painful， with normal active amplitudes， but with increased pain in anterior elevation. She had no long biceps pain or signs of frank subacromial impingement， but she had severe pain (VAS 7/10) on pressure of the distal part of clavicle. The cross arm test was inconclusive.\n\n【7】The shoulder X-rays showed a type 1 acromion with a CSA (Critical Shoulder Angle) of 31°， without reporting any coracoclavicular abnormality at first sight. The arthro-scanner performed on this patient found calcification of the trapezoid tendon at its clavicular insertion with an obvious coracoclavicular impingement.\n\n【8】A xylocaine infiltration test of this calcification was performed， which resulted in complete resolution of impingement pain. A resection of the sub-clavicular calcification was decided upon following a good response to the xylocaine test.\n\n【9】Under arthroscopy， using a lateral and anterior instrumental approach， a bursectomy of the subacromial joint was performed without going intra-articular： A preserved subacromial space was aW found. A dissection of the bursa was performed up to the inferior aspect ofthe distal 14 of the clavicle at the VAPR： evidence of a reduced coracoclavicular space (<5 mm). A per operative dynamic pressure operation on the clavicle confirmed a real coracoclavicular impingement.\n\n【10】Using a motorized cutter， abrasion of the sub-clavicular calcification located opposite the clavicular insertion of the trapezoid ligament was performed while preserving the conoid. A dynamic operation using postoperative clavicular pressure ensured that this conflict disappeared.\n\n【11】The postoperative follow-up was simple， with the arthroscopic entry points closed to the strips on Day 1. She was discharged on Day 1 with a rehabilitation protocol without any limitation of mobility. Force work was allowed after full recovery of the amplitudes joint.\n\n【12】She was seen in consultation at 3 weeks and 3 months with complete resolution of her pain， recovery of all passive and active range of motion without pain. The control radiographs did not reveal any acromioclavicular subluxation or dislocation and a disappearance of coracoclavicular calcification.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】The coracoclavicular ligaments are remnants of the embryonic pro-coracoid cartilage . In about 6% of normal subjects both ends of the pro-coracoid remain cartilaginous. The pro coracoid may ossify. When its clavicular portion undergoes this transformation， a tubercle is formed on the clavicle. If its lower portion ossifies， the two processes can form a joint (1% of shoulder X-rays).\n\n【15】Chen et al. report two most frequent causes of coracoclavicular calcification with trauma ， which has a rather punctiform appearance (36%) and chronic kidney disease， which has a rather tumors appearance (28%). Ankylosing spondylitis has also been reported as a cause of coracoclavicular calcification . The patient presented in this case report had no such history.\n\n【16】Three types of calcifications have been reported ： Punctate calcifications ， ossifications with or without joint formation， and mass tumour calcifications.\n\n【17】In the literature， coracoclavicular pain is mostly reported and described in patients with a true \"coracoclavicular joint\"， so the incidence varies between 0.04% and 27%. Like all joints，they could be affected by rheumatic arthritis or osteoarthritis . The case reported by Cheung et al.  presents clinical characteristics like clinical case presented here. The pain was in front of the left clavicle on anterior rising of the arm.\n\n【18】As far as the treatment of this condition is concerned， the only cases described in the literature of this type of conflict have not been treated by arthroscopy. They were described at a time when arthroscopy was not very developed for shoulder. Treatment， when surgical， consisted of open resection . The approach allowing access to the coracoclavicular space is difficult and invasive and does not allow good visualization of calcifications.\n\n【19】The current challenge is the early detection of these conflicts on clinical examination， as described in the literature， a painful and limited anterior elevation with normal glenohumeral abduction seems to be a sign of coracoclavicular conflict because of a greater mobilization of the clavicle in these movements. X-rays， but especially CT scans with 3D reconstruction， are indispensable aids in the diagnostic process. The xylocaine test is also described as necessary in predicting a good surgical result.\n\n【20】Conclusion\n\n【21】Coracoclavicular calcifications are rare conditions with very few cases described in the literature. This can lead to diagnostic difficulties and yet the sub-clavicular space is easily accessible by arthroscopy. The technique described in this article is simple and allows an efficient and rapid management. The functional and aesthetic damage remains intact compared to the open surgery described until now for this type of pathology.\n\n【22】Arthroscopy offers a real advantage in the management of symptomatic coracoclavicular calcification， but this clinical entity should not be overlooked in front of painful anterior elevation with normal glenohumeral joint on radiography.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:25:24", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:25:49", "cost": 24.876}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:47", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:25:49", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:25:24"}

We report the case of a 56-year-old male with a left supraclavicular swelling that was diagnosed as Masson's haemangioma on histopathological examination.\n\n【2】Keywords： Intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia (IPEH)； Masson’s haemangioma； OPD\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Masson's haemangioma is a rare， benign vascular lesion that accounts for approximately 2% of all vascular tumors of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. It was first described by Pierre Mason in1923 in an ulcerated haemorrhoidal vein， but has also been reported to occur at various sites such as the cranium， thyroid， breast， neck， external jugular vein， tongue， oral cavity and rarely urethra . Due to its histological features of papillary formation， anastomosing vascular channels and plump endothelial cells， it was earlier thought to be a variant of angiosarcoma； however nowadays， it is considered a reactive vascular proliferation to traumatic vascular stasis . Due to its common presentation as a subcutaneous soft tissue lump， the diagnosis is usually not possible without histopathological examination.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 56-year-old， male patient came to our Outpatient Department (OPD) with the complaint of a left supraclavicular swelling for one year. On examination， the swelling measured 2 cm×2cm， and was mobile， non-tender， firm， and with no associated skin changes. A clinical diagnosis of lymphadenopathy was made and Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) asked for. FNAC reported the lesion as a benign lipomatous lesion  and the patient underwent excision of the lesion under local anaesthesia on OPD basis. During excision， the lump was found to be highly vascular， and multiple small vessels were seen traversing through it. The lesion was excised and sent for histopathological examination.\n\n【7】Histopathological examination revealed proliferation of endothelial cells within fibrous tissue， dilated blood vessels that contained thrombi， as well as fibrin deposition. There was no cellular atypia or mitotic figures， and a diagnosis of Masson's haemangioma was made . On receiving the histopathology report， the patient was questioned about any past history of trauma， and he revealed that he had been involved in a road side accident two years ago in which he had sustained trauma to the neck， left upper limb and a fracture of the shaft of left humerus that were managed conservatively.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Masson's haemangioma is a benign vascular tumor that is always almost intravascular， and clearly distinct from an organizing thrombus. It is known by various eponyms such as Masson's intravascular hemangioendothelioma， Intravascular Papillary Endothelial Hyperplasia (IPEH) or reactive endothelialhyperplasia . It was first described in 1923 by Pierre Masson within the lumen of inflamed hemorrhoidal veins in a 68-vear-old male and he believed the lesion caused obliteration of the vessel lumen leading to subsequent degeneration and necrosis. Masson's observations were modified by Henschen， who believed that the lesion was a reactive process rather than a neoplasm. This was confirmed by the findings reported by Kauffman and Stout  that the endothelial layer of the lesion was composed of normal endothelial cells and that the endothelial proliferation was of benign papillae pattern and the cells showed no atypia. Nowadays it is considered to be a reactive vascular proliferation following traumatic vascular stasis .\n\n【10】It is difficult to make a pre-operative diagnosis of Masson’s haemangioma， and it is often misdiagnosed as fibrolipoma， ganglion， cyst， soft tissue tumor or sarcoma. The lesion has no age or gender predilection and has been frequently reported from the head， neck， fingers， trunk and cutaneous veins. It usually presents as a small， firm， superficial mass with bluish-red discoloration of the overlying skin. Color Doppler or a plain ultrasound can be helpful in diagnosing a vascular lesion， but there are no pathognomic features to make the diagnosis with certainty.\n\n【11】Histopathological examination of the excised swelling is the gold standard for making a diagnosis-the following features are important in making the diagnosis and ruling out other vascular lesions：\n\n【12】Intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia， either well-circumscribed or encapsulated；\n\n【13】The papillae are composed of fibro-hyalinized tissue oftwo or more endothelial cell layers；\n\n【14】The proliferative process is completely limited to the intravascular spaces；\n\n【15】The endothelial cells are hyperchromatic， but extreme nuclear atypia and mitotic figures and necrosis are not seen；\n\n【16】There may be pseudo channels， but there are no irregular or anastomosing blood vessels in the stroma .\n\n【17】Based on histopathology， Masson’s haemangioma can be classified into three distinct categories：\n\n【18】However， these different pathological varieties do not have any clinical significance， since the treatment is total excision. When resected completely， recurrence is extremely rare.\n\n【19】A “pure form” that occurs within a dilated vascular space， and is most frequently located in the fingers， in the region between the elbows and hands or head and neck，\n\n【20】A“mixed form” that represents a focal change in a pre-existing haemangioma， vascular malformation， or pyogenic granuloma， and A rare “indeterminate\" form that does not belong to either ofthe first two categories， and has an extravascular origin .\n\n【21】However， these different pathological varieties do not have any clinical significance， since the treatment is total excision.

The global prevalence of SCI is 1：1000， with an incidence of 4 to 9 new cases per 100，000 people per year. The most common causes of traumatic SCI are traffic accidents， falls， and acts ofviolence. Currently， the prevalence of quadriplegia is comparable to that of paraplegia . To the best of our knowledge， this case report highlights the use of spinal cord stimulation for the first time to treat traumatic complete paraplegia of the lower extremities， with substantial efficacy. We present the case of a 38-year-old Asian male， a truck driver by profession. He had suffered a complete loss of motor and sensory functions in both lower extremities in a traffic accident 3 years ago. The accident also resulted in an AIS-B injury (the sensory function is preserved in the S4-S5 area of the sacral segment， but no motor function is preserved) at the T11/T12level，accompanied by alternating numbness， deep sensory disturbances， and dyskinesia in both lower extremities， with no spasticity in the legs， and a motor score of 0 for all key leg muscles (No muscle contraction). The patient did not show any clinical improvement in both lower extremities after spinal internal fixation and could not stand or walk (walking index score for SCI： 0)， despite extensive rehabilitation in a rehabilitation center. Therefore， with the consent of the patient and his family， we exploratively implanted a Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) device in his body on April 26，2020， to improve the symptoms of the lower extremities.\n\n【2】During the operation， an approximately 4-cm-long straight incision of was made on the L2-L3dorsal surface under C-arm guidance. The corresponding lamina was opened， and electrodes (model565 DEFINE 2×8； Medtronic， USA) were inserted upward in the epidural space. Thereafter， the electrodes were connected to an Implantable Pulse Generator (IPG)， and the working parameters were set as follows： voltage， 1.8 V； pulse width， 210 us； and frequency， 300 HZ through repeated tuning. The motor score of the patient’s key muscles in both lower extremities was graded 1 after surgery. The muscles can contract slightly， but they cannot move the joints. The contraction of the muscles can be felt only when the muscles are touched. The patient's spinal cord injury grade was AIS-C. For position sensation assessment， we requested the patient to close his eyes and then placed his lower extremities in a certain position， and asked the patient to describe the position of the extremities. For movement sensation assessment， we requested the patient to close his eyes，and then flexed orbent his extremities， and asked the patient to describe the direction of movement. For vibration sensation assessment， we placed a vibrating tuning-fork on the bony prominence of the patient and asked the patient to describe the sensation of vibration and the duration of sensation. The patient underwent long-term， extensive rehabilitation training， including comprehensive limb training， gait and balance training， and whole-body muscle training. At the 2-year discharge follow-up， the patient was able to stand and walk with the assistance of a limb appliance ， and the patient's spinal cord injury grade was AIS-D. (Motor function is preserved below the nerve plane of spinal cord injury， and at least half of the key muscle strength below the nerve plane of spinal cord injury is restored to grade 3).\n\n【3】Keywords\n\n【4】Traumatic complete paraplegia； Lower extremities； Spinal cord injury； Spinal neuromodulation. Discussion Herein， we reported a case of using an SCS device to restore the functions of standing， walking， and trunk control in a patient with complete traumatic paraplegia of both lower extremities.\n\n【5】Table 1： Changes in sensory and motor functions in both lower extremities of the patient.\n\n| Study  | Deep sensation  |  |  | Alternating numbness  | Muscle strength (grade)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Test  | Position sensation  | Movement sensation  | Vibration sensation  | Alternating numbness  | Muscle strength (grade)  |\n| Before surgery  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 1 day after surgery  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| 2 years atter surgery  |  |  |  |  |  |\n\n【7】-， +， and ++++represent the degree of a symptom\n\n【8】Although the patient did not regain natural movement， this recovery is sufficient to demonstrate the considerable progress achieved with spinal neuromodulation in the treatment of SCI-induced paraplegia. Previously， it was considered that such a recovery is mediated by remodeling of the residual descending pathway .\n\n【9】It has been hypothesized that a few nerve fibers can survive spinal injury， but these fibers remain functionally silent owing to low activities below the spinal level of injury . This suggests that electrical stimulation of the spinal cord enhances the signal from the residual descending pathway， and this interpretation is further supported here bythebetter performance achieved with rehabilitation after SCS device implantation compared with that before SCS device implantation.\n\n【10】SCS is a neuromodulation technique used to relieve chronic pain， and it may serve as a new therapeutic option to relieve the symptoms of SCI in patients.

We aim to analyze the effect of Fuji Apple Juice (AJ) intake on Oxidative Stress (OS) and biochemical parameters after a single HD session in chronic HD patients.\n\n【2】Case Report： Six HD patients consumed 300 mL and 150 mL of Fuji AJ (Malus domestica Borkh) on different days，immediately after a single HD session. A 3-week washout period was applied between the two doses. Blood samples were collected before and after 30 min and 60 min. We analyzed the total antioxidant status， Total Oxidant Status (TOS)， Ascorbic Acid (AA)， catalase， glutathione peroxidase， Superoxide Dismutase (SOD)， and reduced glutathione， as well as biochemical parameters including phosphorus， K， Uric Acid (UA)， and glucose. After both trials， patients were questioned by telephone about AJ tolerance.\n\n【3】Conclusion： The 300 mL of AJ significantly increased TOs (p=0.05)， AA (p=0.001)， UA， and K levels (p ≤0.00) over time， while SOD activity increased significantly only after 30 min (p=0.02). After 150 mL of AJ， UA and phosphorus levels increased significantly (p<0.00). Acute AJ intake did not affect bowel habits and no adverse gastrointestinal events were reported. Thus， acute AJ intake was well tolerated and 300 mL of AJ may provide mild-favorable effects on antioxidant status without exceeding recommended values of serum Kin HD patients.\n\n【4】Keywords： Hemodialysis； Apple juice； Acute intake； Oxidative stress； Potassium\n\n【5】Abbre viations\n\n【6】K： Potassium； HD： Hemodialysis； AJ： Apple Juice； OS： Oxidative Stress； TOS： Total Oxidant Status； AA： Ascorbic Acid； SOD： Superoxide Dismutase； UA： Uric Acid； SD： Standard Deviation； EPAGRI： Rural Issues and Agricultural Research Institute of Santa Catarina\n\n【7】Introduction\n\n【8】Increased Oxidative Stress (OS) is related to chronic inflammation and all-cause mortality in maintenance Hemodialysis (HD) patients . Strong evidence shows that food-based antioxidant intake is more advantageous to treat chronic kidney disease in relation to nutrient-based supplementation， for instance， citric fruit in the diet leads to a better response against OS when compared to Ascorbic Acid (AA) supplementation .\n\n【9】Several fruits are rich in polyphenols， a powerful group of antioxidants . Polyphenols act as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant agents and prevent cardiovascular diseases ， which is the main cause of death among HD patients . Apples are considered a valuable source of nutrients and phytochemicals， including polyphenols . The intake of an apple twice a day for a week was well-tolerated among HD patients and showed promising effects on antioxidant status without affecting serum Potassium (K)levels . Juice made from 100% fruit showed favourable evidence of antioxidant content which may also provide health benefits .\n\n【10】To date， there are no published studies showing the effects of Apple Juice (AJ) intake on OS and K levels in chronic HD patients. In this pioneer-pilot study， we hypothesized that acute AJ intake of 150 mL and 300 mL would have beneficial effects on OS parameters after a single HD session， without increasing serum K levels.\n\n【11】Case Presentation\n\n【12】Six patients were analyzed in this study. All of them were on dialysis 3 times/week (3 to 4 h/session) with polysulfone dialyzer membrane. Patients were 49.3 ± 11.4 (mean ± SD) years-old and mainly male (n=5). The most common etiologies for chronic kidney disease were diabetes (n=4)， hypertension (n=1)，and atrophic kidney(n=1). Patients showed dialysis vintage of 38.8 ± 51.1 (mean ± SD) months， body mass index (body weight (kg)/height (m)) of 28.5 ±5.8 kg/m²(mean ±SD)， creatinine of 1140.3 ±234.2 umol/L (mean± SD)， Kt/V of 1.29± 0.16 (mean ± SD)， glomerular filtration rate of 4.33 ± 1.21 mL/min/1.73(mean ± SD)， hematocrit of 33.5±2.58% (mean ± SD)， and hemoglobin of 109 ± 9.6 g/L (mean ±SD). All patients received phosphorus binders and intravenous erythropoietin， and they were all on therapeutic regimens which included antihypertensive and/or antidiabetic drugs. For this study， participants were used as their own controls， thus all data were compared to individual baseline values. This study was conducted from June to August 2015 in a dialysis clinic located in a southern capital of Brazil. Each volunteer consumed Fuji AJ immediately after a dialysis session. Three hundred milliliters of AJ were consumed in the first trial， followed by 150 mL of AJ in the second trial. A 3-week washout period was applied between the two intervention days. The Fuji apples were obtained from the Rural Issues and Agricultural Research Institute of Santa Catarina (EPAGRI) (latitude2817' 39\"， longitude 49°55'56\" and altitude 1.415 m)， Brazil. Mature apples were harvested during the 2015-season and stored at +4±1℃(mean ± SD) until the trials. Approximately 3.5 and 1.5 units of Fuji apples were used to prepare 300 mL and 150 mL of AJ， respectively. The300 mL-dose was chosen considering favourable effects previously described in healthy volunteers . Unpeeled apples without seeds or added water were blended in a centrifugal juice extractor (Britania， Sao Paulo， Brazil). The juice， containing 100% apple was consumed immediately after the mentioned procedure. Chemical composition， polyphenol content， and antioxidant capacity from both trials (150mL and 300 mL AJ) were measured and showed no significant differences between each other . All participants received dietary monitoring and counseling from a certified dietitian. Subjects were instructed to avoid polyphenol-rich foods for 2 days before the Table 1： Chemical composition of Fujr apple juice used in the study.\n\n| Parameter， unit  | Apple juice  |  | p  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Parameter， unit  | 300mL  | 150mL  | p  |\n| Dry matter，%  | 14.08(0.63)  | 14.28(0.34)  | 0.47  |\n| TSS，°Brix  | 14.13(0.81)  | 14.01 (0.92)  | 0.66  |\n| pH  | 4.59 (0.19)  | 4.49(0.15)  | 0.22  |\n| TA， g eq malic acid/dL  | 2.04(0.62)  | 1.58(0.27)  | 0.06  |\n| TP，mg EGA/dL  | 43.24(16.0)  | 50.40(2.52)  | 0.20  |\n| TF，mg eq. catechin/dL  | 4.66 (0.27)  | 5.04(0.15)  | 0.26  |\n| TMA， mg ci-3-gli/dL  | 0.47(5.18)  | 0.33(0.04)  | 0.10  |\n| DPPH， ECso mg/L  | 18.06(8.71)  | 17.40(3.17)  | 0.83  |\n\n【14】TSS： Total Soluble Solids； TA： Titratable Acidity； TP： Total Phenolic； EGA：Equivalent Gallic Acid； TF： Total Flavanol； TMA： Total Monomeric Anthocyanin； DPPH： serum 2，2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical-scavenging activity.

Blood samples were centrifuged immediately after collection and stored at-80°C until further analysis. Glucose，uricacid (UA)， and phosphorus serum levels were determined using commercially available kits(Labtest， Lagoa Santa， Minas Gerais， Brazil). Potassium levels were determined by an automated Dimension RXL Max System (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Products GMBH， Marburg， Germany). Total Antioxidant Status (TAS) and Total Oxidant Status (TOS) assays were measured by spectrophotometry . Ascorbic Acid(AA)  and reduced glutathione  were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. Superoxide Dismutase (SOD) activity was evaluated using an SOD Assay Kit (Sigma Aldrich， St. Louis， MO， USA). Catalase and glutathione peroxidase activity were determined as previously described . Complementary clinical and biochemical data were obtained from medical records (chronic kidney disease etiology， dialysis vintage， Kt/V，creatinine， glomerular filtration rate，hematocrit，and hemoglobin). This study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee， and by the U.S. National Library of Medicine. All participants provided written and informed consent. For statistical analysis， the Student t-test was applied to verify differences between the two trials and gastrointestinal symptoms. One-way RM-ANOVA was applied to verify the effects of AJ intake after 30 min and 60 min on OS and biochemical parameters，followed by the post-hoc Bonferroni. Two-way RM-ANOVA was used to compare doses of AJ， followed by the post-hoc Bonferroni. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 17.0 software (SPSS Inc， Chicago， IL， USA). A significance levellower than 5% (P<0.05) was considered.\n\n【15】Table 2： Changes (A) in axidative stress after acute intake of Fuji apple juice.\n\n| Parameter  | Time， unit  | Apple juice  |  | p  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Parameter  | Time， unit  | 300 mL  | 150mL  | p  |\n|  | Baseline， mmol/L  | 0.45(0.24)  | 0.34(0.09)  |  |\n| TAS  | 30 min， A%  | 2.20(30.60)  | 2.90(21.50)  | 0.3  |\n|  | 60 min，A%  | -2.20(32.40)  | -8.80(13.10)  |  |\n|  | Baseline，mmol/L  | 0.25 (0.17)  | 0.16 (0.07)  |  |\n| TOS  | 30 min， A%  | +44  | +12(70.10)  | 0.15  |\n|  | 60 min，A%  | +72(134.40)  | +25(128.60)  |  |\n|  | Baseline， U/mg Hb  | 0.65(0.27)  | 1.50(0.63)  |  |\n| Catalase  | 30 min， A%  | +48 (67.50)  | +51(76.60)  | 0.03  |\n|  | 60 min，A%  | +12(164.20)  | +20(33.40)  |  |\n|  | Baseline， U/mg Hb  | 121.80(73.10)  | 152.50(23.30)  |  |\n| SOD  | 30 min， A%  | +11.60(137.60)  | +4(27.60)  | 0.36  |\n|  | 60 min， A%  | -2.90  | -15(22.40)  |  |\n|  | Baseline， U/mg Hb  | 16.50(12.10)  | 22(15.20)  |  |\n| GPx  | 30 min， A%  | +19 (34.20)  | -4.50(17.90)  | 0.56  |\n|  | 60 min，A%  | -7.30(51.30)  | -37(43.20)  |  |\n|  | Baseline， pmal/g Hb  | 6.23(2.71)  | 6.53(1.58)  |  |\n| GSH  | 30 min， A%  | -8.30(23.50)  | +15.60(14.70)  | 0.54  |\n|  | 60 min， A%  | +6.70(58.10)  | +6.70(21.10)  |  |\n|  | Baseline， umol/L  | 99.50(13.10)  | 28.50  |  |\n| Ascorbic acid  | 30 min，A%  | +11.20(7.50)  | +3.90(3.90)  | <0.00  |\n|  | 60 min， A%  | +18.10(8.40)°  | +8.80(4.30)  |  |\n|  | Baseline， umal/L  | 109.90(18.20 | 135(33.30)8  |  |\n| Uric acid  | 30 min，A%  | +16.60(8.50)  | +11.90(7.56)b  | 0.04  |\n|  | 60 min， A%  | +22.10(13.30)°  | +16.70(7.01)  |  |\n\n【17】TAS： Total Antioxidant Status； TOS： Total Oxidant Status； SOD： Superoxide Dismutase； GPx： Glutathione Peroxidase； GSH： Reduced Glutathione Values as mean (standard deviation) (n=6).

We found mild-favourable effects with 300 mL of AJ on some OS biomarkers， without exceeding recommended values of serum K for HD patients . Table 2shows the effect size of AJ intake on OS. In the first trial， 300 mL of AJ significantly increased TOS (p=0.05)， AA (p=0.001) and UA (ps0.00) over time， but SOD activity only increased significantly after 30min (p=0.02).\n\n【24】Special attention must be given to the intake of fruit juices by people with diabetes mellitus， as the AJ showed to increase glucose levels. It is noteworthy that AJ did not exceed the recommended K values in HD patients .\n\n【25】After the dose of 150 mL， only UA increased significantly (p<0.00). In summary， acute AJ intake did not change TAS values after a single HD session， even though UA levels increased significantly. An explanation for this might be the insufficient boosting of UA levels to modulate TAS values via the fructose-induced pathway . In addition， we speculate that antioxidants found in the given doses of AJ were not effective in decreasing TOS levels， even though previous studies with different fruit juices demonstrated an effective defense against OS in HD patients .\n\n【26】Both trials maintained the regular bowel habits among patients， showing no significant changes in the median defecations per day of1.5(p=0.36)， and no adverse gastrointestinal effects were reported(data not shown). In conclusion， AJ intake was well tolerated， and the dose of 300 mL may provide mild-favourable effects on OS after a single HD session， without exceeding recommended values of serum K in chronic HD patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:10:13", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:10:43", "cost": 29.647}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:47", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:10:42", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:10:12"}

It is usually not associated with underlying systemic disease and follows a benign course with spontaneous regression. No specific treatment modalities are needed. Herein， an anecdotal case of purpura pigmentosa linearis unilateralis chronica is presented in the highlights of a scientific literature update.\n\n【2】Keywords： Purpura pigmentosa； Segmental distribution； Spontaneous regression\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Purpura Pigmentosa Linearis Unilateralis Chronica (PPLUC) is a rare capillaritis ， a subtype of Pigmented Purpuric Dermatoses (PPD). It is characterized clinically by linear or segmental distribution of pigmented purpuric macules located predominantly on the lower extremities. First， in 1992 Riordan et al.  described four cases of distinctive type of purpuric eruption， occurring in a linear and pseudo-dermatomal distribution in young males.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 23-year-old male was admitted to our department with a eight-month history of an asymptomatic rash， starting from the posterior left lowerleg and ascending towards his left buttock. The patient denied any accompanying disease. The clinical presentation revealed well-defined purpuric patches， partly confluent into circumscribed ecchymoses ， following the lines of Blaschko in alinear S1/S2 distribution. Dermoscopyshowed vascularlacunae， brown dots， andlinear vessels . A punch biopsy from the left calf revealed mild perivascular lympho-plasmocytic inflammatory infiltration with erythrocyte extravasation in the papillary dermis . The routine blood count and coagulation tests were normal， thus excluding thrombocytopenic purpura.\n\n【7】Diagnosis of pigmented linear unilateral purpura was concluded based on clinical presentation and histological findings. The patient was advised to sustain low activity lifestyle. Vasoprotective regimen was additionally prescribed. At the second month follow-up visit no objective changes were registered.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Purpura pigmentosa chronica is a chronic inflammation of the capillaries， usually affecting areas of hypostasis. Several clinical subtypes have been commonly described： Purpura annularis telangiectodes or Majocchi's disease， pigmented purpuric lichenoid dermatosis of Gougerot and Blum， eczematid-like purpura of Doucas and Kapetanakis， Schamberg’s disease or purpura progressive， and lichen aureus . Rare variants such as purpura granulomatosis， transitory pigmented purpuric eruption， purpura pigmentosa linearis unilateralis chronica have also been reported. All subtypes are histologically identical， manifesting capillaritis .\n\n【10】Unilateral Linear Capillaritis (ULC) is a benign condition with a tendency to regress spontaneously over several months to a few years . In 2017 Elshimy et al.  critically reviewed the fourteen ULC cases reported up to that time worldwide and found no sex predominance(male：female =8：6)， mid-adulthood average onset age (21 years)， predominant location of the lower extremities， and spontaneous regression between 3 to 36 months. As patients were largely asymptomatic， no active treatment was required.\n\n【11】Suggested causative factors include abnormalities in the cellular immunesystem， bacterial infections， capillary fragility， drug induction， and phlebostasis . The unilateral or linear distribution ofULC along Blaschko lines might also be explained by an underlying genetic abnormality， such as mosaicism .\n\n【12】Three different pathogenetic mechanisms have been proposed：enhanced delayed hypersensitivity immune response causing dermal infiltrate of lymphocytes， macrophages andLangerhans cells； disturbed humoral immunity and increased capillary fragility.\n\n【13】The main differential diagnosis includes thrombocytopenic purpura- a rare blood disorder， characterized by purpuric patches， fatigue， anemia， and neurologic disturbances. Often severe bleeding， fever and dark urine from hemoglobinuria can also be seen .The disease is easily recognized by typical blood count findings.\n\n【14】The rather inconspicuous ULC course， lack of subjective symptoms， and the tendency of spontaneous regression evokes no active treatment . However， few therapeutic modalities have been tried. Pentoxifylline proved beneficial， especially in patients with more extensive lesions ，psoralen-PUVA treatment has been reported to improve the condition . We preferred vasoprotective drugs， which unfortunately showed no effective impact on the 204month follow-up visit.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】ULC is a very peculiar clinical form of chronic pigmented purpura， usually not associated with underlying systemic condition. It follows a benign course with spontaneous regression， occurring up to 36 months upon onset. Hence， different treatment modalities should be accurately selected since they may expose patients to greater risk than benefit.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:10:02", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:10:10", "cost": 8.117}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:47", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:10:09", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:10:01"}

PainDraineris a drug-free， self-management tool， powered by artificial intelligence that adapts to the self-reported activities of each individual patient， resulting in a truly patient-centric support. The tool was tested in an open label， one-arm pilot study performed in two phases， encompassing in total 15 patients. The change in quality of life， pre-and post-treatment by using PainDrainer\"， was measured using a PROMIS Pain Interference 6a validated questionnaire. The outcome showed a statistically significant improvement in pain interference， surpassed the minimal important difference between T-scores， and showed a reduction in pain intensity after six weeks'treatment. In conclusions the study showed both patient acceptance and improvement in quality of life for chronic pain patients.\n\n【2】Commentary\n\n【3】Pain is one of the most common reasons patients see a physician ， a leading reason for suffering and disability ， and more than 100 million individuals only in the United States suffer from chronic pain . This condition is considered as a major worldwide health problem and is associated with high personal and economic costs. Despite the high prevalence of chronic pain， most patients find even the most up to date treatments falling short due lack of efficacy or significant side effects. The current Opioid Crisis in the United States is a clear example of this problem . Also， many patients have very limited access to highly specialized pain clinics due to both availability and/or cost . An alternative option to increase accessibility， not only to chronic pain patients，but to a variety of health conditions are digital tools for self- management. Those tools have emerged over the past few years， one example being the recently developed PainDrainer\" for chronic pain. PainDrainer\" was developed in collaboration with health care providers， pain specialists and experts in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and is utilizing the concept of the Acceptance and Commitment Therapy(ACT)， believed to constitute a core component in evidence-based treatment of chronic pain. ACT is considered a form of clinicalbehavior analysis and is based on functional contextualism leading to effective action and clinical interventions. Furthermore，ACT has a behavioral perspective of inner experience， for example pain， caused by environmental events which may influence the patient . According to the American Psychological Association， ACT also recently achieved the status of “well established” for the treatment for chronic pain. If the relationship between daily activities and the experienced pain level of the patient could be understood and the balance be improved， it would allow the patients to do more， suffer less and improve their Quality of Life(QoL). In order for a patient to learn how their daily activities affect their pain， the different activities and pain levels need to be recorded， analyzed and presented back to the patient. Since the human brain can only process around four parameters at a given time ， the relation between daily activities and pain is difficult to comprehend and interpret. Inaccurate conclusions can lead to problems， such as fear avoidance and catastrophizing. However， a digital device powered by artificial intelligence could better quantitative， clarify and decipher the relationship of daily activities and pain， which in turn could help patients maximize their desired activities. PainDrainer was developed to takes advantage of the relation between environmental events， such as daily activities， and experienced pain to guide the chronic pain patient on how not to exceed a certain pain level. The patient simply records their daily activities and the resulting pain. The AI engine of PainDraineris designed to adapt to each individual patient and the resulting advice is consequently truly patient-centric on how to best advise them to achieve their goals， using the information they provided. It is continually updated， allows review of prior activities and lets the patient set new goals each day. The display of PainDrainer is shown in Figure 1. The present clinical study design was a one-arm， open label pilot study performed at the Koman Family Outpatient Pavilion at UC San Diego Health (IRB 190759). The study tested the hypothesis that self-management， using a drug-free， digital tool powered by an AI engine could increase the QoL of chronic pain patients. The primary and secondary outcome of this pilot study was improvement in pain interference and pain intensity， respectively. Eligible patients (67% women)， suffering from neck， shoulder， and/or lower back pain， who were undergoing standard medical care at a university based， chronic pain management clinic was included in the study after signing an informed consent. The first phase of the pilot study enrolled nine patients and was based on version 13 of PainDrainer， while the second phase of the pilot study enrolled six patients and was based on version 14. The difference between versions was an improved user interface in the latter， including improved graphics， usability， helps texts， specific feedback and prognosis， all which provided an enhanced user experience. Importantly， both versions had the same functionality， including algorithms， AI engine and treatment options. Both study phases were LIIS：evaluated， usingtheevalidated questionnairePROMIS Pair Interference 6a to measure QoL . From this questionnaire， the T-scores were calculated and compared at the start of the study and post-treatment after around 6 weeks of using PainDrainer. The T-score shows how many standard deviations the result is from the mean and a post-treatment reduction indicated a positive response. The positive response rate in the first phase was 56% (5/9)， while 44%(4/9) of the patients showed no improvement. In the second phase， the positive response rate was 83% (5/6)， while 17% (1/6) of the patients showed no improvement . The power in the response was then analyzed， using a one-tail， paired T-tests to calculate the statistical difference between T-scores， pre- and post-treatment. In phase one， the p-value between the T-scores obtained pre-and post-treatment was 0.0086 and in phase two the p-value was0.0014. The Minimally Important Difference (MID)  was then analyzed for both study phases ， where MID refers to the smallest meaningful difference in T-score that carries implications for the patient. For pain interference， MID estimates range from 2 to 3T-score points . In our first study phase the mean difference between T-scores was 3.0， while in the second study phase a mean of4.8 was recorded. Consequently， after using PainDrainer\"for around six weeks the result surpassed a clinically relevant MID. This effect was also sustained in the majority of patients that continued to use PainDrainer\" for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was improvement in pain interference， indicated by a decrease in T-score， which the results supported. The secondary outcome was experienced pain intensity measured by the NRS scale. A reduction was recorded in10/15 patients ， with a mean reduction in pain intensity of1.6 units (range 1-4 units). Three patients showed no change， while two patients showed an increased pain level with one unit. PainDrainer is powered by an AI engine and uses machine learning to teach an individual model associating activities with average pain. The model is based on artificial neural networks， specifically a multi-layer perceptron with a single hidden layer . During training(back-propagation) the weight factors are tuned such that a given activity record corresponds to the average pain as recorded by the patient. The training is carried out to ensure that model can generalize as good as possible to unseen activity settings. A trained model can be queried in a reverse fashion to find appropriate activities for a desired average pain level. To test the engine， we analyzed the convergence rate for each responding patient， using version 14. The AI engine showed convergence in all responding patients after their individual logging of activities. A converging AI engine demonstrates that the software adapts to the input data of each individual patients， illustrating the concept of patient-centricity. The effect of ACT has been investigated in a number of traditional clinical studies， where the outcome has varied from none to modest improvements in pain interference，while resulting in more significant improvements in depression， and anxiety . Several trials with digitally delivered ACT have also been conducted ， including smart phone applications， although these have not provided anytheoretical rationale or have undergone clinical efficacytesting . PainDrainer is， to the best of our knowledge， the first digital tool， powered by artificial intelligence to address an unlimited accessibility for chronic pain patients to a drug free， self-management tool with initial clinical evidence. In summary， we have designed a truly patient-centric digital tool to circumvent questions， such as what works for whom， how and under which circumstances? Consequently， we tested a digital， self-management tool powered by an AI engine， in a pilot study for chronic pain patients. The outcome of the study indicates that by utilizing PainDrainer the patients achieved an increased QoL， due to the fact that the AI engine allowed them to better manage the relation between their daily activities and their pain. The positive indications from the present pilot study will form the basis for further clinical investigations with larger sample size and an extended follow-up period.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:38:30", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:38:41", "cost": 10.871}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:47", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:38:40", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:38:29"}

Although benign， the ABC can be locally aggressive. Its expansile nature can cause pain， swelling， deformity， disruption of growth plates or joint surfaces. It constitutes 1% of all bone tumors， most commonly seen in children and adolescents. Almost all bones can be involved，butlong bone metaphyses and vertebrae are the mosi common sites of involvement. Among all flat bones， the clavicle is one of the rare sites where tumors or tumor-like lesions are seen， and it is one of the very rare settlements in terms of ABC. In this study， we present a rare case of an 8-year-old patient who was surgically treated with an aneurysmal bone cyst located in the right clavicle， resembling a solitary bone cyst with a Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI).\n\n【2】Keywords： Cyst； Bone； Clavicle； Tumour； Benign\n\n【3】Case Presentation\n\n【4】An 8-year-old girl with painless swelling on the right clavicle was found to have a mass of 2 cm x 2 cm in the right supraclavicular region on the physical examination. No skin disorder，localized increase in temperature or redness. In biochemical analyzes were normal. Anti HCV，HBSAG and anti HCV values were negative.\n\n【5】In the radiographs taken for the mass， in the right clavicle was found eccentrically located， septated，superior cortex thinned but undisturbedan expansilelyticlesion with slightly heterogenous internal structure . On Computed Tomography (CT)， in the right clavicle， expansile， heterogeneous bone lesion in the right clavicle was obtained. It was noted that a portion of the lesion was surrounded by a sclerotic line and the cortical cortex was somewhat tapered in CT sections.A focal septation-like appearance was observed in the lesion . On Magnetic Resonance(MR) images， the lesion in the right clavicle was seen a thin septation in the central portion and expansile character low signal on T1 weighted images and high signal and in the T2 weighted images . In contrast enhanced images the lesion showed peripheral contrast enhancement， but not a significant fluid-fluid level . Despite the eccentric and septated appearance on x-ray examination， the presence of highly homogeneous of internal structure and absence of fluid-fluid levels on CT and MR， suspicious in terms of solitary bone cysts. The presence of focal， more contrasting areas within the lesion in MR images also suggests the differential diagnosis of telangiectatic osteosarcoma.\n\n【6】Aspiration biopsy was performed first for the differential diagnosis of the lesion， followed by biopsy of the lesion. Aspirated red liquid was prepared using a liquid based cytology method. Cytology was the result of blood elements (non-diagnostic cytology). There were no signs of infection. In the biopsy specimen， the material was mostly composed of reactive new bone tissue and a very small area oflesion support the ABC .\n\n【7】The case was operated with prediagnosis of ABC. Frozen study showed numerous myxoid and chondroid stromal cartilaginous tissue and loose stromal component and membranous fragments between them and no definitive diagnosis was made. In the resected curette material， fibrotic stroma surrounding blood-filled cavities， hemosiderin-loaded macrophages and osteoclastic giant cells were observed. The case was reported as ABC. Cellular atypia and other malignancy findings were not observed in the material. Thelesion was curetted during surgery and the space in the clavicle was filled with bone graft. The case was directed to follow\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Aneurysmal Bone Cyst (ABC) is an expansile， osteolytic， locally destructive benign vascular lesion which is one of the pseudotumors of the bone； it is located intramedullary . It was first described by Jaffe and Lichtenstein in 1942 . It constitutes approximately 1% of all primary bone tumors . ABC is common in the metaphyses of the extremity long bones and in the vertebrae and it is rare in short tubular bones， patella， calvarial bones， flat bones such as orbita and costas . The clavicle is one of the places where the tumor and tumor-like lesions are very rare . The incidence of tumors in the clavicle is less than 1%. ABC is the most common benign lesion of the clavicle . 85% of cases with aneurysmal bone cyst are under 20years-old and rarely seen less than 5 years-old . Accordingly we present an 8-year-old girl. Patients usually have pain， swelling， and more rarely pathological fractures. Symptoms occur after trauma in one third of the cases . Our patient presented with complaints of pain and swelling. Skin redness， temperature difference， trauma story was not available.\n\n【10】The prognosis of the disease varies. Sometimes the lesion grows slowly； sometimes it grows rapidly and reaches giant dimensions The duration of symptoms is usually shorter than six months . In our case， swelling was noticed about 1 month ago the etiology of ABC is not fully known. The primary lesion started as arteriovenous malformation from the bone or periosteal region and hemodynamic effects of blood flow play a role in etiology. Dabezies et al.  claim that ABC is seen in children after fracture and trauma can play a role in etiology.\n\n【11】Typical radiographic appearance of aneurysmal bone cyst is eccentrically located， expansile， occasionally osteolytic bone lesion. Integrity of cortex is generally preserved. There is no periosteal reaction . Pathologic fracture is very rare . The transition zone between the normal bony and lesion is narrow and soft tissue component is not observed. However， if the cortex erodes， destroys， and contains a soft tissue component， it may suggest an aggressive form of ABC . Appearance of soap bubbles in the lesion together with the thinned cortex is rarely detected. If the cortex and medullary together erode， it can mimic a centrally located tumor in the bone . ABC is seen in as sub periosteal thickening on the x-ray. Centrally located lesions may mimic simple bone cysts but simple bone cyst is always seen at the center of metaphysis adjacent to epiphyseal area. In our case， an eccentrically located， expansile， well-defined osteolytic lesion was determined in X-ray. ABC is seen as cyst with septated， fluid-fluid level on CT. The lesion is usually seen low-signal， but there may also high signal areas depend on presence of hemorrhage on T1-weighted MR images. Heterogeneous high-signal areas can be observed due to cyst content on T2-weighted images . ABC should be considered in the presence of septated cyst with fluid-fluid level， showing low signal on T1 and high-signal on T2 weighted images . Fluid-fluid level is specific for aneurysmal bone cyst . In our case， this specific appearance was not determined on MRI and the homogeneous internal structure separated by fine septation was observed. Therefore， MRI appearance suggests solitary bone cyst. The ABC has primary types (about 70%) and secondary forms(about 30%) with concomitant benign and malignant tumors such as chondroblastoma， giant cell tumor， osteoblastoma， osteosarcoma， malignant fibrous histiocytoma .\n\n【12】The histological structure of theaneurysmal bone cyst is composed of reactive repairtissue withhemorrhagetherefore microscopic images of some areas of giant cell tumor， fibrous dysplasia， chondroblastoma， osteoblastoma can resemble aneurysmal bone cyst . Therefore， it should be debated whether aneurysmal bone cyst is secondary to another lesion or cystic hemorrhagic structural changes of the lesion. These tumors， which are counted because of their coexistence and similarities in imaging methods， should be considered in differential diagnosis. Treatment planning should not be done without definitive diagnosis by biopsy .\n\n【13】Morphologically， there are cystic， cystic-solid (mixed) and solid forms of ABC . The most striking feature of the cystic type is the cavernous spaces with fibrous tissue， osteoclastic giant cells and bone mixture. In the solid type， osteoblastic and fibrous proliferation and scattered osteoclastic giant cells and osteoid trabeculae are observed. In the mixed type， characteristics of these two types coexist. Microscopically， cystic spaces filled with erythrocytes are observed， whose inner surfaces are not paved with endothelium . There are capillary-rich fibroblastic proliferation， osteoclastic giant cells， hemosiderin-loaded macrophages， and reactive new bone tissue on the wall of cystic spaces that do not cascade to each other . Histopathological differential diagnosis of ABC is giant cell tumor， brown tumor， fibrous dysplasia， chondroblastoma， osteoblastoma. In some areas of these tumors， the presence of cystic hemorrhagic areas and osteoclastic giant cells similar to ABC which may lead to misdiagnosis. The solid type of aneurysmal bone cyst with a soft tissue component may cause radiological diagnostic difficulties and necessitate differential diagnosis with telangiectatic osteosarcoma due to its high mitotic and cellular activity . In our case， the lesion was expansile but does not show the typical fluid-fluid level lesion on the MR image， therefore simple bone cyst and telangiectatic osteosarcoma are considered in the differential diagnosis and biopsy was performed.\n\n【14】The main treatment of ABC is curettage and grafting . Nearly all ofthe cases were seen improvementafter curettage and grafting . Gibbs et al.  suggest a \"burr drill\" method in addition to curettage and grafting. Embolization during surgery in some cases； it may be necessary to add phenol， liquid nitrogen and bone cement as local adjuvants . Radiotherapy is also effective in giant size lesions. However， recurrence is reported in 10% to 15% of cases with ABC. George et al.  reported when Ethibloc is injected into the cyst， the recurrence rate reduced to 6.5%. It has been reported there is no recurrence in the cases of treated with argon beam coagulation in addition to curettage and grafting . Our case was treated with curettage and grafting. The patient’s follow-up and recurrence has not been observed.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】As a result， when an expansile lesion in the clavicle was detected in childhood， the MR appearance was similar to simple cyst but the aneurysmal bone cyst should be considered in the differential diagnosis and it should be thought contradictory results may occur between imaging methods and diagnosis should be made absolutely by biopsy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:43:21", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:43:53", "cost": 32.061}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:47", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:43:53", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:43:21"}

This case report is being presented to highlight the relatively benign presentation of this disease， as well as an approach for treatment. This patient was a 50 year old Asian male with no past medical history with a progressively enlarging raised scalp lesion. In office excision was performed， with following pathology revealing hidradenocarcinoma. The patient subsequently underwent wide local excision with sentinel lymph node biopsy. The margins were widely negative and the sentinel node was also negative. Follow up CT has demonstrated no distant metastases.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Hidradenocarcinoma is a rare malignant cutaneous adnexal tumor associated with a high propensity for local recurrence and subclinical metastasis， thus necessitating timely identification and treatment. Very little has been published in regards to the proper management of this cancer. Here， we present a case of this highly aggressive tumor with a rather benign presentation， as well as an approach to treatment.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 50 year old male of Asian descent with an unremarkable past medical history presented to our outpatient community clinic with complaint of a raised scalp lesion of 8 months duration. The patient reported that the lesion progressively enlarged for the first 4 months but then stabilized in size thereafter. The lesion was asymptomatic with no associated bleeding， ulceration， discharge， or pruritis. He did not recall trauma or an inciting event. Initial examination revealed a round 1.5 cm diameter， well circumcised， immobile， soft mass on the right temporo-parietal scalp. The lesion was minimally tender to deep palpation. There were no overlying skin changes or discharge. No regional lymphadenopathy was noted. A presumptive diagnosis of sebaceous or pilar cyst was established and general surgery was consulted. After obtaining informed consent， the mass was excised in the outpatient setting under local anesthesia. It was noted that the mass was quite adherent to the surrounding tissues which necessitated removal in a piecemeal fashion.\n\n【6】Histopathologicexamination demonstrated a poorly-differentiated carcinoma exten ding beyond the resected margins. The tumor was characterized by nests of epithelial cells with variable cytoplasm ranging from clear to eosinophilic with squamous differentiation. Associated with the tumor was a dense hyalinized stroma， as well as round spaces suggestive of duct lumens. Immunohistochemistry showed positive staining for cytokeratin 5/6， cytokeratin 7， p63， carcinoembryonic antigen， and epithelial membrane antigen.\n\n【7】These findings were consistent with malignant cutaneous adnexal carcinoma， most likely hidradenocarcinoma. The case was reviewed at a multidisciplinary tumor board. The diagnosis and treatment options were discussed with the patient， and informed consent was obtained for planned re-excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy.\n\n【8】Lymphoscintigraphy was used intraoperatively to identify sentinel lymph nodes along the right neck. The area was further explored using a handheld Geiger counter and 3 small blue sentinel lymph nodes along the posterior border of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle were resected and sent for pathology. Wide local excision around the previous incision was performed with 2 cm margins down to the bregma of the scalp. Total diameter of the excision measured 5.5 cm. A full thickness skin graft with an area of16 cm’ was harvested from tissue just inferior to the right clavicle and secured to the scalp. The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no complications. Histopathologic exam of the tissue margins demonstrated no evidence of tumor and sentinel lymph nodes that were negative for metastasis. Post-operative full body computed tomography revealed no evidence of visceral organ involvement.\n\n【9】The patient has been followed postoperatively on a monthly basis to evaluate graft healing and to assess for signs of tumor recurrence. At 6 months postoperatively， the graft is continuing to heal without complication and there is no suspicion for tumor recurrence.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Hidradenocarcinoma is a rare malignant cutaneous adnexal tumor associated with a high propensity for local recurrence and subclinical metastasis， thus necessitating timely identification and treatment. Hidradenocarcinoma poses a diagnostic challenge given the lack of distinguishing characteristics and indolent nature of presentation . Previous reports suggest that trauma and/or instrumentation of the lesion may precipitate localized growth . Therefore if the lesion is initially biopsied or excised for diagnostic purposes， definitive treatment should be pursued expeditiously to reduce the possibility of recurrence or metastasis. In the present case， the 1.5 cm diameter tumor was initially mistaken for a sebaceous cyst and subsequently excised as such. Fortunately， there was no evidence of recurrence or growth of the lesion when the patient presented for repeat excision 1 month later.\n\n【12】There is no consensus on hidradenocarcinoma management； however surgery in the form of wide local excision is the most widely reported. More recently Mohs micrographic surgery-with or without wide local excision-has also been utilized， particularly with cases involving the scalp . If wide local excision is performed， at least3 cm margins should be obtained . In our case， tumor location and patient anatomy dictated the use of 2 cm margins. The tendency for these tumors to metastasize via regional lymphatics has led to investigation into the utility of sentinel lymph node biopsy in the management of hidradenocarcinoma . On physical exam， our patient did not exhibit regional lymphadenopathy. Despite this， w elected to perform sentinel lymph node mapping and biopsy to assess for subclinical lymphatic metastasis. Despite aggressive treatment， local recurrence has been reported to occur in up to 50% of cases and metastasis rates may be as high as 60%. The 5-year survival rate has been reported at 30% . Our patient is recurrence-free at 6 months， but will need continued close surveillance given the high recurrence and mortality rate of this aggressive cancer.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 15:00:22", "endTime": "2024/09/20 15:06:11", "cost": 348.591}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:47", "update_time": "2024-09-19 23:06:11", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 23:00:22"}

It usually manifests in nonspecific symptoms but may also cause cardiac arrhythmias including bundle branch blocks， sinus bradycardia，ventricular arrhythmias and asystole.\n\n【7】Calcium counterbalances the effect of potassium on myocytes such that intravenous calcium antagonizes hyperkalemia induced cardiac membrane excitability and protects the heart against arrhythmias.\n\n【8】In this report we present a patient in cardiac arrhythmia due to hyperkalemia that was stabilized with the use of intravenous calcium. We present the initial and successive ECGs after calcium administration. Furthermore， we briefly review hyperkalemia related ECG changes， the role of calcium in hyperkalemia management and the literature supporting its use.\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\n【10】A 76-year-old male with a history of end stage renal disease presented to the hospital with chest pressure， shortness of breath， upper back pain and lower extremity edema for the past four days. His last dialysis session was four days prior to this visit. The patient was triaged to a critical care room due to Electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities  obtained on arrival.\n\n【11】His initial vital signs were： Blood pressure 154/73 mmHg， pulse of 66，temperature of 98.5°F， respirations 19 and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. Physical exam was notable for an alert and oriented Hispanic male in irregularly irregular heart rhythm with a 2/6 systolic murmur. He had labored breathing but breath sounds were clear to auscultation bilaterally. The cardiac monitor showed a wide complex bradycardia with short runs of ventricular complexes.\n\n【12】Due to the ECG changes in the setting of hyperkalemia (serum potassium of 7.6 mEq/L)， he was given two grams of calcium gluconate via slow Intravenous (IV) push. He then had a repeat ECG within five minutes which showed normal sinus rhythm.\n\n【13】He reported that he was feeling \"alittle better\". He was also started on ten milligrams of nebulized albuterol， five units ofIV insulin and 25 grams of dextrose (D50) to treat hyperkalemia. After 20 min， he again was noted to have runs of wide complex tachycardia prompting administering another two grams of calcium gluconate. A third ECG  two minutes after the second dose of calcium showed a narrow complex sinus rhythm.\n\n【14】The patient was observed on cardiac monitor for several hours. He received hemodialysis in the emergency department and tolerated it well. His presenting complaints resolved after dialysis and he was discharged home with return precautions.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】This case report describes a potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmia caused by hyperkalemia and its correction by intravenous calcium. This report is unique because sequential electrocardiograms of hyperkalemia related arrhythmia are difficult to capture in the emergent setting， especially of those with life threatening potential. Moreover， this report shows that repeated calcium administration may be necessary to correct ECG abnormalities.\n\n【17】The potassium concentration gradient across the myocardial cell membrane establishes the membrane potential . Hyperkalemia lowers the transmembrane gradient thereby shortening the duration of the action potential and repolarization time . This is responsible for some of the early ECG changes， such as ST-T segment depression， peaked T waves， and Q-T interval shortening . As potassium levels continue to rise， PR and QRS prolongation occurs. Other ECG manifestations include a diminished P-wave， QRS widening， and ultimately a wide-complex“sine-wave\"that may progress to asystole.\n\n【18】Calcium antagonizes hyperkalemia induced cardiac membrane excitability and protects the heart against arrhythmias. Although its use for treating fatal arrhythmias is often recommended， data in human subjects are lacking. The toxic effects of potassium on myocytes， and its reversal by calcium， were first demonstrated in animal models . Later， Intravenous (IV) calcium was shown to be effective in treating patients with acute kidney injury during the Korean War . Although the bulk of evidence supporting the use of calcium comes from case reports and anecdotal experience ， there is little doubt that calcium is an important and life-saving agent in the emergency treatment of hyperkalemia.\n\n【19】Some adverse effects of intravenous calcium are peripheral vasodilation， hypotension， bradycardia， and arrhythmias. A more serious adverse effect of IV calcium is tissue necrosis if extravasation occurs . This can be avoided if calcium gluconate is used， which is considered less toxic on peripheral veins. Historically， caution has been advised with administration of IV calcium in patients with known or suspected digoxin toxicity because of case reports of death in this context . On the contrary， there are reports showing no adverse effects of IV calcium administration in the presence of digoxin toxicity . Furthermore， a more recent retrospective study of 23 patients receiving IV calcium in the setting of digoxin toxicity has shown no increased risk ofarrhythmia or mortality .\n\n【20】Lastly， it should be noted that albuterol and insulin were given along with the second dose of calcium. While these treatments may have played a role in correcting serum potassium， we attribute the reversal of ECG abnormalities to calcium administration due to the instantaneous effect noted on the bedside cardiac monitor and the fact that potassium lowering agents can take up to 30 min to take effect On the other hand， it would not be ethical to withhold medications in unstable patients and so this would have been uinavoidable.\n\n【21】This case report describes a potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmia caused by hyperkalemia and its correction by intravenous calcium. Moreover， this report shows that repeated calcium administration may be necessary to correct ECG abnormalities.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 15:13:33", "endTime": "2024/09/20 15:13:45", "cost": 12.339}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:47", "update_time": "2024-09-19 23:13:45", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 23:13:32"}

The most common causes include upper airway cough syndrome， cough allergic asthma， eosinophilic bronchitis， allergic cough， and gastroesophageal reflux cough， which accounts for 70% to 95% of the cause of chronic cough in Department of Respiratory . Cough induced by bronchial foreign body is uncommon. We report an unusual case of chronic cough due to fish bone incarceration in the left lung， suggesting the importance of medical history and bronchoscopy in the diagnosis of chronic cough\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\n【10】A 45-years-old male presented to Department of Respiratory with chief complaint of cough for six month. He initially presented to a clinic， where he was diagnosed as bronchitis， for which treatment was begun. Ten days before presenting to our hospital， the patient began to have cough with shortness ofbreath， and the wheezing could be heard. There was a medical history ofa transient cough with blood stasis after eating fish porridge six month ago. Physical examination revealed that nasal sound could be heard in the neck and left lung， and patients were advised to undergo fiberoptic bronchoscopy. However， the patient did not accept the advision. The symptoms ofcough relived reduced at first return visit after seven days， but no improvement in shortness of breath. Nasal sound could still be founded in the neck and left lung， but the patient agreed to undergo fiberoptic bronchoscopy. During the process of bronchoscopy examination， a foreign body which wrapped around by granulation tissue was found in the upper left lobe of the patient. Under the ECG monitoring， the foreign body was taken out smoothly， which was a fish bone with a length of about 1 cm x0.3 cm . The symptoms of cough and shortness of breath disappeared after treatments for two weeks.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Cough is the most common symptom of patients presenting to respiratory specialist clinics and community outpatient departments. Patients with chronic cough account for more than one-third in respiratory specialist clinics in China . However， the cause is complicated especially for those whose radiograph was not abnormal obviously. Because the diagnosis is not clear， a number of patients often take ineffective various tests， or long-term antibiotics and antitussives， with side-effect profile unacceptable.Cough is a defensive nerve reflex， which is good for clearing respiratory secretions and harmful factors， however， frequent and severe cough will affect the work， life， social activities and cause high economic burden . Chronic cough could result in manycomplications in cardiovascular， digestive， neurological， urinary， musculoskeletal and other systems， such as urinary incontinence， syncope， insomnia， and anxiety . Chronic cough is associated with air pollution closely . The most common causes include upper airway cough syndrome， cough allergic asthma， eosinophilic bronchitis， allergic cough， and gastroesophageal reflux cough commonly ， which accounts for 70% to 95%. Imaging examination， induced sputum cytology，pulmonary function test， airway hyperresponsiveness test， FeNO test，24-hour esophageal pH-multiple-channel impedance monitoring were auxiliary test for chronic cough， which is important for the definitive diagnosis of chronic cough . If symptoms， signs， and examinations could not establish definitive diagnosis， unusual diseases should be considered and pay attention to the role of medical history and bronchoscopy. In this case， the patient had a transient cough with blood stasis after eating fish porridge six months ago and then he was diagnosed as bronchitis for a long time， for which the ineffective treatment was begun. The medical history suggests that there may be bronchial foreign body， and the fish bone wrapped around by granulation tissue in the upper left lobe was found.\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】In the diagnosis of chronic cough， we should pay attention to the importance of medical history and bronchoscopy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:31:19", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:31:41", "cost": 22.691}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:46", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:31:42", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:31:19"}

In such cases， however， they have typically been associated with a biopsy， or following surgery or trauma. This paper describes a patient with an apparent sural nerve entrapment related to running in the absence of the above-described situations. This case also describes the use of arch taping to aid diagnosis and guide subsequent treatment using foot orthoses.\n\n【2】Keywords： Nerve entrapment； Foot orthotics\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Entrapment neuropathies involving the foot are relatively rare ， but can involve one of five different nerves； Tibial， Deep Peroneal (Fibular)， Superficial Peroneal (Fibular)， Sural， and Saphenous. Depending on the location and severity of the entrapment， these conditions may be managed with non-surgical interventions . Those involving the tibial nerve in the tarsaltunnel are the most common and have sometimes been referred to as “Joggers Foot\"because of the repetitive compressive force exerted on the flexor retinaculum during running . Muchless common are entrapment neuropathies involving the lateral aspect of the leg and foot， which may be caused by either the Peroneal (Fibular)or Sural nerves .\n\n【5】The current case report describes a 24 year-old runner with recurring lateral foot numbness and paresthesia and the successful non-surgical management of the condition with foot orthoses. The case report further describes the use of adhesive strapping of the foot to aid in diagnosis and guide foot orthotic fabrication.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】Relevant history\n\n【8】The patient described in this case report was a 24 year-old female recreational runner (~20miles/ week) with the chief complaint of bilateral paresthesia over the lateral forefoot (Right茅Left) after running distances greater than three miles. The patient reported that she initially noticed the onset of numbness while she was running on the high school cross-country team as a sophomore. She reported that the numbness was initially restricted to the dorsal-lateral foot， but increased with further running to include the mid-lateral calf and leg. The patient indicated that her symptoms were restricted to sensory loss only and denied any motor involvement. The patient reported that these symptoms would typically subside within 10 minutes after she stopped running， regardless of the distance that she ran.\n\n【9】Other than three lateral ankle sprains to her right ankle， which were all managed conservatively， the patient had no history of trauma to her feet. She reported that while in high school， her arches had been taped by the local athletic trainer using the “cross-x\"technique， similar to that described by McPoil and McGarvey. Unfortunately， this taping did not alter her symptoms. The patient did utilize foot orthotics she had purchased at a local retail store， which helped， but did not alleviate her symptoms enough to allow her to run long distances without the numbness returning.\n\n【10】Physical examination\n\n【11】Examination by the physical therapist consisted of first， screening the patient's lumbar spine as a possible source of her symptoms. The patient's lower extremity joints had normal range of motion bilaterally and her muscles all tested strong and painless. With the exception of her feet exhibiting a pronated foot posture in standing (FPI： L=+6； R=+7) ， there were no other lower extremity mal-alignments noted， including genu varum， genu valgum， excessive femoral anteversion， or increased tibial torsion during standing and walking. The shoes that the patients used for running were new， showed no signs of excessive wear， had adequate cushioning， fit well and did not restrict her forefoot width. Because the patient's complaint of paresthesia was transient in nature and resolved fairly quickly after her cessation of running， it was felt that electrodiagnostic testing would not be of significant value in making a definitive diagnosis.\n\n【12】Because the patient indicated that the “over-the-counter” foot orthoses， which she was currently using， had provided some relief， the effect of her foot posture during running as a source of her symptoms was investigated further. To do this， the patient’s arches were first taped using the “low-Dye\"technique previously described in the literature using two-inch cloth athletic tape applied directly to the skin . The modified reverse-six taping technique was then applied to further alter the posture of the foot by raising the medial longitudinal arch and therefore control the amount of foot pronation during running . The effect of applying each of these two taping techniques resulted in raising the patient’s dorsal arch height by3.9mm measured using procedures described by McPoil et al. The patient was then asked to run at least three miles to determine if the altered foot posture resulting from the application of the tape altered her symptoms. The patient returned the next day and indicated that while the tape was applied she had been able to run without numbness or paresthesia. The above procedure was then repeated in order to insure that altering her foot posture with tapehad altered her symptoms.Because the patient's symptoms resolved when her medial longitudinal arch was raised and overall foot pronation was limited by the application of the tape， it was deduced that the cause of her symptoms were related to her foot posture and excess pronation. It was further deduced that if foot orthoses could provide a similar change in foot posture and motion control， they would be a more permanent solution to her problem.\n\n【13】Intervention\n\n【14】Due to the immediate resolution of the patient's symptoms by taping her arches， foot orthoses were fabricated to duplicate the tape's effect of raising the patient's medial longitudinal arch. The foot orthoses utilized to accomplish this consisted of a polyurethane base shell with a foam top cover. Material (Plastazote I) was added to the medial longitudinal arch in order replicate the 3.9 mm change in the height of the dorsal arch that was produced by the tape. See Figure 3. No “break-in”period was used once they were deemed comfortable during the initial fitting. Since being fitted with the above constructed foot orthoses， the patient has reported that she no longer has had any episodes of paresthesia or numbness in her feet during running while using the foot orthoses.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Because no electrodiagnostic testing was performed on the patient， the actual nerve involved cannot be determined with complete certainty and is therefore a limitation to the current case. Because the patient's symptoms resolved relatively quickly after running， it was felt that such testing was not warranted. However， based on the reported distribution of the patient's symptoms， the dorsal lateral branch of the sural nerve is a logical conclusion as the nerve most likely affected by her running. Although sural nerve compression has been reported in the literature， its cause is generally that of a mass lesion， scar tissue， ganglia or trauma and not from exercise alone . In such situations， however， the pain and paresthesia are generally much more proximal than that seen in the current patient . Because of the nerve’s distribution， however， it could result in paresthesia or numbness over the lateral ankle and foot . Sural nerve impingement has also been attributed to ill-fitting footwear . The current patient case is somewhat unusual since the distribution of symptoms was primarily along the lateral foot， her footwear was not restrictive and there was no history of trauma or surgery. Certainly， if clinicians are presented with a similar case， electrodignositc testing should be considered to aide in their diagnosis of the problem.\n\n【17】Tapping the foot in order to raise the medial longitudinal arch and limit calcaneal eversion served to help determine if excess pronation of the foot during running was the cause of the patient’s symptoms. Because altering the patient’s foot posture and motion during running through the use of tape alleviated her symptoms， it is reasonable to assume that excessive foot pronation resulted in the impingement of the dorsal sural nerve as it courses behind the lateral malleolus and along the lateral aspect of the foot.\n\n【18】The use of foot and arch taping has been advocated and described in the literature as an effective method of determining whether foot posture or foot motion play a role in various lower extremity injuries . Further， Meier and colleagues effectively used the same taping procedures described in this case study to fabricate foot orthoses in order to manage a variety oflower extremity injuries . Although the tapping procedures used in this case eliminated the patient's symptoms， it was not considered a practical solution since she would have to be tapped each time that she wished to run. As such， a more permanent solution was sought to accomplish the same thing that the tape did， namely raise the medial longitudinal arch and limit excess calcaneal eversion during running. As such， foot orthoses were constructed in order to accomplish the same thing that the tape did， which was raise the medial longitudinal arch and limit excess calcaneal eversion. To accomplish this， the amount that the medial longitudinal arch was raised with the application of the tape was used to ensure that the foot orthoses that was fabricated accomplished the same thing. It reasonable to assume that other types of foot orthoses could have a similar effect providing that resulted in the same change that was seen with the application of the tape.\n\n【19】As illustrated in this case study， determining if a person’s foot posture or movement is related to their chief complaint can be challenging. In such situations， foot taping can be utilized successfully as a cost effective method to determine if foot motion control is warranted. If so， a method of controlling such motion without the use of tape can be considered. In the present case， this was accomplished with the use of foot orthoses that altered the patient's foot posture the same amount that taping did， thus alleviating of their symptoms.\n\n【20】Conclusion\n\n【21】This case study describes the management of a patient with lateral foot numbness during running using taping as a way to confirm that altering foot posture and motion was the cause of her symptoms. Further， it illustrates how the change in foot posture from taping can be used in guiding the fabrication a foot orthosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:27:43", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:28:08", "cost": 24.767}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:46", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:28:09", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:27:43"}

Ninety percent of the ectopic thyroid is located at the base of the tongue， whereas lateral thyroid gland is very rare . Here， we report a patient with nasopharyngeal carcinoma， who had a mass in the right supraclavicular region. The mass had no FDG uptake using 'F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (\"F-FDG PET/CT) imaging， which was finally found to be ectopic thyroid tissue through needle aspiration biopsy.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 69-year-old man who first came to our attention for the neck mass. Both Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) showed a mass in the nasopharynx(blue arrow) ， and two masses in the right neck， of which one was in the upper neck(red arrow) ， the other was in the supraclavicular region (yellow arrow) . Enhanced CT showed the masses had significant heterogeneous enhanced . Enhanced T1-weighted MRI also showed hyper intensity with significant heterogeneous enhancement . Neck Ultrasound showed a heterogeneous mass about 33 mm in size (orange arrow)  with peripheral sparse blood flow signals (white arrow)  in the supraclavicular region. The mass in the nasopharynx was confirmed as non-keratinized undifferentiated carcinoma at histological analysis (R). This patient was clearly diagnosed as Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC).\n\n【7】It is important to mention that the mass in the supraclavicular region have the characteristics of metastatic Lymph Nodes (LNs) based on anatomical imaging (CT and MRI)， while it was not confirmed as metastase by ultrasonography. In order to further determine whether thislymph node is metastatic， so as to confirm the tumor clinical staging， we performed IF-FDG PET/CT imaging for this NPC patient. Higher \"F-FDG accumulation was shown in the nasopharyngeal lesion (blue arrow)  and the right upper neck mass (red arrow) . While， the mass in the right supraclavicular region had no uptake of F-FDG (yellow arrow) . The coronal maximum intensity image of these masses was shown in Figure 2G. Finally， CT-guided mass biopsy was performed to determine the nature of the mass in the supraclavicular region and pathological diagnosis confirmed the mass was differentiated thyroid tissue . The thyroid gland itself could be visualized at its normal anatomical site in this patient. And the patient was asymptomatic with normal thyroid hormone levels. supraclavicular region. Figure G showed the coronal maximum intensity image. Pathalogical diagnosis confirmed as differentiated thyraid tissue (K).\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】IBF-FDG PET/CT plays a great role in diagnosing metastatic LNs， especially for LNs with the maximum diameter less than 10 mm， which do not reach the radiologic diagnostic criteria for metastasis in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC) . One study reported the diagnostic sensitivity， specificity， accuracy， positive and negative predictive values of IF-FDG PET/CT for cervical metastatic LNs of NPC were 94.1%， 85.0%，89.2%，84.2% and 94.4%， respectively . In the present study， we used F-FDGPET/CT to show no FDG accumulation in the supraclavicular mass， which eventually proved to be an ectopic thyroid but not metastasis， thereby avoiding excessive irradiation of thelower neck LNs region. In the study of Park SH et al. they also used F-FDG PET/CT to show a relatively low F-FDG avidity lesion in the mediastinum， which pathologically diagnosed as ectopic thyroid.\n\n【10】The ectopic thyroidisabnormalityT causedby aberrant thyroid gland embryogenesis. The mechanisms responsible for the development of ectopic thyroid tissue are based on thyroid embryology， which include metastases， abnormal migration， and hetero topic differentiation of endodermal cells . The patient had bilateral partial thyroidectomy for bilateral thyroid adenoma 11 years ago. The reason of thyroid ectopic may be that thyroid tissues were divided by the shearing force of muscle movement during surgery， and then gradually migrated to other places， and finally form the ectopic thyroid.\n\n【11】Conclusion\n\n【12】We report the rare case of ectopic thyroid incidentally detected for a patient with NPC.

Formerly known as Autoimmune Progesterone Dermatitis (APD)， the condition has been increasingly referred to as PH due to a body of evidence suggesting its pathogenesis is most likelyan IgE-mediated reaction and not due to the production ofautoantibodies. We present a case of this rare disorder that was found in an African-American female of child-bearing age and without exogenous Progestogen use.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 41-year-old African-American female patient presented to the Allergy Clinic complaining of swelling of her lips， tongue and face for the past few years. Other symptoms included difficulty swallowing， and changes in her voice. The patient denied shortness of breath，rash， visual changes， sneezing， rhinorrhea， cough， or wheezing. At the time of initial office visit the patient had no known allergies. She reported that these symptoms have been recurring every month a few days after her menstruation period， coinciding with the ovulation window. Skin testing was performed revealing positive results against progesterone. Having never been on any medication containing progesterone， it was concluded that her allergy was to endogenous progesterone. The patient was initiated on prednisone 20 mg orally every month for symptomatic control and was also given two epinephrine auto-injectors in case of emergency. Allergy shot immunotherapy was initiated to immunize to progesterone， however the patient did not respond appropriately. After a long course over 9 years to conservatively treat her rare allergy， she was ultimately referred to Gynecology for planned oophorectomy.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】PH may present clinically with a heterogeneous range of dermatological and systemic symptoms including， but not limited to， urticaria， angioedema，pruritic clustered vesicular rashes， anaphylaxis， wheezing， and chest tightness in response to exposure to progestogens . While the underlying derangements in physiology required to develop PH have not been elucidated， a prominent theory proposes that exposure to exogenous progestogens (oral contraceptive pills， In-Vitro Fertilization(IVF) treatments) causes the development of progestogen-specific IgE antibodies that cross-link to mast cells which subsequently degranulate in a type I hypersensitivity reaction . However； this theory does not account for the reported cases in which the patient had no know previous exposure to exogenous estrogens .\n\n【6】Diagnosis of PH involves a careful history that temporally associates symptoms with exogenous progestogen administration or the progesterone surge of luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. This can then be followed by skin prick， progesterone challenge， or serological testing to confirm the diagnosis .\n\n【7】Multiple therapeutic approaches to PH have been reported with variable success. Importantly， therapeutic choices should be guided by the goals ofthe patient， specificallywith respect topregnancy desires and side effect tolerability. Generally， treatment is aimed at relief of hypersensitivity symptoms， ovulation suppression， or desensitization to the offending progestogen. Regarding symptomatic relief， oral H1 antihistamines and oral corticosteroids have demonstrated incomplete efficacy ， while corticosteroids have well-documented and compliance-limiting side effects . In a recent case， omalizumab， a monoclonal antibody directed at the IgE surface receptor on mast cells and basophils， was used successfully to treat PH . In future practice， use of biologics like omalizumab may be limited by high costs ； however， they offer a promising potential treatment option for PH.\n\n【8】Ifa trial of symptomatic relieftherapy fails， ovulation suppressants have been used as a next line of treatment. These medications have their own potential drawbacks. Unsurprisingly， combination Oral Contraceptive Pills (OCP’s) are poorly tolerated due to the chance of a hypersensitivity reaction to low-dose progesterone within the OCP . GnRH agonists and selective estrogen receptor modulators have been used to control symptoms with incomplete success and undesirable side-effect profiles that result from estrogen withdrawal. For patients with severe symptoms who do not respond to the above therapies or desire pregnancy， cases of desensitization to progestogens with intramuscular， oral，and intravaginal progesterone have been reported to be successful .\n\n【9】Ultimately， in patients with severe and refractory symptoms to the aforementioned therapeutics， oophorectomy is a viable option for patients who are past child-bearing years or do not desire pregnancy that was first described by Shelley et al. in 1964 . However， oophorectomy is a procedure with well-documented risks including decreases in cognition and sexual function along with increases in cardiac risk and osteoporosis  and should be used as a last resort.\n\n【10】Conclusion\n\n【11】PH is a very rare disorder that has little to no known incidence and prevalence in the U.S population. There are fewer than 200 reported cases worldwide. We present a rare case of PH that was refractory to standard therapies such as H1-antagonist， corticosteroids， and even Allergy shot immunotherapy.

The pathogenesis of this infiltration is debated， but our data are in favor of a hematogenic invasion by tumoral cells. Neuropathy secondary to tumoral nerve invasion may worsen in spite of good hematological response to treatment.\n\n【5】Keywords： EMG； Hematologic； Peripheral neuropathy； Nerve tumor； Biopsy\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia (WM) is a distinct B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by IgM monodonal gammopathy and bone marrow infiltration by lymphoplasmacytic cells . WM associated neuropathy can be observed in around 40% of cases . Although anti-MAG neuropathy is the most frequently described form， axonal neuropathy is common and has various etiologies. We report the case of a patient with severe sensory motor neuropathy that worsened despite treatment of WM， and that illustrates the diagnostic challenge of this situation.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 71-year-old female was admitted to our department in December 2018. Over the past two years， she had presented painful sensory disorders in her feet-progressively extending to the whole leg-and subsequent distal motor weakness. Concomitant 10 kg weight loss prompted systemic investigations in May 2018 that revealed an IgM monoclonal gammopathy with excess lambda free light chains at 200 mg/L. Lymphoplasmacytic cell infiltration into the bone marrow and pleura confirmed the diagnosis of WM with pleural localization and MYD88 mutation. Treatment with rituximab， dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide was initiated then switched to rituximab and bendamustine in October 2018 because of neurological worsening. Despite the decrease in lambda free light chains to 72 mg/L and regression of the pleural mass， sensory disorders extended to both hands and motor weakness reached the proximal part of the lower limbs. Electrophysiological studies revealed a severe progressive asymmetrical sensory motor axonal neuropathy. Complete laboratory tests were performed： Anti-MAG， anti-gangliosides and anti-neuronal antibodies were negative. The patient was positive for type 1 cryoglobulinemia with no evidence of complement consumption. Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) analysis was normal and included immunophenotyping and search for clonality. Salivary gland biopsy showed few amyloid deposits that were too small to be typed. Biopsy of abdominal subcutaneous fatty tissue was normal. Nerve Biopsy (NB) was subsequently performed. Nerve fragments were embedded in paraffin for staining， cut in transverse semi-thin and ultra-thin sections for optical and electron microscopy， and frozen for molecular biology. Congo red staining was negative. NB revealed severe axonal loss and nerve degeneration as well as perivascular， perineural and endoneural infiltrates of small mononuclear cells， identified as B and T cells by anti-CD20 and anti-CD3staining， respectively. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based clonality testing showed monoclonal B cell amplification.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】This observation demonstrates the relevance of NB in WM-related axonal neuropathy. Once electrophysiological studies and blood tests had ruled out a demyelinating process such as anti-MAG neuropathy， further investigations focused on mechanisms of axonal neuropathy such as amyloidosis， endoneural deposits of immunoglobulin， vasculitis or tumoral infiltration. Although salivary gland biopsy was suggestive of amyloidosis， NB showed no deposits stained by Congo red coloration or detectable in electron microscopy. There were no deposits of immunoglobulin in electron microscopy. The absence of cytomorphological abnormalities of cell infiltrates associated with positivity for type 1 cryoglobulinemia could be evocative of vasculitis but the preservation of the vessel wall ruled out this hypothesis. Ultimately， clonality assessment by PCR was the key test to distinguish tumor lymphoproliferation from nonspecific reactive cell infiltrates. Tumoral nerve infiltration in WM is rarely described  and probably under estimated because explorations such as MRI， PET scans and CSF analysis can be negative . In a retrospective study of 40 patients with WM-related neuropathy， 2 out of 25 patients with an axonal neuropathy had tumoral nerve infiltration . In a more recent article， of 15 patients with neurolymphomatosis diagnosed with PCR analysis on NB， only one had WM . Several mechanisms are suspected ： Contiguous nerve invasion， meningeal invasion， or hematogenous metastasis， but the exact pathogenesis remains unclear. Our images support the theory of a hematogenic invasion by tumoral cells， illustrating not only their accumulation in perivascular spaces as described in previous studies， but also their diffusion from the vessel to the endoneurium through the blood-nerve barrier and their aggressivity towards the nerve structure. Furthermore， this case highlights the existence of a dissociation between neurological and hematological responses to treatment in WM， in the same manner as there is no correlation between the severity of the hemopathy and the occurrence of a neuropathy . Indeed， the neuropathy worsened despite the rise in IgM lambda， and the use of chemotherapy capable of crossing the blood-nerve barrier. This dissociation raises questions about the management of WM， and in particular how and when to evaluate treatment response or to conclude in treatment failure.\n\n【12】Severee progressiveaaxonal neuropathyyin WMdespite hematological response to treatment may be evocative of tumoral nerve invasion.

The present communication describes a rare case of a choroid plexus papilloma leading to CSF ascites following Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 5 year old boy presented to us with complaints of progressively increasing abdominal distension from past 6 months and respiratory distress for 2 days. There was no history of jaundice or bleeding manifestations. Patient was aknown case ofhydrocephalus for which medium pressure VP shunt (chabra shunt) was placed at the age of 3 years. On examination child was having massive ascitis with positive fluid thrill sign. There was no hepato-spenomegaly and other signs of hepatocellular failure. Neurologically the child was conscious and oriented and there were no signs of shunt dysfunction. Shunt bulb was palpable and soon gets refilled after compressing the bulb. Paracentesis showed clear transudate fluid with no evidence of infection (WBC= 5 cells/mm’， all lymphocytes， sugar= 72 mg/dl and protein = 24 mg/dl). Ascitic fluid culture was sterile and was negative for Acid fast bacilli. In addition， cytology was negative for malignant cell. Liver and renal function test were essentially normal (serum bilirubin =0.6 mg/dl，SGOT=36 U/I， SGPT=11U/I， serum albumin =3.8 gm/dl， urea = 27 mg/dl， creatine =0.8 mg/dl). Echocardiography revealed a normal functioning heart. The patient tested negative for HIV. Abdominal Ultrasound and CT scan showed no abnormality in relation to abdominal viscera or peritoneum. CECT head showed gross communicating hydrocephalus with choroid plexus papilloma  in bilateral lateral ventricle which was later confirmed by histopathological examination of postoperative specimen.\n\n【4】Despite diuretic treatment and peritoneal tapping the ascites re-accumulated. Based on impression of CSF ascites the lower end of the shunt tip was exteriorized and was maintained as ventricular drain so as to relieve intracranial and intra-abdominal pressures， which continued to drain 1200-1500 ml of CSF daily and ascites resolved within 2 weeks postoperative. Surgical resection of choroid plexus papilloma was done on both sides of lateral ventricles and shunt was removed. The postoperative period was uneventful. Sections from both right and left tumour tissue show multiple fragments composed of delicate fibrovascular fronds lined by single layer of monomorphic cuboidal cells with basal round nucleus. No necrosis， mitosis or pleomorphism seen. S-100 immunostain shows positivity in tumour cells. Above histological features are suggestive of choroid plexus papilloma .\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Ascites has been defined as accumulation of excess fluid within the peritoneal cavity . The commonest cause of ascites is cirrhosis oftheliver， closely followed by other serious hepatic diseases. In children， hepatic， renal and cardiac diseases are the most common causes. CSF ascites is a rare complication of Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts. VP shunts are usually placed for obstructive or progressive hydrocephalus. Occlusion of the shunt tube and infection are frequently observed as V-P shunt complications. Overproduction of the CSF will be the likely possibility once the shunt infection had been ruled out. Early detection of shunt ascitis (noninfective) which is an uncommon occurrence and its aetiology will be helpful for better management.\n\n【7】Different intervals (2 months- 13 years) between shunt placement and symptomatic ascites have been reported . Our case develops ascitis after two and half years of shunt placement. Several etiologic factors had been discussed in literature， but it is the imbalance between peritoneal absorption capacity and amount of CSF Production is the major cause. By this definition， patients with excessive amount of CSF production like choroid plexus papilloma are at risk to developing CSF ascites following VP shunt . On the other hand， patients with high CSF protein due to chronic infection (tuberculous meningitis) or brain tumors -especially optic glioma  may have difficulties in CSF absorption through peritoneum. Under such circumstances， inflammation has been associated with an increase in leukocytes，impairment of lymphatic flow， and a subsequent increase in intraperitoneal protein concentration due to impaired protein absorption causing ascitis.\n\n【8】Peritoneal inflammation due to repeated shunt revisions  or non-specific inflammatory response to shunt material ，play role in the other side and decrease absorptive ability of peritoneum. Also in brain tumors， especially in astrocytoma and glioblastoma， increased vascular permeability can cause microvascular extravasation of plasma into the peritoneal cavity and cause ascites . A large series of twenty-eight patients with cerebrospinal ascites have been reported . Their ages ranged from 10 days to 53 years， but most patients were children， especially infants. Common etiological factors responsible were congenital hydrocephalus， obstructive hydrocephalus， choroid plexus papilloma， craniopharyngioma and posterior fossa tumour. In our patient choroid plexus papilloma was found to be the cause of CSF ascites. This is thought to be due to imbalance between excess production and its absorption.\n\n【9】Treatment for cerebrospinal ascites is revision of the V-P shunt to ventricular-atrial shunt but in choroid plexus papilloma revision will only relieve ascitis with associated risk of congestive heart failure and bacteraemia.

So， it is need a deeply investigation in order to verify association or not with Spike protein derivates used. Of interest to observe the prevalence/incidence of cardiac sudden deaths after COVID-19 disease before the vaccination seasons.\n\n【3】This review is performed whit a neutral approach and without pre-concept. All data comes from biomedical database and published as article.\n\n【4】Italy， Tel： +39-3402479620；\n\n【5】Keywords： Cardiac sudden deaths； Myocarditis； Pericarditis； SARS-CoV-2 spike protein derivates； Physiology epidemiology； Pathology； Toxicology\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Great public debate is involved in the level of extra cardiac sudden deaths as reported in the media in last periods. The same of interest to verify the moves of this phenomena and considering the fact that a severe pandemic (COVID-19-SARS-CoV-2) produced high number of deaths (in acute way) but also as long COVID-19 sequela.\n\n【8】To be considered on the global mortality rate also the effect played by the protocols adopted； Preventive measure (lockdown and other) or therapeutic option (drug used or not used)： Interesting literature report the objective analysis in neutral scientific way and the entity of the effect.\n\n【9】The history of this time under evaluation reported various research published or changing the protocols to be used： See the hydroxychloroquine case.\n\n【10】Various effects were due to “Pandemic inside the pandemic\". The pathologic effect for the heart and other organ of the virus is due by the SPIKE protein toxicity and by the great immune response of the body to fight this microorganism. The toxicity ofthe spike protein is clearly showed by scientific literature without any doubt. the body this product like mRNA vaccine) to stimulate immune response generate the need to verify its profiles of safety also related cardiac sudden deaths and not only for other risks (central nervous system thrombosis et other).\n\n【11】For this reason， it is useful to observe epidemiology of sudden deaths in yearbeforepandemic and to compare with pandemic season， and verifying also the effect played by long COVID syndrome and if possible， to divide the effect played by the vaccination campaign.\n\n【12】All this factor can be considered as cofactor? And there is a summatory of pathological effect? The rare ADR registered in some m RNA vaccine like myocarditis-pericarditis in young's and the fact that some authorities restricted use of some product to determinate class age are facts that need to better study these phenomena.\n\n【13】Electronic Devices (WCR) and COVID-19 Vaccine ADR：Myocarditis and Pericarditis -Epidemiology and Physiology of an interesting phenomena.\n\n【14】“After observing this evidence published in scientific article and observing that the median (age) ofRARE myocarditis after COVID-19vaccine seen differ from the classic myocarditis (more frequent in young in vaccinated) and related the profile of the COVID-19disease (Higher risk of myocarditis >50 year) and the role played by comorbidities it is of interest to match the geographic distribution of myocarditis after COVID-19 vaccine with the use of WCR device. This because these 2 factors (Spike protein natural or artificial) and WCR radiation are recognized able to Influence heart as reported in literature”.\n\n【15】From European Society of Cardiology COVID-19 patients retain elevated risk of death for at least 18 months after infection.\n\n【16】“Compared to uninfected individuals， the risk of death in COVID-19 patients was up to 81-fold higher in the acute phase and5-fold higher in the post-acute phase. Patients with severe COVID-19were more likely to develop major CV disease or die than non-severe cases”.\n\n【17】“The results showed that the adjusted incident rate ratios of CV outcomes in the post-COVID-19 exposure period were significantly higher than those in the pre-exposure period (ratios of incident rate ratios for all CV outcomes were significantly higher than 1) and exhibited a graded increase by severity of the acute phase of the disease. Cardiac arrest (HR=2.45(2.89)”.\n\n【18】“Myocarditis is a condition caused by acute or chronic inflammation of the cardiac myocytes， resulting in associated myocardial edema and myocardial injury-necrosis. The exact incidence is unknown， but is likely underestimated， with more mild cases going unreported. Diagnosis and appropriate management are paramount in pediatric myocarditis， as it remains a recognized cause of sudden cardiac death SCD in children and athletes. Myocarditis in children is most often caused by a viral or infectious etiology. There are now 2 highly recognized etiologies related to COVID-19 infection and theCOVID-19 mRNA vaccine.\n\n【19】November 274， 2022\n\n【20】“In general， a causal link between myocarditis and anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is supported by several considerations： A close temporal relation to vaccination； all cases were found dead within 1week after vaccination， absence of any other significant pre-existing heart disease， especially ischemic heart disease or cardiomyopathy， negative testing for potential myocarditis-causing infectious agents， presence of a peculiar CD4 predominant T-cell infiltrate， suggesting an immune mediated mechanism. The latter criterion is supported by demonstration of a phenotypically identical T-cell infiltrate at the deltoid injection site in 1 ofthe cases\".\n\n【21】According COVID-19： Pandemic disruption linked to 30，000excess heart disease deaths， charity reports.\n\n【22】“Between March 2020 and Aug 2022 there were more than 30，000excess deaths involving coronary heart disease， an average of 230 a week above the expected death rate. Many people have not been able to access care for conditions like as high blood pressure， that could raise the risk of a future heart attack or stroke， the foundation's report said\".\n\n【23】Excess deaths in 2022 among worst in 50 years “More than650，000 deaths were registered in the UK in 2022， 9% more than 2019” .\n\n【24】“SARS-CoV-2 vaccination reduces morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 disease； unfortunately， it is associated with serious adverse events AE， including Sudden Unexplained Death (SUD). 13 were recruited， aged between 23 and 72 years； 10(77%) were men， 12 were Thai； and 1 was Australian. Eight (61%) died after receiving the first dose of vaccine， and 7 (54%) died after receiving ChAdOx1 nCoV-19； There were no significant correlations between SUD and either the number or the type of vaccine. Fever was self-reported in 3 cases. Ten (77%)and 11 (85%) died within 24 h and3 days of vaccination， respectively. Whole exome sequencing analysis revealed that 5 cases harbored SCN5A variants that had previously been identified in patients with Brugada syndrome BS， giving an SCN5A variant frequency of 38% (5 of 13). This is a significantly higher rate than that observed in Thai SUD cases occurring 8 to 30days after COVID-19 vaccination during the same period (10%(1 of10))， in a Thai SUD cohort studied before the COVID-19 pandemic(12%(3 of 25))， and in our in-house exome database (12%(386 of3231))”.\n\n【25】From MAYO CLINIC：\n\n【26】“Brugada (brew-GAH-dah) syndrome is a rare but potentially life-threatening heart rhythm condition (arrhythmia) thatis sometimes inherited.\n\n【27】People with Brugada syndrome have an increased risk of irregular heart rhythms beginning in the lower chambers of the heart(ventricles)”.\n\n【28】April 284， 2022\n\n【29】Increased emergency cardiovascular events among under- 40population in Israel during vaccine rollout and third COVID-19wave.\n\n【30】“CV adverse outcomes such as blood clotting (coronary artery thrombosis)， acute coronary syndrome， cardiac arrest and myocarditis have been identified as consequences of COVID-19infection. Data from regulatory surveillance and self-reporting systems， including the Vaccine Adverse events Reporting System in the US， the Yellow Card System in the UK and the EudraVigilance system in Europe， associate similar CV side-effects with a number of COVID-19 vaccines currently in use”.\n\n【31】From Euroscientist.com：\n\n【32】Science in society》UK recorded more than 10，000 extra non-covid deaths since July： How do we know vaccines are not to blame? which more deaths than expected have been registered.

Paul Hunter， professor in medicine at the Univ. of East Anglia， notes that： In general， the excess deaths seem to be primarily CV， and that many of them are happening at home.\n\n【35】Myocarditis and Pericarditis After Vaccination for COVID-19.\n\n【36】“40 hospitals in Washington， Oregon， Montana， and LA County， California that were part of the Providence health care system and used the same electronic medical record were included. All patients with documented COVID-19 vaccinations administered inside the system or recorded in state registries at any time through May 25，2021， were identified. Vaccinated patients who subsequently had Emergency Department ED or inpatient encounters with diagnoses of myocarditis， myopericarditis， or pericarditis were ascertained from EMRs”.\n\n【37】Extra deaths in 2022 close to highest level in 70 years- how much are NHS failings to blame?\n\n【38】“More deaths at home， many of the recent excess deaths are occurring at home， as opposed to in hospitals or care homes.\n\n【39】In the 2 weeks to 304 December， 1，804 more people died at home vaccination distribution periad (Oct 18， 2020， ta Jun 20， 2021) COVID-19 disease 2019. than usual， almost 40% higher than the 5-year average. In total over the past 6 months 84，337 people have died at home， 21，803(34.9%) more than the 5-year average from. That’s a much bigger difference than the change in other settings”.\n\n【40】Materials and Methods\n\n【41】With an observational point of view some relevant literature and Figures 1-23 are reported. An experimental hypothesis is submitted to the researcher in order to provide a global conclusion related the topic of investigation. All literature comes from PubMed or other relevant biomedical database.\n\n【42】Results\n\n【43】From literature\n\n【44】According Cadegiani FA：“Myocarditis and sudden death SD after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. Myocarditis induced by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines is an indisputable complication observed particularly in young males as demonstrated by multiple studies in different populations. Two studies reported that COVID-19 mRNA vaccine-induced myocarditis disproportionately affected adolescents(Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR)： 22.3； 95% Confidence Interval (CI)：19.9)，18 to 29-year-olds (ROR： 6.6；95%CI： 5.5)，and males(ROR： 9.4； 95% CI：8.6).\n\n【45】These findings were supported by other great registry study that identified increased myocarditis risk MR following SARS-CoV-2mRNA vaccination， with the highest risk detected in people aged18 to 24 years， particularly after 2nd dose， where 8.1-fold increased risk after the BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2mRNA vaccine (95% CI： 6.9) and 30-fold increased risk after the mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2vaccine (95% CI： 21-43)were reported. An Israeli government data set demonstrated 13.6-fold increased myocarditis risk (95% CI： 9.2) among males aged between 16 to 19 years compared to the expected following historical data， while a nine-fold increased myocarditis risk(95% CI： 4.8) was recorded when compared to unvaccinated of similar age and sex during the same period. In a 23 million-resident area， the myocarditis risk MR after SARS-CoV-2mRNA vaccination was increased across all populations， particularly high among males aged 16 to 24 years after the 2nd dose of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273， where 5.3-fold (95% CI： 3.7) and 13.8-fold (95% CI： 8.7) increased myocarditis risk MR was recorded. Independent autopsies or biopsies of patients who presented post-SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine myocarditis in different geographical regions enabled the conclusion that a primary hyper catecholaminergic state was the key trigger of these events； SARS-CoV-2 mRNA was densely present，and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was progressively produced in adrenal medulla chromaffin cells， which are responsible for catecholamine production； the dihydroxyphenylalanine decarboxylase enzyme that converts dopamine into noradrenaline was overexpressed in the presence of SARS-CoV-2mRNA，leading to enhanced noradrenaline activity； catecholamine responses were physiologically higher in young adults and males than in other populations； catecholamine responses and the resting catecholamine production were higher in male athletes than in non-athletes； catecholamine responses to stress and its sensitivity were enhanced in the presence of androgens； and catecholamine expressions in young male athletes were already high at baseline， were higher following vaccination， and were higher than those in non-vaccinated athletes. The epidemiological， autopsy， molecular， and physiological findings unanimously and strongly suggest that a hyper catecholaminergic state is the critical trigger of the rare cases of mvocarditis due to components from SARS-CoV-2， potentially increasing sudden deaths SD among elite male athletes.“.\n\n【46】“The demographic and clinical characteristics of myocarditis after mRNA vaccination in previous reports are summarized in Table reported. Vaccine-associated myocarditis has been reported predominantly in young males after second vaccination. Myocarditis was mainly diagnosed clinically based on elevated serum troponin and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging， and all patients except ours and the patient reported by Verma et al. Recovered after receiving supportive care.\n\n【47】“The incidence of sudden cardiac death ranged from 0.93 to 1.3per 100，000 person-years， whereas an incidence of 1.62 per 100，000person-years was reported in this research study .\n\n【48】“The study examined 4 large (>2 million inhabitants) European population-based prospective registries collecting emergency medical services-attended (i.e.， with attempted resuscitation)OHCA and SCD(OHCA without obvious extracardiac causes) for>5 consecutive years from January 2012 to December 2017 in the Paris region (France)，the North Holland region， the Stockholm region (Sweden)， and in all of Denmark. The average annual incidence of SCD in the 4 registries ranged from 36.8 per 100，000 (95% CI： 23.1 per 100，000) to 39.7per 100，000 (95% CI： 32.8 per 100，000)”. second dose at a rate of3.5-140 per million doses. 27”.\n\n【49】“Cardiovascular CV effects of COVID-19 vaccination\n\n【50】Myocarditis and pericarditis are known complications of mRNA vaccines，especially in young adult and teen males aged 12 to 17 years，23 with the highest observed incidence within 2 to 7 days after the “Additional analyses of CDC Vaccine Safety Datalink with data from 9 participating integrated health care organizations revealed an increased risk of myocarditis/pericarditis events among individuals12 to 39 years of age in the 7-day risk interval after the vaccination with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines compared with unvaccinated individuals or individuals vaccinated with non-mRNA COVID-19 vaccines on the same calendar days (rate ratio of 10.8 % CI， adjusted for site， age， sex， race/ethnicity， and calendar date).\n\n【51】The estimated myocarditis/pericarditis chart-confirmed rate was12.6 cases per million doses with second-dose mRNA vaccine among individuals 12 to 39 years of age. The rates based on International Classification of Diseases； 10h Revision-coded cases were also higher in males than in the females. All chart-confirmed cases with follow-up had resolution of symptoms； and among those who had follow-up ECG/echocardiography and lab. Testing， most had returned to normal or baseline. On this basis， the FDA will add a warning to the product label of both mRNA vaccines regarding the risk of myocarditis”.\n\n【52】“In general， treatment of either acute or chronic myocarditis is aimed at reducing congestion and improving cardiac hemodynamics in heart failure HF， as well as providing supportive therapy， with the hope of prolonging survival. Treatment of heart failure follows the same treatment regimen regardless of the underlying cause (ACE inhibitors，beta-adrenergic blockers)”.\n\n【53】“We present autopsy findings of a 22-year-old man who developed chest pain 5 days after the first dose of the BNT162b2mRNA vaccine and died 7 h later. Histological examination of the heart revealed isolated atrial myocarditis， with neutrophil and histiocytepredominance.Immunohistochemical1C4d staining revealed scattered single-cell necrosis of myocytes which was not accompanied by inflammatory infiltrates. Extensive contraction band necrosis was observed in the atria and ventricles. There was no evidence of microthrombosis or infection in the heart and other organs. Theprimary cause of death was determined to be myocarditis， causally-associated with the BNT162b2 vaccine\".\n\n【54】“This study focuses on CV manifestation，particularly myocarditis and pericarditis events， after BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine injection in Thai adolescents. This prospective cohort study enrolled students aged 13 to 18 years from 2 schools， who received the second dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Data including demographics， symptoms， vital signs， ECG， echocardiography， and cardiac enzymes were collected at baseline， Day 3， 7， and Day 14(optional) using case record forms. We enrolled 314 participants； of these， 13 participants were lost to follow-up， leaving 301 participants for analysis. The most common CV signs and symptoms were tachycardia (7.64%)， shortness of breath (6.64%)， palpitation (4.32%)， chest pain (4.32%)， and hypertension (3.99%). One participant could have more than 1 sign and/or symptom. Seven participants(2.33%) exhibited at least 1 elevated cardiac biomarker or positive lab assessments.\n\n【55】CV manifestations were found in 29.24% ofpatients， ranging from tachycardia or palpitation to myopericarditis. Myopericarditis was confirmed in 1 patient after vaccination. Two patients had suspected pericarditis and 4 patients had suspected subclinical myocarditis CV manifestation in adolescents after BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19vaccination included tachycardia， palpitation， and myopericarditis. The clinical presentation of myopericarditis after vaccination was usually mild and temporary， with all cases fully recovering within 14days. Adolescents receiving mRNA vaccines should be monitored for CV side effects. Clinical Trial Registration： NCT05288231”.\n\n【56】“Cases of myocarditis， diagnosed clinically by laboratory tests and imaging have been described in the context of mRNA-based anti-SARS-CoV-2vaccination. Autopsy-based description of detailed histological features of vaccine-induced myocarditis is lacking. We describe the autopsy findings and common characteristics of myocarditis in untreated persons who received anti-SARS-CoV-2vaccination. Standardized autopsies were performed on 25 persons who had died unexpectedly and within 20 days after anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. In 4 patients who received a mRNA vaccination， we identified acute (epi-) myocarditis without detection of another significant disease or health constellation that may have caused an unexpected death. Histology showed patchy interstitial myocardial T-lymphocytic infiltration， predominantly of the CD4 positive subset， associated with mild myocyte damage. Autopsy findings indicated death due to acute arrhythmogenic cardiac failure CF. Myocarditis can be a potentially lethal complication following mRNA-based anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Our findings may aid in adequately diagnosing unclear cases after vaccination and in establishing a timely diagnosis in vivo， providing the framework for adequate monitoring and early treatment of severe clinical cases”.\n\n【57】“CV events occur more frequently in the early morning， with morning rates higher for both AMI and sudden cardiac death”.\n\n【58】“A recent analysis of data from Florida (US) found increased risk of cardiac death in the first 4 weeks after mRNA vaccination in people aged 18 to 39 years 20 compared to subsequent weeks” .\n\n【59】Exploring the relationship between all-cause and cardiac-related mortality following COVID-19. 2022.\n\n【60】“Cardiac-related deaths CRD following vaccination. In the 28days following vaccination， a statistically significant increase in cardiac-related deaths was detected for the entire study population(RI=1.07， 95% CI= 1.12). Stratifying by age group revealed RIs were significantly higher for age groups 25 to 39 (RI=2.16，95%CI= 1.47) and 60 or older (RI=1.05， 95% CI=1.10). The remaining age groups failed to reach statistical significance”.\n\n【61】“Myocarditis or pericarditis incidence after mRNA COVID-19vaccination in the current study (.9 per 100，000 for males and.9 for females across age groups and vaccine cohorts) was similar to estimates found in a study from eight USA health systems in the Vaccine Safety Datalink . Previous CDC estimates found the highest risk for post-vaccination myocarditis among males aged 16 to17 years (10.6 per 100，000) during a 7-day risk window after receipt of a secondmRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose. Estimates from the current study (22.0 per 100，000 males aged 12 to 17 years) are higher， likely because outcomes were captured using ICD-10-CM codes alone rather than through passive reporting with subsequent verification through medical record review. Among males aged 12 to 17 years， the group with the highest incidence of cardiac complications after receipt of a second mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose， the risk was1.8 to 5.6 times as high after SARS-CoV-2 infection than after the vaccination”.\n\n【62】“Circadian rhythm and sudden cardiac arrest\n\n【63】In 1987，Muller and his colleagues published a retrospective study of the death certificates of 2203 patients in Massachusetts who died outside of the hospital in 1983. They found a circadian variation in sudden cardiac death SCD with 2 peaks during 24 h the primary peak occurred from 7 am to 11 am and a secondary peak occurred between 5 pm to 6pm. These results corresponded with the findings of the MILIS Study Group in 1985 that described the onset of acute myocardial infarction as following a circadian rhythm with a peak from 6 am to noon” .\n\n【64】“This study work compared myocarditis mortality rate in the SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated with that in the general population in Japan.

SMR of myocarditis was 1.69 (1.18 to 2.42) for overall vaccinated population，1.35 (0.84 to 2.55) for those 60 years or older. Estimated adMMRRs and adSMR were about 4 times higher than the MMRRs and SMR. Pooled MOR for myocarditis was 148.49 (89.18 to 247.25).\n\n【66】SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was associated with higher risk of myocarditis death MD， not only in young adults but also in all age groups including the elderly. Considering healthy vaccinee effect， the risk may be 4 times or higher than the apparent risk of myocarditis death. Underreporting should also be considered.

The earthquake that struck the Los Angeles area at 4：31 am on January 17h， 1994， was1 of the strongest earthquakes ever recorded in a major city in North America.\n\n【72】“In a huge analysis of more than 30，000 vaccinated patients who had experienced COVID breakthrough infections (pre-Omicron variant)， scientists found that 6 months later， even the vaccinated incurred a higher risk of death and debilitating long COVID symptoms involving multiple organs (lungs， heart， kidney， brain， others) when compared to controls without evidence of SARS-CoV-2infection”.\n\n【73】“The post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection- also referred to as Long COVID-have been described， but whether Breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 Infection (BTI) in vaccinated people results in post-acute sequelae is not clear. In this study， we used the US Department of Veterans Affairs national healthcare databases to build a cohort of 33，940 individuals with BTI and several controls of people without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection， including contemporary(n=4，983，491)，historical(n=5，785，273)and vaccinated (n=2，566，369) controls. At 6 months after infection， we show that， beyond the first30 days of illness， compared to contemporary controls， people with BTI exhibited a higher risk of death (Hazard Ratio (HR)=1.75，95% Confidence Interval (CI)： 1.93) and incident post-acute sequelae (HR=1.50， 95% CI： 1.54)， including cardiovascular CV， coagulation and hematologic， GI， kidney， mental health， metabolic， musculoskeletal and neurologic disorders. The results were consistent in comparisons versus the historical and vaccinated controls. Compared to people with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were not previously vaccinated (n=113，474)， people with BTI exhibited a lower risk of death (HR=0.66，95% CI： 0.74) and incident post-acute sequelae (HR=0.85， 95% CI： 0.89). The findings suggest that vaccination before infection confers only partial protection in the post-acute phase of the disease”.\n\n【74】“Approximately 80% of all SCDs occur in the home and around60% are witnessed” .\n\n【75】Circadian aspects of mortality in hospitalized patients： A retrospective observation from a large cohort\n\n【76】“Circadian Variation in SCD\n\n【77】Circadian patterns have been the subject of considerable interest in CV， including both SCD as well as myocardial infarction MI.

The vaccine was associated with an excess risk of myocarditis (1 to 5 events per 100，000 persons). The risk of this potentially serious adverse event and of many other serious adverse events was substantially increased after SARS-CoV-2infection”.\n\n【82】“There were 19，740，741 doses of mRNA vaccines administered and 297 reports of myocarditis/pericarditis meeting our inclusion criteria. 69.7% occurred following the second dose of COVID-19mRNA vaccine and 76.8% occurred in males. The median age of individuals with a reported event was 24 years. The highest reporting rate of myocarditis/pericarditis was observed in males aged 18 to 24years following mRNA-1273 as the second dose； the rate in this age group was 5.1 (95% CI 1.5) times higher than the rate following BNT162b2 as the second dose. Overall reporting rates were higher when the inter-dose interval was shorter (≤ 30 days) for both vaccine products. Among individuals who received mRNA-1273 for the second dose， rates were higher for those who had a heterologous as opposed to homologous vaccine schedule”.\n\n【83】COVID-19 vaccine\n\n【84】Strongassociation with cardiovascular death，Eespecially hemorrhagic stroke and venous thrombosis.\n\n【85】“We analyzed 196 death cases reported after inoculation of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (COMIRNATY) by June 9 in Japan. Japanese Ministry of Health JMH， Labor， and Welfare virtually denied the causality of all cases without conducting appropriate epidemiological analysis.\n\n【86】Mortality odds ratio wascalculatedas the indicator of disproportionality in cause of death. We compared odds of cause of death after inoculation and death in Japanese vital statistics in 2019 as control non-vaccinated population. MOR was obtained by using the numbers of death from non-CV system as the reference causes for 2age groups： Vaccinated medical workers (20 to 74 year of age) and elderly (= 65 years) separately.\n\n【87】Of 31 deaths among vaccinated medical workers (both sexes)， 26(84%) died from CV diseases， such as stroke， myocardial infarction， Venous Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism (VT/PE) and heart failure， while 22% died in the general population. MOR is 19.4(p<0.0001). MOR of hemorrhagic stroke (40.7) and VT/PE (114.0) were extremely high Of the reported vaccinated elderly death cases， 69% died from CV causes， while 26% died in the general population. MOR is 5.9(p<0.0001). MOR of hemorrhagic stroke (12.8) and VT/PE (24.9) were also very high These suggest that COVID-19 vaccination is closely associated with the risk of death from CV causes， especially hemorrhagic stroke and VT/PE”.\n\n【88】But an adverse event occurring after vaccination doesnt prove vaccination caused it .\n\n【89】“During Wave I (1 March 2020 to 6 June 2020)， we observed a sharp increase in excess CVD deaths.

During pandemic after COVID-19 disease and with vaccination 4. After pandemic whit only vaccination (no disease)\n\n【106】This data makes possible to verify the contribution ofevery single moves.\n\n【107】Discussion\n\n【108】The profile of CV complication of COVID-19 disease is clearly reported by literature. Related reference reported it is possible to verify this temporal presentation of effects： The same the infected patient (with severe disease) shows increased level of cardio vascular complication vs. the non-infected. (ESC 2023) This data was higher vs. pre-pandemic periods . In Figure 20 the monthly death 2020-21 was always superior then in 2018-19 years even if after starting the mass vaccinations. The same the monthly death in years from 2010 to2019 was lower than. Great part of sudden deaths are of cardiovascular origin. Extra deaths are reported from January. A part from COVID-19 disease deaths are registered extra deaths. Pericarditis increased from May 2021 (USA) Figure 10.

The same to observe the RARE ADR of some mRNA COVID-19 vaccine like pericarditis and myocarditis in young males. Of interest to observe the role played by ACE Inhibitors in myocarditis therapy. The incidence of CV Deaths or unexpected deaths before and after the COVID-19 vaccination campaign is an interesting phenomenon.\n\n【112】Trends from 2012 to 2017 are reported in references (not great increased)， Figure 7. Related the data published it is possible to consider that the similar population pre and post-pandemic studied have an equal level of basic cardiovascularpathology， so the additional mortality can not to be considered due only by this phenomena.\n\n【113】To be considered also that various references report that after vaccination some events are registered in healthy patients. (Are there relationship?) ， military often are healthy. Some producers of COVID-19 vaccine introduced in COVID vaccine-technical sheet information about risk of rare myocarditis in subpopulations. Relevant the study related the SUD in Brugada syndrome associated a COVID-19 vaccination (genetic factors involved) Figure 5. The vaccination after the COVID disease can be considered like and additional dose of Spike protein ( for the cumulative effect).\n\n【114】The incidence of myocarditis after some COVID-19 vaccination was higher in some subclasses (young then adults).\n\n【115】Event like pericarditis and myocarditis increase after the second dose rates were higher when the inter-dose interval was shorter (i.e.，≤30 days). Of interest to observe that mortality increase in statistical way every year due by the difference between new born and new elderly (so increase elderly and related deaths). The average data of increase is greater than of the. The difference between 2022and 2021 can be used a measure of the vaccine influence. In the 2022 it was observed a+12%vs. 2021. The fact that in 2020 was reported more deaths can be related to various factors (Pandemic，kind ofpreventive measures adopted and kind of therapy chosen). Literature published provided evidence ofthis， if mortality in 2020 was only due to SARS CoV-2 virus and no other co-factor (also by some kind of preventive measure， drugs used or not， protocol adopted in emergency) in the2021-2022 it had to be observed to a reduction： Instead， the cause of death for all causes was increased.\n\n【116】Conclusion\n\n【117】Even Considering that the prophylaxis measure like vaccination is useful in various virus disease observing scientific database some questions are of interest. For the meaning of this work， it is necessary read the data and figure related CSD or deaths considering pre-pandemic years， pandemic season and also the vaccine campaign timing (first doses and second or other doses). Why monthly mortality rate was higher in 2021 than in 2013 in USA? What is the cumulative effect played on Sudden cardiac extra deaths and unexpected by COVID disease or long COVID added to vaccination? And due only by vaccination? It is possible to choose 2013 data as baseline. This information is useful to better understand these global phenomena. Why great amount of unexpected extra death was observed at home? The figure reported in this work added to the time presentation of the effect can give information about these phenomena.\n\n【118】The fact that was registered extra deaths in last periods a part the classic parameter  can be due by the effect ofthe pandemic(or to long COVID) but it must to be more deeply investigated also the effect played by the spike protein derivates (wide used) to fight this virus.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【4】Italy， Tel： +39-3402479620；", "content": "【0】Abstract\n\n【1】Aim of this work is to observe some interesting phenomena involving pre- and post-pandemic cardiac sudden deaths epidemiology and after the mass vaccination campaign.\n\n【2】The current level of unexpected extra deaths as reported in scientific literature vs. pre-pandemic years.

The same of interest to verify the moves of this phenomena and considering the fact that a severe pandemic (COVID-19-SARS-CoV-2) produced high number of deaths (in acute way) but also as long COVID-19 sequela.\n\n【8】To be considered on the global mortality rate also the effect played by the protocols adopted； Preventive measure (lockdown and other) or therapeutic option (drug used or not used)： Interesting literature report the objective analysis in neutral scientific way and the entity of the effect.\n\n【9】The history of this time under evaluation reported various research published or changing the protocols to be used： See the hydroxychloroquine case.\n\n【10】Various effects were due to “Pandemic inside the pandemic\". The pathologic effect for the heart and other organ of the virus is due by the SPIKE protein toxicity and by the great immune response of the body to fight this microorganism. The toxicity ofthe spike protein is clearly showed by scientific literature without any doubt. the body this product like mRNA vaccine) to stimulate immune response generate the need to verify its profiles of safety also related cardiac sudden deaths and not only for other risks (central nervous system thrombosis et other).\n\n【11】For this reason， it is useful to observe epidemiology of sudden deaths in yearbeforepandemic and to compare with pandemic season， and verifying also the effect played by long COVID syndrome and if possible， to divide the effect played by the vaccination campaign.\n\n【12】All this factor can be considered as cofactor? And there is a summatory of pathological effect? The rare ADR registered in some m RNA vaccine like myocarditis-pericarditis in young's and the fact that some authorities restricted use of some product to determinate class age are facts that need to better study these phenomena.\n\n【13】Electronic Devices (WCR) and COVID-19 Vaccine ADR：Myocarditis and Pericarditis -Epidemiology and Physiology of an interesting phenomena.\n\n【14】“After observing this evidence published in scientific article and observing that the median (age) ofRARE myocarditis after COVID-19vaccine seen differ from the classic myocarditis (more frequent in young in vaccinated) and related the profile of the COVID-19disease (Higher risk of myocarditis >50 year) and the role played by comorbidities it is of interest to match the geographic distribution of myocarditis after COVID-19 vaccine with the use of WCR device.

In total over the past 6 months 84，337 people have died at home， 21，803(34.9%) more than the 5-year average from. That’s a much bigger difference than the change in other settings”.\n\n【40】Materials and Methods\n\n【41】With an observational point of view some relevant literature and Figures 1-23 are reported. An experimental hypothesis is submitted to the researcher in order to provide a global conclusion related the topic of investigation. All literature comes from PubMed or other relevant biomedical database.\n\n【42】Results\n\n【43】From literature\n\n【44】According Cadegiani FA：“Myocarditis and sudden death SD after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. Myocarditis induced by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccines is an indisputable complication observed particularly in young males as demonstrated by multiple studies in different populations. Two studies reported that COVID-19 mRNA vaccine-induced myocarditis disproportionately affected adolescents(Reporting Odds Ratio (ROR)： 22.3； 95% Confidence Interval (CI)：19.9)，18 to 29-year-olds (ROR： 6.6；95%CI： 5.5)，and males(ROR： 9.4； 95% CI：8.6).\n\n【45】These findings were supported by other great registry study that identified increased myocarditis risk MR following SARS-CoV-2mRNA vaccination， with the highest risk detected in people aged18 to 24 years， particularly after 2nd dose， where 8.1-fold increased risk after the BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2mRNA vaccine (95% CI： 6.9) and 30-fold increased risk after the mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2vaccine (95% CI： 21-43)were reported. An Israeli government data set demonstrated 13.6-fold increased myocarditis risk (95% CI： 9.2) among males aged between 16 to 19 years compared to the expected following historical data， while a nine-fold increased myocarditis risk(95% CI： 4.8) was recorded when compared to unvaccinated of similar age and sex during the same period. In a 23 million-resident area， the myocarditis risk MR after SARS-CoV-2mRNA vaccination was increased across all populations， particularly high among males aged 16 to 24 years after the 2nd dose of BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273， where 5.3-fold (95% CI： 3.7) and 13.8-fold (95% CI： 8.7) increased myocarditis risk MR was recorded. Independent autopsies or biopsies of patients who presented post-SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine myocarditis in different geographical regions enabled the conclusion that a primary hyper catecholaminergic state was the key trigger of these events； SARS-CoV-2 mRNA was densely present，and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was progressively produced in adrenal medulla chromaffin cells， which are responsible for catecholamine production； the dihydroxyphenylalanine decarboxylase enzyme that converts dopamine into noradrenaline was overexpressed in the presence of SARS-CoV-2mRNA，leading to enhanced noradrenaline activity； catecholamine responses were physiologically higher in young adults and males than in other populations； catecholamine responses and the resting catecholamine production were higher in male athletes than in non-athletes； catecholamine responses to stress and its sensitivity were enhanced in the presence of androgens； and catecholamine expressions in young male athletes were already high at baseline， were higher following vaccination， and were higher than those in non-vaccinated athletes. The epidemiological， autopsy， molecular， and physiological findings unanimously and strongly suggest that a hyper catecholaminergic state is the critical trigger of the rare cases of mvocarditis due to components from SARS-CoV-2， potentially increasing sudden deaths SD among elite male athletes.“.\n\n【46】“The demographic and clinical characteristics of myocarditis after mRNA vaccination in previous reports are summarized in Table reported. Vaccine-associated myocarditis has been reported predominantly in young males after second vaccination. Myocarditis was mainly diagnosed clinically based on elevated serum troponin and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging， and all patients except ours and the patient reported by Verma et al. Recovered after receiving supportive care.\n\n【47】“The incidence of sudden cardiac death ranged from 0.93 to 1.3per 100，000 person-years， whereas an incidence of 1.62 per 100，000person-years was reported in this research study .\n\n【48】“The study examined 4 large (>2 million inhabitants) European population-based prospective registries collecting emergency medical services-attended (i.e.， with attempted resuscitation)OHCA and SCD(OHCA without obvious extracardiac causes) for>5 consecutive years from January 2012 to December 2017 in the Paris region (France)，the North Holland region， the Stockholm region (Sweden)， and in all of Denmark. The average annual incidence of SCD in the 4 registries ranged from 36.8 per 100，000 (95% CI： 23.1 per 100，000) to 39.7per 100，000 (95% CI： 32.8 per 100，000)”. second dose at a rate of3.5-140 per million doses. 27”.\n\n【49】“Cardiovascular CV effects of COVID-19 vaccination\n\n【50】Myocarditis and pericarditis are known complications of mRNA vaccines，especially in young adult and teen males aged 12 to 17 years，23 with the highest observed incidence within 2 to 7 days after the “Additional analyses of CDC Vaccine Safety Datalink with data from 9 participating integrated health care organizations revealed an increased risk of myocarditis/pericarditis events among individuals12 to 39 years of age in the 7-day risk interval after the vaccination with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines compared with unvaccinated individuals or individuals vaccinated with non-mRNA COVID-19 vaccines on the same calendar days (rate ratio of 10.8 % CI， adjusted for site， age， sex， race/ethnicity， and calendar date).\n\n【51】The estimated myocarditis/pericarditis chart-confirmed rate was12.6 cases per million doses with second-dose mRNA vaccine among individuals 12 to 39 years of age. The rates based on International Classification of Diseases； 10h Revision-coded cases were also higher in males than in the females. All chart-confirmed cases with follow-up had resolution of symptoms； and among those who had follow-up ECG/echocardiography and lab. Testing， most had returned to normal or baseline. On this basis， the FDA will add a warning to the product label of both mRNA vaccines regarding the risk of myocarditis”.\n\n【52】“In general， treatment of either acute or chronic myocarditis is aimed at reducing congestion and improving cardiac hemodynamics in heart failure HF， as well as providing supportive therapy， with the hope of prolonging survival. Treatment of heart failure follows the same treatment regimen regardless of the underlying cause (ACE inhibitors，beta-adrenergic blockers)”.\n\n【53】“We present autopsy findings of a 22-year-old man who developed chest pain 5 days after the first dose of the BNT162b2mRNA vaccine and died 7 h later. Histological examination of the heart revealed isolated atrial myocarditis， with neutrophil and histiocytepredominance.Immunohistochemical1C4d staining revealed scattered single-cell necrosis of myocytes which was not accompanied by inflammatory infiltrates. Extensive contraction band necrosis was observed in the atria and ventricles. There was no evidence of microthrombosis or infection in the heart and other organs. Theprimary cause of death was determined to be myocarditis， causally-associated with the BNT162b2 vaccine\".\n\n【54】“This study focuses on CV manifestation，particularly myocarditis and pericarditis events， after BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine injection in Thai adolescents. This prospective cohort study enrolled students aged 13 to 18 years from 2 schools， who received the second dose of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Data including demographics， symptoms， vital signs， ECG， echocardiography， and cardiac enzymes were collected at baseline， Day 3， 7， and Day 14(optional) using case record forms. We enrolled 314 participants； of these， 13 participants were lost to follow-up， leaving 301 participants for analysis. The most common CV signs and symptoms were tachycardia (7.64%)， shortness of breath (6.64%)， palpitation (4.32%)， chest pain (4.32%)， and hypertension (3.99%). One participant could have more than 1 sign and/or symptom. Seven participants(2.33%) exhibited at least 1 elevated cardiac biomarker or positive lab assessments.\n\n【55】CV manifestations were found in 29.24% ofpatients， ranging from tachycardia or palpitation to myopericarditis. Myopericarditis was confirmed in 1 patient after vaccination. Two patients had suspected pericarditis and 4 patients had suspected subclinical myocarditis CV manifestation in adolescents after BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19vaccination included tachycardia， palpitation， and myopericarditis. The clinical presentation of myopericarditis after vaccination was usually mild and temporary， with all cases fully recovering within 14days. Adolescents receiving mRNA vaccines should be monitored for CV side effects. Clinical Trial Registration： NCT05288231”.\n\n【56】“Cases of myocarditis， diagnosed clinically by laboratory tests and imaging have been described in the context of mRNA-based anti-SARS-CoV-2vaccination. Autopsy-based description of detailed histological features of vaccine-induced myocarditis is lacking. We describe the autopsy findings and common characteristics of myocarditis in untreated persons who received anti-SARS-CoV-2vaccination. Standardized autopsies were performed on 25 persons who had died unexpectedly and within 20 days after anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. In 4 patients who received a mRNA vaccination， we identified acute (epi-) myocarditis without detection of another significant disease or health constellation that may have caused an unexpected death. Histology showed patchy interstitial myocardial T-lymphocytic infiltration， predominantly of the CD4 positive subset， associated with mild myocyte damage. Autopsy findings indicated death due to acute arrhythmogenic cardiac failure CF. Myocarditis can be a potentially lethal complication following mRNA-based anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Our findings may aid in adequately diagnosing unclear cases after vaccination and in establishing a timely diagnosis in vivo， providing the framework for adequate monitoring and early treatment of severe clinical cases”.\n\n【57】“CV events occur more frequently in the early morning， with morning rates higher for both AMI and sudden cardiac death”.\n\n【58】“A recent analysis of data from Florida (US) found increased risk of cardiac death in the first 4 weeks after mRNA vaccination in people aged 18 to 39 years 20 compared to subsequent weeks” .\n\n【59】Exploring the relationship between all-cause and cardiac-related mortality following COVID-19. 2022.\n\n【60】“Cardiac-related deaths CRD following vaccination. In the 28days following vaccination， a statistically significant increase in cardiac-related deaths was detected for the entire study population(RI=1.07， 95% CI= 1.12). Stratifying by age group revealed RIs were significantly higher for age groups 25 to 39 (RI=2.16，95%CI= 1.47) and 60 or older (RI=1.05， 95% CI=1.10). The remaining age groups failed to reach statistical significance”.\n\n【61】“Myocarditis or pericarditis incidence after mRNA COVID-19vaccination in the current study (.9 per 100，000 for males and.9 for females across age groups and vaccine cohorts) was similar to estimates found in a study from eight USA health systems in the Vaccine Safety Datalink . Previous CDC estimates found the highest risk for post-vaccination myocarditis among males aged 16 to17 years (10.6 per 100，000) during a 7-day risk window after receipt of a secondmRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose. Estimates from the current study (22.0 per 100，000 males aged 12 to 17 years) are higher， likely because outcomes were captured using ICD-10-CM codes alone rather than through passive reporting with subsequent verification through medical record review. Among males aged 12 to 17 years， the group with the highest incidence of cardiac complications after receipt of a second mRNA COVID-19 vaccine dose， the risk was1.8 to 5.6 times as high after SARS-CoV-2 infection than after the vaccination”.\n\n【62】“Circadian rhythm and sudden cardiac arrest\n\n【63】In 1987，Muller and his colleagues published a retrospective study of the death certificates of 2203 patients in Massachusetts who died outside of the hospital in 1983. They found a circadian variation in sudden cardiac death SCD with 2 peaks during 24 h the primary peak occurred from 7 am to 11 am and a secondary peak occurred between 5 pm to 6pm. These results corresponded with the findings of the MILIS Study Group in 1985 that described the onset of acute myocardial infarction as following a circadian rhythm with a peak from 6 am to noon” .\n\n【64】“This study work compared myocarditis mortality rate in the SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated with that in the general population in Japan. The study was based on the materials and the vital statistics disclosed by the Japanese government.\n\n【65】Number of myocarditis death MD which met the inclusion criteria were 32 cases. MMRR (95% confidence interval) was 4.03(0.77 to 13.60) in 20s， 7.80 (2.85 to 18.56) in 30s， respectively. SMR of myocarditis was 1.69 (1.18 to 2.42) for overall vaccinated population，1.35 (0.84 to 2.55) for those 60 years or older. Estimated adMMRRs and adSMR were about 4 times higher than the MMRRs and SMR. Pooled MOR for myocarditis was 148.49 (89.18 to 247.25).\n\n【66】SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was associated with higher risk of myocarditis death MD， not only in young adults but also in all age groups including the elderly. Considering healthy vaccinee effect， the risk may be 4 times or higher than the apparent risk of myocarditis death. Underreporting should also be considered. Based on this study， risk of myocarditis following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination may be more serious than that reported previously\".\n\n【67】Public health Ontario surveillance report\n\n【68】Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFIs) for COVID-19in Ontario： Dec 13， 2020 to March\n\n【69】“There have been international reports， including from the US and Israel， of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Information to date indicates that these events occur more commonly after the second dose， within the week following vaccination (typically within 4-5 days)， mainly in adolescents/young adults and more often in males than females”.\n\n【70】“The mean age of the deceased was 62.6 years (age range： 32 to 91years). Vaxzevria was vaccinated in 9， Comirnaty in 5， Spikevax in 3， and Janssen in 1 person. The time interval between thelast vaccination and death ranged from a few minutes (case 17) up to 14 days (case9). Case 17 involved a person who collapsed in a vaccination center immediately after the vaccination； prompt resuscitation efforts were unsuccessful. A total of 12 deaths occurred at home， 4 deaths at a hospital， 1 death at a vaccination center， and 1 death at work”.\n\n【71】Over half the deaths related to atherosclerosis (13 of 24) on the day of the earthquake occurred between midnight and 6 am， whereas only 3 of 32 (9%) of the deaths during the 7 days before the earthquake occurred at that time of day (P=0.002). The earthquake that struck the Los Angeles area at 4：31 am on January 17h， 1994， was1 of the strongest earthquakes ever recorded in a major city in North America.\n\n【72】“In a huge analysis of more than 30，000 vaccinated patients who had experienced COVID breakthrough infections (pre-Omicron variant)， scientists found that 6 months later， even the vaccinated incurred a higher risk of death and debilitating long COVID symptoms involving multiple organs (lungs， heart， kidney， brain， others) when compared to controls without evidence of SARS-CoV-2infection”.\n\n【73】“The post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection- also referred to as Long COVID-have been described， but whether Breakthrough SARS-CoV-2 Infection (BTI) in vaccinated people results in post-acute sequelae is not clear. In this study， we used the US Department of Veterans Affairs national healthcare databases to build a cohort of 33，940 individuals with BTI and several controls of people without evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection， including contemporary(n=4，983，491)，historical(n=5，785，273)and vaccinated (n=2，566，369) controls. At 6 months after infection， we show that， beyond the first30 days of illness， compared to contemporary controls， people with BTI exhibited a higher risk of death (Hazard Ratio (HR)=1.75，95% Confidence Interval (CI)： 1.93) and incident post-acute sequelae (HR=1.50， 95% CI： 1.54)， including cardiovascular CV， coagulation and hematologic， GI， kidney， mental health， metabolic， musculoskeletal and neurologic disorders. The results were consistent in comparisons versus the historical and vaccinated controls. Compared to people with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were not previously vaccinated (n=113，474)， people with BTI exhibited a lower risk of death (HR=0.66，95% CI： 0.74) and incident post-acute sequelae (HR=0.85， 95% CI： 0.89).

The median age of individuals with a reported event was 24 years. The highest reporting rate of myocarditis/pericarditis was observed in males aged 18 to 24years following mRNA-1273 as the second dose； the rate in this age group was 5.1 (95% CI 1.5) times higher than the rate following BNT162b2 as the second dose. Overall reporting rates were higher when the inter-dose interval was shorter (≤ 30 days) for both vaccine products.

The prevalence was higher in men under 30 years of age， increasing from1/100 000 for the general population， to 1/20 000 for the 16 to 30years old group. Two of the 62 patients died. The US Department of Defense reported 14 military personnel diagnosed with myocarditis following COVID vaccination， 13 of them after their second dose of COVID-19mRNA vaccines”.\n\n【104】Experimental project hypothesis\n\n【105】1. Because the toxicity of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and its derivates is knower it is of interest to verify.

During pandemic after COVID-19 disease and with vaccination 4. After pandemic whit only vaccination (no disease)\n\n【106】This data makes possible to verify the contribution ofevery single moves.\n\n【107】Discussion\n\n【108】The profile of CV complication of COVID-19 disease is clearly reported by literature. Related reference reported it is possible to verify this temporal presentation of effects： The same the infected patient (with severe disease) shows increased level of cardio vascular complication vs. the non-infected. (ESC 2023) This data was higher vs. pre-pandemic periods . In Figure 20 the monthly death 2020-21 was always superior then in 2018-19 years even if after starting the mass vaccinations. The same the monthly death in years from 2010 to2019 was lower than. Great part of sudden deaths are of cardiovascular origin. Extra deaths are reported from January. A part from COVID-19 disease deaths are registered extra deaths. Pericarditis increased from May 2021 (USA) Figure 10. Cardiac arrest call reported peaks on 2021 March and July .\n\n【109】Of interest the circadian profile of CSD and the days of presentation after vaccination/when happened and registered).\n\n【110】Great part of deaths after COVID-19 vaccination happened in less than 3 days .\n\n【111】Of interest also to observe the pathological mechanism ofaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein thought the link with ACE2 receptor in pulmonary and other tissue. The same to observe the RARE ADR of some mRNA COVID-19 vaccine like pericarditis and myocarditis in young males. Of interest to observe the role played by ACE Inhibitors in myocarditis therapy. The incidence of CV Deaths or unexpected deaths before and after the COVID-19 vaccination campaign is an interesting phenomenon.\n\n【112】Trends from 2012 to 2017 are reported in references (not great increased)， Figure 7. Related the data published it is possible to consider that the similar population pre and post-pandemic studied have an equal level of basic cardiovascularpathology， so the additional mortality can not to be considered due only by this phenomena.\n\n【113】To be considered also that various references report that after vaccination some events are registered in healthy patients. (Are there relationship?) ， military often are healthy. Some producers of COVID-19 vaccine introduced in COVID vaccine-technical sheet information about risk of rare myocarditis in subpopulations. Relevant the study related the SUD in Brugada syndrome associated a COVID-19 vaccination (genetic factors involved) Figure 5. The vaccination after the COVID disease can be considered like and additional dose of Spike protein ( for the cumulative effect).\n\n【114】The incidence of myocarditis after some COVID-19 vaccination was higher in some subclasses (young then adults).\n\n【115】Event like pericarditis and myocarditis increase after the second dose rates were higher when the inter-dose interval was shorter (i.e.，≤30 days). Of interest to observe that mortality increase in statistical way every year due by the difference between new born and new elderly (so increase elderly and related deaths). The average data of increase is greater than of the. The difference between 2022and 2021 can be used a measure of the vaccine influence. In the 2022 it was observed a+12%vs. 2021. The fact that in 2020 was reported more deaths can be related to various factors (Pandemic，kind ofpreventive measures adopted and kind of therapy chosen). Literature published provided evidence ofthis， if mortality in 2020 was only due to SARS CoV-2 virus and no other co-factor (also by some kind of preventive measure， drugs used or not， protocol adopted in emergency) in the2021-2022 it had to be observed to a reduction： Instead， the cause of death for all causes was increased.\n\n【116】Conclusion\n\n【117】Even Considering that the prophylaxis measure like vaccination is useful in various virus disease observing scientific database some questions are of interest. For the meaning of this work， it is necessary read the data and figure related CSD or deaths considering pre-pandemic years， pandemic season and also the vaccine campaign timing (first doses and second or other doses). Why monthly mortality rate was higher in 2021 than in 2013 in USA? What is the cumulative effect played on Sudden cardiac extra deaths and unexpected by COVID disease or long COVID added to vaccination? And due only by vaccination? It is possible to choose 2013 data as baseline. This information is useful to better understand these global phenomena. Why great amount of unexpected extra death was observed at home? The figure reported in this work added to the time presentation of the effect can give information about these phenomena.\n\n【118】The fact that was registered extra deaths in last periods a part the classic parameter  can be due by the effect ofthe pandemic(or to long COVID) but it must to be more deeply investigated also the effect played by the spike protein derivates (wide used) to fight this virus.", "index": 677, "show": true, "start": 677, "end": 707, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:49:19", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:50:28", "cost": 69.144}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:46", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:50:28", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:49:18"}

Her Corrected Distance Visual Acuity (CDVA) was 20/80 in her right eye (OD) and 20/50 in her left eye (OS). Slit-lamp examination showed a C4 cortical opacification (LOCS II) of the lens OD (C3 in OS)， grade III nucleus in both eyes (Emery scale)， and normal anterior chamber with the depth of 2.5 mm in both eyes. The specular microscope found the patient had a low density of CEC， 867 cells/mm’OD， and 790 cells/mm’OS， but the Central Corneal Thickness (CCT) was normal： 501 um OD and 509 um OS. Moreover， the cells were regular in shape， tightly connected， and equal in size. Other ophthalmic examinations showed no other pathological changes in both eyes.\n\n【6】Cataract Extraction Combined with IOL Implantation in a Senile Cataract Patient with Low Corneal Endothelial Cell Density. A Clinical Report. Ann Clin Case Rep.\n\n【7】With the diagnosis of senile cataract， the patient was scheduled for modified double-incision ECCE combined with Intraocular Lens (IOL) implantation， which aimed to minimize damage to the corneal endothelium. The scleral incision was made at 12：00 position 3 mm posterior to the limbus and corneal incision at 9：00. After fully inflating the anterior chamber with the viscoelastic agent(DisCoVisc)， we created an 8mm circular anterior capsulectomy with a Continuous Curvilinear Capsulorhexis (CCC)， and then the viscoelastic agent was used instead of BSS for the nucleus dissection. The viscoelastic agent was injected into the posterior to the nucleus， facilitating the prolapse of the nucleus into the anterior chamber . With the help of continuous injection of the viscoelastic agent and simultaneously slight pressure on the post lip of the 10 mm incision， the lens nucleus slid out readily . The 10 mm incision was sutured for 3 stitches， and the residual cortex was aspirated clockwise after one-time insertion of the instrument into the capsule\n\n【8】Table 1： Summary of visual acuity (Diopters) and intraocular pressure over6-month review period.\n\n【9】Table 2： Summary of central comneal endothelial density， central corneal thickness， hexagonal cell rate， and coefficient of variation of corneal endothelial cells over a 6-month review period.\n\n| Day  |  | Preoperative  | Postoperative  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Day  |  | Preoperative  | 1d  | 30d  | 90d  | 180d  |\n| CDVA  | OD  | 20/80  | 20/30  | 20/25  | 20/25  | 20/20  |\n| CDVA  | OS  | 20/50  | 20/60  | 20/40  | 20/25  | 20/25  |\n| OP  | OD  | 14.3  | 39  | 11.2  | 10.2  | 14.5  |\n| OP  | OS  | 17  | 28  | 16.3  | 16.7  | 17.2  |\n\n【11】CDVA： Corrected Distance Visual Acuity； IOP： Intraocular Pressure (mmHg) through the 2 mm incision.

After residual viscoelastic was aspirated， the anterior chamber was irrigated with BSS.\n\n【12】Examinations at one day， one month， three months， and six months post-surgery showed clear pupils， a stable IOL， and no inflammatory or other complications. Grade I corneal edema was observed OS on the first-day post-surgery. The patient’s vision recovered well and remained stable .\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】CEC's regeneration ability is not sufficient to replace dead or injured cells， they often cover wounds with the spread or migration of neighboring cells ， resulting in increased cell size and shape on the polymorphic changes. The count of central CECs in normal adults is 2986±314 cells/mm， which decreases with age . Corneal decompensation and subsequent bullous keratitis may occur in the condition of alower count than 500 cells/mm².\n\n| Day  |  | Preoperative  | Postoperative  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Day  |  | Preoperative  | 30d  | 90d  | 180d  |\n| CCD  | OD  | 867  | 640  | 710  | 641  |\n| CCD  | OS  | 790  | 467  | 685  | 626  |\n| CCT  | OD  | 501  | 547  | 563  | 513  |\n| CCT  | OS  | 509  | 543  | 533  | 528  |\n| HEX  | OD  | 67  | 50  | 48  | 47  |\n| HEX  | OS  | 55  | 43  | 41  | 39  |\n| CV  | OD  | 21  | 25  | 19  | 14  |\n| CV  | OS  | 25  | 19  | 27  | 26  |\n\n【16】Mean cell loss rate 23.41%\n\n【17】CCD： Central Corneal Endothelial Cell Density (cells/mm)；CCT： Central Corneal Thickness (um)， HEX： Hexagonal cell rate (%) CV： Coefficient of Variation(%)\n\n【18】Since it was an individual case， the overall CEC count was unknown， only the preoperative and postoperative central CEC density was compared. Therefore， in our case， the mean loss rate of central CEC density in both eyes was 23.41%. In this case， we took the “4S”technique to protect the corneal endothelium：  Smooth slide-out： The length of the primary incision (the scleral incision) was slightly larger than the diameter of the nucleus. Besides， injecting the viscoelastic agents behind the nucleus while gently squeezing the post lip of the incision guaranteed that the lens slid out smoothly without the use of other auxiliary instruments.  Soft instrument：We make full use of these features as a soft instrument in surgery since viscoelastic is a non-Newtonian fluid  that exhibits physical properties in response to changes in shear strain rate. It is to separate free nuclear tissue， maintain the anterior chamber depth and improve the success rate of CCC  when injected into the capsule because of its elasticity， jet swelling effect， and thickening ability. It wraps around the nuclear tissue， allowing the nucleus and viscoelastic to flow easily out of the incision without injuring the endothelium， thanks to its viscosity and damping effect. We also used hydrophilic IOLs  and high-adhesion viscoelastic agents ， which are better for preserving anterior Chamber stability and preventing accidental injury.  Separate channel to implant IOL： To avoid injuring the corneal endothelium， the injector was still employed to implant the foldable IOLs， and the operation of adjusting the IOLs's position was limited. Single operation， one step in place： When removing the cortex and viscoelastic agents， double sets of suction needles were inserted at once instead of repeated entry and exit to protect the endothelium.\n\n【19】The CEC’s Hexagon Cell Ratio (HEX) and Coefficient of Variation (CV) should also be considered to determine the prognosis pre-surgery. Studies have shown  that there are differences in the morphology of CEC in age-related cataract patients of different ages. Therefore， morphological examination of CECs can determine the degree of ocular aging in patients to predict the rate of CEC loss post-surgery. For example， the central CEC density， in this case， was as low as 467 cells/mm' one month after surgery OS . Lower than the critical value of corneal decompensation reported clinically the preoperative HEX and CV level was normal， suggesting the loss of CECs was relatively low and the postoperative outcomes were good.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:50:55", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:51:11", "cost": 16.649}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:46", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:51:11", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:50:54"}

In the airway， activation of B2-receptors results in relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and a widening of the airway. Short-acting B2-agonists are the first-line drugs for treating reversible airway obstruction， such as in asthma. Adverse effects like tremor，palpitation，headache and metabolic effects after their use have been reported previously. But to our knowledge no cases of anaphylactic reactions with nebulized salbutamol have been reported in childhood. We present 2 years-old boy who developed anaphylaxis episodes after nebulized salbutamol inhalation during asthma attacks.\n\n【2】Keywords： Anaphylaxis； Children； Salbutamol\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Asthma is a common and potentially serious chronic disease that imposes a substantial burden on patients， their families and the community. It causes respiratory symptoms，limitation of activity and flare-ups (attacks) that sometimes require urgent health care and may be fatal. Short-acting B2-agonists are the first-line drugs for treating asthma attacks. Adverse effects like tremor， palpitations， headache， paradoxical bronchoconstriction and metabolic effects are commonly described after use of short-acting B2-agonists . Anaphylaxis to the salbutamol has also been documented in adulthood . But in the literature， pediatric patients with anaphylaxis to the nebulized salbutamol have not been reported yet. We present 2 years-old boy who developed anaphylaxis episodes after nebulized salbutamol inhalation during asthma attacks.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 2 -years -old boy was admitted to our hospital with history of asthma and 2 episodes of anaphylaxis after use of nebulized salbutamol during asthma attacks. On the last episode， he experienced generalized urticaria， vomiting， respiratory distress and fainting after 5 minutes of nebulized salbutamol inhalation and the first episode he had similar symptoms. In both time his symptoms were rapidly improved after intramuscular adrenalin injection. In his history， he was experienced similar symptoms when he tookper-oral terbutaline. Skin pricktest (SPTs) was positive with nebulized salbutamol (3 mm wheal). When skin test applied he experienced some urticarial rashes on his body. SPTs were negative with nebulized salbutamol in five asthmatics (exposed to beta 2-agonists) and in five non-asthmatic controls. SPT's for common aeroallergens and latex were negative. We decided not to challenge with salbutamol and any other short-acting B2-agonists because of dramatic response to these drugs. Informed consent was obtained from the patient’s family before the case report was presented.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Asthma is major public health problem in many countries. The most commonly used asthma medications are the short-acting inhaled B2-agonists such as salbutamol (albuterol) first introduced more than 30 years ago and for which there is now extensive clinical experience. Inhaled B2-agonists can cause both pulmonary and extrapulmonary adverse effects . Inhaled B2-agonists cause dose-dependent adverse effects because the inhaled drug is absorbed via the lung bed and the drug deposited in the oropharynx is swallowed . If B2-agonists are absorbed into the systemic circulation，stimulation ofadrenergic receptors in non-respiratorytissues willoccur. Thusstimulation of cardiac receptors causes positive chronotropic (increased hearth rate) and inotropic (increased force of cardiac contraction) effects， which may be experienced as palpitations . Skeletal muscle receptor activation causes fine tremor of the hands and contributes to metabolic effects， including hypokalemia， hyperglycemia， metabolic acidosis and elevation of free acids and ketones . Direct vascular effects cause systemic peripheral vasodilatation， which may precipiate headaches and cause a fall in blood pressure . In an acute attack of asthma B2-agonists may increase hypoxemia by worsening ventilation/perfusion mismatching in the lung . In the litherature， a case of Ig E dependent allergy to different short-acting b2-agonists producing acute bronchoconstriction was described. This patient is a41 year old man who developed acute respiratory distress within five minutes after inhaled several puffs of salbutamol. SPTs were positive with salbutamol，terbutaline，pirbuterol and negative with formoterol， salmeterol， bambuterol and ipratropium. In this patient tolerance to long-acting B2-agonists was good . Cross reactive reaction can be seen between B2 agonists .Our patient had also similar symptoms after per-oral terbutaline use. Only one case with anaphylactic reactions to the nebulized salbutamol was reported，untilnow . This case is a 42-year-old woman diagnosed with asthma due to pollen. She was treated with nebulized salbutamol and budesonide after an acute exacerbation. Ten minutes later， she experienced generalized itching and erythema， eyelid swelling， chest tightness， nausea， and abdominal pain. She had previously tolerated both drugs. Her skin prick tests and intradermal tests with salbutamol and budesonide were found negative. After drug challenge with nebulized salbutamol she experienced anapylaxis. A basophil activation test to salbutamol was performed to the patient but no activation was detected. In this patient， authors were unable to demonstrate the immunological pathway. But， even though the short time between the inhalation and the reaction onset and the fact that patient was reproducibly rechallenged， suggesting a type I reaction， IgE antibodies could not be detected. In the present report we demonstrated type I immune reaction with SPTs to nebulized salbutamol.\n\n【9】Conclusion\n\n【10】Our patient is the first reported pediatric patients who developed anaphylaxis after nebulized salbutamol administration.

We devised New Short-term Intensive Insulin Therapy (N-SIIT) to avoid hypoglycemia and mitigate glucotoxicity and Insulin Resistance (IR).

SARS-CoV-2was positive in PCR test. Chest CT image showed pneumonia. Immediately， we started N-SIIT， but pneumonia drastically aggravated on day 3. However， by continuing N-SIIT， clinical data were improved， and various symptoms disappeared on day 8. The required insulin dose was decreased and finaly replaced by oral diabetes agents. He was discharged on day 13 under stable conditions. Pulmonary infiltration in the chest CT completely disappeared. We did not use anyantiviral medicine or steroids， but COVIT-19 was cured by N-SIIT. Indeed， N-SIIT mitigated hyperglycemic adverse effects， leading to reduction of inflammatory cytokines and decrease of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expressions which is known to act as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2. We also assume that the mitigation of glucotoxicity and IR might have revived his own healthy metabolism and immune response. It is necessary to perform further clinical trials with a large number of subjects to establish practical therapeutic strategies.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】The current COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection represents a worldwide health crisis causing severe illness and death . Although COVID-19 has a broad spectrum of severity ranging from asymptomatic conditions to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)， a great risk of severe COVID-19 has been reported in patients with old age， obesity， diabetes and hypertension . Many reports have shown that patients with such risk factors and COVID-19suffer from synergistic aggravation of both diseases . In particular， the mortality of COVID-19was higher in newly diagnosed diabetes subjects than in non-diabetic or preexisting diabetes subjects. It is possible that the virus enters pancreatic beta-cells via the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor， injures beta-cells and induces Insulin Resistance (IR)，leading to the onset of diabetes mellitus or the aggravation of pre-existing diabetes . Early glycemic control may be an important therapeutic strategy to reduce poor outcomes in hyperglycemic COVID-19patients. Insulin is a safe choice under poor glycemic situations and is considered the first-line treatment in hyperglycemic and critically weakened patients . Although insulin therapy sometimes brings about hypoglycemia， insulin can substantially mitigate beta-cell glucotoxicity and IR in a relatively short period of time， which likely leads to the improvement of abnormal metabolism and lowered immune activity in each patient. Here， we show a newly diagnosed diabetic subject with COVID-19 who we efficiently treated using New Short-Term Intensive Insulin Therapy(N-SIIT) ， which is a basal-bolus insulin injection therapy based on the concept of “treat to target\"to avoid hypoglycemia and eliminate glucotoxicity and IR.\n\n【4】Methods\n\n【5】We used New Short-Term Intensive Insulin Therapy(N-SIIT) based on the concept of “treat to target\". This is different from conventional basal-bolus injection. In brief， 40% of the initial total daily dose of insulin (0.4 units/kg to 0.6 units/kg) was delivered with glargine U300 before dinner as basal insulin， and 20% was applied with Lyumjev before each meal as a bolus injection. On the following day， insulin dose was titrated according to the latest blood glucose level based on the concept of“treat to target”. The relationship between insulin and glucose levels is as follows： Lyumjev before breakfast reduces elevated blood glucose levels after breakfast and determines blood glucoselevels before lunch. Similarly， Lyumjev before lunch and dinner determines blood glucose levels before dinner and bed time， respectively. Basal insulin glargine U300 before dinner determines fasting blood glucose level on the next morning. Through the above relation， titration of four insulin injections reduces blood glucose levels down to the“target\"glucose range (90 mg/dl to 140 mg/dl). When the pre-meal blood glucose level was less than 90 mg/dl， the insulin dose was reduced by 2 units the next day to avoid hypoglycemia. To perform it more efficiently， we optionally injected 2 to 3 units of Lyumjev as additional pre-meal insulin at that time， only when the blood glucose level 2 h after a meal was over 200 mg/dl. Capillary blood glucose measurement and insulin injection were performed using capillary blood measurement devices and pen-type insulin injectors. Doctor or nurse gave instruction about insulin amount to each patient. Statistical analyses were performed using a nonparametric method(n=7). Wilcoxon’s signed rank tests were applied for comparison of the data. In the comparison of three groups，p values were adjusted by Bonferroni-Holm's calculation formula.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】Here， we present the case of a 43-year-old Japanese male patient admitted to our hospital due to three days of a high body temperature of 39.0°℃ and wet cough with blood-tinged sputum， shortness of breath， headache， sore throat， and loss of taste and smell. He had no symptoms or history of diabetes before this episode， but his mother and maternal aunt had diabetes mellitus. He was a non-smoker and social drinker. On admission， his height， body weight and BMI were175 cm， 95 kg and 31.0 kg/m’respectively. Although the patient had several symptoms as described above， his consciousness was clear， and he actively communicated with other people. There were no abnormalities or abnormal sounds in the heart， and respiration was smooth with a small crackle on auscultation. He had occasional nausea but had enough appetite to eat meals regularly. Initial vital signs were as follows： Body temperature， 39.0°℃； blood pressure，148/98 mmHg； heart rate， 82 beats/min； respiratory rate， 20/min； oxygen saturation on room air， 95%. C-Reactive Protein (CRP) was increased up to 9.33 mg/dL， and chest CT images showed pneumonia with ground glass infiltration. SARS-CoV-2 was positive in PCR test. High CRP， ferritin， LDH and liver enzymes and low absolute lymphocyte counts were compatible with SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent cytokine storm. HbAlc and blood glucose levels were as high as 11.8% and 337 mg/dL， respectively. C-peptide was high (5.59 ng/mL)， and anti-GAD antibody was negative. Such high HbAlc， blood glucose and C-peptide indicated that this subject had hyperglycemic crisis with IR. To obtain good glycemic control， we started N-SIIT immediately after admission. As shown in Table 1and Figure 1， the injected insulin dose was increased step by step， but blood glucose levels were not decreased for several days (from day 2 to day 4). After day 5， however， blood glucose levels started to decrease significantly with the same dose of insulin (136 units/day). In addition， after day 9， the insulin dose was considerably reduced， but blood glucose levels were not increased. These findings clearly indicate the mitigation of glucotoxicity and IR， as reported previously. Lab data were improved， and several symptoms subsided by day 8 without bringing about hypoglycemia . Various symptoms， such as loss of smell and taste and cough， subsided， and finally， fever and bloody sputum disappeared on day 8. C-peptide on day 9 was lowered presumably by a feedback mechanism due to adequate insulin injection for beta-cell rest . Then， insulin was replaced by empagliflozin 10 mg/day on day 8， voglibose 0.6mg/day and mitiglinide 30 mg/day on day 9 and linagliptin 5 mg/\n\n| Hospital days  | 1  |  | 2  |  | 3  |  | 4  |  | 5  |  | 6  |  | 7  |  | 8  |  | 9  |  |  | 10  |  | 11  |  | 12  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Before breakfast  |  |  | 258  |  | 219  |  | 209  |  | 212  |  | 198  |  | 158  |  | 147  |  | 148  |  |  | 135  |  | 111  |  | 118  |  |\n| 2 hafter breakfast  |  |  | 282  |  | 352  |  | 216  |  | 266  |  | 250  |  | 154  |  | 173  |  | 114  |  |  | 190  |  | 156  |  | 188  |  |\n| Before lunch  |  |  | 199  |  | 275  |  | 252  |  | 308  |  | 292  |  | 207  |  | 187  |  | 96  |  |  | 138  |  | 125  |  | 155  |  |\n| 2 h after lunch  |  |  | 339  |  | 247  |  | 315  |  | 310  |  | 166  |  | 157  |  | 176  |  | 157  |  |  | 151  |  | 161  |  | 118  |  |\n| Before dinner  | 359  |  | 207  |  | 216  |  | 213  |  | 162  |  | 122  |  | 136  |  | 131  |  | 161  |  |  | 109  |  | 117  |  | 120  |  |\n| 2 h after dinner  | 410  |  | 276  |  | 288  |  | 264  |  | 284  |  | 232  |  | 217  |  | 168  |  | 194  |  |  | 192  |  | 170  |  | 176  |  |\n| Before bed time  | 307  |  | 251  |  | 281  |  | 287  |  | 234  |  | 235  |  | 212  |  | 179  |  | 129  |  |  | 108  |  | 145  |  | 147  |  |\n| Plan， Additional  | PI  | Ad  | PI  | Ad  | PI  | Ad  | PI  | Ad  | PI  | Ad  | PI  | Ad  | PI  | Ad  | PI  | Ad  |  | PI  | Ad  | PI  | Ad  | PI  | Ad  | PI  | Ad  |\n| Lyumjev breakfast  |  |  | 10  | 2  | 16  | 3  | 20  | 2  | 24  | 3  | 29  | 3  | 30  | 0  | 30  | 0  |  | 30  | 0  | 15  | 2  | 8  | 0  | 3  | 0  |\n| Lyumjev lunch  |  |  | 10  | 3  | 16  | 2  | 20  | 3  | 25  | 3  | 30  | 0  | 30  |  | 30  |  |  | 30  | 0  | 15  |  | 8  | 0  | 3  |  |\n| Lyumjev dinner  | 10  | 2  | 14  | 2  | 16  | 2  | 20  | 4  | 26  | 3  | 30  | 2  | 30  |  | 30  |  |  | 30  | 0  | 15  | 0  | 8  | 0  | 3  | 0  |\n| glargine-U300  | 20  |  | 24  |  | 28  |  | 32  |  | 38  |  | 42  |  | 46  |  | 46  |  | 46  |  |  | 20  |  | 10  |  | 10  |  |\n| Total  | 32  |  | 61  |  | 75  |  | 101  |  | 122  |  | 136  |  | 136  |  | 136  |  | 136  |  |  | 67  |  | 34  |  | 19  |  |\n\n【9】Lyumjev： New ultra-rapid-acting insulin (insulin lispro-aabc) (units)； Pla： Planned insulin dosage， Add： Additional insulin injection. One basal insulin and three bolus insulin were used but the determination of amount of each insulin was different fram conventional procedure. Pre-meal insulin was defined as \"treat\" insulin， and blaad glucose level which was determined by \"treat\" insulin was converged within \"target\" glucase range (90 mg/dl to 140 mg/dl)\" by daily insulin titration. Initial daily dose was determined by the patient's body weight (95 kg) (0.5 units/kg/day， 47.5 units/day). We started insulin therapy with 10 units of lyumjev before each meal and 20units of glargine U300 before dinner and adjusted as follows. For example， since blood glucose level 2 h after dinner was 410 mg/dl which was higher than 200 mg/dl，2 units of lyumjev was optionally injected at that time. Also， blood glucose level before bed time was 307 mg/dl which was higher than 140 mg/dl， we added 2 units of lyumjev and planned 14 (10+2+2)units for day 2.\n\n【10】Table 2： Time course of various clinical parameters in this subject.\n\n|  | normal range  | day 1  | day 3  | day 9  | day 21  | day 91  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| V-GTP  | 13-64U/L  | 157  |  | 143  | 69  | 78  |\n| AST  | 1.3-30U/L  | 57  | 61  | 42  | 31  | 30  |\n| ALT  | 1.0-42U/L  | 79  | 69  | 76  | 53  | 47  |\n| LDH  | 124-222 U/L  |  | 342  | 255  | 165  |  |\n| Feritin  | 25.0 ng/ml  | 938  | 955  |  | 651  |  |\n| C-peptide  | 0.06 ng/ml  | 5.59  |  | 1.21  | 6.2  |  |\n| CRP  | 0.14 mg/dl  | 9.33  | 7.76  | 1.11  | 0.24  | 0.68  |\n| HbA1c  | 4.0%  | 11.8  |  |  | 10.1  | 7.2  |\n| Glucose  | 70-126 mg/dl  | 337  | 126  | 88  | 148  | 146  |\n| Absolute lympho  | 1，500-4，000/pl  | 930  | 770  | 1，822  | 1.586  | 1.500  |\n| Fibrinogen  | 200-400 mg/dl  |  | 482  |  |  |  |\n| D-dimer  | <1.0 pg/ml  | 0.3  | 0.2  |  |  |  |\n\n【12】V-GTP：y -Glutamyl Transpeptidase， AST： Aspartate Aminotransferase， ALT： Alanine Aminotransferase， LDH： Lactate Dehydrogenase， CRP： C-Reactive Protein； Absolute lympho： Absolute Lymphocyte day on day 11. He was finally discharged to home 12 days after hospitalization under stable conditions， and then diabetes control and evaluation of COVID-19 were performed at the outpatient clinic of Shigei Medical Research Hospital. In addition， as shown in Figure 2， although abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) images showed fatty liver on days 1 and 3， it was markedly improved on day 21， which was probably due to a reduction in glucotoxicity in the liver. Furthermore， and interestingly， although chest CT images showed pneumonia with ground glass infiltration on day 1， which was progressively aggravated on day 3， such alteration was drastically improved on day 21 accompanied by a marked reduction in CRP， and finally， pneumonia infiltration disappeared completely on day. Taken together， intensive insulin therapy with N-SIIT at an early stage of diabetes in this subject not only protected pancreatic B-cells against glucotoxicity and ameliorated fatty liver but also saved this subject from COVID-19； otherwise， this subject might have become\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】We accepted this patient as an emergency case impending the severe stage of COVID-19 or diabetic ketoacidosis because of typical symptoms， laboratory results and aggravating pneumonia . On admission， the patient was classified in phase 2A . In this phase， it is possible that worsening of the cytokine storm leads to irreversible phase 2B and phase 3. It is well known that intensive insulin therapy is very important in critically weakened patients with diabetes and COVID-19 . On the other hand， to reduce cytokine storms， steroid therapy is often performed in COVID-19 patients. However， it is also known that systemic corticosteroid therapy induces hyperglycemia， primarily by increasing postprandial blood glucose levels， IR and pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction and that steroid therapy weakens immunity to infection . Therefore， we have to be very careful when we start steroid therapy in patients with poorly controlled diabetes and COVID-19. In this subject， to interrupt the vicious cycle of diabetes and COVID-19 ， we performed N-SIIT  to relieve glucotoxicity and IR rather than steroid therapy to subside the cytokine storm. Hyperglycemia promotes the production of inflammatory cytokines  and increases the expression of ACE-2 . Increased ACE-2 acts as the receptor for SARS-CoV-2and the dominant path of virus entry into various cells. We believe that N-SIIT reduces hyperglycemia stepwise into the glucose target range， attenuating cytokine storms and viral entry into cells. SARS-CoV-2 infection is likely associated with a rapid increase in the required insulin dose， namely due to increased levels of inflammatory cytokines . In this patient， the insulin dose was increased up to 136units per day. Then， blood glucose levels were decreased to less than180 ng/dl and glucotoxicity was eliminated. As shown in Figure 1， blood glucose levels were decreased with the same dosage of insulin for 4 days (days 6 to 9)， indicating the mitigation of IR as reported previously . Then， insulin therapy was replaced by oral agents，but blood glucose levels were not increased， indicating that this patient was substantially relieved from glucotoxicity and IR . During the period of N-SIIT， various symptoms subsided， and laboratory data improved . We did not treat him with antiviral medicine or steroid hormone， but COVID-19 was cured after N-SIIT. Since most native patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 without risk factors are asymptomatic or self-limited and spontaneously cured within 2weeks， probably with their own healthy innate and acquired immune response， we assume that the mitigation of glucotoxicity and IR with N-SIIT led to revival of his own healthy metabolism and immune response in this subject. Normalized lymphocyte counts might have contributed to recovery of immune response. This hypothesis is supported by convalescent plasma transfusion， in which the infusion of plasma obtained from cured COVID-19 patients with higher titers of anti-SERS-CoV-2 antibody was effective for the treatment of other COVID-19 patients ， indicating that neutralizing antibody works well. Therefore， we think there is a possibility that a neutralizing antibody to SARS-CoV-2 was produced in this patient after N-SIIT and saved him from COVID-19. IR is often observed in subjects with obesity， hypertension and cardiovascular disease (metabolic syndrome) preceding the onset of type 2 diabetes. Thinking from high BMI， elevated C-peptide and fatty liver， this patient had serious IR. However， after blood glucose levels entered the target range with N-SIIT， the required insulin dose was decreased， indicating that the patient recovered insulin sensitivity reported previously . These data clearly indicate that we should start intensive insulin therapy as soon as possible in subjects with newly diagnosed and poorly controlled diabetes and with COVID-19. Intensive insulin therapy ameliorates glycemic control， which mitigates hyperglycemic adverse effects， produces inflammatory cytokine  and increases ACE-2 . Indeed， in this subject， chest CT showed ground glass infiltration on day 1， which was aggravated on day 3but was improved by N-SIIT and finally completely disappeared. In addition， fatty liver was observed in the CT image， but it was also improved by N-SIIT， as reported previously (ref 21 Supplementary Dataset Case 2 and 3). Sodium-Glucose co Transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors also have anti-inflammatory effects and have drawn much attention recently. However， we think that SGLT2 inhibitors should not be used as the first-line medicine in subjects with COVID-19because dehydration and ketoacidosis are likely brought about in such subjects . In this patient， an SGLT2 inhibitor was used after good glycemic control was obtained by N-SIIT， and it was useful without any side effects. In patients with both diabetes and COVID-19， diabetes risk factors and COVID-19 risk factors aggravate the patients’ conditions independently or cooperatively. As intrinsic risk factors for diabetes， hyperglycemia， glucotoxicity and IR might dysregulate metabolism and injure many organs， especially the vascular system. Patients with diabetes are vulnerable to infectious diseases due to weak innate and acquired immunity. In particular， it is likely that diabetic ketoacidosis drastically disturbs metabolism. Hyperglycemia is a risk factor even in non diabetic disease， as described above. On the other hand， as inherent risk factors for COVID-19， infection reduces the number of natural killer cells. SARS-CoV-2 deteriorates glycemic control by increasing IR and impairing insulin secretion and can induce ketosis/ketoacidosis ， although its main pathological site is vascular damage of the lung. Diabetes and COVID-19 have a common and related pathogenesis， leading to the establishment of a synergistic mechanism to aggravate pathophysiological conditions by creating a vicious circle ， although it remains unclear which is the first perpetrator in such a vicious circle. In this case， N-SIIT not only improved glycemic control but also healed COVID-19 pneumonia without any antiviral medicine or steroid therapy for SARS-CoV-2. It is conceivable that N-SIIT recovered normal metabolism by relieving this subject from such a vicious cycle and restoring the immune response to SARS-CoV-2， leading to recovery from COVID-19 pneumonia. We think that these findings further strengthen the evidence reported in many articles that diabetes is a risky comorbidity in COVID-19 patients. Taken together， while the current COVID-19 pandemic brings about a worldwide health crisis， this case report clearly indicates that we should start insulin therapy as soon as possible in subjects with newly diagnosed and poorly controlled diabetes infected with COVID-19. We are sure that this case report will lead to the establishment of a new therapeutic strategy for COVID-19， although it is necessary to perform further clinical trials with a large number of subjects to demonstrate our working hypothesis.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】Newly diagnosed diabetes and poorly controlled diabetes are risk factors of COVID-19 infection. Previously we devised a New Short-term Intensive Insulin Therapy (N-SIIT) on the concept of“Treat to Target\"to avoid hypoglycemia and to converge adequate insulin dosage for the patient’s individual pathophysiology. We successfully treated a case of newly diagnosed diabetes impending to severe stage using N-SIIT. Without steroid therapy N-SIIT exerted favorable effects in the patient with COVID-19 infection. Although hyperglycemia induced cytokine storm， N-SIIT efficiently treated hyperglycemia and led to subside cytokine storm. Therefore， we think that it is very important to treat risk factors of COVID-19 such as hyperglycemia.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 15:59:01", "endTime": "2024/09/20 16:10:21", "cost": 680.371}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:46", "update_time": "2024-09-20 00:10:22", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 23:59:01"}

We report a case with lumbar vertebra MS admitted to the Department of Neurosurgery in the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University in June 2022. This patient hospitalized at local hospital several times. After receiving medication， his symptoms had worsened. MRI examination shows the symptom was caused by the tumor compressing the nerve root. After surgical treatment， the patient’s pain symptoms had improved significantly. The patient discharged 5 days after surgery. The patient has been living normally so far.\n\n【2】Keywords： Melanocytic Schwannoma； Lumbar vertebra； Epidural\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】MS is very rare， which was first reported by WG Millar in 1932， accounting for less than 1%of the total number of schwannomas . A cytogenetic analysis related to MS showed that the karyotype of the tumor cell was diploid with obvious chromosome aberration， mainly showing trisomy of chromosome 6 and ring of chromosome 11. The long arm (6p) gain of chromosome6 and the short arm (11q) gain of chromosome 11 are common genetic features of malignant melanoma . Compared with MS， the common schwannoma is mainly the loss of genetic material on chromosome 22， which leads to the inactivation of NF2 allele ， while the abnormality of chromosome 6 and 11 has not been found in cases with traditional schwannoma. Therefore， MShas also been considered as a separate melanoma in recent years， which is different from a schwannoma previously considered.\n\n【5】MS is common in young and middle-aged people， with a median age of 38 years old . There is no significant difference in the incidence of MS among different genders. MS originated from neural crest， which is a kind of cells with differentiation potential of melanocytes and nerve sheath cells at the same time. It is common in spinal nerve roots and sympathetic ganglia， cervicothoracic segment， and other parts such as skin and soft tissue of head and neck， digestive tract， cervix and retroperitoneum have also been reported . Its clinical manifestations are nonspecific， mainly manifested as shoulder， neck， waist and back pain. MS is mainly caused by tumor stimulating spinal nerve root， and sensory and functional disturbance of corresponding segments occurs when spinal cord is compressed， which is similar to compression symptoms caused by disc herniation or other space-occupying lesions in spinal canal.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】The patient， a 56-year-old male， was admitted to the hospital with aggravation ofright lower limb numbness and pain for more than 1 year and 15 days. The patient suffered from right lower limb numbness and pain without obvious inducement 1 year ago， which was aggravated after activities and could be relieved after rest. However， no attention was paid to the disease at that time. In the last half a month， the patient felt that her symptoms had worsened and her pain was unbearable at night (VAS score： 7 points). The lumbar enhanced MRI scan of local hospital hinted that： L5-S1posterior intravertebral canal mass on the right side， considering neurogenic tumor. The patient came to our hospital for further treatment. The physical examination hinted that： Cranial nerve tests were negative， normal muscle force and muscle strength， pathological signs were negative， Achilles tendon reflexes were normal， right Straight leg lifting test was positive， with significant pain with slight numbness on the lateral side of the right calf and the dorsum of the foot. The lumbar enhanced MRI scan of our hospital demonstrated that： Hyperintense on T1 and hypointense on T2  on the right side of the spinal canal at the level of the L5 vertebra， with significant enhancement ， the size of about 3.5 cm ×1.7 cm， enlargement intervertebral foramen， which is closely related to the right L5 nerve root， with dumbbell-like change. Lumbar spine CT scan showed that： strip-like shadow of soft tissue density on the right side of the vertebral canal at the level of L5 vertebral body， The vertebral body is deformed due to compression. X-ray of lumbar hyperextension and flexion showed that： No lumbar instability. Complete preoperative examination was improved； after eliminating surgical contraindications， surgery was performed under general anesthesia. During surgery， C-arm fluoroscopy located the L5 and S1 vertebra， 3 cm posterior median straight incision， paravertebral muscles were separated， L5 spinous process and vertebral body were exposed， L5 spinous process was removed. By grinding drill， milling cutter was used to remove L5 lamina and expose Dural sac. Exploration and investigation showed that the tumor was located outside the spinal dura mater， with clear boundary， complete capsule and black surface， extending to L5 and S1 intervertebral foramen. Under the surgical microscope， black viscous tissue was found in the capsule， which was tarry . Rapid pathology during the operation suggested melanoma. First of all， most of the tumor operation during hospitalization. A) High T1 signal at the L5 vertebral body level (sagittal section)； B) Low T2 signal at the L5 vertebral body level (sagittal section)； C) Obvious T1enhancement (sagittal section)， the size was about 3.5 cm x 1.7 cm；D) The right intervertebral foramen at T1 (transverse section) was enlarged， which was closely related to the right L5 nerve root and showed dumbbell-shaped changes. in the capsule was removed， and then the adhesion with L5 nerve root was carefully separated along the capsule， and the tumor was completely removed. After complete hemostasis， the reduction and fixation of lamina was carried out， and muscles， subcutaneous and skin were sutured layer by layer. On the first day after operation， the pain in the original pain area was significantly reduced (VAS score for 3 points)， the lower limbs were normal， and there was no new complaint of discomfort. Five days after operation， MRI plain scan and enhancement of lumbar spine showed that there were no residual tumors after operation . Postoperative routine pathology showed that melanin-richlesions and pigmented schwannoma should be considered to be discharged； Immunohistochemistry showed that the tumor cells were S-100 (+)，S0X10(+)，HMB45(+)，MelanA(+)， Ki67 (focus +). The pathological diagnosis was malignant melanin nerve sheath tumor， formerly known as MS. The patient recovered well after operation and was discharged from hospital on the 5h day. The pain was obviously relieved compared with that before operation(VAS score 1). After operation， the patient sought medical treatment in the oncology department， and it was recommended to conduct reexamination regularly. The patients have lived normally since telephone follow-up.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Total surgical resection is recognized as an effective means to treat MS at present， and radiotherapy and chemotherapy can be supplemented after total resection. Currently， it is difficult to predict the prognosis of this disease. By retrospectively analyzing40 cases， a literature pointed out that the recurrence rate in situ is35% and the metastasis rate is 44%. According to the reports of a few recurrent patients at home and abroad， it is speculated that the recurrence， metastasis and malignant transformation of the disease may be related to tumor residue， morphological heterogeneity and infiltration . Therefore， during the operation， the surgeon should try his best to cut the tumor completely and decompress it fully on the premise of protecting the peripheral blood vessels， spinal cord and nerves. There is no unified conclusion on adjuvant treatment except surgery. It has been reported that radiotherapy has certain effects on tumor treatment and prevention of recurrence ， which provides some basis for the follow-up treatment of patients after operation. Italiano reported a case without radical surgery in 2011. The patient found tumor recurrence two months after operation， and after chemotherapy， the tumor progression was delayed to a certain extent.\n\n【10】Plain and enhanced MRI scan plays an important role in preoperative diagnosis； CT examination can understand the invasion of tumor to vertebral body and whether the intervertebral foramen area is enlarged， which is helpful for the formulation of surgical plan. The MRI features of MS are complicated， which is related to the different location and content of melanocytes in the tumor. The paramagnetic radical of melanin in cells can reduce the relaxation time of T1 and T2 ， namely short T1 and short T2. According to the melanocyte content in tumor and T1 and T2 manifestations of MRI， foreign scholars divided MS into four types： Melanin type， non-melanin type， mixed type and hemorrhagic type， most of which are melanin type in clinical practice . The histological features of common melanin type are >10% melanocytes in lesions， and MRI features are short T1， short T2， that is， high signal intensity in T1 and low signal intensity in T2， which are mostlyround， oval or dumbbell-shaped. Enhanced examination can indicate mild， moderate or obvious enhancement.\n\n【11】The diagnosis of MS mainly depends on microscope， electron microscope observation and immunohistochemistry.Microscopically， MS showed epithelioid， spindle-shaped cells arranged in bundle， wheel or interweaving， which were similar to Antoni A area of schwannoma. The nucleus was round or oval， with obvious nucleoli and unusual mitosis. If obvious atypia， more division and necrosis infiltrated surrounding tissues were found， malignancy should be considered . Fontana-Masson melanin silver staining was positive and PAS staining was negative in tumor cells. Under electron microscope， macrophages rich in mature melanin bodies were scattered， and a large number of glycogen granules were deposited in the nucleus. In ultrastructure， continuous basement membrane，long-spaced collagen fibers and other Schwann cells were found， and some of them contained melanin bodies . In immunohistochemistry， most patients showed positive S-100， HMB-45，Melan-A， Leu-7 and NSE detection results. Tumors may be accompanied by hemorrhage， cystic degeneration， necrosis， calcification and sandy bodies. MS can be distinguished from primary or metastatic melanoma， melanoma， pigmented neurofibroma and cellular blue nevus according to their microstructure and immunohistochemistry.\n\n【12】In conclusion， MS is a potentially malignant tumor， and its etiology， treatment and prognosis are unclear， which remains to be further studied. At present， the only recognized effective treatment is total surgical resection. Radiotherapy can play a certain role in preventing recurrence after operation and patients without total tumor resection during operation. Due to the high recurrence rate and metastasis rate of this disease， regular follow-up and reexamination play an important role in understanding the disease condition， determining the treatment plan and evaluating the prognosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:56:13", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:56:35", "cost": 22.018}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:46", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:56:35", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:56:13"}

In 1894， Jarisch and White made the first descriptions of patients with this syndrome， highlighting the presence of multiple basal cell carcinomas. Then in 1960， Robert W Goltz and Robert J Gorlin described a triad of signs of this disease including； multiple nevoid basal cell carcinomas， multiple jaw keratocysts and bifid ribs . Pathogenesis of the syndrome is attributed to abnormalities in the long arm of chromosome 9 (q22.3-q31)and loss of， or mutations of human patched gene (PTCH1 gene) .\n\n【6】The syndrome is associated with multiple Keratocystic Odontogenic Tumors (KCOT) in 90%of cases. In addition to jaw cysts， multiple basal cell carcinomas and skeletal anomalies are common findings. Skeletal findings are； bifid ribs， vertebral anomalies， bossing of frontal and temporoparietal region， hypertelorism， palmar and plantar pit and fissures， Calcification of falx cerebri， ocular and centeral nervous system lesions， cleft lip and palate， mandibular prognathism and in some rare cases the ovarian fibroma . KCOTs associated with this syndrome can be seen in both maxilla and mandible but there is more tendencies to posterior mandible  and the recurrence rate is more than nonsyndromic cases .

In the OPG of patient the multiple jaw lesions has been diagnosed and patient has been referred to Mashhad dental faculty. In clinical examination， the patient had a slight frontal and temporal bossing. There were no hypertelorism but he had unibrow. There was no pigmented lesion in any region of patient’s body .\n\n【9】In OPG ， radiolucent lesions related to bilateral mandibular and right maxillary impacted third molars were observed. In the left maxilla second and third molars were impacted.\n\n【10】In the right mandible， radiolucent lesion with well defined and cortical border and large extension from sigmoid notch to apical region of distal root of right 1' molar was observed that led to displacement of impacted third molar to the gonial angle. Also in the left side of mandible there was a well defined radiolucent lesion with cortical border in relation to impacted third molar that was 147mm dimensions. There was a slight tooth bud displacement in this region. And in the right side of maxilla there was a radiolucent， well defined with cortical border lesion related impacted third molar that was caused the displacement of the tooth. In the skull radiography， calcification of Falx cerebri was observed in form of radiopaque lines in the center of the skull which is a typical view ofthis syndrome .\n\n【11】Histopathological evaluation of jaw lesions revealed cystic wall with ulcerated areas， squamous epithelium and wavy parakratine. According to these findings， the diagnosis wasKeratocystic odontogenic tumor (KCOT).\n\n【12】Treatment plan for the patient was including the prophylactic removal of impacted left maxillary teeth， removal of impacted third molars with enucleation of related KCOT in the left mandibular and right maxillary region and marsupialization of the right mandibular cyst. Marsupialization was done by creating a window in the epithelium of cyst and suturing it to the surrounding periosteum and then to keep it open by an acrylic obturator with a process extended to the cyst was made. Patient followed every month and at third month， an OPG was taken that revealed calcification of surgical site in left side of mandible and decompression of cyst followed by upward movement of impacted third molar in right side of mandible . No new lesions seen on the provided image.\n\n【13】Case 2\n\n【14】A 21 years old man with chief complains of pain and swelling of lower jaw came and an OPG was ordered. In his OPG there were multiple radiolucent lesions in both mandible and maxilla . In clinical examination， the patient had a slight frontal bossing but there was nohypertelorism.Also he had pigmented lesions in multiple sites of his body. He had unibrow too . In the panoramic and cone-beam computed tomography ， there were radiolucent lesions in 3 sites of jaws； right ramus and retromolar of mandible， left retromolar of the mandible and distal of right maxillary 2n molar. There were no impacted teeth and the patient had no third molars. In the right side of mandible， the radiolucent lesion was in the distal of 2n molar and posterior extension to mandibular ramus. The lesion had a shape like clover leaves with well defined and cortical border and approximate dimensions of 3010mm that was caused bone\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】The Gorlin syndrome has diagnostic features such as multiple jaw KCOTs， NBCC， calcification of falx cerebri， palmar and plantar pit and fissure， bifid ribs， hypertelorism， frontal and temporal bossing and etc  there were KCOT in two side of mandible in our first case and two side of mandible and right side of maxilla in the second case and also there was calcification of falx cerebri in both cases. These findings were similar to the diagnostic findings of Kavoosi and colleagues . According to Habibi and colleagues average age of diagnosis of Gorlin syndrome in Iranian population is 35/12 years. which in our cases it was lower (15 years old in case l and 21 years old in case 2). Multiple KCOTs is the primary diagnostic symptom of this syndrome， as in our both cases.\n\n【17】According to Habibi and colleagues， there were multiple KCOTs in all of 19 cases they studied  according to Gonzalez et al. These cysts are more willing to engage mandible. Which It was observed in our patients too . According to Habibi et al ， the calcification of falx cerebri exists in 89% of Iranian population suffering from this syndrome which was observed in our both patients. Multiple Basal cell carcinoma usually appears in puberty or the second and third decades of life ， in our first case there was no skin lesion but the second patient had multiple skin lesions on his face and upper limb that biopsy from facial lesions revealed BCCs. KCOT treatment depends on several factors， including age， size and location and extension of lesion， perforation of cortical bone and invasion to soft tissue . According to this， treatments are generally classifiled as conservative or aggressive； Conservative treatment generally includes simple enucleation- with or without curettage， or marsupialization. Aggressive treatment generally includes peripheral ostectomy， chemical curettage with Carnoy's solution， cryotherapy， or electrocautery and resection . Different recurrence rates have been reported with each of these methods. According to study of Kaczmaryc et al.  on the choice of treatment method and recurrence rate of jaw lesions， the lowest recurrence rate was in resection and the highest rate was in enucleation (with or without adjunct therapy). Also， according to Titinchi and colleagues， recurrence rate of KCOT is reported 29/2% that in their study， the highest recurrence was associated with marsupialization . In our first patient that we did enucleation in right maxilla and left mandible and marsupialization in right side of mandible for treatment of KCOT， in 10 month follow-up period， there was no recurrence and the size of right mandibular lesion was reduced.\n\n【18】In 18 months follow-up period of our second patient， there was no recurrence in maxilla which was treated by enucleation. In the mandibular lesions， according to OPG radiographies taken 3，6 and12 months after surgery，the lesions was progressing towards healing but in OPG taken at month 18， the radiolucency was a little increased. So we requested a CBCT from both side of mandible and according to it，lesion's size was reduced but the cysts needed enucleation that was done by a second surgery.\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】Gorlin-Goltz syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant disorder that involves multiple organ systems and if it be diagnosed as early as possible， there is the possibility of more effective treatment and prevention of some findings. So in suspected cases of this syndrome， Counseling and referral to other related specialties for a more comprehensive diagnostic evaluation is recommended.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:02:09", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:05:25", "cost": 196.118}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:46", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:05:26", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:02:09"}

It is thought to be polymicrobial with Klebsiella being one of the most common organisms usually seeding the liver/biliary tract secondary to transplacement from the gut to the portal vein .\n\n【2】Klebsiella pneumoniae， a gram-negative and opportunistic pathogen， has emerged as a major threat in recent years due to its multidrug-resistant strains producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and/or carbapenemases causing disseminated community-acquired and hospital-acquired infections which are challenging to treat. HvKp-induced liver abscess is an emerging cause of PLA worldwide requiring immediate attention . Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (hvKp) affects immunocompetent hosts which were previously common in the Asian pacific rim is now claiming its global dominance . Despite being a gram-negative organism， it has an increased propensity to spread metastatically. It can cause multi-organ infection and is associated with high morbidity and mortality even among immunocompetent hosts， though diabetes has been shown to be a significant risk factor.\n\n【3】We present a unique presentation of HvKp PLA initially presenting as Diabetic Ketoacidosis(DKA) unmasking itself with septic emboli to the lungs and the brain.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 41-year-old Hispanic female with a past medical history of non-insulin-dependent type 2diabetes mellitus presented with 3 days of malaise， generalized fatigue， lethargy， abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting， and rapid shallow breaths after running out of her medications4 days prior to presentation. Physical exam was significant for Kussmaul's breathing and mild abdominal tenderness otherwise was unremarkable. The patient remained hemodynamically stable， afebrile， and on room air. Labs revealed white count of 17.88 K/mm， hemoglobin 11.1 G/dL， platelets 434 K/mm， bicarbonate 5 mmol/L， anion gap 28， ketones 5.2 mmol/L， serum osmolality322， glucose 429 mg/dL， alkaline phosphatase 575 U/L， AST 20IU/L， ALT 32 U/L， hemoglobin Alc>14%， procalcitonin 2.45 NG/mL， lactic acid 4.97 mmol/L. Chest X-ray on admission revealed no focal airspace consolidation.\n\n【6】The patient was subsequently upgraded to ICU level of care for diabetic ketoacidosis and sepsis. Treatment was started with 200 mL/h of intravenous fluids and regular insulin infusion. Given the patient's septic picture and abdominal pain， CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast only was obtained which revealed a large pyogenic liver abscess with extension beyond the inferior liver capsule with an abscess in the right perinephric space involving the lower pole of the right kidney along with multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules in the lung bases with a peripheral distribution in a few with early cavitary changes suggestive of septic emboli. Blood cultures showed growth of Gram negative bacilli prompting initiation of cefepime. On day 2 of hospitalization the patient's anion gap closed with the initiation of basal/bolus insulin and transfer from ICU to the intermediate medical care unit.\n\n【7】On day 3 of hospitalization， her blood cultures speciated to Klebsiella preumoniae with IR drainage and JP drain placement for pyogenic liver and perinephric abscess. Patient was evaluated by an infectious disease specialist. A quick string test was done in the microbiology lab which was positive hence her sepsis and metastatic infection was deemed secondary to hypermucoviscous Klebsiella bacteremia.\n\n【8】Antibiotics were de-escalated to ceftriaxone 2 g IV daily. Echocardiogram was ordered for the pulmonary nodules in lung bases with peripheral distribution. assessment of valvular disease along with a CT chest for pulmonary nodules. On day 4 of hospitalization echocardiogram revealed no valvular disease with a normal ejection fraction. CT chest with contrast was consistent with multiple pulmonary nodules with the largest 17 mm with minimal cavitations. Other much smaller nodules were also seen without cavitation which looked infectious etiology as per radiologist.\n\n【9】On day 5 of hospitalization， patient started complaining of right lower extremity weakness along with sudden dizziness， poor balance and right occipital headache. MRI brain with and without contrast was obtained given concern for septic emboli， which revealed multiple acute infarcts in the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres，vermis， and right lateral medulla. Neurology evaluated the patient with the initiation of aspirin and Plavix. Q. 1 h neuro checks were initiated for the patient given high-risk herniation with cerebellar strokes with a subsequent upgrade to ICU level of care for neuro checks. On day6 of hospitalization a transesophageal echocardiogram was done for evaluation of cardioembolic source of stroke which revealed no evidence ofendocarditis.\n\n【10】On the 7h of hospitalization， a plan to place a PICC line for continuation of ceftriaxone 2 g IV for 6 weeks was made. On day8 of hospitalization， the patient remained stable with improvement of bilateral lower extremity weakness and clinical picture hence she was discharged with drains to the right subhepatic space and right hepatic lobes with close outpatient follow-up with infectious disease. The patient's course was complicated by clogging of the drain along with incomplete resolution of liver abscess after prolonged antibiotic course as shown on CT abdomen and pelvis as residual fluid and gas in the right subhepatic space hence 6 weeks of oral cefpodoxime was added. On subsequent follow-up appointments the patient remained symptom-free with benign abdominal examination and normal inflammatory markers hence no further imaging was obtained.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Liver abscesses are subcategorized into pyogenic， amoebic， parasitic， and fungal which are all associated with high mortality in untreated patients emphasizing the importance ofearly diagnosis . Majority of the liver abscesses are noticed in the right lobe of the liver secondary to its increased blood supply however less commonly they can be seen in the left liver lobe or caudate lobe . Before the advent of percutaneous drainage， surgical intervention was the mainstay of treatment with gastrointestinal sources like diverticulitis and peritonitis most common causes however in recent years biliary tract pathology has been known to be the most common trigger causing pyogenic liver abscesses affecting 55- to 65-year-old age group unlike our patient in this study case . PLA treatment nowadays includes antibiotics， percutaneous drainage when abscess size is larger than 5cm， or rarely surgical intervention .\n\n【13】PLA is polymicrobial with the most common bacteria being E. Coli， Klebsiella， Streptococcus， Staphylococcus， and anaerobes . PLA secondary to Klebsiella has recently become a cause of concern given new emerging Hypervirulent strains (HvKP) and Carbapenem-\n\n【14】Resistant (CR-HvKP). Despite being a well-recognized organism， invasive syndromes affecting immunocompetent hosts causing life threatening infections were not reported previously with HvKp in the first world countries； first recognized in Asia . Their capability of producing hypermucoviscous capsules helps them distinguish from the classic Klebsiella variant on the string test. String test， an initial screening test for these phenotypes assessing the ability of the bacterial colonies to form a hypermucoviscous string >5 mm after an overnight growth on agar plate has now become insufficient for diagnosis .\n\n【15】HvKP's virulenceilsS attributed to its hyperCcapsule， fimbriae， porins， excessivesiderophores， andmacromolecular exopolysaccharides， among others . These pathogens can cause invasive infections including endophthalmitis， meningitis， brain abscesses， osteomyelitis， muscle abscesses， and pyogenic liver abscess among others . Literature suggests a possible relationship between high BMI， alcohol use， and poor glycemic control as in our patient with the development of PLA with risk reduction by modifications of these risk factors . In such patients with risk factors and appropriate clinical presentation， multiple sites for metastatic infection should be evaluated for early source control which remains the mainstay of treatment along with long-term antibiotics depending on sensitivities.\n\n【16】Treatment includes prolonged antibiotics along with source control. HvKP strains unlike the extended-spectrum-producing beta-lactamases-producing strains and carbapenem-resistant strains are susceptible to common antibiotics as evident in our patient since her HvKP strain was susceptible to ceftriaxone . The rise of these strains is alarming， requiring an emphasis on preventative measures to curb the spread of these deadly infections. Exposure prevention， contact tracing， and hand hygiene have been paramount in limiting the spread of these pathogens.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】In conclusion， various strains of klebsiella with increased resistance affecting immunocompetent hosts causing invasive syndromes which are increasingly difficult to treat have not been extensively reported in the literature previously. Given its varied presentations， it is of paramount importance to raise awareness of its different clinical presentations for early and prompt recognition preventing invasive infections by source control. Source control is the mainstay of treatment in these infections along with the requirement for prolonged antibiotics given extension hypermucoviscosity and biofilm production making them difficult to eliminate. Increased knowledge about preventative measures is warranted including hand hygiene to prevent and curb the spread of these worrisome strains.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:46:48", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:47:14", "cost": 26.035}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:46", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:47:14", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:46:48"}

Syphilis serologies positive， cerebrospinal fluid positive for IgG and IgM syphilis. Treated with Penicillin G for 14 days.\n\n【3】Discussion： Neurosyphilis cases are currently on the rise and need to be considered as differential when presenting with atypical psychiatric or neurological symptoms. The diagnosis is based on serological markers in the blood and cerebrospinal fluids. Cerebral imaging studies are encouraged for early detection as well.\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Syphilis was first discovered in 1905 by the German zoologist Fritz Schaudinn and dermatologist Erich Hoffman . The first outbreak of syphilis occurred in 1945 when Charles VII invaded Naples and his troops spread it through Europe. The disease is mostly spreads through sexual transmission. Syphilis is caused by Treponema pallidum and involves multiple organ systems. In later stages of the disease， the Central Nervous System (CNS) is involved as well. The symptoms of neurosyphilis can present as meningitis， meningovasculitis and parenchymal neurosyphilis as Tabes dorsalis . Treponema pallidum is very sensitive to the antibiotic penicillin . However， even though penicillin is available， the diagnosis ofneurosyphilis is not always easy to make and atypicalpresentations have been reported . Syphilis cases have been rising over the last decade. 133，945 cases of syphilis of all stages were reported in 2020 while 41，655 cases are primary and secondary syphilis . The rate ofprimary and secondary syphilis has increased by 147% in the window 2016-2020 and 21%. Acute syphilis can easily be misdiagnosed as primary psychiatric disorder as symptoms can mimic depression， anxiety， psychosis， delirium， cognitive changes with dementia . The described case below illustrates the challenges in diagnosing neurosyphilis in a complex patient with mental health and co-occurring substance use disorder.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 37-vear-old male was referred to the dual diagnosis treatment center after a psychiatric inpatient admission related to substance induced psychosis in January 2020 . The patient had been in recovery ever since his discharge from the hospital and free of perceptual abnormalities. He denied any illicit substance use， continued to smoke tobacco about one pack per day. The patient was followed monthly due to active co-occurring psychiatric symptoms consisting of depressed mood，insomnia，lack ofenergyand motivation withloss ofappetite，mildweightloss and intermittent suicidal ideations. His medications were consistent of： Sertraline 250 mg daily， Aripiprazole 4 mg daily and Hydroxyzine 25 mg as needed up to three times a day for anxiety. The patient had initially reported the blurred vision during a visit in April 2021. He had described fuzzy outlines， at times with flashes of light and floaters. He was referred to an ophthalmologist with appointment being scheduled in July of 2021. He did attend the appointment and was informed to have dry eyes and was prescribed ophthalmic solutions. He did comply with thetreatment and noticed onlya minimal improvement. Due to persisting symptoms and his optic nerve appearing inflamed on examination， he received intraocular steroid injections. Over the course of the next several months his vision worsened to the point where he was unable to work and started having difficulties ambulating in his own apartment. At that time， he contacted his Primary Care Provider. In November 2021， he was found to have bilateral uveitis on exam and serum syphilis and Lyme testing were ordered and returned positive. He was referred to an infectious disease consult at the local hospital. Upon arrival at the hospital， the patient’s chief complaint was solely the blurry vision. The patient denied headaches， confusion， or any other neurological symptoms. The patient on ophthalmological exam had prolonged bilateral posterior uveitis and rash. There were no signs of otosyphilis， focal neurologic deficits， or syphilitic meningitis. The serum syphilis screen showed syphilis IgG/IgM positive， RPR reactive， RPR titer 128. HIV 1+2 neg， Hepatitis serology negative， Chlamydia trachomatis， Neisseria gonorrhoeae negative. The patient underwent lumbar puncture.The Cerebrospinal-Fluid (CSF) appeared clear and colorless. The CSF showed elevated protein (54mg/dl)， white blood cells were elevated at 35/mmE， lymphocytic predominance (80%) versus neutrophils 3%， HIV nonreactive， HCV negative. The patient’s urine drug screening was positive for amphetamines， marijuana and patient reported crystal meth use a few days prior to admission. No brain imaging study was completed during hospitalization. Patient did have penicillin G challenge with monitoring in the intensive care unit due to history of allergy， with no reactions/side effects. The infectious disease consult recommended intravenous Penicillin G 24 million units'continuous infusion for 14days (2/5/22-2/18/22)， followed by Penicillin benzathine injection2/19/22 post-intravenous course. Patient had a Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC line) placed. Unfortunately， no home health nursing available for patient as he could not discharge safely to home or skilled nursing facility with PICC due to recent methamphetamine use. Patient remained inpatient to continue continuous intravenous antibiotics until completion of treatment on 2/19/22. He tolerated treatment well. Additionally， he was diagnosed with likely past Lyme disease infection with +IgG and negative IgM for Lyme and reported erythema migrans 2 years ago. Patient denied any symptoms of arthritis， joint swelling， or peripheral neuropathy. However， treatment was recommended per infectious disease to minimize risk of further manifestation. He received oral doxycycline during hospitalization， and this was prescribed to his pharmacy to continue until completed course. He was prescribed Doxycycline 100 mg twice daily through 2/24/22 (x 5 days， to complete 21-day course) to complete the treatment of Lyme.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】The rate of syphilis infections has been increasing over the last several years， especially in immunocompromised patients with AIDS/HIV. Neurosyphilis is a later stage of the disease when the central nervous system is affected. The spirochete Treponema pallidum can infect different areas of the brain such as meninges， brainstem， spinal cord or cerebellum， spinal cord， or vasculature. There are increasingly atypical presentations reported  of neurosyphilis as in our case with isolated blurred vision but co-occurring psychiatric dual diagnosis presentation which complicated the diagnosis and delayed treatment.\n\n【10】Conclusion\n\n【11】Patients with neurosyphilis can present with neurological or psychiatric symptoms. Utilizing the available serological screening tests for syphilis is important to make the diagnosis. Neuroimaging studies should be considered as well， and treatment should be initiated as soon as possible.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:45:22", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:45:28", "cost": 6.638}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:46", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:45:28", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:45:21"}

A two and one half year old boy was seen for an obvious deformity (genu valgum) of the right lower limb， which had first been noticed by the mother.

The combination of clinical， biochemical， and radiological features may help in lesion characterization， but only histology can provide the definitive diagnosis. Recurrence and/or metastases have been reported in up to 10%to 15% of cases. Although no clear evidence-based treatment guidelines exist， it is widely accepted that renal SFT need to be removed surgically to avoid the potential of malignant degeneration and metastases. A longer follow-up period might be necessary to definitively evaluate the clinical outcome of a renal SFT. A 36-year-old male， without comorbidities， underwent laparoscopic excision of a 7 cm left juxta-hilar pararenal mass in October 2018. Preoperative abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) was compatible with a renal cell carcinoma. The pathological study revealed an SFT. An abdominal CT scan， in May 2021，identified a new suspicious left kidney nodule. Thereafter， the patient had done a Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) in June 2021 that confirmed a mesorrenal nodule suspicious of renal cell carcinoma (24 mmx21 mm×21 mm) in the left kidney. He was submitted to open excision of two left juxta-hilar pararenal lesions. Histology provided the definitive diagnosis of metachronous Solitary Fibrous Tumors (SFTs). This is a very rare case of metachronous SFTs in the same kidney of the first resection in a young patient.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Solitary Fibrous Tumor (SFT) is a rare entity， representing 2% of all soft tissue tumors . It was first described in 1931 by Klemperer and Rabin as a distinct mesothelial tumor arising from the pleura. SFT was reported later in almost any extrapleural site. It is now distinguished into two entities， pleural and extrapleural. Extrapleural SFTs are observed in middle aged adults (mean age 50 years) and affect both genders equally. Urogenital system localizations are very rare. SFTs are usually asymptomatic when they have a small size， so the diagnosis is often delayed. Imaging features are not specific of SFT which are diagnosed as Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) and treated as such. Histologically， is usually a well circumscribed mass， with ill-defined fascicles of ovoid to fusiform cells and hemangiopericytoma-like vasculature， displays immunohistochemical staining for CD34 and STAT-6. Further investigation is needed to assess the clinical behavior of SFT， as well as to establish the appropriate duration and schedule of follow-up. Much of the research on this neoplasm is based on case reports that highlight its potential for clinical aggressiveness. With this same objective， we describe a very rare case of metachronous SFTs in the same kidney of the primary diagnosis.\n\n【4】In October 2018， a 36-year-old man was referred to our center because of a left pararenal neoplasm measuring approximately 7 cm near the renal hilum. Patient had no comorbidities or usual medication. Due to complaints of nonspecific abdominal pain， an abdominal ultrasound was performed， which detected a solid nodule in theleft kidney. Consequently， an abdominal CT scan was performed，which confirmed the presence of a left renal nodule suspected of RCC. He was submitted to laparoscopic excision ofpararenal mass. Histological and immunohistochemical aspects fit into a6.5 cm SFT of the left kidney. It was observed a multinodular neoplasm with well-defined borders. It was constituted by the proliferation of spindle cells without cytological atypia or only with mild atypia. Cells had round or elongated nuclei， with a thin chromatin， without prominent nucleoli， and mitotic figures were rare. There were no areas of necrosis. The cells were arranged in bundles that intersect a predominantly fibrous stroma. The neoplasm showed intense and diffuse positivity for metachranous solitary fibrous tumors. vimentin， CD34 and Bcl. There was very slight positivity for CD99. It was verified absence of positivity for c-kit， DOG1，smooth muscle actin， desmin， protein S100， and p-catenin. The expression of Ki67， the proliferative index， was around 5%.\n\n【5】The patient underwent imaging control every 6 1 months(abdominal ultrasound or CT). On May 2021， in an abdominal CT scan it was identified a new 26 mm left kidney nodule， with low uptake of contrast， not present in the previous exam. Consequently， the patient performed a renal MRI in June 2021 that revealed in the middle third of the left kidney， in an anterior location， a cortical nodule measuring 24 mm x21mm×x21 mm compatible with RCC. In September the patient underwent open mass excision. Intraoperatively， two suspicious hilar nodules were identified， a 2.4cm lesion identified in the CT and MRI scans and a 1 cm independent lesion. The resections were macroscopically complete.\n\n【6】Both nodular lesions had overlapping I morphological characteristics， with expansive growth and low cellularity. It was observed a neoplasm formed mainly by monotonous spindle cells， but cells with a vaguely histiocytic morphology with oval nuclei were also identified. No areas of necrosis， mitotic figures or cytological atypia were identified . Immunohistochemical techniques revealed strong and diffuse positivity for CD34  and nuclear staining with weak to moderate intensity for STAT-6 . The definitive diagnosis was metachronous SFTs (two lesions) with1.2 and 2.4 cm in the left kidney hilum， with apparently complete excision.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】SFT clinical symptoms could be a palpable mass， a flank pain or hematuria but SFT is usually asymptomatic when it has a small size. Although， imaging is useful for the evaluation of renal tumors， ultrasonography， CT， and MRI features are not specific for the diagnosis of SFT . Usually， the differential diagnosis of SFT is difficult， and in most cases the renal mass is interpreted as suspected of RCC and patients undergo surgery . Diagnosis of kidney SFT is mainly based on the histopathological and immunohistochemical findings. SFT is a neoplasm characterized by the proliferation of spindle cells originating from fibroblasts and mesenchymal cells. On gross examination， tumors are usually tan-gray， homogenous， lobulated， well-circumscribed， and most often involve the renal capsule. Microscopically， spindle cells are surrounded by thick， keloid-like collagen bands with patternless arrangements， sometimes with predominant myxoid changes. It is currently recognized to originate from CD34-positive dendritic interstitial cells and therefore show staining for this immunohistochemical marker (90% to 95%of cases). Immunohistochemical staining with Bcl-2， vimentin， and CD99 can also aid in the diagnosis of SFT. Focal and limited reactivity for S100 protein， cytokeratins and/or desmin had also occasionally been reported . The STAT-6 immunohistochemistry constitutes nowadays the most useful diagnostic tool in daily practice， since it is a surrogate marker for the NAB2-STAT6 gene fusion， present in the vast majority of SFT .\n\n【9】It is estimated that 10% of extrapleural SFTs will recur and/or metastasize . SFT are categorized as having intermediate biological behavior， locally aggressive and rarely metastasizing according to the 2020 WHO classification. The diagnostic criteria for malignant SFT were proposed by England in 1989： Mitotic count >4/10 high-power fields； diversity of shapes of cells； many focal points in cells； and necrosis of some cells . In the latest classification of SFTs formulatedby WHO，the above criteria were still used for the diagnosis of extrapleural malignant SFT . Malignant transformation of SFT may result from 2 physiopathologic mechanisms according to literature： De novo occurrence and dedifferentiation from preexisting benign SFT . With malignant transformation， SFT may lose CD34expression .\n\n【10】New studies proposed multiple prognostic factors for SFT's， but the lack of large-scale studies worldwide fall short to assess their significance. A recent study in a multicenter cohort from the French Sarcoma Group database developed a risk stratification model (prognostic groups for overall survival and recurrence). The core idea of risk assessment models is the standardization of the treatment protocol by allocating patients in different subgroups in which therapeutic lines depend on the calculated risk for local and metastatic recurrences.\n\n【11】There are very few series of patients with SFT and much of the literature only describes case reports. Fu et al.  retrospectively analyzed 10 adult patients with renal SFT. Pathological diagnosis revealed that the tumors in 8 patients were benign， while those in the other 2 patients were malignant. No recurrence occurred in a mean follow-up of 47.3±21.5 months. Cheung et al. described a 49-year-old female with a left renal SFT (16 cm x 11 cm x9 cm) who after undergoing a nephrectomy， presented 8 years later with a metachronous contralateral kidney SFT (exophytic nodule， 4.3 cm，in the lower pole submitted to partial nephrectomy). Sfoungaristos et al. report a case of a 72-year-old male with a large retroperitoneal SFT recurrence (12 cm x11 cm) 3 years after nephrectomy to excise the primary tumor. The pathologic diagnosis of the nephrectomy specimen was SFT with negative surgical margins. The patient follows a strict surveillance， being well without evidence of recurrence or metastasis 9 months after the re-operation. Sammoud et al. described a case of SFT with two local recurrences in a 53-year-old man. In the second time of local recurrence the patient had lung metastasis. As in the cases described in the literature， in our case there was a recurrence of the disease even though the first resection specimen had negative margins.\n\n【12】The follow-up time for patients with SFT is not defined. Salas et al.  concluded that recurrence increased between 10 and 20years， suggesting that long-term monitoring is useful. In our case， the recurrence was after 3 years of the primary tumor diagnosis. The patient will maintain imaging control， but there is no defined protocol.\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】In our case report we describe a young man with diagnosis of a very rare case of metachronous SFTs in the same kidney of the first resection. Diagnosis was based on the histopathological and immunohistochemical findings. The evaluation of SFT mainly comes from case reports. Future large population studies are required to enrich our understanding of this tumor type and its behavior and to improve its diagnosis， treatment，and follow-up.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:48:09", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:48:18", "cost": 9.541}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:46", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:48:18", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:48:08"}

Patients suffering from weight loss have reduced ability to complete the prescribed treatment， reduced quality of life， and reduced survival. Optimizing nutrition intake during cancer in order to achieve weight maintenance is difficult and requires individual timely nutritional therapy. The aim of this multi method development study was to create a decision support tool which would prevent weight loss in cancer patients by supporting nutrition intake and containing relevant information to support patients as well as professionals on nutritional aspects throughout the course oftreatment including rehabilitation.\n\n【2】Methods： An APP for decision support was developed with patient and professional involvement. Descriptive data were collected for the evaluation of efficacy as weight development and semi structured qualitative interviews with patients and professionals individually. Interviews were analyzed by qualitative content analysis.\n\n【3】Results： Patients maintained weight. Nutrition intake was supported in 42 patient's home by the tool. When intake was decreasing， a quick and efficient collaboration between patients and professionals made sure the right nutritional therapy decision was made and implemented. Patients and professionals were very satisfied with the system.\n\n【4】Conclusion： The decision support tool for nutritional therapy between patients with cancer and professionals was efficient and well liked. Patients were compliant and maintained weight and oral intake to a high extent. When oral nutrition intake decreased， a fast decision was initiated.\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Malnutrition is a common and serious problem in patients with cancer， as between 15% to 80%of all patients experience significant weight loss during disease and treatment. The consequences of weight loss are muscle loss and impaired functioning， impaired immune system inducing infections， as well as psychological consequences， including depression， isolation and reduced quality of life. Patients suffering from weight loss have reduced ability to complete the prescribed treatment. In radiation therapy and chemotherapy， it has been shown that poor nutrition conditions often lead to postponement or discontinuation of treatment， thus reducing the strategic effect of treatment.\n\n【7】Poor nutritional status specifically contributes to poor outcomes. From literature， we know that even a smaller weight loss has significant consequences for the patients treatment efficiency， and the larger weight loss， especially the loss of muscle mass， the higher risk to survival . Nutrition intervention and individual follow up has shown to improve quality of life and clinical outcomes in short and long term . However， early intervention， individual patient involvement and thus compliance， treatment of nutrition impact factors and interdisciplinary collaboration， seem to be crucial in order to achieve success . It is therefore crucial that an individually adapted nutrition course is initiated at a very early stage. Likewise， it is important that attention to the patient's nutritional state and the changing alternate need for nutrition therapy is continued throughout the entire course oftreatment as well as followed up during rehabilitation . Equally it is shown that nutrition and exercise are considerably coherent factors， and that patients who often cease to be physically inactive in order to save their strength，have greater muscle loss， and thus also harder to exploit the nutrition consumed efficiently .\n\n【8】By counseling patients to eat the adequate and proper diet and inverting medical nutrition therapy in due time， as well as maintaining strength and activity， one may contribute to reduce the number and severity of complications， as well as shorten the disease and rehabilitation process. However， studies have shown that practices regarding nutritional advice and therapy during the course of cancer are insufficient .\n\n【9】People suffering from cancer and disease-related malnutrition may need to change their perception of food and their food culture in order to be able to eat sufficiently during a disease that affects the desire and ability to eat. For example， patients with cancer and disease-related malnutrition may normally aim to live a healthy life in order to prevent type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular problems， just as other people ought to do when healthy. Patients may therefore have to override the food and health perception and experience of proper healthy eating habits they have acquired， in order to fulfill nutritional requirements， when the ability to eat is lacking.\n\n【10】Decision Support Aids (DSA) are tools designed to present treatment choices based on the best evidence for patients， by stating the decision， describing the options， and helping people evaluate options from a personal point of view， thereby increasing the quality of the patients decision without undermining the patient’s preferences. In addition， a DSA can help health professionals in informing， structuring and involving patients in decisions. A decision support tool for cancer patients with weight loss， used by patients themselves and by the patient in collaboration with professionals throughout the course of the cancer may be able to qualify patients and professionals into the best possible dialogue on nutrition and nutrition therapy throughout the cancer course. A decision support tool for nutrition designed for cancer patients with weight loss may help the patient to pay attention to and monitor dietary intake， weight and other symptoms.\n\n【11】The aim of this multi method development study was to create a decision support tool which would prevent weight loss in cancer patients by supporting nutrition intake and containing relevant information to support patients as well as professionals on nutritional aspects throughout the course of treatment. Furthermore， to provide informed dialogue between patient and professionals based on patient preferences， observations and monitoring， as well as launching correct efforts and recommendations for nutritional interventions in case of impairment.\n\n【12】Materials and Methods\n\n【13】The purpose of the Public and Patient Involvement (PPI) study was to develop and implement a tool to help cancer patients with weight loss， making informed decisions about relevant nutrition therapy， in dialogue with health professionals throughout the course of treatment， from first medical visits to completed rehabilitation. Together with nine patients， eight nurses/three physicians a team of IT-technicians and the research team (authors)， we developed anAPP for use by patients as a single system on tablet or smart phone. The APP was developed in an iterative process in three phases， starting with analysis of needs and experience which built the basis for the development， and allowing patients and staff to test and influence the process along the way.\n\n【14】The APP included\n\n【15】A food and dietary registration module to be used by patients at home and which provides instructions to the patient about the correct individually calculated dietary intake and what the patient can eat to improve dietary intake， as monitoring and guidance to the patient. Requirements were set based on the scale of Harris-Benedict equation. Protein requirements were calculated in the program as 1.3g/kg/day. An arrow shows how close the patient is to the aim of the day. Suggestions are provided for achieving the goal. Far from goal shows a red arrow， which turns yellow and then green when goal is near or achieved，also including a numbered percentage.\n\n【16】A weight-registering module， which is also used in the calculation of individual requirements for energy and protein. Red to green relates to goals.\n\n【17】A nutrition impact symptom module， where patients score nausea， constipation， mouth sores， early satiety，pain，depression， and fatigue. Red to green  relates to worst thinkable or no problems.\n\n【18】A physical activity module encouraging physical activity and training by the APP， and patients monitor the activity undertaken in four different phases and how much time they spend during the day.\n\n【19】On the above， patients send information to professionals they chose to include. Patients are encouraged to do this on the day before hospital visit and/ or twice weekly. The patient connects his or her healthcare professionals (either individual or teams) including nurses， oncologists/physicians， dieticians， with a single click and these can afterwards follow the patient’s entries and thus orientate themselves in the patient's nutritional state， dietary intake， discomfort and activity level continuously and be prepared for the meeting with the patient. For professionals we developed a website to gather patient information as listed below. Professionals should prepare themselves for the meeting with the patient， with the information provided， in order to give individual and informed advice on therapy actions and support interaction on decisions.\n\n【20】In the information library module， the patient finds explanations and reliefsuggestions-housing advice，as well as information about the importance of not losing weight during treatment and maintaining physical activity. Similarly， the patient in layman's language finds information about treatment options for weight loss.\n\n【21】We called the APP “NutriDia” reflecting nutrition dialogue between patients and professionals.\n\n【22】Data were collected for the evaluation of results as weight development and semi structuredqualitative interviews with patients and professionals individually. Interviews were analyzed by qualitative content analysis \n\n【23】Ethical considerations\n\n【24】The patients signed informed consent prior to participation. The Ethical Committee of Region North Jutland， Denmark had no objections to the study.\n\n【25】Results and Discussion\n\n【26】We aimed toprimarilyinclude patients with head and neckcancer as well as gastro intestinal cancer. This was due to the assumption that these patients would be moreover able to represent all nutritional challenges. Two other cancer patients were included，as theyhad heard ofthe APP from their treatment team， who found they would benefit from inclusion. Overall 101 patients were consecutively screened for， and 51 patients agreed to participation. Of these， nine patients were solely included in the development process， and 42 patients were included in the intervention period. The decision support tool was used by patients and the health professionals throughout the patient’s treatment course，based on Aalborg University Hospital. Departments involved were the Oncology treatment Departments， including radiation therapy， chemotherapy and surgery. Furthermore， patients used the system with other health professionals during their cancer course， including in conjunction with clinicians in the rehabilitation centers， and in general practitioners. One patient used it in another hospital due to transferrable to another Department of Oncology who took good care of patient and equipment， and found it valuable and easy to follow.\n\n【27】Demographic information for patients who used the tool during their therapy after implementation ofthe final tool is shown in Table 1\n\n【28】The 50 patients considered potential candidates for NutriDia， but who ended up not participating were overall characterized with lack of profit for additional information， lack of compliance， lack of IT capabilities， and poor general condition. Of these 14 were included but chose and were supported to drop out after a few days.\n\n【29】The included patients were to a far extent able to maintain weight， as sixteen patients' maintained weight throughout the five months intervention period and the fourteen who lost weight lost remarkably little. Furthermore twelve patients slightly gained weight during the period. More than this，some patient lost or gained slightly for a couple of days， but managed to restitute within the course of treatment. Weight development is shown in Table 2.\n\n【30】Nutrition intake was noted for all patients， and was on average sufficient for the individual for the overall group. Thirteen patients who had an average lower average oral intake of minus 356 kcal/day (40 kcal to 1020 kcal) were supplemented with either enteral or parenteral nutrition. Eighteen patients had an increased intake of 275kcal/day (30 kcal to 557 kcal).\n\n【31】Qualitative interview findings\n\n【32】NutriDia provides patients and health professionals with a sound basis for common nutrition related decision-making， based on the following features：\n\n【33】Table 1： Demographic information for participants using NutriDia during the interyention.\n\n| Demography N=42  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Gender (men)， n(%)  | 28 (66.0%)  |\n| Age， Mean years (SD)  | 58(11.2)  |\n| BMI， Mean (SD)  | 25.5(2.7)  |\n| Disease Location  |  |\n| Upper Gastrointestinal Cancer (cardia， pancreas， oesophagus， ventriculi)  | 14  |\n| Lower Gastrointestinal Cancer (Colon， Rectum)  | 10  |\n| Head/Neck and Tongue  | 16  |\n| Others  | 2  |\n\n【35】Table 2： Weight development from start to end of the use of NutriDia.\n\n| Weight balance N=42  | Number of patients  | Mean difference Kg (SD)  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Maintain  | 16  | 0  |\n| Weightloss  | 14  | 1.08(2.3)  |\n| Weight increase  | 12  | 0.55(1.14)  |\n\n【37】The patients were very eager to monitor ingested meals， weight， symptoms/discomfort and activity level in. In addition， the patients found they enhanced knowledge about nutrition and nutritional therapy options， reasons for discomforts and how to find relief for these.\n\n【38】Patients describe the tool as contributing to structure， control and overview， and to improve their ability to optimize daily intake of energy and protein. Patients always followed the scale of the app's cover page， which illustrates how much the individual was missing out of his needs.\n\n【39】The decision support tool has helped prevent further weight loss in patients of which a few hadlost weight before the start ofthe cancer treatment course. This may be explained by the motivational factor highlighted by the participating patients， especially regarding the knowledge of and interest in their nutrition and dietary challenges， which they felt helped them to realize questions they had for the professionals and to find good solutions together with the staff.\n\n【40】The results show broad satisfaction with the simple and clear design in the decision support tool， highlighting the colors including the traffic light system. The color codes where the patient achieves“yellow\" at acceptable energy intake and \"green days\" at target achievement was described as being crucial to the patient’s focus on eating sufficiently， as well as continued the feeling of profit and want to monitor almost daily. The color codes thus support the motivation to eat， which all patients express. Patients express that NutriDia has led to increased knowledge of the nutritional content of food， especially in terms of protein and calorie content. Particular attention was paid to protein intake-since patients found the APP gave them the opportunity to follow their protein target and teach them which foods contain a lot of protein. Many patients referred to increased knowledge as they thought protein density was only found in meat and dairy products， which didn`t necessarily taste well for the time being. In addition， patients point out that NutriDia is a good tool for adjusting the intake of calories and proteins and that the app has helped to give them an overview of their weight. Finally， several patients are satisfied that NutriDia suggests what food the patient could add to the diet， and that this may be motivating for patients to try out food that they have not tried so far. As one patient said：\n\n【41】\"I actually had no sense of the whole idea of calories and protein. Have never ever needed it before. I have only eaten when I was hungry. Now I have learned what I need. And it works really well that you can see how much you ve got and how much you need. The nurse praised me this morning， because she could see that I was doing well. And you also like to be praised. I get these ideas (push messages，ed.) to what I can eat in the evening. Ice and so on. Ilike this feature\".\n\n【42】Patients expressed the feeling that they were contributing to the treatment and that the professionals were well-prepared for their meetings with regard to the side effects of cancer treatment and nutritional problems. This reinforces one of the goals in NutriDia； to increase patient involvement in the course of treatment. Patients experienced great satisfaction by actively engaging in the otherwise powerless situation that accompanies cancer diagnosis，including loss of power and desire to eat.\n\n【43】The patient information library contributed to the informative goal of the tool， where patients became more aware of their own side effects， but also about relief suggestions.\n\n【44】Severalpatients emphasize that NutriDia's functioniss are supportive in relation to the dialogue the patient has with the professionals， including doctors， nurses and dieticians. The registered entries in the app acted as a starting point-for the dialogues and consultations the patients had with the professionals. Several patients described feeling confident in knowing that the professionals could follow the entries the patients made at home. In addition， several patients expressed that the professionals made use of the inputs that patients had entered into NutriDia by starting from the specific issues entered， for example regarding fluctuating weight， nausea， side effects of treatment i.e.， One patient refers： \"They encourage me now that it is time for me to do something about these nutritional supplements and such things.“Now you ve lost a bit， so now you have to go ahead and try it.\n\n【45】Only one patient found that her entries were not used with the Oncologist， and that the Oncologist showed less than no interest towards nutrition or her losing weight. Se however had help from the nuirses.\n\n【46】Main results from interviews with professionals\n\n【47】Professionals found that NutriDia motivates more patients to consume the required amount of calories and proteins as well as their weight. In addition， they found that the app gives patients a feeling of self-control， which many patients can enjoy in a situation where may feel out of control.\n\n【48】\"I find we catch them earlier because they themselves get into the weight curve. So I think it becomes very visual for them (patients)， how fast it can go and then they do not get the huge weight loss\"(Nurse， Radiation Therapy).\n\n【49】\"I also think that once they’ve got the APP， they are much more aware of getting up to the full dose\" (Nurse， Radiation Therapy).\n\n【50】\"I'veheard patients say they get a pop-up reminder， “you're behind goals\". It is a big help for many of them\" (Dietitian， Oncological Day Care)\n\n【51】Doctors， Nurses and Dieticians use data from NutriDia as a basis for dialogue with patients. In addition to facilitating dialogue， more professionals use data from NutriDia to qualify focus in each conversation，both before and during the consultation.\n\n【52】\"We talked out of NutriDia， where I could see that the patient met her need for protein and energy， and she had actually taken two of the kilos she has lost\"(Dietician).\n\n【53】“It’s a good tool before consulting to see what’s really going on and how she is taking the oncology treatment (Doctor).\n\n【54】NutriDia makes it easy to involve the patient actively when a common goal is to be set.\n\n【55】\"I like it because we can look at the entries together and agree that this is the time to act on this or that-it is more like we are in it together. For instance the patient I talked too yesterday， who was less reluctant to tube placement， than I would have expected\" (Oncologist).\n\n【56】All in formants agree that NutriDia gave them a quick overview of their patients in the morning. The nurses in the radiation therapy used NutriDia to get an overview of the patients who came to treatment that day when they met in the morning：\n\n【57】\"I go in and look in the morning and see； How are the different patients I have today， how is their weight coming along?(Nurse， Radiation Therapy)\n\n【58】It's quick to get an overview of who's in bad shape-， the weight goes down and nausea rises， so I’m prepared for the patients-while there may be nothing with some of the other patients. So it gives me that fast-paced overview\" (Nurse， Radiation Therapist).\n\n【59】Primary sector： NutriDia was well received in the primary sector including rehabilitation， and was predominantly used by dieticians who found it of great relevance. In rehabilitation there is most often more time for the individual patient， and NutriDia rapidly gained a significant role in the contact between the patient and the healthcare professional. In addition， it was described by professionals that NutriDia in a new way allowed for a slightly better hand in hand\"with the patients between appointments. NutriDia in rehabilitation was often used to assist with the withdrawal from enteral nutrition and nutritional supplements， when the patient monitored increasing weight and better intake.\n\n【60】Overall， NutriDia was well received and lived up to expectations. The only draw-back was the lack of integration into the electronic patient journals， which was not included in the project due to data safety.\n\n【61】In this PPI multi method development study， we included no group for comparison. Following， we are not able to say if the results achieving weight as well as protein/energy intake maintenance may have also been possible with other means and methods. Meanwhile， the development rose out of patient and professional experiences and perspectives， adding to the relevance of the actual intervention . Furthermore， the tool gave room for an active and very individualized approach to nutritional therapy， which has earlier been shown efficient by other methods . This study supports the finding of the Cochrane review， which found that people exposed to decision aids feel more knowledgeable， better informed， clearer about their values， and with a more active role in decision making .\n\n【62】Supported by NutriDia， patients were able to maintain weight and thus that were give improved conditions for going through oncology treatment without complications related to nutritional risk. NutriDia well managed to engage patients in their own nutritional route and therapy， and promoting shared decision making between professionals and patients. This and the ability of NutriDia to interact in patients lived daily lives may be an important link to enhancing better compliance to nutritional therapy.\n\n【63】Conclusion\n\n【64】The NutriDia decision support tool， which was built with patients and health professionals， prevented weight loss in 42 Head and Neck and GI cancer patients. Its features including monitoring of nutrition intake and nutrition impact symptoms， motivation and information facilities， supported nutrition intake and provided a sound basis for patients and their health professionals in the dialogue on nutritional therapy， throughout the course of treatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:17:07", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:17:19", "cost": 12.222}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:46", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:17:20", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:17:07"}

Intraoral examination revealed an exophytic white lesion that extended from the entire left maxillary alveolar ridge to the palate beyond the midline. A thorough clinical， radiological， and histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of oral verrucous carcinoma.\n\n【2】Keywords： Oral； Hard palate； Verrucous； Carcinoma； Histological examination\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Verrucous Carcinoma (VC) is an uncommon subtype of low-grade， well-differentiated Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) that develops mostly in the skin， genitalia， esophagus， and oral cavity. Oral Verrucous Carcinoma (OVC) accounts for 2% to 12% of all oral cavity carcinomas and mostly affects the buccal mucosa， followed by the hard palate， the floor of the mouth， and the gingiva .\n\n【5】Clinically， OVC appears as a painless， white-grey， warty， exophytic mass that resembles cauliflower . It presents a strong predisposition for local invasion and a low predisposition for diffusion in neighboring structures， which varies depending on the lesion size and the evolution period. Metastasis from OVC is uncommon .\n\n【6】Histologically， OVC exhibits a well-differentiated squamous proliferation with a papillary or verrucous epithelial surface and clear hyperkeratosis， invading the subjacent stroma with well-defined， pushing margins. Minor cellular atypical is usually seen .\n\n【7】This report describes a case of VC of the hard palate in a 75-year-old female patient.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 75-year-old female was referred to our Department of Oral Medicine and Maxillofacial Radiology for evaluation of a lesion on the left side of the palate dating back more than a year. Her medical record revealed controlled diabetes with no other specific health conditions； she didn’t report taking any systemic medications.She has had ahistory ofsmoking a minimum of 10 cigarettes per day for at least 40 years. Her physical examination disclosed no extra-oral abnormalities.\n\n【10】Intraorally， the patient presented a painless verrucous exophytic white lesion that covered the whole left maxillary alveolar ridge and reached the palate beyond the midline .\n\n【11】The Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the facial bones， with a focus on the hard palate， showed an increase in the left palatal mucosa thickness， cortical irregularity， and osteolysis of the inferior border of the maxillary sinus .\n\n【12】An incisional biopsy was performed under local anesthesia and sent for histological assessment.\n\n【13】The anatomopathological examination showed papillary tumor proliferation covered by an acanthotic and keratinized stratified squamous epithelium. The interpapillary buds are enlarged and grow in depth. Minimal cellular atypia and lymphocyte infiltration were noted .\n\n【14】These findings support the diagnosis of an OVC.\n\n【15】The patient was referred to an oncologist， and a whole-body evaluation was performed using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans after intravenous injection of 6.8 mCi of lF-FDG and a high-resolution CT scan with an appropriate PET scanner. Diffuse hypermetabolic thickening at the left maxillary aspect with no evidence of active distant metastasis was detected.\n\n【16】An MRI-1.5T examination showed an expansile lesion of the ill ex hard palate on the left side measuring 3.7 cm x3.6 cm ×1 cm and extending to the bony floor of the left maxillary sinus. The lesion had intermediate signal intensity and showed enhancement after intravenous gadolinium administration. No neck lymphadenopathy or evidence of extension into the sinus or the nasal cavity was noticed.\n\n【17】These investigations confirmed the VC of the hard palate.\n\n【18】Considering the patient’s age and the lesion’s size， treatment by radiotherapy and chemotherapy will be adopted rather a surgical one.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】OVC is a rare tumor affecting the oral cavity； it is more frequent in patients between 40 and 60 years old with a male preponderance. The etiology of OVC is unknown； however， tobacco smoking， alcohol drinking， and chewing betel nuts are established major risk factors . Additionally， other conditions， including chronic inflammation， ulcers， poorly fitting removable dentures， poor oral hygiene， and immunosuppression， have been reported as causal factors in the literature . In comparison to SCC oncogenesis， the human papillomavirus has a much smaller impact on OVC oncogenesis . Moreover， it is suggested that OVC may arise in potentially malignant lesions， dysplasia， and carcinoma in situ .\n\n【21】While OVC is not generally considered to have a racial predilection， many studies conducted on Asian patients reported a higher occurrence in men， with incidences as high as 77.4% and94.9% ； this seems to be related to the consumption culture of betel nut and tobacco chewing .\n\n【22】The diagnosis of OVC is challenging. In fact， it is very difficult to distinguish OVC from other lesions， such as OSCC，Oral Verrucous Keratosis (OVK)，and Oral Verrucous Hyperplasia (OVH) .\n\n【23】OVH has been referred to as an early stage or precursor to OVC andis believed to have similar biological potential . Additionally， many authors raise the problem of the differentiation between “pure”OVC and“hybrid”OVC which has foci of SCC . Therefore， it is essential to differentiate OVC from all these lesions through meticulous histopathological assessment. Recent researches have recommended using biomarkers to identify OVC. Since it might be difficult to distinguish OVC from other lesions such as OSCC and OVH based on the histopathological findings， Hosseinpour et al. highlighted via a comprehensive review the value of using biomarkers like Ki67 and P53 to help with the final OVC diagnosis .\n\n【24】OVC has a better prognosis than other types of cancerous tumors that might be fatal . The most common treatment for OVC is surgery . In cases of extensive lesions， surgery combined with radiotherapy may be helpful . Other treatment techniques， such as chemotherapy， may be performed when surgery is not indicated. In fact， a variety of cytostatic drugs have shown favorable effects on reducing tumor size .\n\n【25】Conclusion\n\n【26】OVC is a rare tumor with an uncertain etiology and a difficult differential diagnosis.

Signet ring is a term used to describe the histologic appearance of a tumor cell with a crescent-shaped nucleus made by cytoplasmic vacuole compression. It is more common in the stomach， followed by colon， pancreas and less commonly in the bladder. Generally， PSCADCP is diagnosed at a later stage and， consequently， has a worse prognosis when compared to conventional prostatic adenocarcinoma . The grim prognosis and rarity of PSCADCP warrant closer investigation， and much of the literature on this neoplasm is based on case reports. We report a very rare case of early diagnosis in a young man. The treatment and follow-up protocol of these cases has not been established due to the rarity of the disease. However， the literature describes the need for aggressive treatment and very close surveillance.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 54-year-old man was referred for evaluation by urology in June 2021. He had lower urinary tract symptoms， but he was asymptomatic on observation by the urologist. The calculated IPSS was 9. Symptoms improved with an alpha-adrenergic blocker. The rectal examination revealed a prostate with about 40cc， unsuspected. He performed an uroflowmetry which was inconclusive because urine volume was <150 ml. The total PSA was 4.23 ng/ml with a 12% free/total PSA ratio.A multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was performed in August 2021 and revealed a suspicious area in the right lobe， poorly defined， involving the anterior and posterolateral zones of the middle third and apical region， measuring 28 mm x9 mm. There was capsular irregularity， which increases the suspicion of extracapsular extension. The findings classified the lesion as PI-RADS v2. A prostate biopsy identified acinar adenocarcinoma in 15% of the fragments of the right lobe， Gleason 8 (4+4). Staging was performed with PET-PSMA， which described a high intensity focus on the right lobe， centered on the middle floor， lateral and posteriorly and nonspecific bilateral pulmonary nodules. Chest computed tomography detected uncharacteristic micronodules. Thus， the patient underwent retropubic radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection in November 2021. There were no complications， and the patient was discharged on the third postoperative day. The histology revealed a poorly differentiated acinar adenocarcinoma of the prostate， histological variant signet-like cells (30%). About 60% of neoplasia was classified as Gleason pattern 4 (cribriform pattern) and 10% as pattern 3 . The neoplasia was graded Gleason 9 (4+5)，pT2aN0， negative margins， International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) Grade 5. The neoplasia involved 10% of the right lobe tissue (peripheral zone of apex，lower and middle floor). After surgery， he had PSA<0.06 ng/ml.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】PSCADCP can present with voiding problems， but it can present with symptoms related to metastasis since the diagnosis is usually made at an advanced stage of the disease. In our case the patient reported lower urinary tract symptoms that resolve with an alfa-adrenergic blocker. The diagnosis of PSCADCP requires histopathologic examination of the tissue， and it is necessary to prove the prostatic origin of the primary tumor， classically it was necessary to exclude metastases of other organs to the prostate， namely gastrointestinal tract. Currently， available imaging tests allow targeting the origin of the tumor in the prostate. Due to a slightly elevated PSA with a free/total PSA ratio <15%， the patient underwent a multiparametric MRI that was compatible with right lobe prostate carcinoma (PI-RADS v2.1-5) which was confirmed by biopsy. Staging PET-PSMA also revealed intense marking of the right lobe of the prostate，which indicates a neoplasm of prostatic origin. Adjacent foci of more typical prostatic adenocarcinoma strongly favor a prostatic origin， as described in the literature . There are reviews that admit that the minority ofpatients (31%) had a documented gastrointestinal work-up to determine the primary signet cancer cells source .\n\n【8】The name signet cell was given because of the appearance of the cell， since large vacuoles push the cell nucleus to the periphery. The4h edition of the Classification of Tumors of the Urinary System and Male Genital Organs， from World Health Organization， in agreement with other authors， considers that to diagnose PSCADCP， signet cells should comprise more than 25% of the tumor . Immunohistochemical techniques can be performed when there are doubts. In fact，certain histologic appearance can belike the signet ring cell， such as vacuolated lymphocytes and altered smooth muscle cells after radiotherapy or hormone therapy. Guerin et al.  suggested that signet ring carcinoma cells should be classified as a variant of high-grade adenocarcinoma rather than a separate histologic classification. In support of this proposition， a signet ring carcinoma cell is often found in the presence of other high-grade prostatic adenocarcinoma patterns. The diagnosis of PSCADCP is certainly a histologic diagnosis that can be done using needle biopsy，endoscopic resection specimens， orprostatectomy specimens. Gleason score sum of 9 or 10 is typical and is usualy associated with a high stage， early spread to bones and viscera， and poor outcomes. In our patient， the radical prostatectomy specimen revealed 30% of the tumor formed by signet ring cells. About 60% of the neoplasia is classified as Gleason pattern 4(cribriform pattern) and 10% as pattern 3. Thus， the prostate cancer was classified as Gleason 9 (4+5)， ISUP grade group 5.\n\n【9】Warner et al.  in their review of 9 cases of PSCADCP calculated that mean age was 68.2 years. Blas et al. ， in 2019，reviewed 5 cases of PSCADCP and found a mean age of 77.8 years and mean PSA level of 18 ng/ml (10.6 ng/ml to 331 ng/ml). The patient described in this article is young when compared to the mean ages described in the literature. In addition， it had a slightly increased PSA level， little suspicious of neoplasia， different from the values described in some reviews. Wang et al.  identified that younger age (40 to 50vs. >70) was a predictor of worse cancer specific survival， despite more aggressive therapy. This information could be useful when counseling these patients and emphasizes the need for new strategies and molecular-based therapeutic approaches for these cases.\n\n【10】Fujita et al.  presented a case series of 42 patients with PSCADCP and found that up to 75% of cases present with locally advanced or metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Stage IV disease was a predictor of poor survival. Furthermore， they showed that the survival rates after the initial diagnosis was 82.3% in the first year， 54.7% in the third year and 11.7% in the fifth year. Warner et al. showed an average survival time of 29 months and 33% of patients presented at diagnosis with stage IV cancer. Bronkema et al.  also concluded that metastatic disease was most common with PSCADCP(10.3%) compared to non-variant cases (4.2%)； PSCADCP presents with higher local stage than non-variant tumors. Warner et al.  reviewed 9 cases and all were diagnosed at an advanced stage and， despite multidisciplinary treatments， the mortality rate was very high， around 66%. Recent case reports continue to alert for diagnosis at a very advanced stage of the disease， which implies a poor prognosis. Kim et al.  reported a 56-year-old man with hematuria which exams identified a bladder mass. Consequently， transurethral resection was performed， and histological evaluation revealed a signet ring cancer invading muscularis propria. He was submitted to radical cystoprostatectomy. The histology revealed that tumor involved both prostate and bladder， but its center was in the prostate and definitive diagnosis was PSCADCP. Chemoradiotherapy was initiated two months later， but patient developed bone and liver metastases and died. Despite the poor prognosis and description of mortality in practically all cases， there are more recent case reports of therapeutic success. Gok et al.  presented a case without any evidence of disease 16 months after combination of hormone therapy and radiotherapy. Fortunately， the case described in this case report was diagnosed at a very early stage， which is very rare and may imply a better prognosis for the patient.\n\n【11】The optimal treatment strategy for this subtype of prostate cancer is unknown because few cases were reported. Historically， the treatment approach for PSCADCP has been like that for traditional prostate adenocarcinoma， involving combinations of hormonal therapy， radiation， and surgery. However， the response to hormonal therapy is unpredictable . Kim et al.  concluded that instead of conventional hormonal therapy， aggressive treatment and close follow-up are necessary. Kwon et al. reported a patient that started traditional androgen blockade and， nine months later， he was diagnosed with hormone refractory prostate cancer. The patient died after 2 cycles of chemotherapy. Wang et al.， in their review of 93patients with PSCADCP， concluded that local disease， younger age and being married were predictors of radical prostatectomy. Younger age was a predictor of aggressive local therapy and was the strongest predictor for radical prostatectomy rather than external beam radiotherapy.Our patient was young and refused blood transfusions， so radiotherapy was a poor option due to its long-term sequela， for example， radiation induced cystitis\n\n【12】Conclusion\n\n【13】PSCADCP occurs in 2.5% of cases of prostate carcinoma and requires careful histological diagnosis. It has a poor prognosis that is correlated with the diagnosis at a very advanced stage. The diagnosis in an early phase， as in our case， is very rare. Although it is difficult to define an optimum treatment strategy， early diagnosis， aggressive treatment， and close follow-up might improve prognosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:40:59", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:41:05", "cost": 5.41}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:46", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:41:05", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:40:59"}

After 5 days of admission to the hospital the patient suddenly developed chest pain and hypoxia (SPO ： 80%) with lower extremities weakness. Quickly we completed CT pulmonary angiogram and asked for a neurological consultation. CT pulmonary angiogram showed right main pulmonary artery embolism and right lower pulmonary artery embolism . The neurological consultation showed： Absence of tendon reflexes， no sensory disturbance， no miscarriage， cerebrospinal fluid puncture is normal， CT scan of the brain is normal. Neurologist ruled out Guillian-Barres syndrome and suggested multiple peripheral neuropathy. We quickly started treatment for PE with blood thinners medication， alpha lipoic acid， vitamin B12 and physical treatment and for neuropathy with.\n\n【21】After three days of treatment we noticed significant clinical improvement (improvement of chest pain， shortness of breath， SPO：92%).\n\n【22】The patient has been discharged in excellent condition with normal SPO， on air room， improvement in lower extremities weakness and follow up physical treatment.\n\n【23】After four weeks of the discharge from the hospital， the patient started to suffer from increased of shortness of breath on exertion， cough， hemoptysis， fatigue， loss of weight and fever. CXR showed：\n\n【24】Bilateral areas of parenchymal and interstitial densities in the lungs， predominantly in the upper fields . CT scan showed： Lesions typical of pulmonary tuberculosis with bilateral areas of interstitial densities suggest post COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis . Thus We also ordered the Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) that was performed on sputum specimens (Xpert MTB/RIF test) and the result was positive with Mycobacterium tuberculosis sensitive to rifampicin .\n\n【25】We could not made pulmonary function test because the patient had hemoptysis and active tuberculosis. After confirming the diagnosis， the patient has started on tuberculosis therapy(INH+RMP+ PZA+EMB) and low dose of corticosteroid. Finally the patient has continued his tuberculosis therapy with drug tolerance and with no another complications of COVID-19 infection. At the end of tuberculosis therapy he has made CT scan which showed absence of the tuberculosis cavities， mild Bronchiectasis in the front section of the right upper lobe with absence oflung fibrosis.\n\n【26】Discussion\n\n【27】This case has several important points to be noticed.\n\n【28】The first point： The co-infection of TB and viral diseases like MARS，etc.has been noticed in the past. Studies on association of TB and COVID-19 are few. Some studies suggest that the pandemic has had negative effect on diagnosis TB， because delay or miss related to similarities in symptoms between both conditions. The relationship between TB and COVID-19 was noticed and suggested that TB infection may increase the probability to injury with severe COVID-19 and TB disease progression .\n\n【29】The second point： Many patients also present a pro-coagulant state， which is biochemically detected by increased D-dimer levels and is related to complications and a worse prognosis. D-dimer levels >1000 ng/ml and chest pain as a clinical complaint were the strongest risk factors directly associated with PE development in COVID-19 patients. Thus start specific anticoagulant treatment， as recent data show that this is a safe treatment that should be provided to COVID-19 patients with PE .\n\n【30】The third point： Infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes not only pneumonia， but also neurological complication. Peripheral neuropathy is frequent and mostly results from immune mechanisms and neurotoxic side effects of drugs applied to treat COVID-19such as (linezolid， lopinavir， ritonavir， hydro-chloroquine and glucocorticoids) and to a lesser extent， from the compression of peripheral nerves after prolonged bedding on the ICU .\n\n【31】The fourth point： Post COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis is an important complication； there is currently no clinical data on the frequencyand mechanism ofit. The management of this complication remains unexplored at large due to a lack of clinical trials. The role of anti-fibrotic drugs such as (pirfenidone and nintiedanib)， is suggested based on the similarity in the mechanism to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Thus they may be used even in the acute phase of COVID-19 pneumonia. Also some studies showed use prolonged low dose corticosteroid may prevent remodeling oflung. Finally there are many risk factors for the development of lung fibrosis include(advanced age， comorbidities \"such as hypertension， diabetes\"， severe of infection， Lab findings like \"lymphopenia， elevated lactate dehydrogenase\"， prolonged ICU stay， duration of mechanical ventilation， smokers and alcohol abuse) .\n\n【32】The fifth point： Is our case is particularly interesting because therapeutic success was achieved despite the coincidence of COVID-19 complicated by TB， pulmonary embolism， lung fibrosis， peripheral neuropathy.\n\n【33】Conclusion\n\n【34】The chest and general physicians should thinking and evaluating patients for co-infection TB and COVID-19 during the recent epidemic and they should giving attention to complications that can occur in COVID-19 infection like pulmonary embolism， lung fibrosis， peripheral neuropathy and treating them quickly as possible to improve progression.\n\n【35】We need large studies from several centers to find out the incidence， mortality rate， management guidelines for co-infection tuberculosis and COVID-19， and to investigate the occurrence and test the efficacy of already tested drugs such as anti-fibrotic for COVID-19 fibrosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "\n【13】Lab orations showed elevated white blood cells (11.6×10， elevated CRP (65 mg/l)，.", "content": "【0】Abstract\n\n【1】We report an interesting case of COVID-19 infection filled by complications (tuberculosis， pulmonary embolism， post COVID-19 lung fibrosis and Peripheral neuropathy).

We quickly started treatment for PE with blood thinners medication， alpha lipoic acid， vitamin B12 and physical treatment and for neuropathy with.\n\n【21】After three days of treatment we noticed significant clinical improvement (improvement of chest pain， shortness of breath， SPO：92%).\n\n【22】The patient has been discharged in excellent condition with normal SPO， on air room， improvement in lower extremities weakness and follow up physical treatment.\n\n【23】After four weeks of the discharge from the hospital， the patient started to suffer from increased of shortness of breath on exertion， cough， hemoptysis， fatigue， loss of weight and fever. CXR showed：\n\n【24】Bilateral areas of parenchymal and interstitial densities in the lungs， predominantly in the upper fields . CT scan showed： Lesions typical of pulmonary tuberculosis with bilateral areas of interstitial densities suggest post COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis . Thus We also ordered the Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) that was performed on sputum specimens (Xpert MTB/RIF test) and the result was positive with Mycobacterium tuberculosis sensitive to rifampicin .\n\n【25】We could not made pulmonary function test because the patient had hemoptysis and active tuberculosis. After confirming the diagnosis， the patient has started on tuberculosis therapy(INH+RMP+ PZA+EMB) and low dose of corticosteroid. Finally the patient has continued his tuberculosis therapy with drug tolerance and with no another complications of COVID-19 infection. At the end of tuberculosis therapy he has made CT scan which showed absence of the tuberculosis cavities， mild Bronchiectasis in the front section of the right upper lobe with absence oflung fibrosis.\n\n【26】Discussion\n\n【27】This case has several important points to be noticed.\n\n【28】The first point： The co-infection of TB and viral diseases like MARS，etc.has been noticed in the past. Studies on association of TB and COVID-19 are few. Some studies suggest that the pandemic has had negative effect on diagnosis TB， because delay or miss related to similarities in symptoms between both conditions. The relationship between TB and COVID-19 was noticed and suggested that TB infection may increase the probability to injury with severe COVID-19 and TB disease progression .\n\n【29】The second point： Many patients also present a pro-coagulant state， which is biochemically detected by increased D-dimer levels and is related to complications and a worse prognosis. D-dimer levels >1000 ng/ml and chest pain as a clinical complaint were the strongest risk factors directly associated with PE development in COVID-19 patients. Thus start specific anticoagulant treatment， as recent data show that this is a safe treatment that should be provided to COVID-19 patients with PE .\n\n【30】The third point： Infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes not only pneumonia， but also neurological complication. Peripheral neuropathy is frequent and mostly results from immune mechanisms and neurotoxic side effects of drugs applied to treat COVID-19such as (linezolid， lopinavir， ritonavir， hydro-chloroquine and glucocorticoids) and to a lesser extent， from the compression of peripheral nerves after prolonged bedding on the ICU .\n\n【31】The fourth point： Post COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis is an important complication； there is currently no clinical data on the frequencyand mechanism ofit. The management of this complication remains unexplored at large due to a lack of clinical trials. The role of anti-fibrotic drugs such as (pirfenidone and nintiedanib)， is suggested based on the similarity in the mechanism to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Thus they may be used even in the acute phase of COVID-19 pneumonia. Also some studies showed use prolonged low dose corticosteroid may prevent remodeling oflung. Finally there are many risk factors for the development of lung fibrosis include(advanced age， comorbidities \"such as hypertension， diabetes\"， severe of infection， Lab findings like \"lymphopenia， elevated lactate dehydrogenase\"， prolonged ICU stay， duration of mechanical ventilation， smokers and alcohol abuse) .\n\n【32】The fifth point： Is our case is particularly interesting because therapeutic success was achieved despite the coincidence of COVID-19 complicated by TB， pulmonary embolism， lung fibrosis， peripheral neuropathy.\n\n【33】Conclusion\n\n【34】The chest and general physicians should thinking and evaluating patients for co-infection TB and COVID-19 during the recent epidemic and they should giving attention to complications that can occur in COVID-19 infection like pulmonary embolism， lung fibrosis， peripheral neuropathy and treating them quickly as possible to improve progression.\n\n【35】We need large studies from several centers to find out the incidence， mortality rate， management guidelines for co-infection tuberculosis and COVID-19， and to investigate the occurrence and test the efficacy of already tested drugs such as anti-fibrotic for COVID-19 fibrosis.", "index": 3973, "show": true, "start": 3973, "end": 4059, "province": ["格式规范性", "多余标点"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:36:55", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:37:29", "cost": 34.054}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:46", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:37:28", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:36:54"}

Paragangliomas develop from the para-ganglionic system which is mostly located in the adrenal gland medulla，but also distributed all over the body. They are more commonly seen in head and neck regions of the body and tumors of this region .\n\n【7】Thyroid Paraganglioma (TP) accounts for 0.1% of all the thyroid neoplasms  and between years 1974 and 2013 only about 35 TP cases are reported in the literature . They have a local invasive behaviour and may invade the neighbouring structures. The local aggressive resection wil achieve a prolonged disease free survival of the patients .\n\n【8】Here we present a case that had a suspicious Fine Needle Aspiration Biopsy (FNAB) revealing a neuro-endocrine tumor.\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\n【10】A 67 years old female patient was admitted to our Endocrine Surgery out-patient clinic with a swelling around the neck and an unexplained chronic cough. The physical examination revealed a palpable mass at the right lobe of the thyroid gland without any palpable cervical lymph nodes. All the laboratory tests including the thyroid hormones were normal.\n\n【11】The ultrasound (US) revealed a 33 x 20 mm hypoechoic nodule on the right lobe of the thyroid gland without any cervical lymph node enlargement. There were some other nodules with a variety of dimensions on the left lobe suggesting a multinodular goitre.\n\n【12】FNAB was performed from the dominant nodule with the guidance of US. The FNAB was efficient with enough amount of glands.\n\n【13】In the cytopathology report there was a suspicion of neuro-endocrine tumor.These findings were explained to the patient， her consent was taken and a Total Thyroidectomy (TT) was planned due to suspicious FNAB report and multinoduler goitre.\n\n【14】In the operation the nodule was found to be fixed to the adjacent trachea. During the dissection on the trachea of the right thyroidlobe， a laceration of the trachea happened. Perioperative Ear Nose Throat(ENT) consultation was done and the defect was primarily repaired by the surgical team. Both recurrent nerves were seen and preserved and TT was completed.\n\n【15】In the final histopathology report； grossly the tumor was found to be emerging from the thyroid gland. It was ill defined. On the cut section， it was red-brown in color and soft in consistency， size was 3.0x2.5x2.0 cm.\n\n【16】Histologic sections were prepared from routinely fixed paraffin-embedded tissue， cut at 3 to 4um. Sections for light microscopy were stained with H&E. Sections were stained for immunohistochemical studies on an automated immunostainer (Ventana ES， Ventana Medical Systems， Tucson， Az) using the biotin-avidin tecnique. Microscopically the tumor was partly encapsulated and showed focal extension into the adjacentthyroid tissues. Tumor cells were arranged in Zellballen， trabecular or solid pattern of growth . Tumor cells had round， polyhedral， or spindle shapes， with a moderate\n\n【17】Table 1： Immunoprofiles of thyraid paraganglioma and thyraid medullary carcinoma.\n\n|  | Thyroid paraganglioma  | Thyroid medullary carcinoma  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Chromogranin A  |  |  |\n| Synaptophysin  |  |  |\n| TTF-1  |  |  |\n| Calcitonin  |  |  |\n| CEA  |  |  |\n| Pancytokeratin  |  |  |\n| S-100  | +  |  |\n\n【19】Sustantacular cells amount of granular，eosinophilic， and amphophilic cytoplasm. Nuclei were round to ovoid with finely granular nuclear chromatin. Mitotic figures were occasionally seen. Foci of haemorrhage were common. Tumor was positive for chromogranin A and synaptophysin and negative for TTF-1， calcitonin， CEA and Pancytokeratin . S-100 staining demonsrated the presence of sustantacular cells at the periphery of tumor nests. The pathologic diagnose was thyroid paraganglioma (TP).\n\n【20】Patient was discharged on postoperative day two. Later on that developed wound infection and apse formation at day 7 post-operatively was treated with drainage and dressing of wound in our out-patient clinic.\n\n【21】Screening ofthe patient 29 months after the surgery wasperformed and no metastasis or local recurrences were seen in the ultrasound and PET scan (F-18 FDG). Tests performed for the detection of catecholamine secretion； serum and 24 hours urine adrenaline， noradrenaline， dopamine， metanephrine， normetanephrine， vanyl mandelic acid， 5 HIAA were found to be in normal limits. The thyroglobuline and anti-thyroglobuline levels were 1，45 ng/mL and <1，0 IU/mL respectively. The patient is still being followed up in 6 months periods and using 100 mcg./day L-thyroxin PO.\n\n【22】Discussion\n\n【23】Although the TP accounts for the 0.1 % of all the thyroid neoplasms， this tumor must be remembered in the differential diagnosis of the thyroid cancers .\n\n【24】The FNAB cannot be diagnostic in all cases preoperatively but sometimes like in our case may give an idea about the suspicion of a TP. Generally final pathology reports after the resection of the tumor will give the definitive diagnosis. For the accurate diagnosis of the pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas， both pathologists and the clinicians must communicate properly. The importance of this multidisciplinary approach has been popularized in recent studies. Also an algorithm has been designed for the diagnosis of these cases. The paragangliomas can rarely be diagnosed by the radiologic investigations and even diagnosis is difficult after the FNAB of the nodule . They can be easily be confused with the other thyroid malignancies.\n\n【25】The diagnose frequently cannot be made during the surgery with frozen sections and the differential diagnosis includes primarily the medullary thyroid cancer and the other types of thyroid cancers. Only 1 of the frozen sections performed in 22 patients made the paraganglioma diagnosis. In 10 of these cases diagnosis of medullary thyroid carcinoma and in 3 of the cases follicular carcinoma diagnosis were made by the frozen section .\n\n【26】The immunohistochemical stains applied has a major role in the differential diagnosis . The Chromogranin A， NSE， Synaptophysin and S-100 will demonstrate the staining around the Sustantacular cells. The S-100 staining however is not to specific for the paragangliomas. It can be seen in the Medullary Thyroid Cancer (MTC) too. Thus makes the diagnosis complex . In this case， paraganglioma presented as a mass located within the thyroid gland. When present in such location， the main differential diagnosis was MTC. On histologic examination， TP and MTC may show similar microscopic features， with nesting. The co-expression of neuroendocrine markers makes the distinction far more complicated. MTC originates in the parafollicular C cells of the thyroid gland. Therefore， MTC is characterized by positive staining with Calcitonin. The positivity of epithelial markers and lack of S-100 positive sustantecular cells also facilitate the differential diagnosis .\n\n【27】They have a high tendency to invade (in two out of three cases) adjacent structures like； trachea， recurrent nerves and vascular structures. The extensive resection is generally enough for the treatment of these patients . The tumor was strictly attached to the tracheal cartilages but any tracheal resection was not performed in our patient.\n\n【28】The genetic mutations are reported in about %10 of the paragangliomas. It is recommended to screen the patients for the succinate dehydrogenase B (SDHB)， C(SDHC)，D (SDHD) or SDH assembly factor 2 (SDHAF2) gene mutations. Especially it is known that the SDHB mutation is important in diagnosing the malignant paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma . We did not perform a genetic screening.\n\n【29】In the literature there is no reported case of metastatic or catecholamine producing thyroid paraganglioma . But still it is advised to follow up those patients for the risk of metastasis and catecholamine production . Screening of the patient 29 months after the surgerywas performed and no metastasis or local recurrences were seen in the ultrasound and PET scan (F-18FDG). Serum and 24hours urine tests were normal for the catecholamine and degradation products.\n\n【30】Conclusion\n\n【31】TP must be consideredin differential diagnosis of the neuroendocrine tumors of the thyroid. FNAB is helpful but not always diagnostic for a neuroendocrine tumor. Generally they are local invasive to the adjacent structures. Extensive resection and close follow up is the treatment of choice because their malignancypotential is still not exactly known.

It is subdivided into primary and secondary， which is a manifestation of other underlying pathologies or stressors such as result of an imbalance between vasoconstriction and vasodilation. In most cases， conservative medical treatment gets good control in most cases. Thoracic sympathectomy is indicated as the last therapeutic option in refractory cases. We report a case of a 58-year-old male with digital ulcers on the left hand due to Raynaud's syndrome resistant to conservative treatment who underwent thoracic sympathectomy.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】We present the case of a 58-year-old male， smoker， with arterial hypertension and systemic sclerosis. VATS sympathectomy is indicated for secondary Raynaud's syndrome with digital ulcers on the left hand resistant to conservative treatment. We have your consent for the publication of the data. After basic monitoring， to which thermal monitoring was added in the second finger of both hands， intravenous anesthetic induction was performed with propofol 170 mg， fentanyl150 ug， and rocuronium 60 mg. A 37 Fr left double-lumen tube is inserted to use right one-lung ventilation. The patient is placed in the semi-Fowler's position with the upper limbs abducted at 90°. Anesthetic maintenance is performed with propofol 6 mg/kg/h and fentanyl 150 ug. It is accessed through a miniport in the fourth left intercostal space， the sympathetic chain is identified and it is sectioned at the level of T3. At that time， an increase in skin temperature of 1.3C was observed in the left hand (usually increasing by 1·C to 3·C)， with no changes in the right hand. Once the efficacy of the procedure had been verified， thirty minutes before surgical closure， dexamethasone 8 mg paracetamol 1 g， dexketoprofen 50 mg， and ondansetron 4 mg were administered. After reversal of the muscle block with sugammadex 150 mg， and once he regained consciousness， he was extubated and transferred to the post-anesthetic recovery unit. No perioperative incidents were recorded. The sequence of the procedure is represented in Figure 1.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery of the thoracic sympathetic nervous system is a minimally invasive technique that has shown good therapeutic results with less morbidity than more aggressive techniques. Although it has been studied mainly in primary hyperhidrosis， it has also been used in Raynaud's syndrome， facial flushing， and abdominal pain due to chronic pancreatitis， reflex sympathetic dystrophy or anginal syndromes. For Raynaud's syndrome， the scarce published literature defends its use as a last resort for refractory cases ， offering an effective and safe treatment with favorable cosmetic results， reduced hospitalization and minimal postoperative pain. Sympathetic denervation causes long-term effects on lung function， cardiac function， skin coloration， and psychological status. Theyhighlight a decrease in the forced vital capacity， the forced expiratory volume in the first second and the maximum mid-expiratory flow， a mild obstructive pattern， an increase in bronchial hyperreactivity and a decrease in the mean heart rate； all of them without clinical significance at the moment.

We evaluated the value of Platelet-to-Portal vein Width Ratio (PPR) and Platelet-to-Spleen Thickness Ratio (PSR) to predict advanced liver fibrosis among patients with HBV infection with HBV e Antigen (HBeAg)-negativity and a normal ALT level.\n\n【2】Design and Methods： HBV surface Antigen (HBsAg) -positive and HBeAg-negative individuals with a normal ALT level was enrolled. The inflammation Grade (G) and fibrosis Stage (S) were analyzed according to pathological features. Two groups (<S2 vs. ≥S2) were divided based on the pathological diagnosis， and the clinical characteristics were summarized.\n\n【3】Results： 73 individuals among 142 patients had a normal ALT. 83.56% (61/73) individual's showed advanced liver fibrosis (e S2).

The PPR and PSR decreased gradualy upon fibrosis aggravation (p<0.05).\n\n【4】Conclusion： The PPR and PSR can be employed to assess fibrosis progression among patients with HBV infection with HBeAg-negativity and a normal ALT.\n\n【5】Keywords： Fibrosis stage； Hepatitis B virus； Normal ALT； Platelet-to-portal vein width ratio； Platelet-to-spleen thickness ratio\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】The natural history of Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection can be divided into four stages：Immune tolerance， immune clearance， inactive carrier status， and reactivity .“Immune tolerance”refers to the non-responsive state after the immune system of the body meets a specific antigen . Previously， it was believed that most patients with chronic HBV infection were in the “Immune Tolerance Period\"(ITP) . Patients in the ITP have slight inflammatory necrosis and/or liver fibrosis， and a poor response to antiviral therapy. Simultaneously， spontaneous HBV e Antigen (HBeAg) serological conversion and sustained remission are possible during the ITP. Otherwise，long-term antiviral therapy in the ITP can lead to drug resistance and other adverse events， and even increase the economic burden of patients. Therefore， most patients with immune tolerance of chronic HBV infection do not need antiviral therapy . There is a lack of sensitive and specific markers to measure the immune tolerance of patients after HBV infection. However， in the definition of the ITP of HBV infection by various hepatology societies， a continuously normal level of Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) is regarded as a basic characteristic . However， there is also evidence that significant fibrosis occurs in a large proportion of HBV-infected patients with a normal ALT level who are considered immune-tolerant . Hepatocellular carcinoma has been found in some patients in the ITP . Liver histopathology of HBV-infected people with a normal ALT level indicates that about one-third to one-half of cases are not in the ITP . Therefore， clinicians must judge if patients with chronic HBV infection and a normal ALT level are in the ITP. Liver biopsy is the “gold standard”for determining if the liver has inflammations and fibrosis. However， ascertaining if a patient has liver inflammation by liver biopsy impractical is important because it is invasive. Accurate assessment of the degree of liver fibrosis in patients with a normal ALT level in a non-invasive manner is crucial to ascertain if patients are immune-tolerant. We investigated the basic clinical and laboratory characteristics of advanced liver fibrosis among patients with HBV infection who were HBeAg-negative and had a normal ALT level.\n\n【8】Patients and Methods\n\n【9】Ethical approval of the study protocol\n\n【10】The study protocol was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Fuling Center Hospital of Chongqing City (Chongqing， China). Written informed consent was obtained from patients (or their legal surrogates) before data collection.\n\n【11】Inclusion criteria\n\n【12】The inclusion criteria were： (i) Serum Hepatitis B surface Antigen(HBsAg)-positivity for ≥ 6 months； (ii) serum HBeAg-negativity； (iii) never treated with antiviral agents.\n\n【13】Exclusion criteria\n\n【14】The exclusion criteria were： (i) Infection with hepatitis A， C， D， E or other viruses； (ii) history of alcohol and/or drug intake that caused liver damage； (iii) nonalcoholic fatty liver disease； (iv) space-occupying lesion in the liver； (v) history of hereditary metabolic liver disease or autoimmune liver disease； (vi) history of hypertension， diabetes mellitus， coronary heart disease， or metabolic syndrome；(vii) history of traumatic fractures.\n\n【15】Study design\n\n【16】A total of 165 patients who underwent liver biopsy for assessment of disease progression from July 2019 to June 2021 at Fuling Center Hospital of Chongqing City were evaluated . Twenty-three patients were excluded. Hence， 142 patients with HBV infection with HBsAg-positivity and HBeAg-negativity were enrolled. Of these， 73patientshad a normal ALT level (defined as ALT<40 U/L). All patients underwent ultrasound-guided percutaneous liver biopsy followed by calculation of the METAVIR score to assess the inflammation grade and fibrosis stage. Then， patients were divided into two groups：advanced fibrosis (stage ≥2) and non-progressive fibrosis (stage <2).\n\n【17】The clinical andlaboratory data of all patients were collected upon hospital admission. These data comprised： Age； platelet count； serum levels of ALT， Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)， albumin， globulin， and Albumin/Globulin (A/G) ratio； Portal Vein Width (PVW)；spleen thickness. Serum levels of HBeAg or HBsAg were quantified using a standardized electro-chemiluminescent immunoassay (Architect~HBeAg； Abbott， Chicago， IL， USA) with a limit of detection of 1 S/CO. HBV DNA was measured using COBAS TaqMan v2.0 (limit of detection =20 IU/mL； Roche， Basel， Switzerland). Laboratory tests were done upon admission to Fuling Center Hospital of Chongqing City.\n\n【18】Liver histology\n\n【19】Ultrasound-guided percutaneous liver puncture wascarried out. Then， hematoxylin and eosin-stained liver biopsies were tested by two specialist pathologists in a blinded manner. Inflammation grade ≥2 was considered“moderate/severe necroinflammation\"，and fibrosis stage ≥2 was regarded as “advanced fibrosis\"according to the METAVIR scoring .\n\n【20】Statistical analyses\n\n【21】SPSS 22.0 (IBM， Armonk， NY， USA) was used for statistical analyses. Continuous variables (presented as frequencies and percentages or the mean ± SD) were compared using the Student's t-test or non-parametric Mann-Whitney U-test. Categorical data were analyzed with the chi-squared test and Fisher's exact test. Receiver-Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were generated and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was calculated and compared. Logistic regression was employed to consider the cutoff value. Optimal cutoff values were selected to maximize specificity and sensitivity. P<0.05was considered significant.\n\n【22】Results\n\n【23】Patient characteristics\n\n【24】Twenty-three patients ofthe 165 patients were excluded (infection with the hepatitis C virus (seven patients)； space-occupying lesion in the liver (five)； autoimmune liver disease (five)； genetic metabolic liver disease (two)； alcoholic liver disease (two)； nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (two). Thus， 142 patients were enrolled in this study， and73 individuals had a normal ALT level .\n\n【25】Inflammation grade and fibrosis stage\n\n【26】Of 142 patients， the number with an inflammation grade of 0， 1，2，3， and 4 was 0， 16，100， 23， and 3， respectively . For patients with inflammation grade 0，1，2，3 and 4， the percentage with a fibrosis stage ≥2 was 0%，18.75%，93%，100%， and 100%， respectively.

The corresponding sensitivity and specificity of the PPR were 0.917 and 0.525，and those of the PSR were0.833 and 0.541， respectively .\n\n【46】Discussion\n\n【47】Approximately 257 million people are infected by the HBV worldwide . Recent studies have shown that ~19% of people infected with the HBV require antiviral treatment . For chronic HBV infection， antiviral therapy can prevent the progression of fibrosis， cirrhosis， and cancer of the liver， and reduce the mortality associated withliver disease. Hence，antiviraltherapy is crucial . The serum level of ALT reflects the host immunity to viral challenge， and is one of the most sensitive biomarkers for liver inflammation. Therefore， an increase in the serum level of ALT is a good indication of hepatic necroinflammation， and one of the parameters for determining initiation of antiviral therapy . However， in real-world clinical practice， the ALT level is not completely consistent with the degree of liver inflammation. Inflammation and fibrosis as judged by histology has been documented in people with a HBV infection and a normal level of ALT . We found that 83.80%(119/142) of individuals with an HBV infection had advanced fibrosis. Simultaneously，83.56%(61/73) of patients with a normal ALT level had advanced fibrosis (fibrosis stage ≥2). ALT is a marker of liver dysfunction. In China， about 62.4% of HBV-infected patients have a normal ALT level， and these patients are often mistaken for having immune tolerance. Changes in the ALT level are not always consistent with the degree of inflammation of liver tissue. Hence， errors may arise in judging if patients need antiviral therapy based on the ALT level. Therefore， a normal ALT level cannot be used to ascertain if patients need treatment. Liver biopsy is the gold standard to assess fibrosis/cirrhosis in HBV patients objectively . Antiviral therapy should be applied to HBV patients with a Knodell Histology Activity Index 2 4 or moderate/severe necroinflammation and/or fibrosis with a normal ALT level . We observed that， in HBV-infected patients with a normal ALT level， the progression of inflammation and fibrosis could not be determined by hepatic biochemical indices(ALT， AST， albumin， globulin， A/G ratio)， imaging (PVW， spleen thickness) and other characteristics (e.g.， age) alone. These data suggest that we should reconsider the guiding role of the ALT level for starting antiviral therapy in HBV patients. We also under took evaluation by non-invasive methods， such as the APRI and FIB-4Score. These are recommended by the World Health Organization as non-invasive evaluations of inflammation and fibrosis of the liver. However， these two indices are not applicable to HBV-infected patients with a normal ALTlevel. We noted a significant difference in the platelet count between patients with fibrosis stage <2 and patients with fibrosis stage 2 2. Hence， fibrosis progression in HBV-infected patients with a normal ALT level was inversely proportional to the number of platelets. Hence， although the ALT was normal in HBV-infected patients， inflammation and advanced fibrosis may be present in the liver. Patients with advanced liver fibrosis require antiviral therapy regardless of ALT status . Early antiviral therapy in these patients could also achieve a greater immune response . Our results suggest that HBV-infected patients with a normal ALT level may also have significant hepatic pathological changes and a high risk of liver cancer or death.\n\n【48】Thrombocytopenia has been observed in 76% to 85% of patients with advanced liver disease. Thrombocytopenia is secondary to hypersplenism， possible immune-mediated mechanisms， direct viral suppression of platelet production， and reduced production of thrombopoietin . Thrombocytopenia in individuals with chronic liver disease is associated with portal venous pressure and hypersplenism. The platelet number is influenced by many factors， whereas the portal-vein width and spleen thickness are mainly associated with portal hypertension during liver fibrosis/cirrhosis. We combined the platelet count with the portal-vein width and spleen thickness into the PPR and PSR. The PPR and PSR could be used to predict advanced fibrosis among HBV-infected patients with HBeAg-negativity and a normal ALT level. We calculated the sensitivity of the PPR and PSR to be 0.917 and 0.833， respectively， where as the specificity of the PPR and PSR was only 0.525 and 0.541， respectively. Such low specificity may be related to the many factors influencing thrombocytopenia， as well as having a small study cohort.\n\n【49】We demonstrated that patients with advanced fibrosis had a lower PPR and PSR. Further subgroup analysis showed that the PPR and PSR tended to decline gradually (but significantly) with fibrosis progression. Therefore， the PPR and PSR could reflect the stages of advanced fibrosis among HBV-infected patients with HBeAg-negativity and a normal ALT level. Using the PPR and PSR might provide better predictive accuracy than using the ALT level alone(especially for determining who needs a liver biopsy). Liver biopsy is invasive， so timely and accurate assessment of the need for early liver biopsy is extremely important to detect advanced liver fibrosis. Greater efforts should be made to explore more non-invasive methods to enable accurate judgment of disease progression for patients with a normal ALTlevel.\n\n【50】Conclusion\n\n【51】Our study revealed the value of using the PPR and PSR for predicting advanced fibrosis among patients with HBV infection with HBeAg-negativity and a normal ALT level. The PPR and PSR could help to screen patients who need a liver biopsy in a timely manner.\n\n【52】Limitations\n\n【53】Our study had three main limitations. First， the study cohort was small， which hampered the robustness of statistical analyses. The small sample size was because liver biopsy is invasive and many patients refuse it. Second， our cohort may be not representative of all HBV-infected patients. Third， we excluded HBeAg-positive patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:45:24", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:45:53", "cost": 29.833}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:46", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:45:53", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:45:23"}

As our knowledge is evolving， it is now believed that SARS-CoV-2 can affect any organ system including Gastrointestinal (GI) system. GI symptoms like anorexia， nausea， vomiting， and diarrhea are encountered in patients and these end up being more critical than expected in normal scenario.\n\n【2】Case Presentation： We report a case of 85 years old female， in post COVID-19 period， presented in emergency room with acute onset of pain abdomen and altered mental status with associated history of reduced oral intake for past 6 to 7 days. She was intubated and started on ventilator support secondary to severe respiratory acidosis and deteriorating sensorium. Cardboard rigidity was found during abdominal examination with absent bowel sounds， though family confirmed she was passing stool normally until the day before her presentation. CT chest revealed subcutaneous emphysema，pneumomediastinum and tensionpneumoperitoneum with both lungs having obvious post COVID-19pneumonia sequela. We managed her with intravenous fluid resuscitation， invasive ventilation， broad spectrum antibiotics and other supportive management. Surgery team managed her bowel perforation with bedside abdominal drain insertion in view of high risk for operation secondary to her co-morbid status. In spite of all efforts she died.\n\n【3】Discussion： We believed that our patient might had a complication of bowel perforation， most probably involving upper part of the gastrointestinal tract suggested by presence of subcutaneous emphysema in neck and pneumomediastinum， apart from tension pneumoperitoneum， as a post COVID-19 sequel. Apart from direct bowel wall inflammation by SARS-CoV-2，intestinal dysbiosis as well as immunological alteration in lung via gut-lung axis， local disseminated intravascular coagulation， vasculitis secondary to hypercoaguable state in COVID-19 infection， bowel edema leading to over distension of bowel all play important pathophysiology in bowel perforation， a possible fatal complication in COVID-19 patients， that physicians should be conversant of， especially in criticaly ill patients or with multiple comorbidity， as these patients may or may not present with gastrointestinal symptoms.\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】It is global corona virus pandemic and one with the highest number of registered cases and deaths worldwide. Current number of cases globally is approximately 86，210，710， number of deaths1，863，497，recovered.Novelcoronavirus disease is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) which belongs to the Coronaviridae families of viruses， further subdivided into Coronavirinae and Torovirinae subfamilies. Coronaviruses are large， enveloped， non-segmented， single-stranded， positive-sense RNA viruses about 26 kb to 32 kb in length . In India itself total number of case is more than 10，357，569，total number of case fatalities till date is 149，886 and counting.\n\n【6】They have mainly been identified in zoonotic hosts， that is， birds， camels， bats， masked palm civets， mice， dogs， and cats. It is believed that SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 originated from a zoonotic spill over， resulting in human infections and eventual human-to-human transmission through respiratory droplets which is found to be main mode of transmission of the virus . However， fecal-oral transmission due to the shedding of the virus in the Gastrointestinal (GI) tract may continue for up to 10 weeks after respiratory clearance and is fast becoming important. SARS-CoV-2 shows a high affinity to ACE2 receptors， making sites of high ACE2 receptor expression， such as lungs， GI tract， brain， kidneys， heart， liver and immune system， a prime target for infection. Clinical symptoms of the virus vary significantly over a wide spectrum ranging from mild fever， cough， dyspnea to respiratory failure and eventual death. Current literature focuses on the respiratory symptoms and respiratory acute complications mainly .\n\n【7】It's baleful effects on other organ systems is still evolving andvery little is known about complications occurring during the period of one to two months ofpost COVID-19 status，such as acute myocardial infarction， stroke， deep vein thrombosis and other thrombotic complications， gastrointestinal etc. We report a case of patient with SARS-CoV-2，treated for COVID-19 two months back and came to ER with the one of the dreaded complications of SARS-Cov-2， i.e. intestinal perforation that required emergency surgical intervention.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】An 85 year old female presented to our Emergency Room (ER) with complaint of acute onset of pain abdomen & altered mental status with the History of (H/O) reduced intake orally since 6 to 7days， not passed urine since last since last 6 h， had dry cough for a week. She had passed stool one day back， which was normal in consistency and was able to pass flatus.\n\n【10】She had no recent H/O of fever， shortness of breath， any recent episode of vomiting or diarrhea. Although she had H/O vomiting 2weeks back， only few episodes， persisted for a day. Her urine output was normal at home.\n\n【11】She was recently treated for COVID-19 pneumonia； Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome(ARDS) for which she was hospitalized for 23 days one month back prior to ER arrival. Initially she needed non invasive ventilator support for few days and treated with antiviral(Remdesivir)， Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH)， steroid， antibiotics and other supportive treatment. She was discharged home in stable condition.\n\n【12】Past history of operated brain tumor 1 year back， k/c/o hypertension， hypothyroidism. At the time of arrival patient's GCS was E3V1M4， Heart Rate (HR) 130/min， Spo，-86% on room air， Respiratory Rate (RR) was 44/min， Blood Pressure (BP) 100mmHg/60 mmHg. Due to low oxygen saturation patient was put on high flow oxygen， iv fluid started. In view of low GCS， arterial blood gas was sent which showed： Respiratory acidosis with type 2respiratory failure (pH-7.171， Po.6， PCo.9，HCO.7， and Lactate-1.13). Patient intubated and ventilated.\n\n【13】After ventilation BP dropped to 80 mmHg/50 mmHg， after fluid resuscitation patient as her blood pressure was not improved she was started on inotropic support. On examination： Chest： Bilateral (B/L) equal air entry with mild crepitation. Abdomen was distended， rigid and bowel sound was absent.Onper rectal examination： No impacted stool was noticed. There was no focal neurodeficit. X-ray abdomen showed large/tension pneumoperitoneum. Patient shifted to HRCT Chest in view of old COVID-19 pneumonia which showed CORADS III with gross pneumoperitoneum， mild left sided pneumothorax， pneumomediastinum， and subcutaneoussemphysema noticed involving bilateral deep neck spaces and chest wall. B/L lower lobe consolidation noticed with irregular septal thickening associated with traction bronchiectasis in both lungs， more marked in lower lobes， most likely sequel of COVID-19 pneumonia with fibrosis. Left sided small pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum were managed conservatively with low PEEP in invasive ventilation. Follow up chest X-rays did not show any significant increase in both. Laboratory investigations revealed both rapid antigen for COVID-19 and RT-PCR for COVID-19 nasopharyngeal swab both were negative on this admission， Hemoglobin- 10.7 gm/dl， total WBC-12，000/cumm， platelet Count-3，05，000/cumm， procalcitonin-0.335， ESR30， serum sodium-143.3 meg/Lt， serum potassium-5.32 meg/Lt，creatinine 0.84mg/dl.\n\n【14】Patient was diagnosed with intestinal perforation with huge/tension pneumoperitoneum and peritonitis in septic shock and Acute Renal Failure (AKI). General surgery team was involved and considering the age and co-morbid status of the patient bedside SU intra-abdominal drain was inserted as patient family was unwilling for high risk aggressive surgical laparotomy. In spite of all effort patient deteriorated and died on day 4 of admission. We believed that our patient might had a complication of bowel perforation， most probably involving upper part of the gastrointestinal tract suggested by presence of subcutaneous emphysema in neck and pneumomediastinum， apart from tension pneumoperitoneum， as a post COVID-19 sequel.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Besides common symptoms like cough and cold， shortness of breath， fever etc. some COVID-19 patients seem to experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea， nausea， vomiting， and anorexia. Digestive symptoms also found to be associated with COVID-19 disease severity. Among the overall population， diarrhea， nausea， vomiting， abdominal pain， and anorexia appeared in patients admitted into the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) more prominently than in those not transferred into the ICU .\n\n【17】Pathophysiology\n\n【18】Virus structure： SARS-CoV-2 is single-stranded RNA viruses characterized by two groups of proteins， structural proteins an nonstructural proteins. Structural proteins are Spike (S) proteins marking all coronaviruses and bind to receptors on the host cell， Nucleocapsid (N) that protects the genetic information of virus， Matrix (M)， and Envelope (E). Non-structural Proteins encoded by Replicase Complex， such as proteases (nsp3 and nsp5) and RdRp. This enzyme is an ideal target as it helps the virus to replicate. Each monomer of S protein contains two subunits： S1 and S2， which mediate attachment and membrane fusion via endocytosis. Priming and cleavage of CoV (S) proteins by one of several host proteases including furin， trypsin， cathepsins， Transmembrane Protease Serine Protease-2 & 4 (TMPRSS-2 & 4) are essential for viral entry into the cell .\n\n【19】Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 receptors (ACE-2)： Virus entry to the host cell requires recognition of ACE2 receptor by S1subunit of viral S protein followed by anchoring on viral membrane. S2 sub unit anchors the protein to the viral membrane and facilitates viral fusion. After completion of endocytosis， virus takes over the cellular machinery to produce viral proteins and viral RNA， which then assembles intra cellularly followed by secretion， release of cytokines then lead to various symptoms .\n\n【20】High ACE2 receptor expression is observed in ciliated， goblet and surfactant-producing type 2 alveolar cells， thereby providing a portal of entry of the virus into the body. High ACE2 expression is also observed on the intestinal epithelium (gastric， duodenal， and rectal epithelia) and cardiac and vascular endothelium， offering an explanation to the complication of COVID-19 in these organ systems. It has now been established that SARS-CoV-2 can still be shed through the GI tract even after the resolution of pulmonary symptoms， may continue up to 10 weeks after initial symptoms， making fecal-oral route an important mechanism of transmission of the virus.\n\n【21】Intestinal and lung microbiome in COVID 19： The diverse microbiota colonizes the human GI tract plays pivotal role in nutritional metabolism， development and maturation of immune system， and antibacterial effects. This can be altered during SARS-COV-2 infection leading to dysbiosis. Compared to healthy controls， COVID-19 patients had significantly reduced bacterial diversity， a significantly higher relative abundance of opportunistic pathogens (Streptococcus， Rothia， Veillonella and Actinomyces)， and a lower relative abundance of beneficial symbionts .\n\n【22】Emerging experimental and epidemiological evidences indicated the crucial immunological relationship between the intestinal microbiota and the lungs which was termed ‘gut-lung axis. The SARS-CoV-2 virus itself may cause disorders of the intestinal flora， which could result in digestive symptoms， could further in fluence the respiratory tract through the common mucosal immune system with the largest being the intestinal immune system.\n\n【23】Hypercoaguable state in COVID-19： Studies have stated that critically-ill patients with COVID-19 are more likely to have a hypercoagulable state. The coronavirus has an extensive tissue distribution， causing the release of a high number of pro inflammatory cytokines that damage the microvascular system， promoting abnormal activation of the coagulation system， which manifests itself as generalized small-vessel vasculitis and extensive microthrombi causing intravascular coagulation locally that may lead to intestinal mucosal necrosis， edema . Gartland et al. described catastrophic bowel necrosis in the setting of patent mesenteric vessels in 47 year COVID-19 positive patient.\n\n【24】Over distension of Bowel： DeNardi et al. reported a case of patient with colonic perforation presumed to be secondary to over-distension of bowel. Another hypothesis was an altered colonic motility due to an imbalance of the autonomic innervation of the colon. Since the neuroinvasive propensity has been demonstrated as a common feature of coronaviruses， a neuronal injury should be regarded as a possible pathogenic mechanism .\n\n【25】Conclusion\n\n【26】So far very little is known regarding surgical emergencies related to post COVID-19 infection. Intestinal perforation being reported only in few case reports only， by Aron Kangas-Dick et al.， Vishakha Kalikar et al.， De Nardi et al. Sergio Carlos NAHAS et. al. Apart from direct bowel wall inflammation by SARS-CoV-2， intestinal dysbiosis as well as immunological alteration in lung via gut-lung axis， local disseminated intravascular coagulation， vasculitis secondary to hypercoaguable state in COVID-19 infection， bowel edema leadingto over distension of bowl all play important pathophysiology in bowel perforation， a possible fatal complication in COVID-19 patients， that physicians should be conversant of， especially in critically ill patients or with multiple comorbidities， as these patients may or may not present with gastrointestinal symptoms. Additionally in India， use of high dose of corticosteroids in treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia is another important factor of consideration in bowel perforation. In our case report though the patient unfortunately died from tension pneumoperitoneum， we believe early recognition could still play an important role in patient's outcome. Patient’s age， gender， comorbidities， critically ill status are still to be evinced of having any correlation with bowel perforation as post COVID-19 complication.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:17:23", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:18:14", "cost": 51.968}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:46", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:18:15", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:17:23"}

Aberrant FAM83D expression was reported in multiple cancers. Here， we summarized the latest researches of FAM83D in recent five years， and discussed the relationship of FAM83D and cancer diagnosis， development and prognosis， aiming to provide new perspectives for the research of FAM83D in tumors.\n\n【2】Keywords： FAM83D；Malignant tumors； Tumor biomarkers\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】The FAM83D gene (Family with sequence similarity 83 member D)， also named as CHICA or C200rf129， is located on chromosome 20 . FAM83D is relative highly expressed during cell division，playing critical roles in mid-plate formation， regulatingthelocation ofhuman Chromokines in Kid to spindle during metaphase and sister chromatid separation . Loss of FAM83D leads to dysfunctional spindle， failure of chromatid separation and consequential generation of aneuploidy. Furthermore， researchers have found that FAM83D was co-expressed with many known mitosis-related factors， including Aurora-A， Aurora-B， Plk-1， Plk-4，Cdc20，Cdk1，Nek2， Geminin and CENP protein family， in types of cancers . FAM83D belongs to FAM83 protein family (FAM83A-H)， whose functions had long been elusive. The proteins in FAM83 family share a common Domain of Unknown Function 1669 (DUF1669)， which has weak homology to Phospholipase D . Phospholipase D has been widely investigated in cell proliferation and differentiation. Besides， database analysis showed that the expression level of FAM83D is negatively correlated with overall survival time in various types of cancers. Therefore， FAM83D is tightly related to cell division and may be correlated to cancer development. Here， we summarized the updated cancer-related studies of FAM83D and discuss the possibility of FAM83D as biomarker or target in cancer diagnosis or therapy.\n\n【5】FAM83D and Lung Cancer\n\n【6】Up to date， three independent researchers investigated the relationship of FAM83D expression and lung cancer development. First， through analysis of TCGA LUAD (Lung Adenocarcinoma) datasets， Shi R found that compared to adjacent normal tissues， LUAD tissues showed significant upregulation of FAM83D expression and higher FAM83D expression related to higher DNA ploidy， corresponding well to previous in vitro study that loss of FAM83D leads to aneuploidy. Besides， higher FAM83D expression was associated with shorter survival time. Finally， they performed in vitro assay and showed that FAM83D deficiency inhibited lung cancer cell lines A549 and H1299 proliferation and mobility . Similarly， Yin C found elevated FAM83D expression levels in high invasive Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) cell lines and in the distant metastasis of clinical samples. Interestingly， they illustrated that FAM83D promoted Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) in BEAS2B NSCLC cells but not in A549 and H1299 NSCLC cells， implying the discrepancy of FAM83D functions in different NSCLC cells. Additionally， they showed that FAM83D knockdown increases A549 and H1299 sensitivity to cisplatin in vitro and in vivo . The latest article concerning FAM83D and lung cancer found that circFOXM1 promote NSCLS development by sponging miR-614， and FAM83D was one of the targets of miR-614. Consequently， they conclude that circFOXM1/miR-614/FAM83D axis may regulate lung cancer diagnosis and prognosis in clinic and cell proliferation and progression in vitro and in vivo .\n\n【7】FAM83D and Digestive System Cancer\n\n【8】In total， four independent researches concerned the relationship of FAM83D and liver cancer.\n\n【9】Table 1： Summary of the rale of FAM83D in cancers.\n\n| Cancer type  | No. of literaturereported  | In vitro  | In vivo  | Pathway regulated  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Lung  | 3  | OE： promote growth， mobilityKD： increase sensitivity to cisplatin  | Higher expression in cancer tissues and relatec to shorter OS.  | influencing CCND1，CCNE1 expression  |\n| Liver  | 4  | OE： promotes growth， colonytormation.

Soon afterwards， Lin B got the similar results by analyzing 150 clinic samples collected between 2006 and 2013 . Additionally， they found better outcomes of patients with lower FAM83D after liver transplantation. More recently， another research confirmed the role of FAM83D through analysis of TCGA and GEO  datasets， demonstrating that compared to adjacent normal tissues， liver tumors exhibited higher FAM83D expression， and the higher FAM83D levels implied worse DFS and OS， higher recurrence rate and mortality and more advanced AJCC stages . Their results indicated that FAM83D may serve as one independent marker for liver cancer progression diagnosis and survival times . In vitro， Wang D. et al compared 30 liver cancer samples and corresponding adjacent normal tissues and found no differences in expression levels of FAM83A， FAM83B and FAM83C except for FAM83D. Besides， FAM83D levels were elevated in most liver cancer cell lines compared to normal liver cells. Moreover， FAM83D over expression promoted proliferation and colony formation of Hep3B and Focus cell， while FAM83D knockdown inhibited that of SK-hep-1 and YY-8103 cells. Lin B reported FAM83D deficiency inhibited liver cancer stem cell growth and self-renewal in vitro， as well as tumor growth and tumor metastasis in mice . As to pancreatic cancer， only one literature stated that FAM83D levels were up-regulated in Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) no matter in TCGA datasets or in collected clinical samples， and related to poor prognosis. Meanwhile， in vitro assay showed that FAM83D knockdown inhibited the growth and increased the gemcitabine sensitivity of PDAC cells BxPC3 and SW1990 . Apart from digestive glands， FAM83D were also related to digestive tracts cancer development. Firstly， one group described FAM83D and esophageal cancer， revealing higher FAM83D expression in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC) tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues and tightly correlated to poorer clinical outcomes. Furthermore， FAM83D deficiency inhibited ESCC cells ECA109 and KYSE30 growth and increased their radiosensitivity in vitro and in vivo . Secondly， two articles reported FAM83D expression is positively related to Gastric Cancer (GC) cells HS-746T， AGS and SGC-7901 growth， invasion and migration in vitro and in vivo. Besides， clinical samples and database analysis showed that FAM83D upregulation was observed in GC tissues and celllines， and implicated poor prognosis of GC patients . Thirdly， two groups studied the role of FAM83D in Colorectal Cancer (CRC). One reported that FAM83D over expression may promote HCT-15 and HT-29 cells proliferation and invasion in vitro . The other study found that FAM83D levels are upregulated in clinical CRC samples and in CRC cells lines. Besides， FAM83D knockdown inhibited proliferation， colony formation， migration and invasion of HCT116and SW480 CRC cells .\n\n【12】FAM83D and Female Reproductive System Cancer\n\n【13】In the year of 2019， two groups conducted the research about FAM83D and ovarian cancer. Both groups reported higher FAM83D levels in cancer tissues than normal tissues. Besides， patients with higher FAM83D levels exhibited shorter OS and DFS times and more advanced stages. One of the researches proposed that FAM83D may serve as an effective marker to distinguish low malignant potential tumor from invasive epithelial ovarian cancer. Like in other cancer types， FAM83D over expression promoted growth， migration and invasion of ovarian cells in vitro . Similar to ovarian cancer， two groups researches indicated that FAM83D is one ofthe genes that up-regulated in Endometrial Cancer (EC)， and higher expression was related to more advanced stages. It is worth to note that they showed that FAM83D levels in patients’blood would be a efficacious marker to predict the EC prognosis . Through database mining， four studies dig out the correlation between the expression of FAM83D and breast cancer. Zhai X reported that FAM83D expression was negatively associated with the recurrence-free survival in Triplet-\n\n【14】Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) samples by analyzing GSE45827， GSE38959， GSE65194 datasets from GEO， while another research found FAM83D was associated with poor relapse-free survival and OS of Luminal A type of breast cancers by analyzing dataset GDS2250 . Furthermore， RNA-seq data from GEO showed that FAM83D was one of the most highly regulated genes in TNBC. Additional two studies reported that FAM83D was upregulated in breast cancer tissues and related to poor DFS regardless of breast cancer classification . Besides， in vitro assays showed that FAM83D over expression promoted human mammary epithelial cell (HMEC and MCF10A) transformation， migration， invasion and Anchorage-Independent Growth (AIG) . One the other hand，knockdown of FAM83D in breast cancer MDA468 and BT549cells dramatically inhibited cell growth and invasion .\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】Above， we summarized the role of FAM83D in multiple types of cancers with clinical data and laboratory in vivo and in vitro research data. To get one step further， we compressed all the key information in one table . In the table， we involved the reported cellular pathways that FAM83D may regulate in cancer cells. Collectively， up to date， FAM83D has been reported critical roles to cell proliferation， migration and invasion in nine types of cancers. Through high throughput screenings and validations， the downstream regulating factors/pathways of FAM83D have been identified. Meanwhile， several studies indicated upstream factors that may regulate human FAM83D expression， including circFOXM1/miR-614 axis， miRNA-495 and promoter methylations. However， we found no relationship between promoter methylation status and FAM83D expression levels in mice tissues during development， implying different regulating mechanisms in different physiological or pathological conditions. As one protein that tightly related to mitosis and had highly correlational expressions with CYCLINB1， FAM83D was intensively investigated these years for its mechanisms in regulating cellular behavior. Prospectively， FAM83D may serve as one effective biomarker for cancer diagnosis or prognosis. Furthermore， given that FAM83D deficiency inhibited proliferations and migrations of in many types of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo， it has the potential to be one promising target for cancer therapy. Further studies of FAM83D may focus on three aspects： 1) how it regulates cell division or chromatin separation；2) how it regulates downstream factors or cellular pathways and what is its biochemical features. 3) More retrospective and prospective clinical study to validate its role as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis and its mutations landscape in cancer cases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:46:44", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:46:58", "cost": 14.115}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:46", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:46:58", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:46:43"}

Risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma include chronic sun exposure， advanced age， skin sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation， and immunosuppression. In Europe， the age-standardized incidence is 9 to 96 per 100，000 men and 5 to 68 per 100，000women . The global risk of metastasis due to SCC is between 2% and 6%. Although surgery represents the treatment of choice， radiotherapy has been positioned in the first line in those patients with rejection of surgery. Currently in this type of pathologies， chemotherapy is positioned in a second line， after relapse. On the other hand， advanced tumors at some sites respond better to concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy than to radiation therapy alone. The goal is the potential clinical effect to prolong the duration of the response . On the other hand， the immune system plays a fundamental role in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Inhibitors of the programmed cell death checkpoint (PD-1)are ofinterest， since the expression of the corresponding PD-L1 ligand is associated with regional recurrence and lymph node metastases. Cemiplimab is human recombinant monoclonal antibody that acts by blocking the interaction between PD-1 and its ligand. Neoplastic cells express the PD-1 and PD-2ligand，which， when interacting with the PD1receptor on T lymphocytes， inhibit the immune response. This drug prevents the inhibition of T lymphocytes by tumor cells； therefore it favors the activation of the immune system. We present a diagnosed case of advanced cutaneous squamous carcinoma， who was treated with cemiplimab with surprisingly successful results . In December 2018， an 80-year-old patient came to the oncology consultation due to the presence of an ovoid skin piece measuring 3.7 cm x3 cm， which presented on the surface a raised and ulcerated lesion on the scalp， grayish， keratotic and indurated， with a length of 2.4 cm in maximum diameter. A Computerized axial Tomography (CT) is requested to see the infiltration， and a biopsy is taken for pathological anatomy. He was diagnosed with poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (g3)， ulcerated， infiltrating with a penetration depth of 7 mm. The results of complementary immunohistochemical studies were： -CAMP 5.2， CK20， Synaptophysin and CD56： Positive； while CK7 and TTF1： Negative. As an action plan， the oncology committee decides on surgery by exeresis of the tumor area with subsequent application of radiotherapy (50 Gray for 5 weeks). In December 2019， after a progression-free interval of one year， the review CT revealed new hypermetabolic foci located in： in the right parietal region ofthe scalp， a hypermetabolic mass SUV 8.16 and right laterocervical adenopathy level II-B SUV 5.79. When considering disease progression， the possibility of referring the patient to the Palliative Unit is raised in the specialist committee. Finally， it was decided to start immunotherapy with an anti-PD1 drug， cemiplimab with the standard regimen of 350 mg every 21 days. From the second cycle a partial response is observed and after the fourth a total response of the affected area. After 22 cvcles of cemiplimab， the patient continues in full response with very good tolerance. One of the hypotheses raised in light of the great response of this patient to immunotherapy is that some cancers with a high tumor rate， as in this case， have been associated with a higher response rate to anti-PD-1therapy. Although this may vary depending on the type of cancer， we can predict that in cutaneous squamous carcinoma there is some correlation between the mutational burden of the tumor and the response to immunotherapy . To conclude， cemiplimab may be a good option for patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma， as it is a pathology as well as a limitation of treatments and whose outcome is the referral of the patient to the Palliative Unit Service. Although it is not clear how long treatment should be continued， recent recommendations suggest maintaining therapy until progression or unacceptable toxicity.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:28:42", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:29:39", "cost": 56.253}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:46", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:29:39", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:28:42"}

Paraneoplastic disease with central nervous system involvement is a rare complication. Immunosuppression for the paraneoplastic features and chemotherapy for the underlying malignancy are described treatments but benefits are often short-lived because of co-morbid complications and disease resistance. This report describes a case of relapsed MCL with a rapidly progressing， motor-dominant，paraneoplastic polyneuropathy treated with immunosuppression and ibrutinib， an inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase. Ibrutinib was well tolerated and led to a partial remission comparable in duration with that achieved by more toxic chemotherapeutic regimens， which are often difficult to deliver in this context. Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes are rare but recognized complications of mantle cell lymphoma which are important to diagnose because treating the underlying disease is an essential component of therapy. This report demonstrates that ibrutinib is a safe and effective therapeutic option.\n\n【2】Keywords： Ibrutinib； Mantle cell lymphoma； Centralnervous system； Paraneoplastic syndrome； Anti-ganglioside antibodies\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)， genetically characterized by the t (11；14) chromosomal translocation resulting in over-expression of cyclin D and deregulation of the cell cycle. It accounts for 4-10% of NHL with a median age at diagnosis of 68 years and an approximate 2：1 propensity for older males . It often presents at a late stage and is generally regarded as incurable . Median overall survival varies from 2 to 12 years and depends on several factors， including patient fitness for intensive therapy and disease features， such as the presence of blastoid histology . Extra-nodal involvement is common： patients often present with blood， bone marrow and gastrointestinal infiltration .\n\n【5】Sensory， motor and autonomic neuropathies are a recognized complication of Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma through a variety of mechanisms： leptomeningeal and parenchymal infiltration of the nervous system； metabolic disturbance； infection； complications of therapy and paraneoplastic syndromes .\n\n【6】Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS) are probably caused by immune mechanisms directed against self-antigens normally present in the central nervous system being ectopically expressed by the tumour (onconeural antigens). By definition， PNS occur in the absence of metastasis to or infiltration of the nervous system； known indirect toxic effect； ectopic secretion of hormones or induced coagulopathies. The frequency of PNS is low， occurring in <1% of patients with solid tumours . They are rare in NHL but important to diagnose because treatment of the underlying tumour is an important initial step in their management .\n\n【7】There have been several reports ofparaneoplastic neuropathies associated with immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies against the disialosyl gangliosides， including CANOMAD syndrome (Chronic Ataxic Neuropathy， Opthalmoplegia， Monoclonal IgM protein， cold Agglutinins and Disialosyl antibodies) . They are usually treated with a combination of plasma exchange (PEX) and immunosuppression in the form of corticosteroids， intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) or rituximab.\n\n【8】This article describes a rapidly progressing， motor-dominant polyneuropathy with IgM anti-ganglioside antibodies associated with relapsing MCL and its successful treatment with the Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor， ibrutinib.\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\n【10】A 59 year old Caucasian male with a history of MCL treated four years previously with cytarabine-based chemotherapy followed by a reduced intensity， sibling-donor allogeneic stem-cell transplant， presented to a late-effects clinic with a four week history of dizzy spells. There was no previous history of neurological disorders. Clinical examination was unremarkable. A full blood count revealed a mild lymphocytosis (5.1x109/L) with a population of blastoid lymphocytes on the blood smear. Immuno phenotyping of these cells demonstrated a MCL phenotype (CD5+； CD19+； CD79a+； FMC7+； CD20/22+； CD23-). Renal and liver biochemistry， including serum B12， folate and ferritin assays were normal. A diagnosis of relapsed MCL was made.\n\n【11】Over three weeks，progressive neurological deterioration occurred with ataxia， diplopia， symmetrical paraesthesia and weakness in the upper and lower limbs together with worsening pharyngeal dysphagia. Cranial nerve examination revealed globally reduced eye movements and a left VII lower motor neuron weakness. Fundoscopy was unremarkable. There was bilateral nystagmus and finger-nose ataxia. Power was reduced in a pyramidal distribution in the upper and lower limbs， tone was globally reduced. Reflexes and plantar responses were absent and sensation to light-touch and vibration was reduced in the limbs in a glove and stocking distribution to the level of the hips and shoulders. Cardio-respiratory examination was unremarkable and there was no clinical evidence oflymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly.\n\n【12】Contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CT) of the head， neck， thorax， abdomen and pelvis revealed low volume， mediastinal lymphadenopathy consistent with MCL. Magnetic-resonance imaging(MRI) with contrast of the brain and spinal cord demonstrated no focal parenchymal or leptomeningeallesion.\n\n【13】Examination ofccerebrospinalfluidd(CSF) revealedscant lymphoid cells with a mature T-cell immunophenotype (CD5positive； CD19， CD10， CD23 and FMC7 negative) but no malignant clonal population was detected. CSF protein was raised at 1.03g/L(0.45g/L) and glucose was normal at 3.7mM/L. Paired CSF and serum oligoclonal bands were identical. Nerve conduction and electromyographic (EMG) studies demonstrated severe， axonal， motor and sensory loss in the distal nerve segments of the limbs and active denervation and loss of motor units， consistent with a sensorimotor axonal neuropathy.\n\n【14】Other investigation revealed normal thyroid function， normal creatinine kinase and HbAlc levels. Anti-nuclear antibodies(ANA)， anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCA and cANCA)，HIV and syphilis serology were all negative. Serum immunoglobulins were unremarkable with no evidence of a monoclonal band. An extensive search for an infectious etiology was unproductive and there were no constitutional signs to support infection. Serum complement C3and C4 were within normal range. A bone marrow biopsy was not performed.\n\n【15】Serum antiganglioside antibodies were positive for GD1a， GD1b and GQ1b IgM (levels >1/1000 (normal =<1/500))； GM1， GM2， GD1a， GD1b，GQ1b IgG，IgM GMl and IgM GM2 were negative.\n\n【16】On the basis of these results， a diagnosis of relapsed MCL with a paraneoplastic， motor-dominant polyneuropathy due to anti-ganglioside，onconeural antibodies was made.\n\n【17】Results\n\n【18】Initially， the patient required intensive supportive care in bed， including physiotherapy and nutritional support via a nasogastric feeding tube. Treatment for relapsed MCL was commenced with ibrutinib (560mg q.d. given via a nasogastric tube). In addition， one pulse of intravenous methylprednisolone (100mg q.d. for three days) and one course of intravenous immunoglobulin (0.4g per kilogram per day for five days) were given. After an initial improvement in neurological function，Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus， which were undetected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) at presentation， reactivated and were treated successfully with rituximab (375mg/m2once weekly for four weeks by intravenous infusion) and intravenous ganciclovir.\n\n【19】Over several weeks， a global improvement in power was observed and the patient was discharged from hospital， walking with the aid of a stick. He achieved a partial remission with the use of single agent ibrutinib (560mg q.d.)， but after 4 months， developed a rapid neurological relapse with lymphocytosis and died shortly afterwards.\n\n【20】Discussion\n\n【21】In this case， the differential diagnoses included a paraneoplastic polyneuropathy secondary to MCL； leptomeningeal iinfiltration of MCL； a late infectious complication of allogeneic stem-cell transplantation and， given the presence of anti-ganglioside antibodies， CANOMAD syndrome. CANOMAD syndrome is a rare， immune-mediated， demyelinating poly neuropathy . The clinical features include a chronic or sub acute neuropathy with marked sensory ataxia and are flexia， typically with relatively preserved motor function. Occulo motor and bulbar motor palsies may also be present either as fixed or relapsing-remitting features . Electrophysiological and nerve conduction studies demonstrate demyelinating and axonal neuropathies and immunological assays almost always detect the presence of a paraprotein together with anti-GQ1b and anti-disialosyl antibodies . Inflammatory peripheral neuropathies， paraneoplastic neuropathies and chronic Miller-Fisher syndrome should be considered in the differential diagnosis as they may also feature demyelination due to an autoimmune or paraneoplastic process. Treatment responses have been reported with the use of intravenous immunoglobulin， rituximab and plasma exchange in some cases although response duration is often brief.\n\n【22】Although， in this case， the positive GD1a， GD1b and GQ1b IgM assay together with ataxia and opthalmoplegia were consistent with CANOMAD syndrome， the balance of opinion was against this for several reasons. Firstly， the onset and progression were more acute than the classical， slowly progressing disorder with relapsing and remitting symptoms and a mean duration of 13 years. Secondly， a loss of motor function， not dyskinaesthesia， was the prominent clinical feature， which is not typical for CANOMAD. Finally， the lack of detectable paraprotein was also against the diagnosis.\n\n【23】Relapsed MCL with leptomeningeal infiltration was also a possible explanation. Central nervous system infiltration has a crude incidence of approximately 1% at diagnosis and 4 to 20% overall in MCL .Weakness， confusion， ocular disturbance andheadache are the most common presenting features and CSF cytology or flow cytometry are often but not always positive， even when specific radiographic lesions are present . Leptomeningeal disease(positive cytology with normal neuro-radiological imaging) is more frequent than parenchymal disease in MCL .Although CNS MCL was suspected in this case， it was not possible to prove this from CSF analysis or neuro-radiological imaging.\n\n【24】A late complication ofallogeneic transplantation such as infection were considered unlikely in the absence of a detectable infectious agent； a lack of constitutional upset and the patient's subsequent improvement with immunosuppression.\n\n【25】The most likely diagnosis wastherefore a paraneoplastic， motor-dominantpolyneuropathy due tO anti-ganglioside， onconeural antibodies associated with relapsed MCL. Previously described treatments for PNS， including plasma-exchange and immunosuppression， have historically yielded only short-lived responses . Furthermore， chemo-immunotherapy to treat the underlying malignancy is often difficult or inappropriate to deliver in this context because of co-existing morbidity or typically poor performance status .\n\n【26】In this case， although multiple immunomodulatory therapies， including rituximab， were initiated， an objective improvement was first observed on initiation of ibrutinib and before rituximab therapy.\n\n【27】Ibrutinib is an orally active， irreversible inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase， an intracellular protein downstream of the B cell receptor (BCR) responsible for regulation of cell-signalling， proliferation， migration and homing . It has been shown to have potent activity against a number of B-cell malignancies， particularly chronic lymphocytic leukaemia， Waldenstroms macroglobulinemia and MCL Ibrutinib is veryeffective and well tolerated in relapsed/refractory MCL with an overall response rate of 68% as a single agent . It has also been proven to penetrate the CNS at clinically effective levels using a standard therapeutic oral dose and recent studies have yielded encouraging results in the treatment of MCL with CNS relapse . The safety and efficacy of ibrutinib has not been previously evaluated in this context， although the suppression of onconeural antibody secretion by neoplastic B-lymphocytes is a plausible mechanism of action.\n\n【28】As this case demonstrates， ibrutinib is well tolerated， even in patients with significant co morbidities and can be administered via a feeding tube. It was therefore a rational choice of therapy in this case and led to remission duration comparable with more intensive therapies sometimes used in MCL with CNS involvement .\n\n【29】Conclusion\n\n【30】Paraneoplastic neurological disease is a rare complication of MCL and can be associated with anti-ganglioside antibodies as described in this case. Ibrutinib， in association with immunosuppressive therapy for paraneoplastic complications， is a safe and effective therapeutic option in the context of relapsed MCL with significant co-existing morbidities.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:47:06", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:47:22", "cost": 15.749}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:46", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:47:21", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:47:05"}

It is fatal by second or third day of life in most cases.\n\n【2】Keywords： Mermaid baby；Sirenomelia； Caudal regression syndrome\n\n【3】Case Presentation\n\n【4】A twenty two year old primigravida， at thirty four weeks gestation delivered a 1.7 kg baby by emergencylower segment cesarean section. Cesarean section was done in view of severe intrauterine growth retardation and severe oligohydramnios. There was no history of diabetes mellitus or gestational diabetes in the mother， no history of any chronic medical illness， any drug intake or consanguinity in mother and no history of any genetic disorder in family. Only one prenatal ultrasound was done in first trimester which was reported to be normal. Baby did not cry at birth and required resuscitation. APGAR score was 5， 7 and 7 at 1，5 and 10 minutes respectively. Baby had two umbilical arteries.\n\n【5】Baby was born with both lower extremities fused and two feet present distally . There were no genitalia or urethral opening. Only a tuft of hair was present at the genital area. An anal opening was present in which the nasogastric tube could be passed to a length of 3 cm， with no meconium staining. A sacral dimple was present 1.5cm above the anal opening. Dysmorphic facies were present in the form of dysplasia of the left mandible and dysplastic ears. There was no deformity in bilateral upper limbs. Abdomen and cardiovascular examination was normal. Within few minutes of birth the baby was put on mechanical ventilator due to respiratory failure. Baby succumbed at 12 hours of life and parents did not give consent for postmortem dissection .\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Sirenomelia， is a malformation disorder involving the caudal half of the body . Severe oligohydramnios leads to potter’s facies and pulmonary hypoplasia in majority of the babies making it a fatal condition with most of them are stillborn or die within first few hours of birth. Only four surviving cases are reported till date . It results from defective vascular supply to the lower extremities and genitals by descending aorta. The defect occurs in the gastrulation phase of the embryonic development which occurs around 3r week of intrauterine life.\n\n【8】Etiology of sirenomelia is uncertain， although maternal diabetes mellitus， genetic predisposition， environmental factors and single vitelline umbilical artery causing vascular steal phenomena are proposed to be some of the causative factors . It is considered as one of the most severe forms of the caudal regression syndromes specific to the babies born to mothers with diabetic mellitus. However in our case etiology is unclear as there is no associated maternal diabetes， neither there was single umbilical artery making vascular steal phenomena unlikely.\n\n【9】Managoli S et al.  reported an association of amniotic band disruption sequence and sirenomelia. Adhesions of amniotic bands had disrupted the fetal parts especially anteriorly in the midline， causing multiple anomalies (midline disruption andadhesion ofthelipsbyamniotic strings， a disrupted mandible， a bifid tongue， amputated fingers and toes， hands attached to each other and to the chest wall in the midline at the sternum， feet that were attached to the symphys is in the midline by bands， body wall defects . However no such features of amniotic band disruption were present in our case.Sirenomelia sequence is classified into three groups depending on the number of feet present. The most common of them is symelia apus， in which both legs are completely fused into a single lower extremity. In this condition both feet are either absent or rudimentary. Symelia unipus presents with one foot， two femora， tibiae and fibulae. Whereas in symelia dipus， two distinct feet are present but are malrotated and resemble fins， like in our case .\n\n【10】Lynch and Wright reported a case in which the mother was diabetic and the baby was born with sirenomelia with renal agenesis and an absent right radius. There was also a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and a bicuspid pulmonary valve . Perez-Aytes， et al.  reported an unusual case with partial fusion of lower limbs with absent feet with other features of caudal regression and a single aberrant umbilical artery .\n\n【11】Progressive oligohydramnios due to renal agenesis is the earliest sign of diagnosing this condition in the first trimester.

In this unusual case， abnormality of the cortisol axis was considered after finding a low level of the adrenal androgen precursor， dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate， during an infertility evaluation for anovulation. Low dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate proved secondary to decreased pituitary adrenocorticotropin hormone production from hypercortisolism associated with an adrenal adenoma. Although dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels naturally decline with aging， abnormally low levels should raise suspicion for Cushing’s syndrome.\n\n【2】Keywords： ： Cushing's syndrome； Infertility Oyulatory dysfunction： Amenorrhea； Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Given the low incidence of Cushing's disease and syndrome of 0.7 to 2.4 per million per year and the often non-specific and common symptoms of weight gain， menstrual abnormalities， hypertension， lethargy and mood disorders， this diagnosis is rarely initially considered. Many cases are not diagnosed until symptoms have progressed in severity such as muscle weakness with wasting of the limbs， facial rounding， frontal balding， osteoporosis， diabetes and easy bruising. The case described herein shows a very unusual situation where an abnormality of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis was considered due to a low level of the adrenal androgen precursor， Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate (DHEAS). This level was drawn for evaluation of infertility with an ovulation. This abnormal laboratory value leads to the diagnosis of Cushing’s syndrome secondary to an adrenal adenoma.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 41 year old G0 female with primary infertility revealed a history of irregular menses with subsequent amenorrhea for the last 4 months. She denied any vasomotor symptoms， galactorrhea or pelvic pain. She had not previously received fertility evaluation or treatment. Past medical history revealed no prescription drugs and no significant illnesses or surgeries. Social history and family history were unremarkable. Review of systems was pertinent for inability to lose weight， occasional irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea， menstrual migraine history and long-term history of dysthymia without current medical treatment. Physical examination showed blood pressure of 162systolic， 108 diastolic， body mass index of 28.19kg/m’and otherwise non-contributory. Laboratory testing showed anti-mullerian hormone 0.53 pmol/L (0.074 ng/mL)， follicle stimulating hormone8.7 IU/L，estradiol 168.88 pmol/L (46 pg/mL)， thyroid stimulating hormone 2.44 mIU/L， prolactin12.89 ug/L， DHEAS 0.081 umol/L (3 ug/dL； normal 35-430) and total testosterone <0.24 nmol/1 (7ng/dL). Due to verylow androgen and androgen precursor levels， additional testing of the pituitary-adrenal axis was performed including morning ACTH 0.44 pmol/L (2 pg/mL； normal 15-66)， cortisol 361.38 nmol/L (13.1 ug/dL； normal 5-25)， late afternoon cortisol 361.38 nmol/L (13.1ug/dL) and 24 h urinary free cortisol 193.2 nmol/d (70 ug/24 hr； normal 3.5-45). A 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test failed suppression with a cortisol level of 300.69 nmol/L (10.9ug/dL). A non-contrast CT of the abdomen showed a 3.9 cmx 2.6 cm mass of the left adrenal . A left adrenalectomy was performed with pathology showing an adrenal cortical adenoma. Follow-up laboratory testing showed normalization of cortisol levels.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Cushing’s syndrome， secondary to supraphysiologic levels of glucocorticoids， most commonly arises from ACTH producing pituitary tumors (Cushing’s disease) 80% of the time or from direct secretion of cortisol from adrenal tumors 20% of the time . The majority of adrenal tumors are unilateral with 80% benign and 20%malignant .\n\n【9】With an annual incidence of 0.2 to 5 per million people and a characteristic insidious onset of non-specific symptoms， evaluation for Cushing's is typically delayed . Diagnosis can be particularly challenging in cases with mild hypercortisolism and a subtle clinical presentation. Weight gain is the most common symptom in Cushing's syndrome and evidence of protein wasting， such as proximal weakness， thin skin and easy bruising， can most reliably distinguish Cushing's syndrome from other causes of weight gain. There is no single sign or symptom that is pathognomonic for Cushing's syndrome and clinical presentation is influenced by age， sex， severity and disease duration. The symptom complex includes hirsutism， acne， weight gain， hot flashes， hypertension， moon facies or buffalo hump， osteopenia， depression， emotional lability， menstrual abnormalities， decreased libido， glucose intolerance， dyslipidemia and decreased growth velocity in children . Diagnosing and treating Cushing's syndrome is critical given a two to three-fold increased risk of mortality with higher rates of venous thromboembolism， myocardial infarction and stroke . Appropriate screening tests for Cushing’s include 24-h Urinary Free Cortisol (UFC)， Late Night Salivary Cortisol (LNSC) and overnight Low-Dose (1 mg) Dexamethasone Suppression Test (LDDST). The UFC has an advantage of determining hypercortisolism irrespective of altered corticotropin-binding globulin levels as seen in pregnancy and with estrogen therapy. Disadvantages include inaccuracies from high fluid intake， incomplete urine collection and abnormal renal function LNSC detects loss of diurnal cortisol production seen in Cushing’s syndrome， differentiating from pseudo-Cushing's syndrome， associated with depression， malnutrition or alcohol dependence. However， LNSC is not reliable with tobacco abuse， critical illness or disturbed sleep patterns . A LDDST should normally suppress the morning cortisol to less than 50 nmol/liter(1.8ug/dL). Due to loss of feedback inhibition on the HPA axis， an elevated cortisol level suggests Cushing’s. The LDDST has decreased reliability in patients with malabsorption disorders， liver or kidney failure or patients taking medications that interfere with CYP3A4metabolism .\n\n【10】With positive screening tests， a morning ACTH level is used to differentiate between ACTH-dependent and ACTH-independent causes. High ACTH suggesting a pituitary secreting adenoma or ectopic ACTH production requires brain MRI， while low ACTH suggesting an adrenal tumor requires an abdominal CT scan. Elevated ACTH without radiographic evidence ofa pituitary adenoma requires additional testing. Noninvasive testing to help discriminate a pituitary source from ectopic source includes High Dose Dexamethasone Suppression Test (HDDST) and CRH (Corticotropin Releasing Hormone) stimulation. The former works on the principal that pituitary corticotroph lesions retain partial inhibition by high-dose glucocorticoids whereas ectopic tumors do not. Similarly， the CRH stimulation may help differentiate due to retained response in pituitary lesions， not seen in ectopic tumors. The gold-standard for diagnosis remains bilateral inferior petrosal sinus blood sampling. A adrenal adenama showing characteristic lipid filled cells. central to peripheral ACTH ratio of 2：1 prior to CRH administration or 3：1 after CRH administration has a sensitivity of approximately94% and a specificity >99% for a pituitary source .\n\n【11】In the case subject presenting with infertility， oligomenorrhea， inabilityto loseweight and dysthymia1。morecommor diagnoses of polycystic ovarian syndrome， hypothyroidism， and hyperprolactinemia would be considered. In addition， obesity and dysthymia most commonly lack a secondary cause. The finding of a very low DHEAS level led to the suspicion of ACTH suppression with Cushing’s syndrome resulting from an adrenal tumor. Although DHEAS is not a screening test for Cushing's，abnormal levels warrant further evaluation. In a study of 28 patients with Cushing's syndrome from an adrenocortical adenoma， 100% had abnormally low DHEAS levels. In contrast， 29% of 36 patients with Cushing's disease had abnormally high DHEAS levels .\n\n【12】Hypercortisolism1 contributestOinfertility via ovulatory dysfunction. In 45 premenopausal women with Cushing's syndrome，80% of patients had menstrual irregularities， 33% with amenorrhea and 31.1% with oligomenorrhea . The primary mechanism is cortisol-induced inhibition of Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone(GnRH) release from the hypothalamus and LH and FSH release from the pituitary . At the level of the gonads excess glucocorticoids can inhibit sex steroid hormone production and cell apoptosis. Examination of ovarian tissue in premenopausal patients with Cushing's syndrome has shown a trend towards reduced primordial follicles and fibrosis consistent with a mechanism of hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism . Decreased libido with Cushing's syndrome may also contribute to infertility .\n\n【13】With ACTH-dependent Cushing’s， adrenal androgen excess results in increased peripheral conversion to estrogens along with decreased hepatic production of Sex-Hormone Binding Globulin(SHBG) resulting in higher free estradiol levels， both yielding inappropriate feedback on the HPO axis .\n\n【14】Adrenocortical adenoma， seen in this patient， is the most common cause of ACTH-independent Cushings .\n\n【15】These tumors average 3.5 cm in size with a direct correlation of size and malignancy， while size does not correlate with hormone levels. Approximately 73% of cells within the adenoma are lipid-rich yielding lower attenuation on unenhanced CT compared to the spleen. Similarly， Chemical Shift Imaging (CSI) on MRI shows a relative signal loss compared to the spleen due to the lipid content. CT and MRI are the best imaging modalities， typically with the former preferred. Benign adenomas are characteristically round or oval with smooth walls and homogeneous interior. In contrast， adenocarcinomas are irregular in shape with heterogeneous interior often due to hemorrhage . In summary， this case of Cushing's syndrome found in a woman presenting for ovulatory dysfunction related infertility highlights the non-specific symptoms of the disorder along with the common finding of suppressed DHEAS. Very low DHEAS levels would be unisual in other causes of ovulatory dysfunction.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:13:04", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:13:18", "cost": 14.205}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:46", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:13:19", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:13:04"}

Some factors have been reported to be closely related to DPPB， including cardiovascular disease， hypertension， polyp size， and polyp location. Risk factors for DPPB have been widely investigated， but primary hyper fibrinolysis was overlooked. Here we reported a routine Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR) that resulted in long hospitalization and increased expenses. This report provides some clinical information and treatment options for some similar cases.\n\n【2】Keywords： Polypectomy； Delayed bleeding； Hyperfibrinolysis； Fg；Hg\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】DPPB is defined as bleeding that occurs between the end of the procedure and 30 days after polypectomy . Previous studies have shown that DPPB occurs in 0.3%~0.6% of polypectomies. However， in a prospective study including only patients who underwent polypectomy with EMR，the incidence of DPPB was as high as 3.4%. Most of the risk factors for DPPB are currently considered to be related to the patient， the polyp， and the surgeries . The case we reported is a patient with unexpected and recurrent hemorrhage caused by primary hyperfibrinolysis after polypectomy. There is no standardized management of DPPB. We aimed to investigate the diagnostic process and therapy of unexpected DPPB.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 64-year-old female underwent endoscopic colon polypectomy in our department on July30h， 2018， with normal preoperative blood routine test， hepatic and renal function and coagulation function. Her medical history includes tubal tuberculosis in her youth， which has been cured，and she denied any history of chronic illnesses such as liver disease， hypertension or diabetes. The polyp was located at the junction of the rectum and sigmoid colon， about 1.5 cmx1.2 cm， and no pedicle on the base. It was removed by standard Endoscopic Mucosal Resection (EMR) and then the wound was clamped with two hemostatic clips and no bleeding was observed . After 24 h of postoperative observation， the patient was discharged without abdominal pain or hematochezia. At noon on the day， the patient presented with bloody stools， dark red and approximately 50 ml， and again in the evening， and came to our emergency department. According to emergent colonoscopy，“The EMR wound was located 15 cm above the anal verge， two metal clips were in situ， and a small amount of oozing blood was seen on the surface and edge of the wound ， so another 3 hemostasia clips were placed. She was readmitted to the gastroenterology department after emergent endoscopic treatment. Nutritional and hemostasis support were given promptly， including Suling (Hemocoagulase Agkistrodon for Injection) and Tranexamic Acid (TXA)， and the Hemoglobin (Hb， 133 g/L) and Platelet (Plt) were normal on readmission. However， bleeding recurred with an obvious drop of Hb to 107 g/L. The re-examination showed that Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) were within the normal range， while Fibrinogen (Fg) was significantly reduced to only 0.3 g/L. The urgent supplementation of the thrombin complex was performed and then the bloody stools stopped. But 2~3 days later， the bloody stools reappeared and the Fg was lower than 1.0 g/L again.\n\n【7】The effect of human fibrinogen onlylasted a short period. With the decrease in Fg， the bloody stools recurred every 3 days or so . Further examinations of coagulation factor activity were normal， including protein C activity， protein S activity， antithrombin III activity， lupus anticoagulant， and three items of DIC (Thrombin Time (TT)， 3P test， and plasminogen activity determination). With the specialists of Hematology， Blood Transfusion， and Pharmacy， we finally considered that the bleeding was caused by primary hyperfibrinolysis and developed a replacement therapy of cryoprecipitate and human fibrinogen to maintain Fg level at 1.0 g/L ~ 2.0 g/L. Via a series of treatments， the hematochezia stopped and the patient was finally discharged after about 30-day hospitalization.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】It was a routine planned EMR procedure for this patient. The polyp was not very large and no bleeding occurred intraoperatively or 24 h postoperatively. There were no abnormalities in preoperative blood routine and coagulation function and the patient had no history of liver diseases， hypertension， diabetes， or hematologic diseases， and no history of taking special drugs， such as aspirin， Clopidogrel， Ibuprofen or Indomethacin (NSAIDs). It was obvious that the patient had a low risk of bleeding complications. But her recurrent hematochezia happened and treatment lasted for nearly a month after the polypectomy， therefore the cause of her bleeding and treatment are worthy of concern and discussion. DPPB is thought to be due to the sloughing of the eschar of the cautery-induced ulcer that exposes and injures the underlying vessel . We observed that the occurrence of her hematochezia was accompanied by an obvious decrease in Fg (0.29 g/L~1.01 g/L). Hypofibrinogenemia is diagnosed when the fibrinogen level drops below 1.5 g/L~2g/L(2.0g/L~ 4.0 g/L in the healthy non-pregnant adults) ， and fibrinogen replacement therapy should be implemented . When fibrinogen is less than 1.0 g /L， the patients may show signs of bleeding， severe visceral hemorrhage， and there is a high risk of death .\n\n【10】Hyperfibrinolysis is a state of increased clot resolution. From a clinical point of view， it has been classified into two forms： Primary(qualitative or quantitative abnormalities of proteins directly involved in the fibrinolytic process) and secondary (conditions of imbalanced excessive activation of the otherwise normal fibrinolytic system) . Primary hyperfibrinolysis is not associated with a hypercoagulable or prothrombotic state . The combined detection of fibrin degradation products and D-dimer can help to identify primary hyperfibrinolysis or secondary hyperfibrinolysis. Primary hyperfibrinolysis is divided into inherited， such as a2-plasmin inhibitor deficiency， PAI-1 deficiency， Quebec platelet syndrome， and acquired primary hyperfibrinolysis， such as chronic liver disease， acute promyelocytic leukemia， severe trauma， and post-partum hemorrhage， tumor， etc.\n\n【11】In our case， repeated examination of the Plt， PT， and APTT was within the normal range， DIC-related indexes were normal， and there were no clinical symptoms of DIC， so secondary hyperfibrinolysis could be ruled out. Chronic liver disease was also excluded based on her medical history and related examinations. No evidence of malignant tumors was found based on imaging and tumor markers performed during hospitalization. Therefore， her recurrent bleeding after the polypectomy was due to rare primary hyperfibrinolysis， and the specific cause for acquired primary hyperfibrinolysis is not clear.\n\n【12】Coagulation and fibrinolysis systems are highly regulated and interrelated mechanisms to ensure balanced hemostasis. Fibrinogen is converted into fibrin monomer during coagulation， and then a stable fibrin polymer is formed， which eventually binds to Plt and erythrocytes to provide structural integrity for the growing thrombus. Fibrinolysis is readily considered as two consecutive steps：(i) The generation of plasmin by plasminogen activators， and(ii) The digestion of fibrin by plasmin . The central event of hyperfibrinolysis is the generation of plasmin in the blood circulatory system. The presence of high activity of the plasmin causes a pathological degradation of fibrin and fibrinogen， which furtherleads to rapid clot breakdown with consequent bleeding. The hemostatic capacity of a patient depends on the stability in the processes of formation and degradation of a blood clot. The clot strength increases linearly with the concentration of fibrinogen. Low fibrinogen concentrations form weaker clots that are more susceptible to lysis. There may be a mechanism that prevents the patient from forming stable fibrin polymers on the wound surface， where Fg is continuously consumed and the bleeding cannot effectively stop. In this case， the pathology of the polyp was villous adenoma with mild to moderate atypical hyperplasia of glandular epithelium. Besides， the complexity of rectal blood supply and the variability of blood vessels are likely to be the underlying factors. Plasminogen Activator(PA) mainly comes from the uterus， adrenal， lymph node， prostate， thyroid and so on. This case suggests that hyperfibrinolysis can also occur in non-PA-enriched intestines， which is rare indeed. Primary hyperfibrinolysis is often caused by primary diseases or inducing factors， mainly treated with antifibrinolytics and supplementation of fibrinogen and cryoprecipitate.

Mortality rates are high despite thoracotomy and lobectomy，ranging from 15-20%. An alternative therapy is percutaneous tube drainage.\n\n【1】We present a summary of events in a case of complicated necrotizing pneumonia . Our patient is a 58-year-old female with past medical history significant for COPD， who initially presented with productive cough， fever， chills， and shortness of breath. Her vitals remained stable and physical exam was remarkable for dullness on percussion and decreased breath signs of the right upper lung fields. Chest X-ray showed right apical consolidation and follow up CT thorax showed large cavitary mass that involved the upper lobe of the right lung and the superior segment of the right lower lobe. Bronchoscopy with biopsy was consistent with necrotizing pneumonia and patient was treated with IV antibiotics. However her symptoms did not resolve and surgery was consulted. Patient got de-cortication of the right upper lobe. Nonetheless， surgical intervention did not help and she was readmitted. Compared with prior CT thorax， now there was a substantial complex fluid within the cavity， suspicious for a superimposed infection in the right apex . She was started on IV antibiotics again， but her symptoms persisted. Chest tube was placed with drainage of purulent discharge . The cultures grew pan-sensitive Klebsiella preumoniae， which was treated with antibiotics.

Klebsiella pneumoniae is a common cause of necrotizing pneumonia and is often complicated by lung abscess， which usually appears as cavities. One case series demonstrated multiple small cavities ranging from1 mm -3cm in 48% patients by CT thorax . The most feared complication is massive pulmonary gangrene， which could develop from lung abscess from Klebsiella pneumoniae， and it can destroy an entire section of a lung. Although pulmonary gangrene is a rare condition， but over one-half of cases are attributable to Klebsiella pneumonia . On imaging， pulmonary gangrene starts with lung consolidation， which then leads to multiple small cavities that coalesce into one large cavity. After a10-14-day period of conservative medical therapy without clinical improvement， percutaneous tube drainage should be considered.\n\n【3】Necrotizing pneumonia secondary to Klebsiella pneumonia could lead to fatal pulmonary gangrene.

Although the survival rate for EDT is generally low， there exist guidelines containing specific indications for its use in a subset of patients with penetrating traumatic injuries. Injury to the inferior vena cava and subsequent intra-abdominal exsanguination due to penetrating trauma is associated with a high mortality rate however the use of EDT for such injuries remains to be adequately investigated.\n\n【2】Objectives： To review the indications for and use of EDT， especially in relation to penetrating abdominal injuries， and to discuss the natural history and progression of injuries to the inferior vena cava.\n\n【3】Case Report： A 28-year-old male presented to the Emergency Department after sustaining a stab to the thoracoabdominal region. A focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) was positive for intra-abdominal free fluid. The patient was found to be persistently hypotensive despite aggressive fluid resuscitation and massive transfusion. An EDT was preformed for suspected intra-abdominal exsanguination and the patient was transferred to the operating room where he was treated for an extensive inferior vena cava laceration. After a complicated intensive care unit course， the patient ultimately survived with full preservation of neurologic function.\n\n【4】Conclusion： The use of EDT is associated with a low rate of survival in penetrating abdominal trauma but its appropriate and timely use by emergency physicians can be lifesaving\n\n【5】Keywords： Emergency department thoracotomy； Inferior vena cava injury； Penetrating trauma\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Penetrating trauma is a relatively infrequent presentation to the Emergency Department(ED) and those patients presenting with penetrating injuries requiring resuscitative emergency department thoracotomy (EDT) are evenless common . The American College of Surgeons (ACS) Committee on Trauma recommends that EDT be utilized for patients with penetrating cardiac， thoracic or abdominal injuries who experience traumatic arrest or unresponsive hypotension. This， however， must include observed or objectively measured signs of life upon arrival in the ED or short transport times . Despite current guidelines， a recent retrospective analysis completed at a Canadian level 1 trauma centre revealed that approximately one half of EDTs were completed for inappropriate indications .\n\n【8】While variations exist， the overall survival rates for EDT performed for penetrating and blunt trauma are 11% and 1.6%， respectively . The mechanism of injury， the location of the injury， and the presence or absence of signs of life on arrival to the hospital all determine and account for a wide range in survival . There is a paucity of evidence within the medical literature of patients surviving after EDT performed for massive abdominal hemorrhage  and even less evidence for patients surviving EDT for penetrating injuries to the inferior vena cava (IVC).\n\n【9】A 28 year-old male was transported to the ED via ambulance after sustaining a stab wound wwound.\n\n【10】to the anterior thoracoabdominal region. On arrival， the patient was responsive but lethargic， diaphoretic and had bowelevisceration from the wound site . His initial blood pressure (BP) was 74/47with a heart rate of 93 and an oxygen saturation of 93% on a 100%non-rebreather mask with a respiratoryrate of 24. The patient's airway was secured with endotracheal intubation. A focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) was positive for intra-peritoneal fluid within Morrison’s Pouch. The sub-xiphoid cardiac， spleno-renal and suprapubic view were negative for pericardial fluid and intra-peritoneal fluid， respectively. After the initiation of our massive transfusion protocol and receiving the first unit of packed red blood cells (pRBCs) via a level 1 rapid infuser， the patient’s BP was 67/42. The patient was noted to be exceptionally challenging to bag ventilate COS and， subsequently， bilateral tube thoracostomies were undertaken with no spontaneous return of blood. The patient had received 4units of pRBCs and had a blood pressure of 40/31 with a pulse of 50when the attending emergency physician decided to perform an ED thoracotomy for suspected intra-abdominal exsanguination. A left antero-lateral thoracic incision followed by a vertical pericardiotomy revealed no active bleeding within the left hemi-thorax or blood within the pericardium. A naso-gastric tube was inserted and the thoracic aorta was identified and then cross-clamped which resulted in an immediate improvement of the patient's hemodynamic status； his BP was 100/69 with a pulse of 62. The patient was transported immediately to the operating room (OR) where the massive transfusion protocol was continued. He received a total of 26 units of pRBCs， 25 units of platelets， 21 units of fresh frozen plasma and20 units of cryoprecipitate. The patient was surgically treated for an extensive inferior vena cava laceration and lacerations of the gastric pylorus， liver and gallbladder. The patient was defibrillated with intrathoracic paddles twice for cardiac arrest intraoperatively. After surgical stabilization the patient was transferred to the ICU with a packed and open abdomen on norepinephrine， vasopressin and epinephrine intravenous drips and having received tranexamic acid. In the subsequent weeks， the patient returned to the OR on multiple occasions for attempted abdominal closure and was successfully weaned from vasopressors. After a two-month course in the intensive care unit， complicated by an external high-output duodenal fistula and IVC thrombosis， the patient was eventually weaned from mechanical ventilation after further surgical treatment of his intra-abdominal injuries. He was successfully discharged from the ICU to a regional hospital closer to the city of his residence for continued rehabilitation with no neurological impairment.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Traumatic injuries to the IVC are notoriously lethal. Whether caused by blunt or penetrating mechanisms， approximately 50% of patients withIVCwounds diebefore reaching the hospital . In terms ofpenetrating trauma， gunshot wounds (GSW) produce a much more destructive pattern of IVC avulsion in contrast to the typical linear lacerations inflicted by stab wounds. As with our patient， the majority of penetrating trauma causing IVC injury is accompanied by injury to other abdominal organs， major vessels， or both . It is due to the additional injury of surrounding structures that would otherwise contain the low-pressure IVC hemorrhage that allows caval injuries to cause major hemorrhage and exsanguination. Also， the pattern of injury determines the extent that the IVC may self-tamponade； a phenomenon more likely to occur with oblique GSWand linear stab wounds . While it is common for patients with IVC injury and initial hemodynamic compromise to improve with intravenous fluid resuscitation  failure to respond to attempts at volume repletion indicates continued active bleeding and exsanguination.\n\n【13】Our case-report demonstrates the utility and effectiveness ofEDT in penetrating abdominal trauma with suspected intra-abdominal exsanguination. The rationale of EDT in penetrating abdominal trauma is to ensure adequate cerebrovascular and cardiovascular perfusion while decreasing distal hemorrhage by cross-clamping the thoracic aorta. This principle applies to exsanguination due to both venous and arterial sources of hemorrhage. A meta-analysis by Rhee et al. demonstrated a survival rate of 7.4% after EDT preformed for penetrating abdominal trauma with intra-abdominal exsanguinations. The authors find this survival rate significant enough to consider performing EDT in similar conditions. Our case also highlights the role that the emergency physician plays in the initial treatment of a time sensitive injury with an exceedingly low survival rate before the involvement of a designated surgical trauma service. However， the procedure should only be considered in a centre with adequate and established trauma surgery services.\n\n【14】Conclusion\n\n【15】Penetrating abdominal injuries with persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation is suggestive of ongoing intra-abdominal hemorrhage. We presented the case of a 28-year-old man with a penetrating abdominal injury and suspected intra-abdominal exsanguination secondary to an inferior vena cava laceration in whom an EDT proved pivotal to his survival.

I started injecting him with 0.1 ml of 10 to the 25 fold-diluted (with saline) Neurotropin， a product of Nippon Pharmaceutical Company， Osaka， Japan， consisting of extract of rabbit skin inflamed with inoculation of Vaccinia virus intradermally alternately on both upper arms at 2~3 day intervals. Immediately after I repeated the injection 38 times， the patient scratched his own body and made the skin condition considerably worse. I started using 0.1 ml of 10 to the32 fold-diluted Neurotropin to accommodate the worsened skin condition. After I treated the patient with 1114 injection with the more diluted solution， he claimed of a worse itchiness and a more erythematous skin color. Then I started using 0.1 ml of 10 to the 36 fold-diluted Neurotropin. After a 20-time repetition of this injection， I started using 0.1 ml of 10 to the 39 fold-diluted Neurotropin because his skin condition became worse again presumably due to increase in the patient's sensitivity to the injected antigen. After a 7-time repetition of it， the patient's cheek skin became worse. Then， I started using 0.1 ml of 10 to the 44 fold-diluted Neurotropin. After a 83-time repetition of that， his skin condition became worse， again. I started using 0.1 ml of 10 to the47 fold-diluted Neurotropin. After a 38-time repetition of that， his skin condition became worse. I started using 0.1 ml of 10 to the 50 fold-diluted Neurotropin. After a 10-time repetition of it， the patient claimed itchiness at his right-side abdomen.I started using 0.1 ml of 10 to the 66 fold-diluted Neurotropin. After a 4-time repetition of it， his skin condition became worse. I started using 0.1ml of 10 to the 69 fold-diluted Neurotropin. After a 31-time repetition， his skin became neither better nor worse. Then， I started using 0.1 ml of 10 to the 75-fold diluted Neurotropin. Currently， he keeps receiving it. At the 226h injection， I changed the injection-site from the upper arm to the navel-edge because the latter has a thicker skin so that the duration-time of the injected solution in the skin becomes longer resulting in a quantitative increase in the synthesis of the non-specific antibody. In conclusion， his atopic dermatitis has healed virtually completely. The mechanism of action of the above-described treatment has not been explained clearly， yet.

Surgical treatment is the method of choice， especially for large polyps and those with thick stalk.\n\n【2】Keywords： Fibrovascular polyp； Imaging diagnosis； Esophagoscopy； Operative treatment\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Benign tumors of the esophagus are rare. They may be classified as intramural-extramucosal and intraluminal. Intramural-extramucosal were described by Schatzki and Hawes. The most common of them is leiomyoma， followed by neurofibroma， and both are intramural-extramucosal. Fibrovascular polyp is the most common intraluminal tumor， although its occurrence is rare. The fibrovascular polyp has been called fibroma， fibrolipoma， myxofibroma， polyp or pedunculated lipoma. It is a mixture of fibrovascular tissue， adipose cells， or stroma that originates from the mucosa or submucosa. The fibrous element varies from loose and myxoid to dense with thick collagenous fibers. The majority of fibrovascular polyps are solitary， but multiple cases are also depicted. Symptoms include progressive dysphagia， odynophagia， and respiratory symptoms but become present when the polyp has a large size. We report a case of an old man with esophageal fibrovascular polyp identified by Computed Tomographic (CT)， endoscopy and specimen images. Our objective is to introduce the diagnosis and treatment of the giant esophageal fibrovascular polyp.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】We present a case of 54-year-old man who complained of dysphagia and shortness of breath that emerged in the last few months. Previous and concomitant comorbidities： Nephrectomy of the left kidney because of pyonephrosis in childhood； arterial hypertension.\n\n【7】Computed tomography： A heterodense intraluminal pedunculated tumor in the upper third of the esophagus on the level of Th2 could be seen. The lesion was 50 mm long and 20 mm wide in its largest dimensions and protruded into the lumen of the esophagus almost entirely Figures la-1c. Thetrachea，bronchi， mediastinum and the lungs were in normal ranges. seemingly unaltered and moves with the episodes of cough. The rest of the trachea and bronchi are unaltered.\n\n【8】Fibreoptic esophagoscopy： A polypoid mass under the level of the upper esophageal sphincter with wide stalk (above 15 mm) could be observed. It prominated in depth， reaching a length of 5 cm and occluded more than a third of the lumen of the esophagus. Histology：Submucosal granulation tissue with chronic inflammatory reaction.\n\n【9】Rigid esophagoscopy： Tumor formation in the esophagus that was biopsied. The histology showed papillomatous changes of the squamous epithelium.\n\n【10】The patient was operated on. A left longitudinal cervicotomy was performed along musculus sternocleidomastoids. After reaching the pharyngo-esophageal junction， a longitudinal incision of the esophagus was performed under m. cricopharyngeus . A lobulated tumor mass， approximately 5 cm long， pedunculated on a stalk of 15 mm long was visualized. It was cut in its basis. A suture of the arterial blood vessel that was going into the tumor mass was done. The mucosa in the region of the excision was also sutured. A suture in the wall of the esophagus was performed in two levels by means of interrupted 0000 sutures.\n\n【11】Fibreoptic bronchoscopy： A compression of pars membranacea of the trachea， in the subglottic area， at the level of the first-third cartilaginous ring may be observed1.The compression area is Histological result： Macroscopic characteristic： Grey-whitish pedunculated polyp . Microscopiccharacteristic：Fibrovascular epithelial polyp， covered by multilayer squamous epithelium without dysplasia.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Fibrovascular polyps are rare submucosal tumors， that originate predominantly form the cervical part of the esophagus， at the level of the pharyngo-esophageal junction. They are histologically benign，a11Cbut often cause asphyxia. The risk of aspiration and asphyxia may be caused bythe fact that the vocal cords are unable to perform a complete adduction. This may be a reason for a life-threatening asphyxia， as the entrance of the larynx may be blocked . The fibrovascular polyps are often pedunculated on thick stalks， that are well vascularized. Their surface is often undistinguished from the nearby intact mucosa and may， thus， be missed during the esophagoscopy. It is seldom that the mucosa of the polyps becomes malignant， or the polyps grow to gigantic sizes， reaching the level of the stomach . Dysphagia， vomiting， loss of weight and respiratory symptoms are among the commonest complaints . Multiple synchronous fibrovascular polyps of the hypopharynx are also described .\n\n【14】In the clinical case that we presented， two esophagoscopies have been performed - rigid and flexible. None of them however， gave a clear histological verification of the tumor. In addition， because of the large and well vascularized stalk of the polyp it was decided that the endoscopic procedure carries a risk of hemorrhage. Thus， a cervicotomy and esophagotomy was performed for its extirpation. The removal of fibrovascular polyps is obligatory because of the risk of fatal asphyxia due to laryngeal obstruction. Small polyps -under 2cm to 3 cm， polyps with thin stalk may be endoscopically removed. Though rarely， large fibrovascular polyps may also be endoscopically managed by means ofultrasound scissors . Large polyps，especially those above 5 cm and those with thick vascularized stalk are strongly recommended for a surgical procedure-esophagotomy and excision.\n\n【15】Polyps that are located in the cervical part of the esophagus and in the pharyngo-esophageal junction are removed by a vertical cervicotomy either on the left or right side. In case of a gigantic fibro-vascular polyp a simultaneous transcervical and transabdominal approach for extirpation is possible .\n\n【16】Conclusion\n\n【17】The clinical imaging and esophagoscopy are the basic steps in the diagnosis of intraluminal lesions of the esophagus. Intraluminal fibrovascular polyps of the esophagus， that are inappropriate for endoscopical removal should be managed by surgical treatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:39:43", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:39:52", "cost": 8.937}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:46", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:39:52", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:39:42"}

Its association with chronic low back pain is multi-factorial，including biomechanical changes resulting from asymmetrical motion between the LSTV and the sacrum. The conventional conservative management that consists of physical therapy， activity modification， and medication may not be sufficient to provide satisfactory pain control due to the underlying congenital anatomical variance. Here we report 5 cases that were managed with interventional procedures for chronic low back pain associated with Bertolotti's syndrome.\n\n【2】Case Report： All the cases have failed to respond to conventional conservative management and were found to have Bertolotti's syndrome through radiographs. The pain generating mechanism varied among these five patients，whichled to diverse clinic presentations and applications ofvarious interventional procedures including epidural steroid injections， lumbar facet medical branch block and neurotomy，and sacroiliac joint injection and neurotomy.\n\n【3】Conclusion： In light of the diversity of clinical presentations， management of patients with Bertolotti's syndrome has to be highly individualized. Multimodal care， including interventional approaches， is often required based on clinical data， imaging， and diagnostic blocks.\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Bertolotti's syndrome refers to a congenital variant with an enlarged transverse process of the L5 lumbar vertebra (lumbosacral transitional vertebra， LSTV)， which articulates or fuses with the sacrum or ilium. Its correlation with low back pain was first described in 1917 by the Italian physician Mario Bertolotti. The prevalence of Bertolotti s syndrome was estimated ranging from 4.8% in the general population but increases up to 35.6% in those seeking care for low back pain. It's also believed that LSTV increases the severity of patient’s clinical presentation and pain. Unilateral LSTV is more common than bilateral LSTV (9% vs.3%) . Men are more likely to be affected than women (28.1% vs. 11.1%). Bertolotti syndrome is usually diagnosed based on imaging studies，such aslumbosacral plain x-rays， Computed Tomographic (CT) scans，and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Its presence on the imaging study does not predict the symptoms oflow back pain. However， the presence of an LSTV often leads to increased incidence of low back pain due to reduced and asymmetrical motions between the LSTV and the sacrum. The asymmetrical motion can result in early arthritic changes or nerve root compression at the pseudoarticulation. The restricted motion between the LSTV and the sacrum can lead to compensatory hypermobility of the adjacent segments， causing facet pain or irritation of the nerve roots at that level， or sacroiliac dysfunction . Dueto its biomechanical and pathophysiological changes， the pain generators can be distinct in the patients who presented with low back pain associated with Bertolotti’s syndrome， which imposes a challenge for successful management of these patients.\n\n【6】The conventional conservative management that consists of physical therapy， activity modification， medication such as NSAIDs， muscle relaxants， anticonvulsants， and antidepressants may not be sufficient to provide satisfactory pain relief. There is a dearth of literature regarding interventional approaches to the management of patients with low back pain associated with Bertolottis syndrome . In this report， we describe five patients with Bertolotti's syndrome who presented to a tertiary pain center with low back pain and/or radicular leg pain after having failed conventional conservative management. The pain generating mechanisms varied among these five patients， which led to diverse clinic presentations. Different interventional procedures were applied to achieve therapeutic effects.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】Case 1\n\n【9】A 52 year-old man presents with chronic low back pain for over 3years. The pain was described as deep， dull and radiating to the gluteal areas. The pain was exacerbated by walking and mitigated by heat， physical therapy， massage and a TENS unit. There were no significant neurological findings on physical exam. Radiographs demonstrate bilateral pseudoarticulation and/or fusion between the L5 transverse process and the ilium . A bilateral L3-L5 lumbar facet medial branch radiofrequency neurotomy did not provide adequate pain relief or functional improvement. But a L4-L5 interlaminar epidural steroid injection using a mixture of lidocaine 1% and corticosteroids provided 50% pain reduction for about 2.5 months. The pain likely originated from nerve root irritation by the enlarged transverse processes or pseudoarticulation. This patient currently gets L4-L5 interlaminar epidural steroid injections every 3 months with adequate pain control and functional improvement.\n\n【10】Case 2\n\n【11】A 57 year-old man presents with chronic right leg pain radiating to the right dorsal foot for four years. The pain was described as a constant burning sensation associated with numbness and tingling. The pain was exacerbated by standing and getting up from a sitting position and alleviated by lying down. The straight leg raise test was positive on the right side and the tactile sensation was decreased on the L5 distribution on physical exam. The lumbar spine MRI shows evidence of a protruding disc at L4-L5， compressing and effacing the L5 nerve root on the right side. Radiographs demonstrate fusion between the left L5 transverse process with the ilium. Right L4 and L5diagnostic and therapeutic transforaminal epidural steroid injection using a mixture of lidocaine 1% and corticosteroids provided 60%of immediate pain reduction after the procedure . Further follow-up of outcomes is pending. His right lower leg and foot pain could result from the lumbar radiculopathy caused by L4-L5 disc herniation， which is common in patients with Bertolotti's syndrome in compensation to the limited range of motion around the L5-S1 intervertebral disc.\n\n【12】Case 3\n\n【13】A 65 year-old man presents with predominantly axial low back pain and pain in the left posterior thigh for over 5 years. The pain was described as aching and worse when getting up out of a sitting position. Physical exam showed tenderness on deep palpation over the bilateral facet joints， left worse than right， with the negative straight leg raising test. Radiographs showed fusion of the left transverse process of LSTV with the sacrum or ilium . Lumbar spine MRI showed multilevel degenerative changes， transitional S1 with moderate left lateral recess narrowing at L5-S1 and likely chronic impingement of the left S1 nerve root. Left lumbar facet medial branch radiofrequency neurotomy at 80 degrees for 90 seconds after two previous positive diagnostic blocks provided greater than 60%pain reduction. In this case， the lumbar facet arthropathy in the segments above the sacrum likely contributed to his back pain. This is probably from the hypermobility of these segments secondary to the restricted motion between the LSTV and the sacrum. Unfortunately， this patient was injured in a motor vehicle accident a few weeks after the procedure and we have not been able to further follow up his outcomes of the procedure.\n\n【14】Case 4\n\n【15】A 47 year old man presents with left low back pain radiating to the posterior aspect of the left lower extremity down to the level of the knee for 6 years. The pain was described as sharp and stabbing without numbness or tingling. Physical exam was positive for the straight leg raise on the left side. He completed a course of physical therapy and underwent bilateral lumbar medial branch blocks without significant benefit. Lumbar spine radiographies showed asymmetric enlargement of L5 transverse processes fused or articulate with the sacrum. The pseudoarticulation between the left transverse process and the ilium appeared more mobile than the one on the right side . He had 75-90% of pain reduction for duration of 2-7 months to each left L5 transforaminal epidural steroid injection using a mixture of lidocaine and corticosteroid .\n\n【16】Case 5\n\n【17】A 62 year old man presents with right low back pain radiating to the right gluteal area for 5years. The pain was described as aching and worse with walking. The Patrick test was positive on the right side. Lumbar spine radiographs demonstratedasymmetrical pseudoarticulation and/or fusion between the L5 transverse processes and the iliums . This patient had excellent responses to right sacroiliac joint injections with a mixture of corticosteroid and local anesthetics . Subsequently， denervation of the right sacroiliac joint sensation via L5 dorsal ramus， Sl and S2 lateral branch radiofrequency neurotomy provided 70-80% of pain reduction for four months and he is still benefiting from the procedure . The restricted motion between the LSTV and the sacrum may have led to relative hypermobility and dysfunction of the adjacent segments， including the sacroiliac joint in his case.\n\n【18】Discussion\n\n【19】We describe five patients with Bertolotti'ssyndromewhopresented to a tertiary pain center with low back pain and/or radicular pain after having failed conservative treatments. Their clinical presentations and primary pain generators were different as discussed above in each individual case presentation. The interventional procedures that provided greater than 50% pain reduction in our study include L4-L5 interlaminar epidural steroid injection， L4 and L5 transforaminal epidural steroid injection， lumbar facet medial branch blocks and radiofrequency neurotomy，sacroiliac joint injections and subsequent L5 dorsal ramus， S1 and S2 lateral branch radiofrequency neurotomy.\n\n【20】Management of chronic low back pain associated with Bertolotti's syndrome should be initiated with a comprehensive conservative approach consisting of activity modification， physical therapy and home exercise， psychosocial support， and medications such as NSAIDs， muscle relaxants， anticonvulsants， and antidepressants. Interventional approaches can be beneficial in cases refractory to conventional conservative management. Forthosewho presented with lumbosacral radiculopathy or radiculitis symptoms due to the direct compression or irritation of the nerve root by an enlarged transverse process or pseudoarticulation， a transforaminal or interlaminar epidural steroid injection maybe considered. A diagnostic lumbar facet medial branch block can be performed for those with clinical evidence of lumbar facet pain due to the reduced motion between the LSTV and the sacrum. Radiofrequency neurotomy of the target medial branches may provide longer-term pain relief if the patient has greater than 50% pain reduction from the diagnostic medical branch block. For those suspected of sacroiliac dysfunction due to increased load to the sacroiliac joint with restricted motion between the LSTV and the sacrum， a diagnostic sacroiliac joint injection maybe attempted. If the patient has greater than 50% pain reduction， radiofrequency neurotomy of the L5 dorsal ramus， S1 and S2 lateral branches may provide longer-term pain relief.\n\n【21】A few other interventional procedures to manage chronic low back pain associated with Bertolotti’s syndrome have also been reported. Injections of steroids and/or local anesthetics into the LSTV pseudoarticulation site can be both diagnostic and therapeutic in providing temporary pain relief if the primary pain generator is the pseudarthrosis . Posterolateral fusion， partial or full resection of the LSTV pseudoarticulation have been reported to provide pain reduction and can be considered for long-term relief if the diagnostic block of pseudoarticulation was positive .\n\n【22】Conclusion\n\n【23】In light of the diversity of clinical presentations， management of patients with low back pain associated with Bertolotti’s syndrome has to be individualized. Multimodal care is often required based on clinical data， imaging and diagnostic blocks. Interventional procedures may provide better pain relief and facilitate participation in functional physical activities.

However， bone scintigraphy may show unusual uptake of radiotracer in other regions apart from the skeletal system due to pathophysiological changes. Regarding that differential diagnosis should include the extra-osseous presences adjacent to bone structures that may mimic as skeletal metastatic lesions.\n\n【5】Case Report\n\n【6】A 50-year-old man with prostate adenocarcinoma with previously known bone metastases underwent bone scintigraphy for re-evaluation due to rising of prostate-specific antigen level. In his history， his preoperative Tc-99m MDP bone scintigraphy， 10 months ago， showed multiple areas of osteoblastic uptake， markedly in the left iliac region， suggestive of multiple skeletal metastases and after that the radiotherapy was performed at the left iliac region， zoledronic acid and goserelin was administrated before his TUR-P operation. In the comparative evaluation with preoperative bone scintigraphy； a significant regression was observed in the number and intensity of the radioactivity accumulation areas except a focal increased uptake ofTc-99m-MDP prominent in the anterior neck region which was newly observed on the recent whole-body bone scintigraphy . However， the oblique images could not distinguish whether radioactivity uptake belongs to the thyroid tissue or the vertebra metastasis. Meanwhile， his TSH level was suppressed 0.01 IU/ml (reference value0.30 IU/ml to 5.5 IU/ml) and thyroid Ultrasonography (USG) has shown a nodule in the left lobe，15 mm x 10 mm in size with multiple internal calcification， dominantly with microcalcifications. Nevertheless， the appearance did not correlate with bone scintigraphy uptake and the patient was referred to the Magnetic Resonance (MRI). MRI demonstrated hypo-intense sclerotic lesions in the left T2 vertebra corpus and T4 vertebra without any contrast uptake. Thereafter the Ga-68-PSMA(Gallium-68-Prostate Specific Antigen) PET/CT (Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography) confirmed the metastasis consistent with MRI and bone scintigraphy in the anterior part of left T2 vertebra corpus.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Generally， Tc-99m MDP binds to hydroxyapatite crystals and calcium salts causing the skeletal accumulation and uptake in the other of calcium deposition in the body . Prostate cancer usually metastases to bones by hematogenous orlymphatic spread. However， other than malignant conditions，bone scintigraphy may demonstrate soft-tissue uptake in benign conditions such as thyroid nodules including calcification areas， tumoral calcinosis， myositis ossificans that might mimic as metastasis due to increased Tc-99m MDP uptake.\n\n【9】The increased radiotracer uptake in the soft tissues should be taken into account and should be evaluated further for the differential diagnosis. In our patient Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT and MRI revealed the differential diagnosis that the focal radioactivity accumulated in the anterior neck region in the bone scintigraphy is originally the shine through of the vertebra metastasis which is concordant with true-positivity of the bone scintigraphy rather than false positivity.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:37:40", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:38:54", "cost": 73.788}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:46", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:38:54", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:37:39"}

Many different studies gave conflicting results considering the best approach in patients with extremely high white blood cell count. We present a case report of an infant with MLL rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemia， who presented with extreme hyperleukocytosis (white blood cell count of 2，000×10/L)， and severe anemia (hemoglobin level of 3.9 g/dL)， who was successfully treated with exchange transfusion， followed by chemotherapy according to Interfant 2006 protocol. The case report presents a successful treatment of an infant with extreme hyperleukocytosis and anemia and highlights the indications for exchange transfusion and leukapheresis.\n\n【2】Keywords： Hyperleukocytosis； Leukostasis； Pediatric ALL； Exchange transfusion\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Hyperleukocytosis is a life-threatening condition in acute leukemia， usually defined as a White Blood Cell (WBC) count of >100×10/L. We present a case of an infant with extreme hyperleukocytosis with a WBC count of 2，000 ×10/L and concomitant severe anemia with Hemoglobin (Hb) level of 3.9 g/dL due to acute lymphoblastic leukemia， who presented with leukostasis and respiratory symptoms and was treated with Exchange Transfusion (ET).\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】The 11-month-old girl without a relevant family history or any previous medical conditions was admitted to the Pediatric Clinic of University Medical Centre Ljubljana due to fatigue and paleness. Upon admission， she was clinically stable and marked hepatosplenomegaly was present. The first laboratory test showed extreme leukocytosis with a WBC count of 2，000×10/L， Hb level of 3.9 g/dL， Platelet (PLT) count of 26×10/L，lactate dehydrogenase level of 29.76 ukat/L and uric acid level of 431 umol/L . There was no major electrolyte imbalance and arterial blood gas analyses were normal. Coagulation tests revealed increased Prothrombin Time (PT) and activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT). No mediastinal mass was found on a chest X-ray， but diffuse pulmonary infiltrates were present. The girl had no cardiocirculatory or neurological manifestation of leukostasis but the signs of respiratory failure developed on the day of admission. She was sedated， orally intubated and mechanically ventilated. RBC transfusion was not given despite severe anemia due to extreme hyperleukocytosis. She received hyperhydration， rasburicase， PLT transfusion and vitamin K to ensure optimal coagulation. Due to the combination of extreme hyperleukocytosis， severe anemia and low body mass of 10 kg， ET was performed manually with reconstructed whole blood at a rate of 25 ml everv 4 min to 5 min. Over 4.5 h 1，250 ml or 1.5 of total blood volume was exchanged， causing a substantial drop in WBC count. During the procedure， the patient did not develop any adverse events. First laboratory results after the ET demonstrated a WBC count of 522 ×10/L， a Hb level of 7.1 g/dL and a PLT count of 43×10/L. Since blasts in the peripheral blood were defined as lymphoblasts， therapy with steroids was started immediately after ET， still within the first 24 h after the admission. Bone marrow aspiration confirmed B-cell ALL with Mixed-Lineage Leukemia (MLL) rearrangement and since the girl was just under one year of age， she was treated according to the Interfant 2006 protocol. The girl responded well to chemotherapyand is currently in remission and receiving maintenance therapy.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Hyperleukocytosisiissa life-threatening condition in acute leukemia， usually defined as >100×10° WBC/L， and can be seen in5% to 20% of patients . It can lead to leukostasis syndrome， Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) with metabolic abnormalities， severe coagulopathy and multiorgan failure， with a possible evolution of clinical signs from mild to life-threatening within hours . Leukostasis， a potentially deadly complication of hyperleukocytosis， is a result of increased blood viscosity due to the high number of rigid large blasts. Since myeloblasts are bigger than lymphoblast's， leukostasis in Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia (AML) develops at a lower WBC count compared to Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia(ALL). The risk factors of hyperleukocytosis and leukostasis in children with AML are age below one year， FAB M1， M4 and M5 and genetic alterations such as inv and presence of FLT3-ITD+. In ALL hyperleukocytosis is associated with age below one and above nine years， male sex， T-cell immunophenotype and genetic alterations such1asKMT2ArearrangementOIEBCR-ABL fusion . Hyperleukocytosis can present with the pulmonary， Central Nervous System (CNS) and metabolic complications. Severe pulmonary complications present with hypoxia， tachypnea， dyspnea， diffuse alveolar hemorrhage， respiratory failure and changes on chest X-ray. The need for mechanical ventilation usually develops in patients with a WBC count of>650×10/Land>200×10/L in ALL and AML respectively . Central nervous system signs of leukostasis are blurred vision， tinnitus， dizziness， headache， papilloedema， confusion， delirium， somnolence and coma . Lowe reported that CNS complications in children with ALL developed in 3，6% of those with WBC count <400 ×10/L and in 17.9% when WBC count was>400 ×10/L . Metabolic complications include hyperuricemia， hyperkalemia， hyperphosphatemia， and hypocalcemia . The coagulation disorders with Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation(DIC) develop as a result of extrinsic pathway activation due to high levels of tissue factor from WBC and due to high cell turnover .\n\n【9】Leukostasis can also cause priapism， congestive heart failure and peripheral vascular occlusion . The diagnosis of leukostasis is based on clinical signs. A grading score to help evaluate the risk for leukostasis and indication for leukapheresis was proposed by Novotny et al. and is based on the severity of pulmonary， CNS and other symptoms.So definedleukostasis was graded as not present (group 0) in case ofno symptoms and possible (group 1)，when mild pulmonary or CNS symptoms with tinnitus， headache or dizziness are present. Hyperleukocytosis is probable (group 2) in case of limitations due to pulmonary or CNS manifestations with visual disturbances， severe tinnitus， headache or dizziness， and highlyprobable (group 3)， in case of dyspnea at rest or need for additional oxygen or mechanical respiratory support and if severe visual disturbances， confusion， delirium1，、Ssomnolence， intracranial hemorrhage， myocardial infarction， priapism or ischemic necrosis develop . Since hyperleukocytosiIsS诏apotentiallylife-threatening condition， treatment shouldb e e startedpromptly with chemotherapy， hydroxyurea or leukapheresis， the optimal approach still being unknown. To reduce the WBC count and blood viscosity induction chemotherapy or hydroxyurea can be used， the last being especially suitable for treating the patient with not yet identified hematological malignancy . These approaches can be effective， but metabolic complication with TLS has to be prevented by using allopurinol or rasburicase. Other options for reducing WBC count and blood viscosity as well as reducing the severity of TLS and DIC are leukapheresis and ET. Leukapheresis is a procedure primarily used in AML but has been used also for ALL， chronic myeloid leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. It is contraindicated in Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL) due to the increased risk of fatal hemorrhage. It enables the removal of WBCs with a reduction of blood viscosity， whereas RBC， PLT and plasma are returned to the patient. Additionally， by giving FFP before leukapheresis， the risk of bleeding complications can be further reduced. During leukapheresis， PLT transfusion is usually given to keep the PLT count above 30×10/L. Red blood cell transfusion is usually withheld until after the first leukapheresis . Leukapheresis was studied by many authors. A large meta-analysis by Orbeiar et al. showed no difference in early death rate in 1，500 adult and pediatric patients with AML and WBC count>100×10/L who were treated with leukapheresis，hydroxyurea or chemotherapy . COG study which included 256 children with AML and WBC count >100×10/L also showed that leukapheresis did not reduce induction mortality . Another study published by Nguyen et al.  concluded that children with ALL and WBC count>200×10/L have no benefit from leukapheresis， and Chen et al.  have shown that high-dose chemotherapy in children with AML and hyperleukocytosis reduces mortality rate if it is started within hours， making leukapheresis， hydroxyurea and low-dose chemotherapy not needed in a routine manner. Porcu analyzed the results of 48 patients who were treated with leukapheresis due to hyperleukocytosis and found out that there was no correlation between the degree of leukoreduction and early mortality rate . On the other hand， a high WBC count was associated with an increased risk for hypoxia， coagulopathy with pulmonary and CNS hemorrhage， renal failure and early death . Despite controversial results， some authors suggest using leukapheresis in the case of WBC count of>400×10%L and >100 10/L in ALL and AML respectively . According to the2019 Guidelines on the Use of Therapeutic Apheresis in Clinical Practice， which was published by the American Society of Apheresis， symptomatic hyperleukocytosis secondary to AML or ALL is a category II (accepted as second-line therapy， either as a standalone treatment or in conjunction with other modes of treatment) and grade 2B recommendation (weak recommendation， moderate-quality evidence) . Prophylactic leukapheresis is a category III(optimum role of apheresis therapy is not established and decision making should be individualized) with grade 2C recommendation(weak recommendation andlow-quality or very low-quality evidence). Novotny published a grading score to evaluate the risk for leukostasis and concluded that leukapheresis had a definitive effect on the improvement of symptoms if patients had probable or highly probable leukostasis (grade 2 or 3) . When leukapheresis is performed， 1.5 to 2 blood volumes are usually processed and total WBC can be reduced by 30% to 60%， followed by the rapid improvement of clinical condition . It should be repeated as long as the WBC count does not drop below 50-100×10/Land 400 10/L in AML and ALL patients respectively and as long as symptoms persist . Giving FFP before leukapheresis and keeping the PLT count above 30×10/L reduce the risk of bleeding complications. Red blood cell transfusion is usually withheld until after the first leukapheresis .Importantly， the decision to perform leukapheresis should in no way postpone the start of the treatment with chemotherapy or hydroxyurea. The important limitation during leukapheresis in small children is the proportion of extracorporeal volume which should not exceed 15% of total blood volume . In children weighing less than 10 kg， whole blood ET can be used instead of automated cell separators. Since transfusion of RBC is not indicated in the hemodynamically stable child with hyperleukocytosis due to a risk of a further increase in the blood viscosity， ET is an option that enables a drop in WBC count and a rise in Hb level . Clinical studies comparing apheresis and ET are lacking. Kurnaz et al. also published a retrospective study in which 29 adult patients with hyperleukocytosis were treated with leukapheresis with or without volume replacement. There was no difference in overall survival between patients with and without volume replacement but the early mortality rate was lower in the group of patients who had volume replacement， probably due to a greater reduction of WBC count and removal of cytokines . Importantly leukapheresis and ET can also lead to the delay in the initiation of induction chemotherapy， and to prevent the rebound in WBC count after finishing leukapheresis， chemotherapyor hydroxyurea should be given as soon as possible. In patients with hyperleukocytosis coagulation disorders including DIC are common and supportive therapy with transfusion of PLT， Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) and fibrinogen are often indicated. Since a large tumour burden leads often to TLS，adequatehydration andallopurinol or rasburicase should be started promptly. Red Blood Cell (RBC) transfusion increases blood viscosity and should be avoided in patients with hyperleukocytosis . In case of a need for RBC transfusion， it should be given after leukapheresis or with an ET.\n\n【10】Conclusion\n\n【11】Hyperleukocytosis and leukostasis are life-threatening conditions in patients with leukemia demanding prompt treatment. The role of leukapheresis and ET in the treatment of hyperleukocytosis is not clear despite the effective reduction of WBC count but can contribute to a rapid improvement of symptoms of leukostasis. Even though published studies included mostly adult and pediatric patients with hyperleukocytosis due to AML and despite their conflicting results， some authors suggest leukapheresis in case of hyperleukocytosis with WBC count of >400×10/Land>100 10/L in ALL and AML respectively. According to Novotny leukapheresis is effective in case of symptomatic hyperleukocytosis of grade 2 or 3. In case oflow body mass or concomitant severe anemia， ET could replace leukapheresis. The presented case of an infant with ALL and clinical signs of leukostasis due to extreme WBC count confirms that ET is a feasible alternative to leukapheresis which enables the reduction of WBC， safe correction of anemia and improvement of clinical status.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:50:36", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:50:43", "cost": 7.216}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:46", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:50:43", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:50:36"}

It is a rare autosomal recessive， inborn error of collagen metabolism manifesting as skin changes， recurrent infections， unusual facial features，organomegaly (hepatosplenomegaly) with elevated liver enzymes and varied intellectual dysfunction. There have been around 70 cases reported worldwide but our case is worth reporting as the patient has all features with portal hypertension and presented as massive upper gut bleed (variceal bleed). We present a 22 year old unmarried male with no underlying comorbidity. The patient was immediately stabilized by securing airway， breathing and circulation and given two units packed cell transfusion with hemodynamic monitoring and intravenous fluids. Simultaneously all base line investigations including were sent. Seeing the nature of bleed， Gastroenterologist was called and an urgent Upper GI endoscopy was done which revealed multiple varices (3 grade 3 and2 grade 2) for which banding was done and patient starts on injection terlipressin 2 mg 8 hourly and pantoprazole infusion at a rate of 8 mg/h for 72 h . While the patient was being managed and after stabilization a complete general physical examination with relevant systemic examination revealed pallor， depressed nasal bridge， hepatosplenomegaly and multiple ulcers on bilateral lower limbs which according to the patient were chronic and present for more than 3 years. These ulcers were typically non-healing and the patient had never sought medical attention for them but was given some local treatment by a quack. Further he gave history that one of his siblings had a similar history of developing multiple ulcers on limbs which heal by atropic scarring. Keeping all these points in mind the possibility of prolidase deficiency was thought of. Thin layer chromatography of his overnight urine revealed marked increase in iminopeptide after gelatin loading (prolidase deficiency).\n\n【2】Discussion\n\n【3】Prolidase deficiency is a rare genetic disease with autosomal recessive inheritance first described by Goodman in 1968 in a male patient with intellectual disability and characteristic ulcers on legs. Prolidase is an important enzyme involved in recycling of proline and hydroxyproline that is approximately one fourth of collagen . The deficiency of this enzyme results in urinary loss of proline which is in the range of 3 gm per day . These patients are intellectually subnormal， have short stature， saddle nose， hypertelorism， narrowed eyes and hypoplasia of jaw. The most characteristic featureremains skin fragility withlegulcerationandpitted scarring.Other cutaneous manifestations are photosensitivity， purpura， telangiectasias， and dry crusted lesions on face and fissured erythematous palms and soles . They also present with recurrent infections such as otitis media， respiratory tract infections and sinusitis. In addition other features like simian crease， wasting of small muscles of hand， talipes equines， osteoporosis， hyperextensible joints， deafness， corneal opacities， amblyopia， optic atrophy， splenomegaly and protuberant abdomen . The diagnosis is made by determining iminopeptiduria greater than 5 mmol/ 24 h with predominant peptide glycoproline. A characteristic feature is resistance to all treatment including skin graft rejection. Treatment modalities of help are dapsone， diphenylhydantoin， ascorbic acid and manganese . Topical preparation of 5 percent glycine and proline is effective . Pulse corticosteroids show good response with inhibition of iminodipeptide primed neutrophil superoxide generation . Plasma apheresis was also tried and successful in around 2 patients .\n\n【4】Conclusion\n\n【5】No specific treatment can be recommended； rather greater awareness and improved understanding of pathophysiology will improve recognition and treatment of this multisystem disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:08:07", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:08:28", "cost": 21.039}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:46", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:08:28", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:08:06"}

Bacillus cereushas found notoriety as a cause of gastroenteritis， but bone infections involving this bacterium are very rare . We report a case of B. cereus osteomyelitis in an otherwise healthy young girl with no identifiable risk factors， the first of its kind in the literature to our knowledge.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A healthy， five-year-old Caucasian female with no significant past medical history was seen in the pediatric orthopedic clinic with an 8 week history of left sided gait abnormality. She refused to heel weight-bear and had no clear history oftrauma，insect bites， superficial abrasions or penetrating injuryto her left foot. There was no history of fever or systemic features of infection， and no history of immunodeficiency. She had no urinary， chest， ENT (including dental) or skin evidence of infection. Her hindfoot was swollen， and was tender to palpate over the calcaneus.\n\n【4】Several areas of lucency and sclerosis within the calcaneus were seen on radiographs. She was admitted for further investigations. Hematological tests revealed a CRP of <3， ESR 8， and WCC of10.6×10. Blood cultures showed no growth.\n\n【5】An MRI was performed the following day which showed increased signal within the calcaneus， talus and cuboid bones， consistent with multifocal osteomyelitis .\n\n【6】A calcaneal biopsy under general anesthesia was performed. Alateral approach was undertaken to access the calcaneus. Nofrank pus was seen， but the bone was friable and dark， altered interosseous blood was encountered. Multiple， non-cross-contaminated fresh tissue samples of bone fragments， tissue swabs and blood aspirate were sent to the lab for culture.\n\n【7】Microbiological culture revealed growth of Bacillus cereus in 4/4 samples， and StaphylocoCCUS hominus in 2/4 samples. Histology revealed trabecular bone with absent normal marrow， having been replaced by fibrous tissue， foamy histiocytes， and lymphocytes， consistent with chronic osteomyelitis.\n\n【8】Following discussion with our infectious disease physicians， intravenous Vancomycin was initiated. Following initial administration in hospital， it was continued in the community for a total of 6 weeks， during which she was kept in a non-weight-bearing below knee cast. Vancomycin was chosen to provide anti-staphylococcal cover in addition to B. cereus， although it was less clear that this was a pathogenic organism in this patient's case. The duration was chosen due to the poor vascular supply to the calcaneus， and the poorer efficacy of vancomycin compared with beta lactam antibiotics.\n\n【9】A follow up MRI was obtained to confirm resolution of infection， four weeks after cessation of Vancomycin. This was consistent with resolving osteomyelitis， with reduced signal intensity in the hind foot and mid foot.\n\n【10】Weight bearing commenced after 6 weeks in cast. By 3 months she was running and jumping normally， without any symptoms of pain or disability. At 6 months post biopsy she continued to be symptom free with normal radiographs and was discharged from routine clinic follow-up.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Bacillus cereus is a Gram-positive aerobic or facultatively anaerobic， spore-forming， motile，rod-shaped bacterium . Its environmental reservoir includes soil， marine and fresh water， and the intestinal tracts of invertebrates . It is also one of the most common bacteria cultured from the drug associated paraphernalia of heroin addicts . Having a spore form allows B. cereus to survive standard food cooking processes in a dormant state. Once in an active state， it produces a number of tissue destructive exo-enzymes， including an emesis-inducing toxin . It is the emesis effect of B. cereus which gives it most notoriety， causing fried rice syndrome' following the consumption of cooked rice stored at room temperature after its initial preparation.\n\n【13】B. cereus is often regarded as an insignificant contaminant in positive clinical specimens. However， it is recognized to cause a multitude of pathologies， including fulminant sepsis， cutaneous infections，anthrax-like progressive pneumonia， severe eye infections， and meningitis ， as well as osteomyelitis.\n\n【14】While uncommon， osteomyelitis due to B. cereus is certainly recognized， though less than 10 cases have been described in the literature . All of these cases were associated with surgical or accidental trauma， IV drug use， pre-existing infection or sickle cell disease. Only two cases have been reported in children - an 11-year-old boy with a depressed skull fracture and B. cereus osteomyelitis of the bone fragment ， and a 13-year-old girl with distal femoral osteomvelitis due to S. aureus and subsequent superimposed infection with B. cereus . To our knowledge， this case represents the only case of B. cereus osteomyelitis in a child without any identifiable risk factors or history of inoculation injury， with confirmed deep infection. The patient had no other site of infection， and no definite trauma. The difficulties of history taking in a young child were illustrated in this case given the delay from symptom onset to presentation； no history of significant antecedent trauma could be recounted from the child or parents. Of note the patient was a very active child with a new trampoline； minor trauma may have had an association with this case but was below the sensitivity of the history taking to detect.\n\n【15】While microbiology contamination with B. cereus is common， we are confident our case represents a true causative effect as it was recovered from all four tissue samples， whereas S. hominis was only seen in two ofthese. Furthermore，there was a clinical and radiological resolution of infection following appropriate antibiotic treatment.\n\n【16】Osteomyelitis due to B. cereus has previously been successfully treated with gentamicin， cloxacillin， clindamycin， penicillin and vancomycin； antibiotic optionstypically revolveearoundthe susceptibility profile of the isolated strain and the antibiotic resistance is variable. One study of 54 strains of B. cereus concluded that vancomycin may be the drug of choice for invasive infection .\n\n【17】Incconclusion， while an11iincommon cailseofpediatric osteomyelitis， B. cereus should be considered in the differential diagnosis. This is particularly relevant in cases in which no response is demonstrated with traditional empiric antibiotics. Because there are no specific features to the clinical presentation or imaging， this case highlights the importance of adequate microbiological sampling prior to commencement of antibiotics.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:40:37", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:42:05", "cost": 88.335}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:46", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:42:04", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:40:36"}

These lesions are rarely described in long bones since they generally appear in the tubular bones of the extremities. The etiology is unknown， although it is related in several cases to a traumatic history. It shares imaging and histological similarities with other bone lesions such as Bizarre Parosteal Osteochondromatous Proliferation (BPOP)， subungual exostosis， osteomyelitis， myositis ossificans， and malignant surface tumors of bone and cartilage which include conventional， periosteal and parosteal osteosarcoma. Regarding treatment when presenting early， this process can be treated conservatively with rest and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication. When presenting late， with an aggressive nature and/or with recurrence， wide local resection is considered the treatment of choice. Differential diagnosis is essential to avoid unnecessary aggressive treatments. We present a case of a florid reactive periostitis of a middle third tibia， with progressive growth without previous trauma or infectious process. The diagnosis was not suspected by imaging tests. The histological findings of a parosteal lesion with benign characteristics raise the possibility of florid reactive periostitis， having ruled out chronic osteomyelitis due to the negative microbiological studies. After the intervention， the pain disappeared and one year after the surgery there were no recurrences of the lesion.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Florid Reactive Periostitis (FRP) is a rare benign periosteal lesion， which mostly involves the tubular bones of the extremities. FRP of the long bone is especially rare. We present a case of a florid reactive periostitis of a middle third tibia.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 36-year-old female patient presented with a swollen and painful lesion in the middle third of the right tibia with progressive growth without previous trauma or infectious process in the tibia. Characteristically predominant nocturnal pain. Conventional radiographs revealed a bone tumor with periosteal reaction with involvement of adjacent soft tissues . Due to the intense pain， the patient went to the emergency room and a deep vein thrombosis was ruled out by Doppler ultrasound showing an area of cortical bone irregularity with periosteal reaction. The MRI showed a lesion in the middle third of the diaphysis of the right tibia with Codmann's triangle and associated medullary edema . The CT scan showed a lesion of aggressive characteristics with periosteal reaction in onion layers and with prominent speculation that affects more than 90%of the transverse section of the tibia and a craniocaudal extension of 6 cm . With these findings， extension study and bone biopsies were carried out by tru-cut for radiodiagnosis. In the histological analysis， only soft tissues with myxoid edematous changes were observed. Given the hardness of the bone lesion， it was not possible to take a sample of it percutaneously. A second incisional biopsy was performed with these results： Very compact cortical and medullary bone with portions of mature lamellar bone with ossification and mineralization. The arrangement of some trabecula was parallel and others more irregularly distributed. It showed a florid crown ofosteoblasts in some areas without atypia with very occasional mitotic figures. Given the radiological data of the lesion on the cortical-dependent surface， FISH of the MDM2 gene was performed， not observing its amplification. The sample sent as periosteum showed chronic inflammatory signs and vascular proliferation. Samples are sent to microbiology， all being negative. The study of the complete piece was recommended， as it may be a florid ossifying reactive periostitis. Surgical intervention was carried out，performing an exten ded resection，leaving the lateral hemicortical bone of the tibia， and a cancellous structural graft was provided and stabilized with a plate . Several samples are sent to pathological anatomy and microbiology . Histological results again showed a proliferative bone lesion with trabecula that are arranged perpendicular to the cortical bone， the bone had a mature appearance with more densely sclerosed areas and empty lacunae ofosteocytic necrosis and phenomena of reactive bone formation could be glimpsed. It was a sclerosing lesion. In continuity and towards the surface， periosteal reaction with neoformation and vascular proliferation as well as fibroblasts was observed. As no areas of chondroid differentiation or frank atypia were observed ， the diagnosis of periosteal osteosarcoma was ruled out. A new FISH of the MDM2 gene was performed， not observing amplification， so parosteal osteosarcoma was ruled out. Therefore， the findings of a parosteal lesion with benign characteristics raise the possibility of florid reactive periostitis， having ruled out chronic osteomyelitis due to the negative microbiological studies of both surgeries. After the intervention， the pain disappeared and one year after the surgery there were no recurrences of the lesion.\n\n【6】Florid reactive periostitis is a benign bone lesion characterized by transverse section of the tibia and a craniocaudal extension of 6 cm. Gammagraphy shows increased uptake at the bone lesion. an aggressive periosteal reaction and soft-tissue inflammation . Usually affects the digits of the hand and less frequently the feet. It is characterized by pain and tight swelling restricting digital motion and is not usually related to previous trauma. The imaging and histologic features， show an overlap with other bone lesions including BPOP， subungual exostosis，osteomyelitis， myositis ossificans， and malignant surface tumors of bone and cartilage which include， conventional， periosteal and parosteal osteosarcoma. From a histological point of view， cartilage is absent in FRP and periosteal reaction is absent in BPOP.On BPOP the exophytic bone mass has a characteristic dark blue tinctorial quality， especially at the interface with the cartilage . Another benign lesion that occurs in relation to the long bones (and shows overlapping radiologic and histologic findings with reactive periostitis) is myositis ossificans traumatic . Peripheral ossification is the characteristic feature noted on CT . Histologically there are three phases of myositis ossificans： acute (fibroblastic zone)， subacute(osteoblastic zone)， and late (calcified zone). Detection of this zonal phenomenon on histology is diagnostic of myositis ossificans . Another benign lesion that occurs in relation to the long bones (and shows overlapping radiologic and histologic findings with reactive periostitis) is myositis ossificans traumatic . Peripheral ossification is the characteristic feature noted on CT . Histologically there are three phases of myositis ossificans： acute (fibroblastic zone)， subacute (osteoblastic zone)， and late (calcified zone). Detection of this zonal phenomenon on histology is diagnostic of myositis ossificans . Chronic osteomyelitis may also be in the differential diagnosis. This diagnosis is made radiologically by the presence of an osteolytic center with a ring of sclerosis on conventional imaging. Additionally， a culture of the biopsy tissue is needed to support the diagnosis and identify the specific pathogen. Histology often only shows sclerotic bone with chronic inflammatory cells . Furthermore， subungual exostoses can also mimic florid reactive periostitis. There is a reproducible translocation [t(x； 6) (q13； q22)] associated with this diagnosis and thus， it may be considered a true neoplasm. Lastly， malignant osteoblastic tumors including parosteal， periosteal， and conventional osteosarcoma are considered in the differential diagnosis. Parosteal osteosarcoma is the most frequently occurring osteosarcoma and thus it is crucial to diagnostically separate this entity from reactive periostitis. Histologically， it exhibits an extensive boney matrix with a hypocellular stroma and mild to minimal fibroblastic cellular atypia. Radiologically， it takes the appearance of a firm， lobulated “cauliflower-like\"， lesion encircling the bone. A thin radiolucent line delineating the tumor from the cortex， known as the “string sign\"， is seen radiologically in 30% of cases conventional osteosarcoma. Histologically， these tumor cells are very pleomorphic with numerous atypical mitoses that are entrapped in the osteoid matrix. Regarding treatment when presenting early， this process can be treated conservatively with rest and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication . When presenting late， with an aggressive nature and/or with recurrence， wide local resection is considered the treatment of choice.\n\n【7】Conclusion\n\n【8】Florid Reactive Periostitis Ossificans (RPO) is a rare benign entity that in less than 100 cases has been described in the literature with far fewer outside the bones of the hand， feet， fingers， and toes. Because the imaging and histologic features show an overlap with other bone lesions and malignant conflict tumors of bone and cartilage a careful assessment of clinical history， radiology， and pathology help reach an accurate diagnosis. Although rare， this entity should be considered in the differential diagnosis of any osteogenic growth in long bones.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:58:21", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:59:16", "cost": 54.782}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:46", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:59:16", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:58:21"}

This disease is a major public health problem in our country. The incidence of the disease has been increasing in the absence of an effective prevention policy. In addition to liver and lung localization representing 90% of the disease， other organs and tissues are spared. Acute recurrent pancreatitis caused by the presence of hydatid membranes in the biliary tract is very rare disease. This is considered unusual. We report a case of acute recurrent pancreatitis in a female patient who had presented an acute pancreatitis six months ago.\n\n【2】Keywords： Acute recurrent pancreatitis； Hydatid cyst； Biliary cystic fistula； Surgery； ERCP and Endoscopic Sphincterotomy\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Hydatidosis is a zoonosis that is generally caused by infection with tapeworms (Echinoccocus granulosus). When the parasite eggs are ingested by human beings， the infective forms penetrate the intestinal wall and reach the liver via the portal circulation. In some cases， the hydatid cyst subsequently ruptures into the biliary tract . Patients who have pancreatitis caused by hydatid membranes in the biliary tract have been treated，generally，by surgery. There are a few previous case reports in the international literature of acute pancreatitis an exceptional cases as acute recurrent pancreatitis as a complication of hepatic hydatid disease ruptured into the biliary tree. We present a single case of acute recurrent pancreatitis caused by the presence of hydatid membranes in the biliary tract treated by endoscopic sphincterotomy.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 46 years old female patient was oriented to our hospital with epigastric pain radiating to the back， fever， nausea and vomiting over a period of 48 h. She is followed up and treated for diabetes mellitus (type 2) for 9 years. She had a history of a first attack of acute pancreatitis six months ago with diagnosis ofhydatid cyst of liver (segment VII with 6 cm of diameter). Laboratory investigations showed serum lipasemia=1255UI/L(>3xn). She was managed medically for her acute pancreatitis and operated for the hydatid cyst of the liver with cholecystectomy (October 2018). There was fistula between hydatid's cyst cavity and biliary tree treated by drainage. One month later the patient developed a second attack of acute pancreatitis “acute recurrent pancreatitis\". Biliary RMI showed voluminous residual cavity of hydatid cyst in the segments VII & VII of the liver measuring 60 cm x 70 cm accompanying with discrete dilatation of CBD (7 mm) with biliary cystic fistula allied with a material of hydatid cyst in the CBD. Pancreas was globally enlarged associated with castings of necrosis. The Computed Tomography showed enlarged pancreas gland classified as pancreatitis stage E of Balthazar  with CTSI of 2. There was an extended thrombosis of splenic vein with a small intra-abdominal collection of 1.9 cm ×2cm.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Hydatid cystic disease is a illness that has been known since antiquity and was described by Hippocrates with the particular term “liver filled with water\"， followed by the famous Arabian physician Al-rahzes who wrote on hydatid cyst of the liver about more than one thousand years ago . The life cycle of the parasite was acknowledged by Dew et al. It’s a parasitic disease caused by the larval form of Echinococcus granulosus . Primary host of hydatid disease is the dog. Humans become an accidental intermediate host.\n\n【9】The growth is slow and it may take several years before hydatid cyst become symptomatic. Hydatid cysts may be found in almost any part of the body， but are most often found in the liver (60%) and lungs (30%). Despite the overabundance of publications concerning hydatid cyst， little is known about disease affecting the pancreas. The main causes of acute pancreatitis are gallstones and chronic alcohol abuse，accounting for 75% of all cases . There are rare reports in the international medical literature of acute pancreatitis resulting from intra-biliary rupture of a hydatid cyst . There are 16 previous case reports in the international medical literature of acute pancreatitis as a complication ofhepatic hydatid disease ruptured into the biliary tree， but only 3 reports of treatment with endoscopic sphincterotomy . We did not find in the literature a similar case (like our) of recurrent acute pancreatitis caused by rupture of a hydatid cyst in the biliary tree. Spontaneous rupture of the hepatic hydatid cyst in to the biliary tract occurs in 3.2% to 37% of the cases ， truthful perforation is seen in 3.2% to 17% and small rupture occurs in 10% to 37% ， while communication between biliary tree and hydatid cyst occurs in 80% to 90% of patients. The physiopathological description of acute pancreatitis due to liver hydatid disease open to the biliary tree is comparable to that of gallstone pancreatitis. Hydrostatic pressure inside the hydatid cyst significantly goes beyond that in bile， and rupture into the bile ducts is frequent . Evident communication can lead to expulsion of hydatid cyst material (membranes， scolices， daughter cysts) into the biliary tree and may cause jaundice and/or recurrent cholangitis. The passage of this material through the papilla of Water can cause transitory obstruction of the pancreatic canal and/or bile reflux into the pancreatic duct and it may produce an acute pancreatitis. A confined allergic reaction to echinocoCCUS antigens inside the ampulla can also be a part in the beginning of pancreatitis . The rupture of a hepatic hydatid cyst into the bile tree may happen clinically， with symptomatology of cholangitis such as abdominal pain， fever and jaundice . Serology can be used to approve diagnosis of hydatid cyst， but a negative serologic result does not exclude the diagnosis. The negative serology can occurs in about 50% of the patients . In our patients， the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was confirmed by clinical presentation， raised serum lipase， by abdominal CT scan and by biliary magnetic resonance imaging particularly as our patient had an episode of acute pancreatitis of biliary origin 9 months ago.， the hydatid origin is already known since she was operated for hydatid cyst one month ago before developing acute recurrent pancreatitis.\n\n【10】The habitual treatment for hydatid cysts ruptured into the bile ducts is surgery with exploration of the CBD through a choledochotomy， associated with t a T. tube insertion， clearance of cyst fragments and surgical removal of the hydatid cyst or cysts， whichever by Enucleation or by pericystectomy and incomplete hepatectomy. Nevertheless， such procedures are associated with high morbidity， mortality and prolonged hospitalization. In a new study which included 20 patients who had been operated for intrabiliary rupture of hydatid cysts， the mortality was 10% (2 deaths in 20patients)， overall morbidity was 60%， with wound infections in 6patients， suppuration of the residual cavity in 4 patients， and wound dehiscence in two patients， while mean hospitalization was 28.75 days.\n\n【11】ERCP has been used early-on in the preoperative diagnosis of complicated hydatid disease . A number of reports have been published showing the efficacy and safety of Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiogram Pancreatography((ERCP) and Endoscopic Sphincterotomy(ES) in the treatment ofintrabiliary ruptured hydatid disease . Endoscopic sphincterotomy is an effective， safe and well known method in the treatment of hydatid cysts ruptured into bile ducts . Certain author proposes that endoscopic techniques may altogether replace surgery in patients with hydatid disease open to the biliary tract. Al Karawi et al.  have reported on a series of 6 patients with intrabiliary rupture of hydatid cysts， which they treated with ES， hydatid material extraction with balloon and basket， while Akkiz et al.  reported treating 5 patients in the same way. Moreover， Rodriguez et al.  treated 5 elderly patients unfit for surgery with ES and hydatid material extraction， and Giouleme et al. 24 treated two other patients， who remained asymptomatic thereafter. Albendazole is the most potent anthelmintic drug used in the medical treatment in combination with surgical or percutaneous interventions. On the other hand， it may be used as the primary treatment in patients with severe accompanying diseases， patients with very small or asymptomatic cysts， or patients with multiple cysts， or patients with difficult surgical access. In addition， it can be used as a primary treatment in patients who do not accept surgical treatment . Our patient underwent ERCP with Endoscopic Sphincterotomy associated with ablation of hydatid cyst material. She passed a smooth period post ES. All laboratory investigations have become within normal values. Medical treatment Albendazol 400mg 2 × daily she was discharged in good condition and there was no recurrence of acute pancreatitis. After 6 month the patient had no recurrence neither hydatid cyst nor acute pancreatitis.\n\n【12】Conclusion\n\n【13】Acute pancreatitis is an unusual complication of hydatid disease ruptured into the biliary tree. Hydatid membranes in the biliary tract should be well-thought-out as a probable cause of pancreatitis in patients with liver hydatid cyst. We presented a single case of acute recurrent pancreatitis related to rupture of hydatid cyst into the biliary tract. In endemic areas， physicians should be attentive of this potential cause of acute pancreatitis. Endoscopic sphincterotomy is safe and real in the treatment of acute pancreatitis induced by hydatid disease. It has become one of the therapeutic options of ruptured hepatic hydatid cyst into the biliary tract adopted by most of surgeons for its safety and effectiveness.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:59:51", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:00:05", "cost": 13.904}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:45", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:00:05", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:59:51"}

The RS patients were dyspnea， fed difficulties， with cardiac abnormalities caused by cardiac dysfunction， aggravating hypoxia， poor nutrition， increased surgical risk. Mortality rate of RS patients with cardiac anomalies was high. Neonatal distraction (Mandibular Distraction Osteogenesis， MDO) in severe micrognathia patients have been shown to be effective method in treating upper airway obstruction. In our hospital， MDO and cardiac surgery were done at the same time， upper airway obstruction and cardiac structural abnormalities due to hypoxia， can simultaneously treated， no one died， RS patients gain the most weight and benefits. It's a safe and effective way to do both surgeries at the same time for the RS patient with cardiac anomalies.\n\n【2】Keywords： Robin sequence； Cardiac anomalies； Surgery reduce mortality\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Robin Sequence (RS) was first described by the French Stomatologist Pierre Robin in 1923and is characterized by the triad of micrognathia， subsequently leading to glossoptosis and varying degrees of upper airway obstruction . RS is a congenital condition occurring in approximately1 in 5600-8000 live births . Recently， an international consensus was achieved regarding the three distinguishing characteristics (micrognathia， glossoptosis， and upper airway obstruction) that should be included in the diagnosis of RS in newborns. Cardiac anomalies and cleft palate and is frequently encountered .\n\n【5】The incidence of cardiac anomalies in Robin sequence has been previously reported at 7% to22%. Cardiac anomalies include ventricular septal defect， patent foramen ovale， patent ductus arteriosus， pulmonary hypertension. In the study by ， 30% of patients who died had cardiac anomalies. Monroe and Ogo  reported a 21.5% incidence of congenital heart disease in 65patients with Robin syndrome . However， mortality rate of PS patient with cardiac anomaly was39.3% . Congenital heart disease was the important factor for mortality in RS patients.\n\n【6】However how to reduce mortality in RS patients with severe structural abnormalities of the heart. Mandibular Distraction Osteogenesis (MDO) has been shown to be successful in treating upper airway obstruction caused by micrognathia in pediatric RS patients； however， high operation risk exits . The objective of this study was to given the improvements to reduce the mortality in patient with RS and congenital heart disease.\n\n【7】Patientand Methods\n\n【8】All children with Robin sequence admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (<28 d) from January of 2017 to December of 2019 were identified. Inclusion criteria were children diagnosed with RS (micrognathia， glossoptosis， and upper airway obstruction， with or without cleft palate) and cardiac anomalies (except patent foramen ovale). Admitted with a small mandible and no evidence of respiratory obstruction were excluded. Any evidence of respiratory compromise in the presence of a small jaw requiring at least supplemental oxygen or positioning changes was considered to be sufficient for a diagnosis ofRS. In contrast， a child with a small jaw and no breathing problems (not requiring supplemental oxygen， positioning changes， or other interventions) was not considered to have RS.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension was found in all children with cardiac malformation.\n\n【23】Clinical outcome\n\n【24】Hospitalization time and ventilator use time in RS patients without cardiac malformation (33.36 ± 18.71)，(7.18±1.47) was similar as in group of MDO and cardiac surgery at the same time， (27±6.7)，(6±2.19)，respectively.\n\n【25】Hospitalization time and ventilator use time for separate operations was significantly longer than that for both operations. Patient 10 was hospitalized for 102 days， which was related to the duration of non-invasive ventilation and postural therapy. Patient 4was difficulty in evacuation of breath machine after heart operation for 20 days， then MDO was operated， the breath machine was withdrawn smoothly after 4 days. Average ventilator-carried time was6.8 days in simultaneous operation group； it is 17.3 days in the other group. After matching the two groups of patients， two patients were select； children underwent both operations at the same time gained more weight.\n\n【26】Discussion\n\n【27】Cardiac anomalies is a difficult problem in neonates with RS， mortality rate is high. The RS patients were dyspnea， feeding difficulties， with cardiac abnormalities caused by cardiac dysfunction， aggravating hypoxia， poor nutrition， increased surgical risk. It is difficult to make the decision which surgery was first. Cardiac surgery was performed first， prolonged ventilatory assist time； even it makes difficulties to evacuate the ventilator. However， if MDO first， the patient is at high risk， because of the unstable circulation. In our hospital， cardiac surgery and MDO were performed in the same day， cardiac surgery first， MDO second， average ventilator-carried time and hospitalization time was shorten， and the patient gained more weight.\n\n【28】Mortality rate was high in children untreated PAH . In RS patient， VSD with left ventricular to right atrial shunt， blood enters the right ventricle， increased blood to the lungs leads to increased pulmonary arterial pressure. The ratio of right to left shunt in patients with PAH is not low. The foramen ovale were reopened by most of the intracardiac shunts， and PDA aggravating hypoxia， hypoxia causes pulmonary artery contraction， influence pulmonary gas exchange aggravates PAH and hypoxia . In healthy people exposed to hypoxia， the potential arteriovenous branch in the lungs can be reopened. Therefore， it can be alleviates PAH to compensate for pulmonary vascular resistance， but aggravated hypoxia. RS patient suffered from hypoxia due to upper airway obstruction， potential arteriovenous branch maybe reopened， aggravated hypoxia. 71.4% of RS patients who died had cardiac disease . Therefore， attention should be paid to PAH during the treatment.\n\n【29】So breaking hypoxia is the key to treat RS patients with cardiac malformation. In our department， nutritional support and oxygen inhalation were given several days before operation， improves internal environment. Cardiac surgery and MDO operated were performed on the same day， upper airway obstruction and cardiac structural abnormalities due to hypoxia， can simultaneously treated， RS patients gain the more weight， shorten the mechanical ventilation period as well as the hospital length of stay.\n\n【30】It is a safe and feasible way for neonatal RS patients to do cardiac surgeryand MDO on the same day. In the future， we will study this in a larger sample to evaluate safety and explore complications.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:53:04", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:53:33", "cost": 29.579}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:45", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:53:33", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:53:02"}

Cow’s milk allergy is the most common food allergy in infants and young children affecting 2-3% of the general population . The prevalence is less than 1% in 6 year-old children or older . Most children outgrow their allergy by age 3 years . However there are studies with worse percentages of tolerance. Saarinen et al found about 11% of children with previously IgE-mediated cow’s milk allergy to have persistent sensitivity at age 8.6 years .\n\n【8】The only treatment for food allergy is strict avoidance of the food and use of an epinephrine injector if needed. Oral immunotherapy with food (OIT) is a therapeutic possibility to induce tolerance . The first case of successful oral immunotherapy was described in 1908 in a male with egg anaphylaxis .\n\n【9】A Cochrane meta-analysis revising controlled studies of OIT in cow's milk allergy concluded that oral immunotherapy is effective in desensitization of most pediatric patients with IgE-mediated allergy.\n\n【10】There are few studies on milk desensitization in adults those studies presents the results in a global manner (groups that includes adults and children) . In the study of Levy and al. there are adults that tolerated full dose as well as adults that did not achieve full tolerance.\n\n【11】We present a case of desensitization to cow's milk proteins in an adult patient. The OIT could improve the quality of life of the patients and their families.\n\n【12】Case Presentation\n\n【13】We report the case of a 36-year- old patient with a history of allergic asthma due to pollen sensitization (Olea europea and Cupressus arizonica) diagnosed in childhood with allergy to cows milk proteins. He was breast-fed until 1 month ofage. When introducing a cow’s milk formula he developed vomiting food refusal and 5-6 stools a daysome ofthem bloody. An upper gastrointestinal transit discarded hiatal hernia and hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.\n\n【14】At 4 months years old serum specific IgE for cow's milk proteins was negative. Then a cow's milk provocation test (CPT) was performed with a positive result： 30minutes from the beginning he presented vomiting. A cow’s milk and derivates free diet was recommended.\n\n【15】Table 1： He underwent an allergy study in our department.\n\n| SPT (Diater， Madrid-Spain)  | Results  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Cow's milk  | 10x5 mm  |\n| Alpha-lactalbumin  | 14x9 mm  |\n| Beta-lactoglobulin  | 10x11mm  |\n| Casein  | 16x11mm  |\n| Sheep's milk  | 12x12mm  |\n| Goat's milk  | 14x10mm  |\n| Histamine  | 7x7mm  |\n| SSF  | negative  |\n\n【17】Table 2： He underwent an allergy study in our department.\n\n| Specific IgE (Cap System@， Phadia， Uppsala， Sweden)  | Results  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Alpha-lactalbumin  | 0.43 kU/L  |\n| Beta-lactoglobulin  | 1.13 kU/L  |\n| Casein  | 2.58 kU/L  |\n| Cow's milk  | 4.27 kU/L  |\n| Sheep's milk  | 2.85 kU/L  |\n| Goat's milk  | 3.16 kU/L  |\n| Total  | 12.4 kU/L  |\n\n【19】Skin prick-tests (SPT) to cow’s milk proteins (beta-lactoglobulin alpha-lactalbumin casein serum albumin) and CPT performed one year later were positive： 45 minutes from the onset the patient presented hives itching and sneezing. An annual follow-up with skin tests and specific IgE was conducted for 14 years remaining positive.\n\n【20】The patient first came to our allergy department with 36 years of age. He was in a strict free cow’s milk protein diet despite which he had suffered several episodes of labial angioedema maculopapular lesions perioral itchingand dyspnea all related with the intake offoods containing traces of cow’s milk some of them in the last 6 months before attending our outpatient clinic. Once requiring treatment with intramuscular epinephrine. He underwent an allergy study in our department .\n\n【21】The patient gave his informed consent and we began the OIT with cow's milk following our protocol as seen below . Patient was premedicated with： ebastine 10 mg (1 hour before) and budesonide160 mcg/formoterol 4.5 mcg turbuhaler (1/12 hours daily).\n\n【22】Before starting the OIT an endpoint titration prick-test with cow’s milk was performed using dilution 1/10000， 1/1000， 1/100：1/10000：2x2 mm 1/1000：5x5mm 1/100：6x6 mm Histamine 5x5 mm SSF NEG.\n\n【23】According to our protocol we did not perform a cow’s milk provocation test before starting the OIT because the patient has presented several allergic reactions some of them severe after accidental exposures in the last 6 months .\n\n【24】The first six visits were twice a week and then weekly.

We present a case of a 52-year old female patient with metastatic breast cancer with lung and liver involvement， known to be a BRCA2 mutation carrier.\n\n【2】Following a presentation to the emergency service with pain and blurred vision in her left eye， she was diagnosed with uveal metastases. Ten days following this new diagnosis， she was enrolled onto a clinical trial of olaparib， a PARP-inhibitor (Phase 1 Food Effect Study D081ACC00001， NCT01851265). She subsequently developed an improvement in her vision (Snellen visual acuity increased from 1/60 to 6/18 over 6 weeks) and the ocular tumour with its associated retinal detachment was noted to have regressed considerably.\n\n【3】PARPinhibitors are currently involved in several clinical trials for ovarian/breast cancers associated with BRCA mutations. They work by preferentially targeting DNA repair defects in BRCA-positive mutated cancer cells.\n\n【4】In this case olaparib caused regression of ocular metastases in a patient with a BRCA mutation and advanced breast cancer. It supports the case for further research towards offering targeted treatment through gene expression analyses and biomarker functional assays.\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Uveal metastases from breast， lung or gastrointestinal malignancies represent the most frequent intraocular malignancy and the incidence of clinically detectable intraocular metastases in patients dying of cancer has been estimated to be around 1%. Uveal metastases can rarely be the presenting feature in patients with an unknown primarytumour but more commonly manifest in patients with a known primary or with known metastatic disease. In a retrospective case series of 264 patients with uveal metastases secondary to breast cancer by Demirci et al. ， choroidal metastases were most common， followed by iris and ciliary body metastases. Presenting features of uveal metastases include blurred vision， photopsia， shadows and pain. The average survival after diagnosis of uveal metastases was 21 months， and the five-year survival rate was around 24%.\n\n【7】The aim of treatment is usually to restore visual acuity and hence to improve the quality of life for patients with uveal metastasis. Management options for uveal metastases include localised treatments such as external beam radiotherapy， plaque brachytherapy， photodynamic therapy and enucleation， as well as systemic treatments such as chemotherapy， hormone therapy and immunotherapy.\n\n【8】BRCA Mutation and Advanced Breast Cancer. Ann Clin Case Rep.2019；4：\n\n【9】We present a case where treatment with olaparib， a Poly (ADP-ribose) Polymerase (PARP) inhibitor， resulted in a rapid regression in uveal metastases from a breast primary.\n\n【10】A 52-year old female presented to the ocular oncology clinic in September 2013 with pain and blurred vision in her left eye. She was a known BRCA2 mutation carrier and had a history of metastatic breast cancer with lung， lymph node and liver involvement. Her visual acuity was 6/5 in the right eye and 1/60 in the left eye. She was subsequently diagnosed with a choroidal metastatic lesion in her left eye . The anterior segments and right fundus did not show any abnormality.\n\n【11】Table 1： Previous treatment received by patient for bilateral BRCA-positive breast cancer， prior to her presentation to the ophthalmology department in 2013.\n\n| Previous treatment for bilateral BRCA-positive metastatic breast cancer  | Surgical  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Previous treatment for bilateral BRCA-positive metastatic breast cancer  | Bilateral wide local excision with axillary node clearance  |\n| Previous treatment for bilateral BRCA-positive metastatic breast cancer  | Radical radiotherapy  |\n| Previous treatment for bilateral BRCA-positive metastatic breast cancer  | Hormonal agents  |\n| Previous treatment for bilateral BRCA-positive metastatic breast cancer  | Zoladex (started 2001)  |\n| Previous treatment for bilateral BRCA-positive metastatic breast cancer  | Tamoxifen (started 2010)  |\n| Previous treatment for bilateral BRCA-positive metastatic breast cancer  | Chemotherapy  |\n| Previous treatment for bilateral BRCA-positive metastatic breast cancer  | Fluorouracil/ Epirubicin/Cyclophosphamide July to October 2011  |\n| Previous treatment for bilateral BRCA-positive metastatic breast cancer  | Paclitaxel September 2010 to February 2013  |\n| Previous treatment for bilateral BRCA-positive metastatic breast cancer  | Capecitabine May to August 2013  |\n\n【13】Capecitabine May to August 2013\n\n【14】1A： At presentation (September 2013)， showing inferonasal choroidal mass with associated inferior retinal detachment. 1B： After treatment with olaparib (February2014)， showing decrease in exudative retinal detachment. 1C： October 2014 -no recurrence of lesion.\n\n【15】Her previous treatment for metastatic breast cancer is detailed in Table 1. Ten days following the diagnosis of choroidal metastasis， she was enrolled onto a clinical trial of olaparib capsules (a Phase 1 Food Effect Study D081ACC00001， NCT01851265， study completion date June 2017) . The decision to enrol onto the trial predated her visual symptoms and was unrelated to her diagnosis of choroidal metastasis.\n\n【16】Results\n\n【17】Her Snellen visual acuity in the affected left eye improved from1/60 at its worst to 6/18 six weeks after having been started on olaparib. The choroidal metastasis and its associated retinal detachment were noted to have regressed considerably， both clinically and on ultrasound scan  in February 2014(22weeks from start of olaparib)， and also later on in September 2014 on repeat CT scan . At last follow-up in August 2015， visual acuities were 6/5 in the right eye and 6/9 in the left eye. Unfortunately in spite of the improvement in her ocular condition and some initial improvement in the liver lesions with olaparib， the patient eventually developed more advanced disease in the liver and lymph nodes. She was taken off olaparib and subsequently enrolled onto another clinical study of Liposomal Eribulin (November 2014 to February 2015)， followed by palliative chemotherapy with carboplatin (February 2015to April 2015) and vinorelbine (started in April 2015). The patient passed away in October 2015.\n\n【18】Discussion\n\n【19】ExternaallBeamRadiotherapy (EBRT)remains theemost commonly used treatment modality for uveal metastases with success rates of up to 86% in restoring visual acuities . It is easily accessible but time consuming and usually involves several trips to the hospital over a period of 3 weeks to 4 weeks. Its side effects include cataract formation and radiation retinopathy.\n\n【20】Systemic chemotherapy is also commonly used- its effects are often slower than with radiotherapy . Photodynamic therapy can be used for shallow， well circumscribed metastases and has been successfully used in a case where the metastatic lesion was refractory to treatment with radiotherapy or chemotherapy . Hormonal treatments used include tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole， letrozole or exemestane for oestrogen-receptor positive tumours . Successful use of intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment has also been reported .\n\n【21】Demirci et al.  described the management and prognosis of patients with uveal metastases from breast cancer. The types of treatment for choroidal metastases included EBRT (59% of patients)， systemic chemotherapy (29%)， hormonal therapy (9%)， plaque radiotherapy and enucleation (3%). They noted a 12% rate of recurrence of choroidal metastasis following treatment and a 10%rate of active choroidal metastasis in spite of treatment. 53% of the study patients had developed ocular metastases while on systemic chemotherapy or immunotherapy， indicating that these might not be sufficient for preventing ocular metastases. Tumour responses to treatment therefore remain variable and new agents are being researched.\n\n【22】PARP-inhibitors such as olaparib， which target BRCA-positive tumour cells， are one of the newer agents being investigated as treatment for BRCA-positive ovarian/breast cancers . They offer an alternative option to women who develop resistance to chemotherapy following a relapse ofinitially treated cancer. They have shown promising results as anticancer agents， both in monotherapy and as chemo-potentiating agents.\n\n【23】PARP-inhibitors work by preventing cancer cells from repairing their DNA . BRCA1 & 2 is tumour suppressor genes that serve an important function in DNA repair. BRCA-positive cancers often show poor response rates with traditional agents， and therefore tailored therapies on basis of biomarker screening are being developed. PARP 1 is an important component of base excision repair involved in the repair of DNA single-strand breaks which would otherwise be converted into DNA double-stranded breaks. Cells with inactive BRCA genes are heavily dependent on PARP 1 for DNA repair. PARP-inhibitors therefore selectively target the BRCA-positive cancer cells while normal cells， in which DNA repair is still carried out by the active BRCA genes， are spared .\n\n【24】Conclusion\n\n【25】In this case olaparib caused regression of ocular metastases in a patient with a BRCA mutation and advanced breast cancer. It supports the case for further research towards offering targeted treatment through gene expression analyses and biomarker functional assays. The hope is that prompt delivery of targeted treatment at the time of diagnosis will help prevent the emergence of drug resistant cancer sub-populations. More research is required to further assess the relative risks and benefits oftreatment with olaparib.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:43:59", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:44:12", "cost": 13.009}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:45", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:44:12", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:43:59"}

In the operating room the patient was intubated， and was positioned in the decubitus position， right lateral thoracotomy was performed， revealing intercostal hernia between gih and 10intercostal space and the 9ih rib was displaced. We observed a huge， herniated sac and a 10 cm ruptured diaphragmatic defect on the right anterior aspect. Intercostal hernia with abdominal content including small bowel reduced back， diaphragmatic defect was closed with vicryl suture， displaced rib was fixed with prolene suture， and Sublay UltraPro mesh was placed beneath external oblique， the fascia of the intercostal and external oblique was approximated， and a second Ethicon UltraPro mesh was placed and fixed onlay with vicryl sutures to secure the defect. A drain was placed. Following surgery， the patient's vital signs were normal. He was mobilized early and underwent daily pulmonary rehabilitation. Two days later， the patient started coughing， and lung auscultation revealed crackles. A Chest X-ray was performed， which showed a small amount of bilateral pleural effusion and mild pneumonia. Antibiotics were initiated. Over the next two days， the patient continued to cough without fever， and his vital signs remained stable， (SPo2 level) around 90%. A CT Angiogram (CTA) was performed on the 5h day after surgery to rule out Pulmonary Embolism (PE) and evaluate any other postoperative findings. The CTA revealed right lower lobe atelectasis without any other abnormalities， and the diaphragm and intercostal space were intact. The patient continued to undergo intensive daily respiratory physiotherapy， and over the next few days， he showed significant improvement. The surgical site was satisfactory. The patient was discharged after 9 days following surgery. Currently， it has been 6months since the surgery， and there has been no hernia recurrence.\n\n【3】Discussion\n\n【4】We present a patient with a transdiaphragmatic intercostal hernia and a large diaphragmatic defect. The patient has no history oftrauma or coughing and denies any previous surgical intervention. We believe that this hernia is the result of an extended period of several years working with heavy loads. TDIH is a rare condition typically associated with trauma or intensive coughing . Although extremely rare， cases of TDIH caused by trauma， a long period of coughing， or sneezing have been reported . To the best of our knowledge， this is the first case report describing TDIH resulting from an extended period of several years working with heavy loads， without a history of trauma or other causes documented in the literature. The appearance of a large diaphragmatic rupture on the right side is extremely rare and presents a challenge in making the diagnosis based solely on clinical findings.\n\n【5】In conclusion， TDIH should be suspected following blunt or penetrating trauma. A high clinical suspicion along with a CT scan， will provide an accurate diagnosis. Surgical repair of the defect， with the placement of double mesh， can help reduce the risk of recurrence. Our case emphasizes the importance of accurate physical examination. however， physical examination alone may be sufficient to make an accurate diagnosis， and intercostal hernia can be suspected even without a history oftrauma， chronic cough， or violent coughing.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 15:19:11", "endTime": "2024/09/20 15:19:17", "cost": 5.51}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:45", "update_time": "2024-09-19 23:19:17", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 23:19:05"}

Recognition of rare CNS parenchymal involvement by multiple myeloma is critical with regards to treatment options.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】Case 1\n\n【4】A 69 year old male presented with de novo IgG multiple myeloma diagnosed initially in. The patient's initial treatment lasted from 2008 to 2009 when the patient was in complete remission requiring only maintenance therapy. However，the patient had a relapse in 2014. During this workup， the patient obtained an MR of the brain with contrast demonstrating leptomeningeal disease. The patient was treated a second time， however an MR of the brain with contrast in 2017demonstrated a third relapse， and in 2018 an MR of the brain with contrast now demonstrated new enhancing intraparenchymal lesions.\n\n【5】Case 2\n\n【6】A 79 year old female presented with status epilepticus in the setting of multiple myeloma， breast cancer， and cholangiocarcinoma. MR imaging of the brain demonstrated diffuse hemorrhagic metastasis to the brain. A lumbar puncture was performed with the sample sent to cytopathology for analysis， demonstrating abundant single cells with plasmacytoid features， including mononuclear and binucleate cells and morphologically favoring multiple myeloma. Although the patient does have both breast cancer and cholangiocarcinoma， the CSF sample sent for cytology proved to have malignant cells consistent with multiple myeloma. An MRI of the brain demonstrated diffuse intraparenchymal metastasis throughout the cerebral hemispheres as well as diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement along the cerebellar folia. In this rare case， the patient demonstrated diffuse intraparenchymal metastasis in the setting of multiple myeloma.\n\n【7】Description\n\n【8】Central nervous system involvement is a rare complication ofmultiple myeloma.FPatients may present with either an intraparenchymal lesion or with a leptomeningeal lesion . It is important to identify intracerebral metastasis from multiple myeloma because the tumor is radiosensitive and thus radiotherapy may play an important role in therapy . The mechanism for the spread of plasma cells to the leptomeninges is not clear， however， it is thought that the plasma cells may extend to the central nervous system through microscopic veins in the arachnoid membrane .\n\n【9】Summary\n\n【10】Multiple myeloma is a neoplastic disorder of plasma cells that secrete a monoclonal immunoglobulin. The disorder represents approximately 1% of all cancers， approximately 10%0of all hematologic malignancies， and is the most common primary osseous malignancy in adults . Risk factors include exposure to ionizing radiation， as well as toxic exposures such as to benzenes， herbicides， and insecticides . Clinical presentation can include bone pain， fatigue， and anemia with lethargy . The highest incident of cases is from ages 50 to 70， with incidence increasing with age， and it is more common in men than women . Multiple myeloma can affect multiple organs and organ systems. Extramedullary plasmacytoma is overall a less common manifestation of multiple myeloma， with 6%to 8% of patients newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma presenting withextramedullary manifestations， and with anestimated 10%to30%of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma presenting with extramedullary manifestations . Improvements in multiple myeloma therapy have also likely lead to an increase incidence of patients who are now able to present with extramedullary myeloma due to increased survival .Typicallocations of extramedullary plasmacytomas include lymph nodes， spleen， and liver， though there are reports of involvement of nearly every organ system .\n\n【11】The presence of extramedullary manifestations of diagnosed multiple myeloma is relevant to patient care as there is an association with higher relapse rates and with a genomically higher risk disease， as well as with shorter overall and disease-free survival . In addition， any relapse of multiple myeloma is more likely to include extramedullary manifestations if they were present on initial diagnosis .\n\n【12】Aretrospective review in 1963 by Silverstein et al. demonstrated a 3% rate of intracranial metastases in 273 patients with multiple myeloma. More recently， the reported incidence rate for central nervous system involvement of multiple myeloma is 0.7%to 1% . Most often the disease manifests as leptomeningeal carcinomatosis， with intracranial plasmacytoma being a rarer manifestation . There have been case reports discussing the occurrence of plasmacytoma in the sella， involving the temporal bone， and involving the intraocular muscles . Typically myelomatous involvement of the central nervous system occurs in relapsingpatients， rather than as the primary presentation. Diagnostic imaging， including contrast-enhanced MRI， has become a useful aid in diagnosis， staging， and post-treatment surveillance of multiple myeloma with possible extramedullary manifestations.\n\n【13】In the first case report， a patient with multiple relapses to multiple myeloma presents with imaging evidence of both leptomeningeal and intraparenchymal disease. In the second case report， a patient with known multiple myeloma， breast cancer， and cholangiocarcinoma， presents with diffuse hemorrhagic metastases resulting in a clinical presentation of status epilepticus. A subsequentlumbar puncture and CSF analysis including cytology demonstrates evidence of multiple myeloma. Although rare， central nervous system myelomatous involvement can cause many complications for the patient. While intracranial plasmacytomas are radiosensitive， there is an overall shortened survival in patients with multiple myeloma and concurrent extramedullary disease， including CNS involvement. Thus it is important for the radiologist to be aware of such presentation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 15:03:31", "endTime": "2024/09/20 15:19:02", "cost": 931.535}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:45", "update_time": "2024-09-19 23:19:02", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 23:03:30"}

Patients with MPNs may have a second neoplasm； the risk of lymphoid line neoplasms is 2.5 to 3.5 times. The explanation for this association is the genetic instability of hematopoietic progenitors in MPNs.\n\n【2】Case Report： Patient man 80 years old， Caucasian， known with much comorbidity， presents for physical asthenia， sweating， and right inguinal adenopathy with a diameter of 5 cm to 6 cm， partial mobility， and pain (appearing 1 month before the examination). The patient was diagnosed concomitantly with DLBCL and AML secondary to Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF) and presented a complex karyotype-trisomy 8 and 13 and triple-negative PMF status. The patient initially received 2well-tolerated R mini CHOP series， this type oftreatment was selected to treat DLBCL for one unfit patient for intensive chemotherapy due to his age and comorbidities. R mini CHOP administration was followed by severe aplasia that lasted approximately 2 weeks followed by severe thrombocytosis that reached 4000 x 10/L and thromboreductin recommendation was mandatory. The result of the treatment was a partial response but with severe adverse events neutropenia G4， due to the delay of the treatment the patient lost the response. It was mandatory to select another treatment line and the chosen was Venetoclax， it was selected for the simultaneous treatment of DLBCL and the underlying AML. It was obtained a significant reduction in the size of the inguinal lymph node block in 2 weeks of the treatment. Severe neutropenia was diagnosed and complicated with sepsis. The evolution is unfavorable with the installation of multiple organ dysfunctions.\n\n【3】Conclusion： The presence of a complex karyotype (trisomy 8， trisomy 13) in a patient with myeloid metaplasia with triple-negative PMF was associated with blast transformation and severe thrombocytosis. The patient was diagnosed concomitantly with DLBCL， making the therapeutic decision difficult. Venetoclax has been shown to be useful in the treatment of DLBCL but has been associated with severe neutropenia， which has led to infectious complications.\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Large B cell non-Hodgkin's malignant lymphoma (DLBCL) represents 30% to 40% of the total number of patients diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL). This type of NHL presents2 molecular subtypes： Germinal center B-Cell like (GCB) and Activated B-Cell like (ABC) subtypes； however， 10% to 15% of cases are unclassifiable . The diagnosis of NHL in rare cases may be associated with chronic Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPNs). Sometimes the diagnosis of MPNs has been established in patients with NHL history during the remission period . Patients with MPNs may have a second neoplasm， with a risk of 1.5 to 3 times for solid tumors (skin， lung， thyroid，kidney) and 2.5 to 3.5 times for lymphoid line neoplasms： Monoclonal gammopathy or chronic lymphoproliferative syndrome： B Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia(B-CLL)， NHL . The higher incidence of the development of lymphoproliferation in patients with MPNs is higher in men and those with the JAK2V617F mutation， and the median duration for the identification of the second neoplasm is 68 months after the diagnosis of MPNs. The risk of lymphoproliferation is 3 times higher for NHL and up to 12 times for B Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (B-CLL). The explanation for this association is the genetic instability of hematopoietic progenitors in MPNs . Some studies have shown that treatment with JAK inhibitors can be involved in increasing the risk of developing NHL， a hypothesis unconfirmed by other studies. However， not all studies have confirmed this hypothesis . The concomitant presence of Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia (AML) and DLBCL is rarely reported in the literature. Cases of acute leukemia diagnosed after the diagnosis of DLBCL have been reported . Acute myeloid leukemia discovered in DLBCL patients is often secondary to chemotherapy that includes alkylating agents (fludarabine， cyclophosphamide)， especially if it also combines rituximab but is also due to immune dysfunction or infections . The association at the time of diagnosis of AML and NHL was not reported. We will present the clinical case of a patient diagnosed concomitantly with DLBCL and AML secondary to Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF) who presented a complex karyotype-trisomy8 and 13 and triple negative PMF status.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】Patient man 80 years old， Caucasian，known with ischemic heart disease， mitral and tricuspid insufficiency，hypertension， heart failure class III NYHA， morbid obesity， presents for physical asthenia， sweating. The clinical examination shows right inguinal adenopathy with a diameter of 5 cm to 6cm，partial mobility， and pain (appearing1 month before the examination). Laboratory investigation at the onset： WBC 3.14 ×10/L (N 4-11×10/L)， Hb 10.6 g/dl (N 12.3 g/dl to 17 g/dl)， Plt 1380×10/L (N 150-450×10/L)；peripheral blood smear revealed 20% erythroblasts，25% blasts， 43% lymphocytes， 30%monocytes， 26% neutrophils， macro platelets and giant platelets， normochromic red cells， frequent polychromatic cells， anisocytosis， ovalocytes and rare tear drop cells. Bone marrow aspiration revealed normal cellularity with 35% to 40% myeloblasts and verylarge groups of platelets. Abnormal biochemistry results were uric acid 8.6 mg/dl(N3.4 mg/dl to 7 mg/dl)，LDH 502IU/L(N 135IU/Lto 225IU/L)，and CRP 39.72 mg/L (N 0 mg/L to 5 mg/L)； the rest of the hematologic， coagulation and biochemistry parameters were normal. It should be noted that the platelet count in January 2021 was 461×1000/uL，and the rest of the hematological parameters were normal. Lymph node biopsy was performed， and the histopathological result identified diffuse malignant lymphoid tumor proliferation with medium/large polymorphic cells， rounded， incised， lobed nuclei， hardly visible nucleoli， and weak basophilic cytoplasm. Immunohistochemistry showed that lymphoid tumor proliferation was B large cell positive diffuse for CD20+ and BCL2， with phenotype CD10 negative， BCL6positive， and MUM1 positive. The proliferation index Ki67 was 85%， with aberrant expression of CD5 and negative for Cyclin D1，CD3CD30， and CD23， establishing the diagnosis of DLBCL NOS with a non-germinal center phenotype/non-GCB . The PET-CT evaluation revealed a hyper captive voluminous area (SUVmax16.13) corresponding to a tumor mass of 9.68/8.55 cm located inter gastrosplenic and hypercapture along the great gastric curvature up to the antrum， without clear differentiation between these hyper fixations. Multiple hyper fixed areas located right laterocervical(SUVmax 9.39 and dimensions 2/1.85 cm)， mediastinal (SUVmax7.33)， intra-abdominal (celiac area SUVmax 7.34， dimensions2.62/2.35 cm， hilum splenic with confluent appearance and SUV max 5.23， paraaortic and right paravertebral)， right internal and external iliac (SUVmax 17.11 and dimensions 3.3/2.38 cm)， left obturator (SUVmax 5.82)， right inguinofemoral with confluent aspect (SUVmax 26.08， diameter 9.97/10.29 cm) in correspondence with lymph node formations. Diffuse and inhomogeneous hyper tracking of the radiotracer at the bone marrow level of the scanned bone segments suggestive of the presence of MPNs . Upper digestive endoscopy does not show any pathology. Osteomedullary biopsy (trephine biopsy) performed for staging and diagnosis of DLBCL but also for differential diagnosis ofthrombocytosis)indicates the presence of medullary hypercellularity (85%) by diffuse blast infiltration (approximately50%) with medium cell， vesicular， rounded nucleus， hardly visible nucleoli， normoblastic maturation with rare macro/megaloblastoid elements， very common megakaryocytes， very polymorphic， some with nucleocytoplasmicatypia grouped compactly perivascular and peritrabecular. Silver impregnation Gomori MF2focal (>30%). This result is suggestive of acute transformation (AML) of Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF) . Molecular testing of BCR/ABL， JAK2 V617F， CALR and Mpl was negative. ASXL1 and TET2 mutation was not performed. Immunophenotype evaluation of bone marrow by flow cytometry indicated 30% myeloid blasts CD34+， CD117+，HLA-DR+，CD3-，CD7+，CD19-，CD33+， CD36-， CD13+，CD300e-，CD35-，CD14+/-，CD16-，CD64-，CD11b-，CD10-， CD15-，CD56-，CD9+/-，CD123+/-，CD105-， CD71+/-suggestive for myeloblast without maturation with aberrant co expression of CD7， CD9， CD13 (AML M1 FAB) . Cytogenetic examination of bone marrow aspirate revealed the presence of trisomy 8 and 13. FISH examination did not reveal IGH-BCL2 rearrangement (t (14；18)(q32， q21) or BCL 6 (3q27). Additionally， MYC rearrangements(8q24) and FGFR1 (8p11) were not revealed. Deletions of the DLEU(13q14)，TP53(17p13) orKMT2A rearrangement (11q23) genes were not detected. The diagnosis was DLBCL stage III in a patient with blastic phase PMF (AML M1 FAB post PMF) associated with trisomy8 and 13. The patient initially received 2 well-tolerated R mini CHOP series； this type oftreatment was selected to treat DLBCL for one unfit patient for intensive chemotherapy due his age and comorbidities. R mini CHOP administration was followed by severe aplasia that lasted approximately 2 weeks followed by severe thrombocytosis that reached 4000 ×10/L. For this reason， it was decided to administer anagrelid (Thromboreductin) under which the platelet count returned to normal. The result after administration of the 2 R mini CHOP applications was partially response with a slight reduction of the right inguinal lymph node block. The decision was made to stop the administration of R mini CHOP (due to severe neutropenia as an adverse event and loss of response by increasing the size of the lymphadenopathy) and to start taking venetoclax. It was selected for the simultaneous treatment of DLBCL and the underlying AML. The evaluation made 2 weeks after the onset of venetoclax indicated a significant reduction in the size of the inguinal lymph node block as well as the presence of severe leucopenia associated with moderate anemia. During pancytopenia， the patient presents with sepsis with a respiratory startingpoint. CTevaluation shows right lobepneumonia associated with small bilateral pleural effusion and minimal pericardial effusion. All microbiologic cultures (blood， sputum) were negative， but the patient was positive for SARS-CoV-2， and the rest of the serology tests， CMV， and EB V were negative. At admission，the WBC count was 0.56×10/L， Hb 6.5 g/dl， Plt 781×10/L，IL-6 84pg/ml， CRP 136.57 mg/L， procalcitonin1 ng/mL (N<sau= 0.05 ng/ml)， and D dimers 1.43 ug/ml FEU (N.5 ug/ml FEU). The evolution is unfavorable with the installation of multiple organ dysfunctions(aggravation of renal failure， the installation of severe ventilatory dysfunction and toxic septic shock). As a peculiarity of evolution， it is worth mentioning the deterioration of cardiac function with the effect of myocardial contractility， the appearance of pulmonary hypertension and valvular-mitral and tricuspid insufficiencies that contributed to the existing complications (ventilatory dysfunction and pleural and pericardial effusions). Additionally， the presence of severe thrombocytosis over 3000-4000×10/L required the administration ofanagrelide to prevent thrombotic complications.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】The patient was diagnosed with AML M1 FAB (with abnormal expression of CD7) secondary to PMF. This expression is associated with a reserved prognosis . Two genetic aberrations are associated -trisomy 8 and 13. Trisomy 8 is one of the most common cytogenetic mutations found in AML (10% to 15%) but also in other neoplasms-Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS)(15%to20%)，MPNs， Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) (5%)， solid tumors (colon， breast)， rarely in B-CLL or NHL . The prognosis of AML 8+patients is reserved； patients with NHL have not been reported . Trisomy 13 has been described in AML M0 and M1 FAB， especially in men over 70 years of age (0.7%)， MDS， PMF， and atypical chronic granulocytic leukemia (atypical CML). The prognosis of AML 13+patients is unfavorable， with a median survival of 0.5 to 14.7 months. At the same time， the patient was diagnosed with DLBCL NOS(not otherwise specified) with a non Germinal Center B cell (GCB) phenotype and aberrant expression of CD5. CD5 expression in DLBCL is more frequently associated with advanced disease or the presence of extra ganglionic determinations. The clinical evolution of such a patient is unfavorable . The concomitant diagnosis of AML and NHL is rare. Cases of AML have been reported in patients with untreated B-CLL， and this association gives a reserved prognosis. In the case of the presented patient， there was no treatment prior to the diagnosis of NHL and transformed MPNs. Although the diagnosis of AML secondary to PMF was made concomitantly with that of NHL-DLBCL， it should be noted that this patient had elevated platelet counts at least 6 months prior to diagnosis， and the patient was not investigated. The patient did not have any dynamics of morphology in the past or the result of a previous peripheral blood smear or spleen and liver size. This patient has two trisomy8 and 13 genetic mutations that give a reserved prognosis. Trisomy8 has been found， in a few cases， in patients with T cell NHL or B cell NHL (B-CLL，DLBCL， follicular or mantle cell NHL) .It has also been identified in patients diagnosed with MDS or MPNs. The unique presence of trisomy 8+ in MDS patients indicates the presence of an intermediate prognosis. However， the association with other anomalies determines the inclusion of the patient in the category of unfavorable prognosis . In our patient， trisomy 8 was associated with trisomy 13， a less common cytogenetic abnormality. Baer reported the presence of trisomy 13 in patients， especially in elderly men， with AML with undifferentiated or biphenotypic type and the prognosis of these patients were reserved . Trisomy 13was also identified in patients with PMF， and the evolution of these patients was rapid with blastic transformation . The presence of the complex karyotype represented by trisomy 8， 13 and deletions del (20q)，del (13q) or chromosome 1 abnormalities is associated with the blastic transformation of PMF and decreased patient survival. The patient presented associated trisomy 8 and 13， explaining the rapid unfavorable evolution. In addition， it is associated with the triple-negative status of PMF，and this status is associated with an increased risk of blast transformation and unfavorable prognosis . Mention should also be made ofthe need to differentiate primary triple myelofibrosis from secondary myelofibrosis secondary to DLBCL or AML. PET-CT examinations as well as bone marrow HP and IHC examination are important in the differential diagnosis of secondary myelofibrosis due AML evolution . Both ex-HP IHC and ex-PET-CT performed in our patient confirm the diagnosis of the blastic phase of PMF. In addition， the patient was diagnosed with aggressive NHL a recent clinical manifestation. A variety of lymphoproliferative neoplasms may be associated with secondary myelofibrosis (B-CLL， HL or NHL， HCL， multiple myeloma)  and secondary fibrosis. The pathogenetic mechanism involved in the onset of secondary myelofibrosis could be the release of IL-1 by neoplastic cells that stimulate fibroblast growth by inducing secondary fibrosis. Another explanation could be the separate proliferation of two clones that are due to molecular and chromosomal abnormalities of the multipotent hematopoietic cell， thus causing bilinear clonal proliferation .\n\n【10】Conclusion\n\n【11】The presence of a complex karyotype (trisomy 8， trisomy 13) in a patient with myeloid metaplasia with triple-negative PMF was associated with blast transformation and severe thrombocytosis.

The main problems of Hemangiomas are characterized by a rapid， progressive growth. Growing， they destroy surrounding tissue and cause significant functional and cosmetic damage to the patient .\n\n【7】Currently there are more than 50 methods of treatment of hemangiomas with different mechanisms of action . This is due to the different localization of formations， multiple forms of their manifestations and search for optimal treatment. At the same time， the surgical method in the treatment of hemangiomas is still one of the main. In reconstructive， plastic and aesthetic microsurgery department of National Scientific Center of Surgery named after A.N. Syzganov for2 years were operated 14 patients with hemangiomas of the neck. The age of patients ranged from1 to 10 vears. In anamnesis in 8 of them on tumors previously held several of interventions in the department of endovascular surgery (cryo， laser destruction， excision， embolization， conservative treatment by propranolol etc). 6 patients came primary diagnosis ofthe presence of formations was not difficult. Accompanying relatives of patients complained of the presence oflarge formations on the neck， changing color depending on the position of the child. 3 patients had significant limitation of movement of the head， deviation of the neck， 4 patients had pain syndrome， due to compression of the primary trunks of the brachial plexus. In all patients， the presence of hemangioma was determined during the first month of life. On examination revealed localization， prevalence and functional impairment determined by palpation symptoms \"squeezing and filling. Soreness occurred in 4 patients. Pulsation determined on 5 formations. All formations were soft consistency， immobile performing imaging studies was limited. Age of children was not always allowed to perform certain research. At the same time， ultrasound， angiography， and magnetic resonance imaging were performed in all children.\n\n【8】Ultrasound examinations of hemangiomas were performed using high-resolution linear encoder 8 MHz. To rate blood flow was applied pulse Doppler and color mapping of the flow. With the help of electronic meters measured linear sizes ofhemangiomas， and using a ruler stroke a path and calculates the area of hemangiomas. Carrying out ultrasound investigation in 14 patients with hemangiomas， allowed us to set the depth of lesion， clarify the localization of hemangioma， anatomic topographical relationship of the tumor to the surrounding tissues， degree of interest of main vessels and blood flow speed in the formation and in parenchyma. In our observations sizes ofhemangiomas ranged from 5.0 cm x 4.0 cm to 17.0 cm x 9.0 cm. Formation had irregular shapes， deckle-edged. Sonographic signs of capsule were detected only in 3 cases and corresponded to cavernous forms. During Doppler ultrasound in 9 patients with cavernous and mixed hemangiomas in formations identified blood flow. It was characterized by \"mosaic\"view due to multiple un-and hypoechogenic areas of irregular shape with a diameter- 0.2 cm， representing the vessel lumen. With angiography identified the sources and variations of blood supply in the affected area， localization， sizes and character of vascular changes. In 4 patients formation sprouted into the surrounding tissues and had a relationship with a major vascular system， studied blood flow speed， and also 2 patients conduct differential diagnostics of complex of hemangiomas with different forms angiodysplasias. Magnetic resonance imaging performed on the MRI’s magnetic field of 1.5tesla. Scanning was planned in three mutually perpendicular planes-axial， sagittal， coronal， mode T1-T2-weighted images. On magnetic resonance imaging in all patients indicated the presence of soft tissue formation， inhomogeneous structure with hyper intense areas.\n\n【9】Surgery was performed under general anesthesia with the use of microsurgical techniques， increase (microsurgical loupe)， microsurgical instruments and hyperfine suture material.\n\n【10】13 patients were performed stage endovascular embolization (up to 4-5 times) followed by excision offormation under magnification to5 times. In these operations notechnical difficulties were encountered， as hemangiomas were sclerosed. Blood loss was minimal. Difficulties were raised in the allocation of the anatomical structures of the neck from sclerosed tissue.\n\n【11】Case Presentation\n\n【12】Patient “K\" 1 year 4 months has been hospitalized with the diagnosis： \"Tumor formation left to neck with compression of the nerve trunks of cervical and brachial plexus\". Complained on the presence of a painful neck tumor formation， labored breathing， movement disorders of the head and left upper extremity， sleep disorder.\n\n【13】From the words of her mother she has the formation from birth The formation still is increasing. Over the last month pain appeared in the field of formation， labored breathing， movement disorders of the head and left upper extremity， sleep disorder. Over the entire period formation has changed color from flesh to cyanotic-purple. locally： on the left side of the neck with the transition to the front and back surfaces has a tumor formation， rounded shape， sizes 16.0cm x 9.0 cm， holding % of the perimeter surface of the neck， purple colored， moderately painful， soft-elastic consistency， immobile， pulsing. During Valsalva probe has been a sharp expansion of the internal jugular vein. Active and passive movements of the left upper extremity are painful .\n\n【14】Besides general clinical examination conducted instrumental methods of research. Doppler ultrasound： cavernous hemangioma of the neck on the left. Common carotid artery and internal jugular vein are passable. Thoracic aortography： Angiographic picture volumetric formation of the left half of the neck . Magnetic resonance imaging of soft tissues of the neck： soft-tissue formation in the projection of the soft tissues of the neck on the left . Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain： residual signs of encephalopathy with unexpressed ventriculomegalia. The formation of cervical region on the left ECG result： sinus bradycardia.\n\n【15】Patient was examined by oncologist， cardiologist， maxillofacial0m surgeon， pediatrician， vessel surgeon. Consilium recommended phasingendovascular embolization followed by excision offormation.\n\n【16】Patient underwentUunsuccessful attempt of endovascular destruction in relation with the throw back of a contrasting substance into the internal jugular vein which could worsen the condition of the child. Considering to growth of labored breathing， pain syndrome， clinic of compression the nerve trunks of the brachial and cervical plexus， been decided not to perform the second attempt of embolization and remove the formation.\n\n【17】Under general anesthesia using a 2.5-fold increase was performed operation： excision of tumor formation of the neck. Operation stages： after appropriate processing of the surgical field， to reduce the amount of blood loss as possible， performed finger \"pushed out\" of formation， while formation became flesh colored. At the base of the tumor imposed mild intestinal clamps. The skin over the bloodless formation dissected in obliquely-longitudinal direction. At revision：the formation is a cellular structure without a capsule， intimately soldered with sub clavian vein， common carotid artery to the bifurcation level， grows into the neck muscles， intimately soldered to the nerve trunks ofthe cervical and brachial plexus， thyroid cartilage. Tumor nourishment was carried out of the pool of the common carotid artery， branch ofthe thyroid-cervical trunk. Outflow of blood is carried by the supraclavicular vein . It was performed removal offormation with excision of superficial neck muscles， partial excision of the sternocleidomastoid， scalenes muscles. Alloying of the nourishment vessels of formation with excision of supraclavicular vein . Blood loss was 50 ml the resulting defect of covering tissues was removed by plastic with local tissues . Active wound drainage. Pathology-histological conclusion： Juvenile capillary hemangioma of the neck. Postoperatively， the patient received anti- bacterial， anti-inflammatory therapy. The general condition has stabilized. Sutures are removed on the 11h day. Child had been discharged in satisfactory condition with the recommendations.\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】In control of the ultrasound examination after 1 year was performed， no recidive growth of formation . All patients were examined at various time intervals after surgery recidive growth of formation is not revealed. Thus， the optimal treatment of hemangiomas is a stage endovascular embolization followed by surgical removal of formation. In the absence of conditions for endovascular embolization， if exist contraindications for the use of propranolol we prefer operative treatment using microsurgical techniques and bloodless technologies.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:33:05", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:33:15", "cost": 9.345}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:45", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:33:14", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:33:05"}

Seven cases appeared in 37-dayperiod in premature babies and one died. GLB appeared on average 18 days postnatally， when enteral feeding reached 130 ml/kg/day. The first symptoms were seen 2.4 days before diagnosis， including abdominal distension， vomiting and regurgitation of curd milk. Diagnosis was made by X-ray in each case. Treatment was medical for three cases and surgical in four cases. Prematurity， consumption of Premature Formula milk (PF)，enhanced caloric density， and combining PF with medium chain triglycerides were the main predisposing factors.\n\n【2】Keywords： Bezoar； Newborn； West indies； Enterocolitis； Necrotizing； Enteral nutrition\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】A bezoar is a trapped mass located in the gastrointestinal system， usually in the stomach， classified according to its major constituents： trichobezoar (hair)， phytobezoar (plant material)and lactobezoar (milk). A lactobezoar is an aggregation of mucus with undigested milk constituents. There are several factors that are associated with increased likelihood of lactobezoar formation， including prematurity， low birth weight， an immature gastro-intestinal tract， dehydration， and enteral nutrition with formulas that have a high caloric density or that contain casein or Medium Chain Triglycerides (MCT) . Lactobezoar may occur in full term babies that have been breastfed， but this has only been reported very rarely. Gastric Lactobezoar (GLB) is the most common type of bezoar but it is a rare pathology， only described in medical literature around 100 times since 1959. Classical symptoms ofGLB are abdominal distension， emesis， diarrhea， and an abdominal mass. Diagnosis is most easily made by X-ray， which may show a large radio-opaque mass resembling a “sandwich loaf’ or “gingerbread”located in the stomach； this description is pathognomic for GLB. Diagnosis can otherwise be made using ultrasound， which should demonstrate a large， heterogeneous， hyperechoic mass in the stomach . Medical treatment comprises discontinuation of oral feeding， intravenous fluids and parenteral nutrition， gastric lavage and N-acetyl-cysteine in order to encourage disintegration of the bezoar . Sometimes， lactobezoar may result in gastric outlet obstruction and complications such intestinal pneumatosis that require surgery .\n\n【5】In 2013 we saw seven cases of this rare neonatal pathology in a time period of just 37 days in our NICU. Four of the affected neonates required surgery and one died. This was a notable event not only for the severity of the outcomes and the rarity of such a cluster， but also that it was the first time we had seen this pathology in our unit since it opened in 1990， despite the fact that there had been no changes to our enteral feeding protocols for four years.\n\n【6】The aim of our study was to analyze each case individually to look for predisposing factors， as well as analyzing the nutritional process to find any anomalies in milk reconstitution or potential sources of contamination， in order to understand the cluster and to prevent further cases.\n\n【7】Case Series\n\n【8】A retrospective analysis was performed for all cases of GLB in our unit. Inclusion criteria for the analysis were defined as any patient with an abnormal radiological picture consistent with GLB， as well as one of the following： gastric perforation， necrotizing enterocolitis (according to\n\n【9】Table 1： Cases of gastric lactobezoar： potential predisposing factors.\n\n| GA  | Type of diet  | Type of Milk  | Duration PF (d)  | Caloric density (Kcal/100 ml)  | ml/kg/d at diagnosis  | Duration MCT+PF(d)  | Surgery  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 27  |  | PF+HM  | 5  | 87  | 153  | 9  | Y  |\n| 30  | C+D  | PF  | 9  | 86  | 129  | 15  | Y  |\n| 33  | D  | PF  | 9  | 80  | 145  | 0  | Y  |\n| 36  |  | PF+HM  | 5  | 87  | 153  | 4  | Y  |\n| 32  | C+D  | PF+HM  | 3  | 80  | 120  | 2  | N  |\n| 33  | D  | PF  | 9  | 80  | 112  | 0  | N  |\n| 35  | D  | PF+HM  | 3  | 80  | 160  | 0  | N  |\n\n【11】GA： Gestational Age； C： Continuous enteral feeding； D： Discontinuous enteral feeding； PF： Premature formula； HM： Human Milk； MCT： Median Chain Triglyceride；Y：Yes； N：No；d： Day； Kcal/100 ml： Kilocalories per 100 milliliters； ml/kg/d： milliliters per kilogram per day the modified Bell's stage) . We only included neonates that were hospitalized in our NICU (Fort de France， Martinique and French West Indies) between 1 July 2013 to 3m October 2013. We collected the following data for each patient： gestational age， birth weight and size， mode of delivery， neonatal resuscitation， type of nutrition(parenteral or enteral) at the time of diagnosis， abdominal signs at diagnosis (regurgitation， emesis， abdominal distension)， and the need for surgical intervention. We also collected data on some possible predisposing factors： whether enteral feeding was continuous or discontinuous， the type of milk used enteral supplementation， milk composition， use of MCT， discrepancy between the milk composition and medical prescription， possible sources for contamination， and bacteria cultured from the milk or patients. Descriptive statistics comprising counts and proportions， means， medians， were done as appropriate with Excel 2013. IRB approved the study.\n\n【12】Results\n\n【13】Description of cases\n\n【14】Seven cases were diagnosed in a 37 day period， from 24h August to 3r October 2013 . The affected neonates were all male and premature， ranging from extremely premature to moderately premature (mean： 32.3 GA； 27 to 36 GA). We did not find that the mode of delivery was a risk factor： four of the neonates were born by vaginal delivery and three by caesarean-section. Two ofthem required immediate resuscitation， both recovering within a few minutes. On average the diagnosis of GLB was made 18 days postnatally(minimum 5 days， maximum 56 days)； the first signs appeared 2.4days before diagnosis and commonly included abdominal distension， regurgitation and/or vomiting of curd milk (in 5 cases， 71%). X-ray imaging wasperformed in every case，showinga\"sandwichloaf image which is pathognomicfor GLB . No gastric ultrasounds were performed because the X-ray results were sufficiently convincing. In terms of treatment， we initially used a medical approach： enteral nutrition was stopped and parenteral nutrition commenced， and we performed gastric lavage with N-acetyl-cysteine. Antibiotics were used in four cases due to suspicion of abdominal sepsis mimicking necrotising enterocolitis. These cases all required surgery as they did not respond despite best medical management. The diagnosis of GLB was confirmed during these surgeries by macroscopic observation. The least premature baby (36 GA) died of multiple organ failure a few days after surgery.\n\n【15】Potential predisposing factors\n\n【16】All the affected neonates were fed before their diagnosis by continuous or discontinuous enteral nutrition using reconstituted milk powder (premature formula，PF)； two of them had breastfeeding in complement. In addition， four of them received MCT enterally(Liprocil). We analyzed the nutritional composition ofthe milk given to all babies in the unit and found no discrepancies between the milk given and the milk prescribed. The typical composition of the PF milk for the neonates on our unit was (by % of total mass) casein 14.5%， total protein 15.8%， with a protein/casein ratio of 0.069 and a sodium content of 0.39 d/100 ml. The diagnosis of GLB was made in these babies whilst the volume of their enteral feeds was being increased， occurring on average when the volume reached 130 ml/kg/day. Three out of the four babies who underwent surgery were fed with more than 80 kcal/kg/day with PF supplemented by MCT . All of the bacterial cultures taken from milk bottles and the affected children's secretions or blood were negative. We did not identify any sources of contamination in the neonatal unit.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】This is the first publication describing a GLB cluster. As it is a rare pathology it usually occurs as an isolated case， in different units and with a long timeframe which introduces many variables to consider. It was for this reason that we decided to investigate the cluster to understand what could be causing it， make changes to our protocols and stop this cluster as soon as possible. The death of one of our patients demonstrates the highly dangerous nature of the condition. It can be difficult to make a diagnosis of GLB because the clinical signs are commonplace in neonates， and many occur in perfectly healthy babies with no underlying pathology. However， early suspicion of GLB is imperative， as the pathology is severe and requires timely management， and the more severe signs that lead to diagnosis may be preceded by subtler clinical signs. The presence of both abdominal distension and vomiting/regurgitation of curd milk should indicate a possible diagnosis of GLB and should be investigated with imaging such as abdominal X-ray or ultrasound.\n\n【19】The severity and rare nature of the disease and the unusually high number of patients with the condition in our unit in a very short time frame required us to do some detective work to ascertain the most likely culprit. Due to the clinical presentation and the frequency of sepsis amongst the cases， we looked for a bacterial sepsis or contamination of the enteral nutrition that could have led to the formation of a GLB， but were unable to isolate any germs or likely sources of contamination. We then collected data from all the cases on all previously documented predisposing factors described in medical literature， in order to find out if one or more factors could be implicated in the onset of this cluster. Neither dehydration nor were electrolyte disturbances associated. However， we did find a correlation between other classical factors such as prematurity and use of Premature Formulas and MCT . Interestingly， the more severe cases that required surgery were those fed with a combination of PF and MCT， giving a caloric density higher than 80 kcal/100ml.The rapid increase of high calorie enteral nutrition in the context of prematurity and immature gastrointestinal function could probably explain the sudden onset of this unfamiliar pathology in our unit.\n\n【20】To make sure that there was no other explanation； we tracked a potential manufacturingerrorby precisely analyzing milkcomposition and eliminated this as a potential cause. An expert assessment of our enteral nutrition protocols didn’t show any difference between our protocols and international recommendations (European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN)). They did however hypothesise that the combination of PF and MCT (Liprocil) could have led to a saponification reaction favoring lactobezoar formation.\n\n【21】We favored this approach to enteral nutrition because in Martinique， as in many other parts of the French West Indies， many children are born with fetal growth restriction due to placental insufficiency . Thus， to improve their growth and future development， they are fed with an aggressive strategy， and enteral nutrition is introduced as soon as possible to avoid the risks of central line infection associated with parenteral nutrition . Despite the risks associated with poor growth， the severity of GLB is such that we decided to change our enteral nutrition protocols. Since the cluster， we have modified our strategies， limiting enteral nutrition to <80kcal/100 ml，prohibiting the combination of MCT and PF， and using pasteurized maternal milk for all premature neonates born at <32 GA or weighing <1500 g.\n\n【22】Since introducing these changes， we have not had any further cases of GLB. To evaluate the impact of our new enteral nutrition protocol on the neonates in our unit， we are currently carrying out a study to analyze their growth and track any adverse effects.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:06:58", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:07:23", "cost": 24.284}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:45", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:07:22", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:06:57"}

His blood pressure was 260/180 mm of Hg. There was complete visual recovery with reversal of angle closure once the blood pressure was brought under control.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Malignant hypertension is a sudden and rapid development of extremely high blood pressure. It is often associated with end organ damage including central nervous system， cardiovascular system and renal system . Prompt diagnosis and management of this condition， is essential to prevent ocular and systemic morbidities. Involvement of the eye in the form of papilledema and retinopathy， is quite often associated with malignant hypertension . We report a case of acute angle closure glaucoma due to malignant hypertension， which recovered completely once the blood pressure was brought under control.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A previously healthy， 30 years old， man presented to us， with painful loss of vision， associated with redness in his right eye， of 3 days duration. He also gave history of headache. He had no relevant medical history in the past， apart from intermittent headaches.\n\n【6】On examination his visual acuity was counting fingers at 3 feet in his right eye and 20/20 in his left eye. Anterior segment examination of the right eye  revealed， marked circum corneal congestion， sub conjunctival haemorrhage， corneal epithelial edema， shallow anterior chamber， 4mm pupil with sluggish pupillary reaction， and clear lens. Left eye  was quiet and anterior chamber was of normal depth. Intraocular pressure (IOP)， measured with applanation tonometry was 68 mm of Hg in the right eye and 20 mm of Hg in the left eye. Gonioscopy showed closed angles in the right eye  and wide open angles in the left eye. Fundus examination through undilated pupil， in the left eye revealed disc edema， splinter haemorrhages， and hard exudates in the macula. Undilated fundus evaluation of the right eye， through a hazy media， showed disc edema and splinter haemorrhages in the right eye. Ultra-sonogram， B scan of the right eye revealed choroidal effusion. His blood pressure reading was 260/180 mm of Hg.\n\n【7】With this picture， a diagnosis malignant hypertension with grade four hypertensive retinopathy in both eyes and secondaryangle closure glaucoma in the right eye， due to posterior push mechanism was made. We started him on topical antiglaucoma medication， a fixed combination of beta blocker and alpha agonist. Since the renal status of the patient was not known， oral acetazolamide and intravenous mannitol were avoided. He was immediately shifted to emergency department， oflocal government hospital. He was admitted in the intensive care unit and was started on medications to lower his blood pressure. Complete systemic evaluation was done by the internist He reviewed with us 4 weeks from the initial visit. He was on beta blocker， calcium channel blocker and angiotensin II-receptor blocker. His renal parameters were found to be normal. He was diagnosed to have malignant hypertension， resulting from primary/essential hypertension， by the internist. His blood pressure reading was 130/80. His best corrected visual acuity was 20/30 in his right eye and 20/20 in his left eye. Anterior segment evaluation was found to be normal in both eyes. Anterior chamber was of normal depth in the right eye with wide open angles on gonioscopy . His IOP was 14 and 18 mm of Hg， in his right and left eye respectively. Dilated fundus evaluation showed completely resolved disc edema in both eyes . The cup to disc ratio was 0.3 in the right eye and 0.2 in the left eye. Right eye showed nerve fibre layer defects in the superotemporal quadrant， few hard exudates， elschnig spots. Left eye showed haemorrhages， cotton wool spots， hard exudates. He was advised to stop the topical antiglaucoma medication， and his IOP was found to be normal， on follow up visit， 4weeks after stopping the medication.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Malignant hypertensionis allife threatening condition. Diagnosing this condition， in a previously normal patient， based on the fundus picture is not a rare phenomenon . However acute angle closure glaucoma associated with malignant hypertension has not been reported so far. Our patient showed a complete recovery with reversal of angle closure once the blood pressure was normalised.\n\n【10】The probable cause of acute angle closure in this patient is a posterior push mechanism， as revealed by choroidal effusion in the B scan. Interference with the venous drainage， leading to choroidal effusion， swelling and anterior rotation of the ciliary body might have caused acute angle closure. Differential diagnosis considered were posterior scleritis， angle closure associated with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) and acute primary angle closure (APAC). Ultra sonogram，B scan was not consistent with posterior scleritis. Once the corneal edema cleared， fundus picture was very well co-related with the features of malignant hypertension， ruling out CRVO. The visual recovery was good， consistent with previous case report on malignant hypertension . Examination of the fellow eye helped us to rule out APAC.\n\n【11】This case report highlights the importance of examination of the fellow eye， which helped us not only to rule out APAC， but also made us to think of malignant hypertension. Baseline systemic evaluation is a must， in all the patients presenting with such high intraocular pressure. Often we tend to bring down the IOP， with all the available antiglaucoma medications including intravenous mannitol and oraallacetazolamide. Administering1intraveno11S mannitoland acetazolamide might be fatal in such patients， since they can have impaired renal function . Malignant hypertension has very poor prognosis in the absence of treatment. It needs to be managed by concerned specialist to limit the consequences.\n\n【12】Conclusion\n\n【13】To conclude， malignant hypertension should be considered as one of the differential diagnosis in patients presenting with acute secondary angle closure.Conservative management and control of hypertension will be sufficient to reverse the angle closure.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:19:41", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:20:12", "cost": 31.726}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:45", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:20:13", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:19:41"}

The clinical examination is variable， which may include from asymptomatic patients to sepsis. It is often misinterpreted during diagnosis which may lead to delay in defining a correct intervention. In this case report we describe a thoracic gossypiboma after 30 years from the primary surgical intervention. We highlight the patient symptoms when admitted to the hospital，the exams pipeline which helped unveil the case of a gossypiboma， and the rationale behind the intervention decision. Computed Tomography images were conclusive for supporting the clinical decision and to guide the surgical intervention.\n\n【2】Keywords： Gossypiboma； Textiloma； Surgical complication； Foreign body\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Gossypiboma， can also be recognized as textiloma， which defines the presence of surgical material (e.g.， cotton swabs， bandages etc.) left in the body after a procedure. The foreign material elicits a granulomatous reaction in response to the local inflammation . The word“Gossypiboma”derives from the Latin language Gossypium and means “cotton”， but also from the Kiswahili boma， \"local of occultation”. The first report of secondary complications caused by surgical material dates from 1884， and was described by Wilson. Nowadays， the increase in the occurrence of Gossypibomas can be explained by the number of emergency surgeries performed， especially in obesity cases . Although increased， these surgical complications are rare， particularly for intrathoracic cases. Additionally， in the current literature the described gossypiboma diagnosed several years after the primary surgery are thoracic ones . The clinical conditions described on those occurrences vary from mild cases to severe ones， where fever， dyspnea， abscesses， fistula and perforations are found . The diagnosis usually happens during the intraoperative monitoring. However， tomographic exams can reveal with precision the gossypiboma formation and support in the clinical decision . In fact， due to the low occurrence of such a rare pathology， it is often underreported， which may lead to inaccurate diagnosis and lack of adequate treatment . Therefore， herein we describe a case of thoracic gossypiboma evidenced in the Hospital das Clinicas， a university hospital of Sao Paulo， Brazil. The reported case was identified 30 years after the thoracic surgical procedure， and the need of a complicated surgical intervention.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】The patient presenting the thoracic gossypiboma was a 47 years old male， smoker， and with drug abuse history. The patient was admitted to the emergency room suffering from fever， cough with hemoptysis， dyspnea， and chest pain. The patient had been treated with antibiotics and presented partial improvement. After preliminary insights given by X-ray exams ， a chest tomography  was performed and revealed a heterogeneous mass in the right hemithorax parenchyma.\n\n【7】This patient clinical data confirmed a previous surgery of laparotomy to remove a gunshot projectile in the early 90s， where hepatic， diaphragm and colon lesions were identified on that occasion. However， further details in regards to the surgical approach were not available. After a joint case discussion with the thoracic surgeryand radiology team， we opted for a video thoracoscopy approach. In the intraoperative period， given the technical difficulty due to pleural adhesions near the right diaphragm， it was decided to perform the thoracotomy procedure as well as a middle and lower right lobectomy. Upon inspection of the surgical specimen， we identified a disintegrating surgical compress associated with purulent fluid .\n\n【8】In the postoperative period， the patient presented a condition compatible with pulmonary sepsis， requiring vasoactive drugs and antibiotic therapy for gram-negative and anaerobes. In less than 24h， the patient presented loss of consciousness and worsening of breath， requiring intubation. A bronchoscopy procedure revealed a secretion occluding the right main bronchus， justifying the intercurrence. After aspiration of the secretion plus use of antibiotics therapy， the patient evolved with progressive clinical improvement， with interruption of vasoactive drugs， as well as successful extubation after 72 h of the procedure. He was discharged， without the need of oxygen support or any identified clinical sequelae .\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Gossypiboma is described as the presence of a foreign body， usually a surgical compress orgauze， which induces a local inflammatory reaction . It is a rare pathology being reported with a frequency between 1/1000-1/10，000 performed surgeries. This data can be underestimated， since it involves medical error and legal implications . Furthermore， the data found in the literature are based on old studies， and the real incidence in the last decade is practically unknown. In addition， case reports on Gossypibomas in the chest are much less frequent than in other body sites， while the abdomen is the most frequent ones . Regarding only intrathoracic sites， descriptions in the pleural and pericardial cavities are the most frequent ones .\n\n【11】Surgical pads and gauze are usually made of inert cotton， thus not stimulating specific inflammatory reactions and granuloma formation in the body. For this reason， many patients remain asymptomatic for long periods， with descriptions reporting intervals of up to 47 years until diagnosis of gossypibomas . However， in some cases， there is a predominantly exudative response， which may evolve to a secondary infection and abscess formation or fistulization .\n\n【12】By understanding the pathophysiology of gossypiboma， the broad symptomatology of this group of patients becomes clear. Machado et al. in a Brazilian observational study involving 16 cases of gossypiboma， chest pain was the most prevalent symptom described(68.75%)， followed by cough (56.25%) and dyspnea (25%)， while only one patient was asymptomatic (6.25%) . Similar cases have been reported worldwide， for instance， Cheng et al. in a review of six cases， described that only two (33.3%) were asymptomatic .\n\n【13】Chest computed tomography is the best diagnostic method to detect gossypibomas and the associated complications， especially when radiopaque markers are used. The radiological alterations usually found ingossypibomas are well-definedmasses with hyperdense margin， with central air bubbles and a swirl-like pattern(curvilinear stripes with high density) . Over time， the air trapped in the cotton fibers of the foreign body， responsible for the classic spongiform pattern， can be reabsorbed， and the lesion， in this case， appears as a solid hyperdense mass. The radiopaque marker in this later phase is essential to help differentiate the gossypibomas from other masses， for example， neoplasms or hydatid cysts . In some cases， however， there is persistence of bubbles despite a long-time interval， and a differential diagnostic of aspergilloma， intrapulmonary abscess or bronchiectasis may be considered .\n\n【14】Other imaging methods， such as chest X-ray， ultrasonography， magnetic resonance imaging and Positron Emission Tomography(PET-CT)) have alreadybeendescribed as alternativesfor gossypiboma diagnosis， however， all with nonspecific findings . Percutaneous biopsy of the mass can be performed， which usually shows cotton fibers， confirming the diagnosis of Gossypiboma based on computed tomography imaging. However， the biopsy becomes unnecessary after a conclusive diagnosis of gossypiboma， since the only therapeutic alternative is the surgery to remove the mass .\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】Intrathoracic gossypiboma is a rare pathology， often unknown and not promptly recognized by the doctors. Misinterpretation leads to unnecessary interventions and delays in the surgical approach， which may increase the risk of more complications， such as formation of abscesses or fistulas. Thus， the gossypiboma diagnosis supported by imaging exams (especially by computed tomography) and early intervention， together with patient safety policies during surgeries， are essential in order to avoid this condition and its potential complications.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:44:51", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:45:05", "cost": 13.416}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:45", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:45:04", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:44:51"}

They are usually benign， incidental findings on brain images and asymptomatic.\n\n【2】Case： We report a case of a 48-year-old man with an acute headache and transient visual symptoms due to an occipital sulcus Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH). Extensive diagnostic workup revealed an occipital DVA with an idiopathic mechanism of bleeding.\n\n【3】Conclusion： To the best of our knowledge this is the first reported case of an occipital sulcus SAH due to a DVA with an idiopathic mechanism of bleeding. The treatment of an intracranial hemorrhage due to a DVA will depend on the presenting symptoms and the pathophysiology of bleeding.\n\n【4】Keywords： CNS Venous angioma； Subarachnoid hemorrhage； Headache； DVA\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Developmental Venous Anomalies (DVAs)， previously known as venous angiomas， are the most common brain vascular abnormalities and are composed of a series of small radially arranged veins that drain into a dilated central vein  these are generallylocated in the frontal subcortical white matter and drain to the superficial or deep cerebral venous system . Microscopically，the venous tissue is， for the most part， apparently normal with little changes of endothelial thickening and hyalinization .\n\n【7】Between 13% to 40% of DVAs are associated with Cerebral Cavernous Malformations (CCM)， and a smaller percentage with other types of intracranial vascular malformations， dermatological syndromes or superficial head and neck venous malformations . Isolated DVAs are generally incidental findings on brain images， asymptomatic and considered benign . Nonetheless， case series and case reports have associated them with epilepsy， headache， focal neurological deficits and Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH) . A study of 422 patients with brain DVAs showed an annual risk of symptomatic bleeding from 0.34% to 1.28%. Most ICHs associated with DVAs are intraparenchymal . Cases of Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) in relation to DVAs have concomitant venous infarctions or intraparenchymal hemorrhage . Lovrencic-Huzjan et al. reported a case of basal cisterns SAH associated with a DVA. To the best of our knowledge there are no reports of cortical sulcus SAH associated with isolated DVA. Here we report an unusual case of an isolated occipital brain DVA presenting with cortical sulcus SAH.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 48-year-old Colombian male patient arrived at the emergency room with a history of a one day non-sudden， global， pulsating， headache of moderate intensity (7/10). One gram of acetaminophen was self-administered with short lasting relief. He complained oftransient bilateral visual loss lasting several minutes at the beginning of the headache. He denied any history of recent or remotetrauma， as well as previous headache or migraine diagnosis. The patient suffered from a stable chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy in treatment with prednisolone 20 mg daily for the last 2 years. Upon admission his blood pressure was 125/84 mmHg， heart rate 72 bpm， respiratory rate 18 pm， afebrile and a general physical examination within normal limits. On neurological examination he was awake， orientated with normal cognitive function. His neuro-ophthalmologic examination was within normal limits， including visual acuity. Cranial nerves showed no deficit.\n\n【10】Axial cut showing a left occipital sulcal linear hyperdensity (red arrow).\n\n【11】A： MRI FLAIR sequence showing a left occipital sulcal linear hyperintensity(Red arrow). B： MRI GRE sequence showing a left occipital linear hypointensity (Red arrow).\n\n【12】On motor examination， his strength was 4/5 in all four limbs (distal and proximal) with generalized hyporeflexia and a bilateral neutral plantar response. His sensory examination revealed no abnormalities and cerebellar signs were absent. There was no evidence of meningeal signs or neck stiffness.\n\n【13】A non-contrast brain Computed Tomography (CT) (Siemens128-channel CT) was performed showing a linear hyperdensity in the left calcarine sulcus . Laboratory work up including platelets， prothrombin time， and activated partial thromboplastin time were within normal limits. A nasopharyngeal swap smear for SARS-CoV-2 virus was negative. Further work up with a contrast enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI Phillips 1.5Tesla) showed hyperintensity on FLAIR  sequences and hypointensity on GRE (Gradient echo) sequences in the left calcarine sulcus with no overlying images of CCM or Arterio-Venous Malformation (AVM) . Contrast enhanced arterial and venous brain MRI angiography(Phillips 1.5 tesla) showed hypoplasia of the left anterior cerebral artery and a fetal origin of the right posterior cerebral artery without evidence of an arterial-venous malformation or fistula (Image 3A). The venous phase revealed hypoplasia of the right lateral sinus and an image compatible with a DVA in the left subcortical occipital region. There was no evidence of thrombosis or stenosis of the brain's venous system .\n\n【14】Findings of cerebrospinal fluid on lumbar puncture were： red blood cells 1440 mm (100% fresh)，proteins 114.6 mg %， 0 leukocytes A： Contrast enhanced MRA arterial phase showing A1 segment hypoplasia of the left ACA and a fetal origin of the right posterior cerebral artery (). Note the absence of vascular malformations.\n\n【15】B： MRA venous phase showing right lateral sinus hypoplasia.\n\n【16】C： MR showing dilated central vein of the DVA in the left occipital lobe (Red arrow).\n\n【17】permm'，non-reactive VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) and negative stains. Oral acetaminophen 1 gr TD was initiated with headache resolution within 48 h. On day 5 after admission， an arterial and venous brain conventional angiography was performed at another institution showing the same results as in the initial MRIs(Images not available). The patient remained without headache or visual symptoms and was discharged home with acetaminophen1 g orally in case of headache， prednisolone 20 mg 8 am for his underlying disease and neurological outpatient follow up. The patient was lost to follow-up， but there was no record of new admissions to the emergency room in our institution.\n\n【18】Discussion\n\n【19】The patient presented a headache syndrome with red flags： acute new onset headache with neurologic symptoms. Initial neuroimaging studies showed left occipital calcarine sulcus SAH. Further work up led to the conclusion of a secondary headache syndrome： An occipital sulcus SAH due to an isolated DVA. Sudden or acute severe headache and transient focal symptoms are not unusual in sulcus or convexity SAH . What is unusual in this case is its cause， the location of the DVA and the presumed pathophysiological mechanism of bleeding.\n\n【20】In a study of 23 patients in Argentina， the clinical manifestations of convexity SAH due to diverse etiologies included headache(60%)， sensory and/or motor symptoms (47%)， and epileptic seizures (30%). Six (26%) patients had thunderclap headache. Khurram et al.  described a series of 41 patients with convexity SAH transient neurological symptoms in 63% and the etiologies included： Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA) (39%)， Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome (RCVS)(17%)，cerebral venous thrombosis (10%)， intracranial atherosclerotic disease (10%) and posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome (5%). The cause was not identified in 20% of the cases. Kumar et al. reported in 29 patients with convexity SAH abrupt onset severe headache as the main manifestation in patients <60 years of age and in relation to SCVR. In patients >60 years of age the main cause was CAA with transient sensory and motor symptoms .\n\n【21】DVAs are usually asymptomatic but have been associated with ICH. The vast majority of ICH are intraparenchymal and the few SAH reported in the literature have been associated with venous infarctions， intraparenchymal hemorrhages， other brain vascular abnormalities and one case of basal cisterns SAH . Although DVAs are almost exclusively supratentorial， their most frequent location is the frontal lobe， only a few of them have been reported in the occipital lobe .\n\n【22】There are three described pathophysiological mechanism which could explain bleeding of a DVA： Imbalances of blood inflow/outflow， venous thrombosis/stenosis and cryptogenic/idiopathic. The latter being the less commonly reported . An imbalance with increased blood inflow and/or decreased outflow in the DVA can cause increased pressure and rupture . The increased inflow maybe due to an Arteriovenous Malformation (AVM) that drains into the DVA or micro shunts within it . The decreased outflow can be due to a remote increase of pressure in the brain's venous system， as it occurs in AVMs or arteriovenous fistulas . Obstruction of the venous channel of the anomaly， as in cases of thrombosis or stenosis of the DVA or the cerebral vein into which it drains， can cause increase venous pressure or rupture . Lastly， a small percentage of DVAs bleed and extensive neuroimaging work up do not reveal any additional abnormality .\n\n【23】Our patient underwent extensive neuroimaging diagnostic work up. A non-contrast CT， contrast enhanced MRI， contrast enhanced brain arterial/venous MRI and brain arterial/venous conventional digital substraction angiography showed only an occipital DVA with an overlying sulcus SAH. The final diagnosis made was a secondary headache syndrome due to a sulcus SAH with an isolated symptomatic occipital DVA with an idiopathic bleeding mechanism.\n\n【24】The management ofICH or SAH associated with a DVA depends on the symptoms， size，location， and pathophysiological mechanism of the bleeding . As the patient presented with occipital sulcus SAH， with mild symptoms that rapidly resolved， with an idiopathic bleeding mechanism， a low probability of recurrence was entertained. Symptomatic management with oral simple analgesics and outpatient follow-up was prescribed.\n\n【25】Conclusion\n\n【26】To the best of our knowledge this is the first reported case of a sulcus SAH due to an isolated occipital DVA with an idiopathic mechanism of bleeding. Sulcus/convexity SAH is in the differential diagnosis of sudden or severe headache with transient neurological symptoms. DVAs could be a rare cause of sulcus or convexity SAH. Finally， in the presence of a symptomatic DVA with ICH， it is important to understand the bleeding mechanism to guide treatment decisions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:08:20", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:08:36", "cost": 15.336}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:45", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:08:35", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:08:19"}

The purpose of this case report is to describe how multidisciplinary cardiac rehabilitation using the home-based patterns reverse left ventricular remodeling in dilated cardiomyopathy.\n\n【2】Case Report： A 29-year-old male， repeated hospitalization for heart failure with poorly controlled， received home-based tailored cardiac rehabilitation， repeated chest pain and breathing difficulties， heart fell sharply. The results of auxiliary examinations showed enlargement of heart， with left ventricular ejection fraction of 34.3%， left ventricular end diastolic diameter from 7.5 cm， left ventricular end systolic diameter from 6.2 cm. However， when we consider family economic conditions， we find that the CRT-implant therapy is not suitable for him. Meanwhile they were far removed from hospital. Afterwards， we decide to adopt multidisciplinary cardiac rehabilitation to help him to alleviate symptoms， reverse left ventricular remodeling and improve the quality of life. Then， we provide home-based CR included comprehensive assessment， scientifically tailored and individualized cardiac rehabilitation prescription and remote wireless ECG monitoring. After 7month home-based CR， his left ventricular Ejection Fraction (EF) improved from 34.3% to 62.2%， left ventricular end diastolic diameter from 7.5 cm to 5.7 cm， left ventricular end systolic diameter from 6.2 cm to 3.8 cm， VO2peak improved from 13.67 to 26.25， VO2AT (ml/kg/min) improved from 7.74 to 14.48， VE/VCO2 decreased from 41.8 to 27.6， there were no adverse events.

However he did not take medicine irregularly. Now he experienced edema of both lower limbs and progressive dyspnea with exercise intolerance again， and his condition was classified as New York Heart Association class III. Thereby， he seeks for the advanced strategies. After carefully examination， we decided to prescribe cardiac rehabilitation for him. Since the patient live in another city far from my hospital. We aim to perform home-based CR for him.\n\n【10】Table 1： Results.\n\n| Demographics  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Age  | 29  |  |\n| Height (cm)  | 175  |  |\n| Weight (kg)  | 112  |  |\n| BMI  | 36.57  |  |\n| Comorbidities  |  |  |\n| Obesity  | yes  |  |\n| Hypertension  | none  |  |\n| diabetes  | none  |  |\n| CVD  | none  |  |\n| NYHA-Cass  |  |  |\n| cardiovascular risk factors  |  |  |\n| GAD-7  | 0  | Normal  |\n| PHQ-9  | 5  | mild  |\n| PSQI  | 16  |  |\n| SF-12  | 38.75  | poor  |\n| Smoking，years  | cession 4years  |  |\n| wine  | A cup once a day  |  |\n| Diet  | A preference for meat  |  |\n| Laboratory analysis  |  |  |\n| Triglyceride mmol/l  | 1.75  |  |\n| High density lipoprotein mmolAl  | 0.94  | LOW  |\n| Low density lipoprotein mmol/l  | 2.03  |  |\n| Total cholesterol mmol/  | 3.18  |  |\n| HbA1c%  | 6.4  |  |\n| Echocardiography  |  |  |\n| LVEF，%  | 34.3  |  |\n| LVEDD，cm  | 7.5  |  |\n| LVESD， cm  | 6.2  |  |\n| Baseline CPET-performance  |  |  |\n| VO2peak (ml/kg/min)  | 13.67  |  |\n| VO2AT(ml/kg/min)  | 7.74  |  |\n| VE/VCO2  | 41.8  |  |\n| RERpeak  | 1.03  |  |\n| HRrest (beats/min)  | 84  |  |\n| HRpeak (beats/min)  | 126  |  |\n| SBPrest(mm Hg)  | not testec  |  |\n| SBPpeak (mm Hg)  | 128  |  |\n\n【12】Initial examination\n\n【13】Comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation assessment is the starting point of cardiac rehabilitation assessment.

The results are represented in Tables. Based on the above evaluation results， we formulated cardiac rehabilitation prescriptions for patients according to the guidelines of The American Heart Association and the American Society of Sports Medicine， including medication prescriptions， exercise prescriptions.\n\n【14】Table 2： Medication prescription.\n\n| Names  | Methods  | Notes  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ACE-I Acertil 4mg  | One tablet a day， once a day  |  |\n| Beta-blocker Aldosterone Carvedilol 12.5mg  | One tablet a day， twice a day  |  |\n| Vasorel 20 mg  | One tablet a day， three timesa day  |  |\n| Potassium Chloride Sustained Release Tablets500mg  | One tablet a day， three timesa day  |  |\n| Furosemide 20mg  | two tablets a day， once a day  | P.M.16：00  |\n| Spironolactone 20 mg  | One tablet a day， once a day  |  |\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】Dilated cardiomyopathy is characterized by ventricular dilatation and systolic dysfunction in the absence of known abnormal loading conditions ； it leads to recurrent occurrence of hospitalization as progression to advanced HF， eventually accounts for high all-cause mortality and heart transplantation/death. The causes or pathophysiology of heart failure in DCM may be variable， but Left Ventricular (LV) remodeling is considered the major pathway to deterioration in Left Ventricular (LV) systolic function . It’s reported that LV reverse remodeling was associated with ~50% lower mortality rates at 10-year follow-up in DCM patients . Over the decades， the Guideline-Directed Medical Therapy (GDMT) has been shown significant benefits on reversing LV remodeling and substantial functional recovery in patients with DCM. It’s widely recognized that timely therapy with Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme(ACEI) inhibitors and beta-blockers confers a LV reverse remodeling and substantial improvement of LVEF in anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy . This case firstly demonstrates the successful utilization of home-based cardiac rehabilitation to improve cardiac function and outcomes in a young male with dilated cardiomyopathy. He showed a significant improvement in peak Oxygen Consumption(VO2peak)， left ventricular ejection (%)， and left ventricular end diastolic diameter from baseline after 2 years multidisciplinary cardiac rehabilitation based on tailored exercise training， combining with tailored psychological intervention， dietary counseling， risk factors control， advice on refraining from smoking and leisure physical activity . Numerous studies have reported favourable effect of exercise-based CR on LA volume， left ventricular geometry and function， and cardiac prognosis in patients with Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) . Isao Nishi et al.  reported that in CHF patients with advanced LV dysfunction on b-blocker therapy， exercise training successfully improves exercise capacity without adversely affecting LV remodeling or causing serious cardiac complications. However to date， there are no studies focused on CR in heart failure specifically due to dilated cardiomyopathy， future studies should work on this specific population. Significantly， in this case， the young male actually received a home-based CR model under remotely guides from our CR team. Not surprisingly， Home-Based Medical Care (HBMC) is a powerful modality which provides high-quality， patient-centered care beyond the limitation of time and space， especially， during this time of COVID-19 crisis . In this report， we indicated the safety and effectiveness of such a home-based CR program consistent with other HBMC.\n\n【18】Conclusion dilation were would have happened significantly along with the evolution. A case is reported of the using the CR in a 29-year -old man with dilated cardiomyopathy. The report demonstrated that the adoption of CR would help patients achieve better clinical treatment effect and maximize the reversal ofleft ventricular remodeling. At the same time the advantage of the home-based model was also proved to be safe and effective.\n\n【19】Table 3： Exercise prescription.\n\n|  | Frequency  | Intensity (Bases on AT}  | type  | Time(min/d)  | progression  | Notes  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Aerobic exercise  | 5days a week  | 95-105 beat/min  | walking  | initial from 5  | Gradually added to40min  |  |\n| Resistance exercise  | 3 days aweek  | Moderate  | Heellift dumbbell preacher curls  | 10  |  | Execution will begin in half a month  |\n| Breath exercise  | 5 days a week  | Moderate  | Deep breathing training  | Initial from 5  | Gradually added to 30min  |  |\n| Flexibility exercises  | 5 days a week  | Moderate  | Joint stretch (shoulder and hips)  | 10  |  |  |\n\n|  | 2018.2.5  | 2018.5.15  | 2018.8.20  | 2019.2.27  | 2019.4.24  | 2019.8.24  | 2020.5.26  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| VO2peak (ml/kg/min)  | 13.67  | 24.07  | 26.25  | 20.47  | 28.71  | 26.25  | 23.31  |\n| VO2AT (ml/kg/min)  | 7.74  | 13.58  | 14.48  | 14.61  | 14.71  | 15.27  | 13.28  |\n| VE/VCO2  | 41.8  | 29.5  | 27.6  | 30.2  | 29.4  | 27.3  | 29.7  |\n| RERpeak  | 1.03  | 1.25  | 1.12  | 1.06  | 1.13  | 1.12  | 1.10  |\n| HRrest (beats/min)  | 84  | 82  | 74  | 94  | 85  | 98  | 115  |\n| HRpeak (beats/min)  | 126  | 162  | 160  | 148  | 169  | 169  | 173  |\n| SBPrest (mm Hg)  | Not testec  | 104  | 106  | 113  | 111  | 149  | 166  |\n| SBPpeak (mm Hg)  | 128  | 149  | 155  | 130  | 165  | 161  | 196  |\n\n【22】Abbreviations： VO2peak： Peak Oxygen Consumption； VO2AT： Oxygen Consumption At Anaerobic Threshold； VE/VCO2slope： The Slope of Increase in Ventilation Over Carbon Dioxide Output； RERpeak： Respiratory Exchange Ratio at Peak Exercise； Wattmax： Maximal Workload； HRrest： Heart Rate at Rest； HRpeak： Heart Rate at Peak Exercise SBPrest： Systolic Blood Pressure at Rest； SBPpeak： Systolic Blood Pressure at Peak Exercise\n\n【23】Table 5： The changes in UCG.\n\n|  | 2018.01.23  | 2018.5.15  | 2018.8.20  | 2019.8.21  | 2020.5.26  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Left ventricular ejection (%)  | 43.3  | 45.2  | 62.2  | 55.5  | 60.3  |\n| Left ventricular end diastolic diameter  | 7.5  | 6.9  | 5.7  | 6.0  | 6.2  |\n| Left ventricular end systolic diameter  | 6.2  | 5.3  | 3.8  | 4.2  | 4.2  |", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:07:25", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:07:59", "cost": 34.002}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:45", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:07:58", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:07:24"}

Especially severe deformities according to Keblish classification are challenging cases for orthopedic surgeons. These patients require a serious preoperative planning prior to surgery. Herein， we shared a our case with a 67-year-old woman with 45° valgus knee deformity with congenital hip dislocation on the right lower limb， which was classified as a severe deformity according to Keblish classification. Knee examination revealed 60° flexion and almost complete extension of right knee. As a result of our planning， we decided to use a Rotating Hinge Knee (RHK) prosthesis to maintain bone and soft tissue balance. The NexGen RHK prosthesis was preferred to correct deformity. Fracture of the medial femoral condyle occurred and fixed as intraoperative complication. The Knee Society Score (KSS) increased from 40 to 91. Patient stated that knee pain completely resolved and could be mobilized easily. RHK prosthesis is an important option for correction deformity in patients with severe valgus knee deformity. Long-term follow-up of these patients is needed to determine the siiccess rate.\n\n【2】Keywords： Osteoarthritis； Keblish classification； Valgus knee deformity； Knee society score； Rotating hinge knee prosthesis\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) is a commonly used procedure to treat osteoarthritis and correct knee deformity and valgus deformity is present in approximately 10% of patients in need of TKA . Keblish classification shows the grading of valgus deformity by measuring Femorotibial Angle (FTA) on X-ray. According to Keblish classification mild deformity angle is <15°， moderate deformity angle is between 15°to 30°and severe deformityangle is>30°. In TKA， bone defects and soft tissue tensions are very important in deciding the type of prosthesis. Usually primary implants are sufficient after appropriate releasing of soft tissues in the lateral portion of knee， especially mild and some moderate deformities. The use of varus-valgus constrained prostheses in moderate and some severe deformities give good results . But most of the severe deformities have bone defect or ligament instability， so these patients need Rotating Hinged Knee (RHK) prostheses .RHK prostheses are particularly successful in adjusting severe coronal plan deformities and soft tissue balance . But RHK prostheses may cause some complications. Especially sagittal alignment failures may cause early loosening of the prosthesis . Nonetheless， when we look at the literature， the publication rate ofloosening of RHK prostheses is low .\n\n【5】Many diseases can cause the development of valgus deformity in the knee. These include congenital causes， osteoarthritis， rheumatologic diseases，posttraumatic arthritis and overcorrection of valgus osteotomies . Especially valgus deformities >20° are difficult cases for orthopedic surgeons .\n\n【6】Here we report a 67 year-old woman 45°× knee valgus deformity patient with ipsilateral congenital hip dislocation. These patients are rare and require serious planning for treatment . We successfully treated this patient with RHK prosthesis.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 67-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with complaints of gait disorder and right knee pain. Physical examination revealed a 5 cm shortening in the right leg， valgus deformity on the right knee and external tibial torsion on the same leg . Knee examination revealed 60°flexion and almost complete extension of right knee. Medial Collateral Ligament (MCL) was slack and Lateral Collateral Ligament(LCL) was contracture. The patella was in the trochlear groove， but it was very fixed. Hip examination of the same limb showed 45° of flexion， but internal and external rotation was very limited. Through the above examination， Knee Society Score (KSS) of patient was assessed to be 40 .\n\n【9】We performed detailed measurements and evaluation before the operation. Because of the presence of congenital hip dislocation in the same extremity， we recommended the shortened total hip replacement surgery to compensate for patellar alignment. However， our patient refused the hip operation， saying that she did not have any complaints from her hip so we decided to do only knee replacement surgery. We thought that it would be appropriate to use rotating hinge knee prosthesis because the MCL was very loose and there was severe bone loss in the lateral femoral condyle.\n\n【10】X-ray examination of patient revealed ankylosis in the left hip， Crowe type 4 congenital hip dislocation in the right hip， severe valgus deformity (45°FTA) in the right knee and external tibial torsion in the right calf . According to the Keblish classification， this patient was classified as a severe deformity . Although the tibial plateau was intact， there was severe bone loss， especially in the lateral femoral condyle .\n\n【11】We applied our tourniquet and tranexamic acid protocol for bleeding control. We preferred to reach the knee joint with a medial parapatellar approach. Lateral femoral condyle was relatively small compared to medial femoral condyle. Especially the MCL was not competent. We have seen osteophyte formation in many different regions of the knee. Anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments were degenerated in the femoral notch. Medial and lateral menisci were worn and calcified. There was severe cartilage loss and arthritis of the femoral， tibial and patella joint surfaces and again severe tibial extorsion. correct after surgery . The movement of the knee joint ranged from 0° to 90° .\n\n【12】Our only intraoperative complication was fracture of the medial femoral condyle during the test. We fixed the broken condyle with two 4.5 mm cannulated screws. Then we placed cemented prosthesis on the fixed condyle. The X-ray image showed prosthesis position. We had no postoperative complications. We started rehabilitation on the first postoperative day and mobilized without weight bearing for 3 weeks. The patient was regularly followed up 1year after surgery. There was no loss of range of motion within the following year. The KSS had improved to 82 at the 1-month follow up， 88 at the 1-year follow up and 91 at the 2-year follow up. Patient and her relatives were given permission to publish this case report.\n\n【13】After resection of the hyperplastic osteophyte and sinovium， the popliteus tendon was first released. Then LCL was completely incised from the femoral adhesion site. Subsequently， iliotibial band was released and flexion and extension gaps were balanced.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】Based on the preoperative X-ray， we selected the femoral canal in the medial femoral condyle as the entry point for the intramedullary guide. A large cystic formation was seen in the lateral femoral condyle after making femoral resections . After curetting this cyst， we filled the interior with spongious bone from the resections. After the internal and external rotation， tautness of the knee joint and alignment were tested， The NexGen RHK (Zimmer， USA) prosthesis (tibia size 2/80 mm， femur size C/100 mm， patella 29 mm and polythene 12 mm) was installed. The patella was dislocated and did not enter the trochlear groove. Thus， firstly the lateral patellar retinaculum was released. After that the 8 mm patellar resection was made and patellar component was placed in the superomedialportion of the patella and the patella was reduced. Knee joint alignment was Herein， we shared a our case with a 67-year-old woman with severe valgus knee deformity angle (45°)， which was classified as a severe deformity according to Keblish classification. During surgery we released the popliteus tendon，LCL and iliotibial band respectively to maintain joint balance. RHK implants was preferred because of severe bone deformity and ligament laxity. These implants are very useful for TKA in patients with moderate and severe genuvalgum. In the literature， different results regarding the use of rotating hinge implants in primary TKA have been reported . Although some authors claim that rotating hinge implants have very good clinical outcomes and long-term survival， higher rates of complications have been reported compared to another authors . However， we preferred this prosthesis in our surgery because RHK prosthesis was the most appropriate option for our case.\n\n【16】A wide range of approaches to the knee joint， such as medial parapatellar， lateral parapatellar， subvastus and midvastus can be used. Medial and lateral parapatellar are more suitable for valgus knee deformities. We preferred the medial parapatellar approach in our case because we did not have enough experience， although the lateral parapatellar approach provided ease in releasing the lateral structures.\n\n【17】Patella subluxation or dislocation in the valgus knee is a common condition. Patellar dislocation due to congenital disorders can be classified into 3 groups. These are soft tissue and joint laxity， patellar hypoplasia and skeletal dysplasia of the femur and tibia， soft tissue fibrosis and contracture . Usually patellar alignment can be corrected with knee arthroplasty in mild to moderate knee valgus deformities. However， lateral patellar retinaculum， popliteus tendon and lateral portion of gastrocnemius releasing， even anteromedial tibial tubercle transfer， may be necessaryto correct patellar alignment in severe deformities. In our case， we primarily released the lateral patellar retinaculum and the popliteus tendon to correct the patellar trajectory. However， the patellar trajectory did not improve. Then we medialized the patella using the patellar component and thus obtained a correct patellar alignment. Tibial tubercle osteotomy was our preferred method and it was not necessary.\n\n【18】The risk of peroneal nerve injury is higher in the knees with valgus deformity and its incidence is about 2% to 3%.One of the major causes of peroneal nerve injury is correction of knee flexion contracture. We did not think that peronel nerve dissection during surgery will be beneficial. Therefore， we do not prefer to perform peroneal nerve dissection due to the risk of iatrogenic injury. To prevent peroneal nerve palsy， the knees are placed in the 20° flexion position for 3 to 4 days postoperatively and active-passive range of motion exercises are performed . In our case， no neurological deficitswere found in thepreoperative and postoperative examinations.\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】In summary， in a case with congenitalhip dislocation and 45·knee valgus deformity of same extremity，RHK prosthesis was successfully applied and the patient's knee pain was relieved and it was easier to walk. Appropriate methods were preferred and patellar alignment was achieved. There was no peroneal nerve palsy after surgery， although it was a serious risk. Since there are limited studies in the literature about long-term results of rotating hinge knee prostheses， therefore， close follow-up is necessary to obtain information about long-term outcomes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:47:56", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:48:09", "cost": 13.403}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:45", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:48:08", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:47:55"}

PNH is based on a clonal defect of hematopoietic stem cells characterized by deficiency in glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored surface proteins due to mutations within the X-chromosomal PIG-Agene . PNH is an acquired hemolytic anemia associated with an increased risk to develop thrombocytopenia， atypical venous thrombosis and hypo plastic bone marrow .\n\n【6】We report the first case in the literature of Off-Pump Coronary Revascularization using Bilateral Internal Thoracic Arteries in a patient with paroxismal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.\n\n【7】Case Report\n\n【8】A 36-year-old man presented to the emergency department for acute non- ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) with elevation of troponins. Previous medical history included dilated cardiomyopathy with dyspnea funtional class II-III in study and coronary disease of three vessels. In addition， the patient presented paroxismal nocturnal hemoglobinuria diagnosed in 2016 and treated with Eculizumab. On admission， laboratory tests exhibited normal kidney function (blood urea nitrogen of 29mg/dl and creatinin of 0.93 mg/dl) and normal liver function. Leucocytes 4690/mm’. Differential blood count revealed 53.7% neutrophils， 33.7% lymphocytes，11.1% monocytes， and 0.9% eosinophils. Hemoglobin 10.1 g/dl， Platelets 113.000/mm. Coronary angiography revealed a moderate stenosesostial and proximal in the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. There were chronicle stenoses in the proximal segment of the left circumflex coronary artery (LCX) and injury of 95 % in the third proximal of the RCA. Echocardiography showed reduced left ventricular function (Ejection fraction： 32 %)， severely dilated left ventricle and global hypokinesia. The conduits used for coronary revascularization were both internal thoracic arteries (left ITA-right ITA [LITA-RITA]). The left internal mammary artery was harvested and anastomosed to the left anterior descending artery. The technical configuration was in-situ anastomoses of the LITA to the left anterior descending artery； and the RITA， after being divided at its origin and bifurcation， was connected end to side to the in-situ LITA as a sequential T graft to two circumflex arteries. Saphenous vein grafts were anastomosed to the posterior descending coronary artery. It was reported that skeletonized harvesting of ITA offer more conduit length and was associated with a lower incidence of sternal infection so we use this technic routinely. The procedure was off-pump without complication. The patient was transferred to the ICU after surgery. During the postoperative subcutaneous heparin 5，000 units was administered 2 times daily to avoid thromboembolism. Eculizumab(900 mg) was administrated during the postoperative to optimize hematological parameters.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Thromboembolism is the most common cause of mortality in PNH， and the 4-year survival of patients presenting with thrombosis at diagnosis was only 40% before the era of eculizumab . Eculizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks terminal complement pathway by binding to C5. This drug has dramatically changed the naturalhistory ofPNH.Eculizumab increases transfusion independency，reduces the risk of further thrombotic events and also health-related quality of life.\n\n【11】Cardiac surgery in PNH patients is associated with several possible complications. PNH-induced granulocytopenia increases the risk of postoperative infection. The aggravation of hemolysis by extracorporeal circulation in cardiac surgery due to complement activation from either contact of blood with the foreign material surfaces during cardiopulmonary bypass circuit， or use of protamine to neutralize systemic heparin after cardiopulmonary bypass and tissue injury is well known . We consider that OPCABG using BITA can be safely performed with low in-hospital mortality and complications rates， even in patient with PNH. Surgical tricks and the new technology in coronary stabilizers allow surgeons to perform a complete myocardial coronary revascularization using the best available arterial conduit (BITA).

Patients commonly present with a sudden onset of back pain and progressive neurological deficit. In the majority of the cases， it is due to a hemorrhage at the thoracic spinal level of unknown aetiology. Management of such cases can present a treatment dilemma. The difficult decision of conservative vs. surgical management must be made in view of the presenting neurology and likely outcome. Here we present a case of the first presentation of leukemia presenting as query cauda equina syndrome due to a sSDH.\n\n【2】Keywords： Back pain； Cauda equine syndrome； Sepsis； Acute myeloid leukemia； Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Spontaneous Spinal Subdural Hematoma (sSDH) is a rare condition ofunknown aetiology and significant morbidity. Patients often present with acute onset of motor， sensory and/or autonomic dysfunction， coherent with the spinal level of the bleed. Management options include conservative management with best supportive treatment， percutaneous drainage or surgical decompression. There are variable outcomes reported with either management option in the literature but it has been suggested that those with mild neurological deficit should be managed conservatively and those with severe neurological deficit should undergo surgical decompression .\n\n【5】Here we present a case of a 49 year-old-female that presented as query cauda equina syndrome secondary to a sSDH. She developed a blood picture of disseminated intravascular coagulation with an unidentifiable cause and was subsequently found to have acute myeloid leukemia.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 49 year-old female shop assistant with a background of hypertension who was under investigation by her GP for systemic lupus erythematosus， due to a three month history of generalized malaise and possible butterfly rash， presented to A&E with a three day history of severe sharp lower back pain， bilateral sciatica that was worse on the left， perineal and saddle anesthesia and five episodes of urinary incontinence. The patient also reported that both her legs were feeling weak. Patient denied any fever， night sweats or weight loss. There was no history of trauma. The patient was previously independently mobile， did not smoke， drank occasionally and was not on any anticoagulation. On examination the patient was of large habitus weighing 133.2 kg and had bruising to multiple areas of her arm. Cardio， respiratory and abdominal examination was entirely normal. Her GCS was 15； cranial nerves were intact， upper limb neurological examination was normal. Lower limb neurological examination elicited weak hip flexors bilaterally (MRC scale 3/5) and reduced sensation over left L5 dermatome. The patient also had saddle anesthesia and a lax anal tone.\n\n【8】Patient’s blood tests on admission showed hemoglobin of 10°g/L，platelet of 157 (ref range 150to 450) and a raised white cell count of 17.99 (ref range 4 to 11) with a neutrophilia. Coagulation screen revealed a PT of 18 (ref range 10 to 13) with a normal APTT and fibrinogen. Biochemistry analysis showed hyponatremia of 132 mmol/L and raised CRP of 142 (ref range 0 to 5).\n\n【9】The patient underwent an urgent MRI that showed a subacute subdural hematoma extending from the cauda equina to the craniocervical junction with compression of the cauda equine . The MRI also showed an abnormal diffuse abnormal T1 low signal throughout the spine with patchy enhancement suggestive ofhematological malignancy . A CT chest， abdomen and pelvis revealed no signs of malignancy.\n\n【10】After consideration for surgery and review ofthe pathology， it was decided to manage the patient expectantly with a patient-controlled analgesia device for pain management and a short course of steroids. Repeat blood tests two days from admission revealed hemoglobin of110， a reduced platelet count of 92， white cell counts of 18.84 with a continued neutrophillia. The clotting function test revealed a PT of 19and a reduced fibrinogen of 0.9 with a clauss fibrinogen and D-dimer of 0.5 and 13，245 respectively. The developing picture of disseminated intravascular coagulation with no clear cause and abnormal signal on MRI was discussed with the hematology team. The patient underwent further investigations under the hematology team， multiple infusions of blood products to correct the clotting deficiency and empirical treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics. A bone marrow biopsy revealed an unusual case that proved to be difficult to distinguish between Blastic Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell Neoplasm (BPDCN)and AML. Theimmunophenotype suggested apicture of BPDCN although it would also be compatible with AML. However genetic analysis showed a tetrasomy of chromosome 8 and a 4 bp insertion within exon 12 of the NPM1 gene. AML with tetrasomy of chromosome 8is rare and BPDCN with NPM1 mutation has only been reported in one case report before. Furthermore， the significance and correlation of tetrasomy of chromosome 8 in BPDCN is unknown. The patient was transferred to the hematology service where she was treated with daunorubicin， cytarabine and mylotarg chemotherapy. The patient’s stay was further complicated by neutropenic colitis， urosepsis， line sepsis and respiratory failure requiring further antibiotic treatment and respiratory support on ITU.\n\n【11】The patient made a good recovery and a partial neurological recovery. On transfer to the hematology services the patient had power 5/5 in all muscle groups of the lower limb but required intermittent catheterization for bladder management. On discharge from hospital the patient was mobilizing independently but required a wheelchair for long distances.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Less than 250 cases of SSDH have been reported in literature with up to 50% reported to be sSDH. Spontaneous SSDH remain a rare entity with an incidence of 0.1/100，000 patient . Those presenting due to hematological malignancy remain a rarer subset with less than5 reported cases in literature. sSDH are most commonly reported to occur in the thoracic spine and can span between one vertebral level up to 23 vertebral levels. They have no gender predominance and are more common between the fourth to the sixth decade of life. The main presenting complaint is sharp stabbing back pain at the site of the hematoma with radiculopathy and concurrent progressive neurological deficit.\n\n【14】Traumatic SSDH (tSSDH) often arise due to spinal surgery， epidurallcatheterization， lumbarpuncture， andchiropractic manipulation. The aetiology of sSSDH is unclear but hypertension， pregnancy， arteriovenous malformations； coagulopathy， therapeutic anticoagulation or underlying neoplasms are all thought to be risk factors.\n\n【15】Various theories have been suggested as to the pathogenesis of SSDH including bleeding originating in the more vascular subarachnoid space and then extending into the subdural space due to rupture of vascular structures following a sudden raise in intra-abdominal/thoracic pressure such as when coughing， sneezing， voiding or lifting heavy objects. Others have suggested that the bleeding originates directly in the epidural space from rupture of epidural veins， arteries， cryptic angiomas， vascular malformations， hemangiomas or spinal angiomas， which can all be further exacerbated by anticoagulation therapy.\n\n【16】Hematological disorderlleeading tO coagulopathy anticoagulation therapy are thought to account for 46% of sSSDH. Other causes include ankylosing spondylitis， systemic lupus erythematosus， fibromuscular dysplasia， cystic fibrosis， polycystic kidney disease， chronic renal failure， rhabdomyolysis， rheumatoid arthritis， pregnancy and eclampsia. To date only 3 cases of leukemia have been associated with sSSDH with onlyone other case presenting as an index presentation of leukemia with sSSDH. The first case was following anticoagulation of a patient with known vertebral body osteolytic lesion from a plasma cell myeloma who developed a thoracic sSSDH and subsequent paraplegia . The second was a26-year-old male also known to have leukemia who presented with acute back pain， lower limb weakness and urinary difficulty who was found to have T9-T11 hematoma . And finally， the third case was that of 55-year-old male who presented with acute back pain who developed paraplegia and a sensory level at T1 found to have a C5-T3 hematoma who was subsequent found to have BCR-ABL gene positive Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) . It is thought that spinal malignant lesions can induce epidural inflammation， cause epidural venous plexus to become more friable and induce vertebral microfractures which can predispose to sSDH .\n\n【17】The unique features of our cases are the chronicity of the presentation， the extent ofthe hematoma from the cauda equina to the cranial-cervical junction， the remarkable sparring of motor function and the unusual histopathology/genetic makeup of the bone marrow neoplasm. The three reported cases all reported acute onset back pain with progressive motor function deterioration within 6 h to 10 h of pain onset. Our patient had a 3-day history of severe back pain with only a mid-hip flexion weakness and bladder dysfunction despite the extensive nature of the hematoma on imaging. This would lead us to hypothesis that thebleed must have occurred from thelumbarepidural venous plexus which would allow for the relatively low-pressure venous bleed clot to slowly expand over time. This would account for chronicity of presentation， the extensive bleed in the epidural space on imaging and localize the pathology to the lumbar-sacral region accounting for the presenting symptoms of bladder dysfunction with lower back pain. AML is an acquired myeloproliferative disorder of growth arrest and failure of apoptosis in myeloid lineage cells. This is thought to occur due to chromosomal translocation and genetic abnormalities. The defective myeloid cells lead to drop in red blood cells， white blood cells and platelets predisposing to bleeding and infection. AML has an incidence of 5-8/100，000 with a median age of onset of 67 years of age and AML being more common in the older population . Presentation of AML can vary from an acute onset over days in children to a chronic fatigue over months in older people but a recognized presentation at onset is DIC， which was seen in our patient. Prognosis in AML varies depending on the age of the patient a disease burden with those having the highest disease burden and advanced age fairing the worst.\n\n【18】The strongest marker of outcome in SSDH is reported to be the presence and degree of neurological deficit at presentation. Leigh et al. reported in a systematic review that patients presenting with neurosurgical deficit at presentation had a 34% chance of good recovery compared to 83% of those presenting without neurological deficit . This is supported by our case as the relative spared motor function on presentation and correlated with good ambulation on discharge. Others have also reported that delay in surgical intervention in patients presenting with neurological deficit can worsen outcome . This puts a huge onus on the treating clinician to decide whether a conservative or surgical approach is best for the patient to preserve and improve neurological function.\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】Spontaneous spinal subdural hematomas， although very rare， should be considered in any patient presenting with sudden onset sharp back pain. Thelevel of suspicion should be further heightened if there is neurological deficit and/or the patient has the aforementioned risk factors. Clinicians should understand that delay in diagnosis and treatment can lead to worsened neurological outcome.

Preoperative planning and proper management should be achieved promptly to avoid serious complications.\n\n【3】Keywords： Bilateral shoulder dislocation； Anterior； Fracture； Epilepsy\n\n【4】Background\n\n【5】Unilateral shoulder dislocation is a common injury but， bilateral shoulder fracture dislocations are uncommon event. A majority of the posterior dislocations were reported during epileptic fits (seizure)， electroconvulsive therapy， patients with neuromuscular and psychiatric disorders. Bilateral anterior fracture dislocations of the shoulder mostly caused by violent trauma， few cases were attributed to epileptic and hypoglycemic seizures.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 23 years old male patient has been presented to our hospital emergency room suffering from bilateral deformed painful shoulder after an attack of epileptic convulsive seizures forty eight hours earlier. Clinical examination findings included bilateral flattening of both shoulders with restricted painful movements in abduction and external rotation. The radial pulse felt well bilaterally， there were no signs of neurological deficit. Radiological examination revealed bilateral anterior fracture dislocation of the shoulders with symmetrical bilateral greater tuberosity fractures . After preoperative workup， Neurophysician and Anesthetic consultation as well as informed consent， the patient was taken to the theater where he was treated by closed reduction of the shoulders under general anesthesia. The bilateral greater tuberosities fractures were still displaced so； reduction and fixation were performed under image intensifier using percutaneous short threaded titanium cannulated screws and washers. The post operative check X-rays showed satisfactory reduction and fixation . The patient was kept in bilateral broad arm slings in adduction and internal rotation for five weeks， progressive mobilization started at the third week with pendulum exercises followed by electric stimulation after each session， gentle capsule stretching exercises were used for restoration of flexibility. The patient was able to resume work three months after surgery. After a period of one- year follow-up， the patient achieves an excellent recovery with bilateral comfortable range of motion in both shoulders (0 to 160) degrees abduction， internal rotation to 70 degrees to (T6) bilaterally and 60 degrees of external rotation on both sides. Clinically the patient had no signs of instability.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】The gleno-humeral joint is the most dislocatable joint in the body about 85% ofall dislocations.95%ofshoulder dislocations are anterior，10% to 15% of those are associated with greater tuberosity . In epileptic patients， although majority of bilateral shoulder dislocations are posterior，bilateralanterior dislocations are rare entity as the forces required to produce the dislocation must act synchronously and in a similar manner at both joints. Sudden violent muscular contractions and deceleration forces in extension abduction and external rotation have been reported as the main cause of bilateral anterior dislocation or fracture dislocation of the shoulder . The internal rotators of the arm overcome the external rotators forces the humerus in adduction and internal rotation during epileptic convulsions when violent muscle contraction dislocates the humeral heads posteriorly. The literature had been previously reported few cases of post traumatic bilateral anterior dislocations of the shoulders . As the greater tuberosity was displaced in approximately 10% to 15% of all anterior dislocations， anatomical reduction and internal fixation should be achieved properly because failed management can lead to impingement syndrome， rotator cuff damage and permanent shoulder disability . Bachhal Vetal  have been reported one case with post traumatic bilateral anterior dislocations associated with bilateral four-part fractures of the proximal humerus in 60 years old male patient due to electrocution. Considering the patient age and the fractures pattern，bilateral hemiarthroplasty was done. At the final follow-up after two years， the patient was pain free with comfortable range of motion of both shoulders. A review of the literature revealed about 30 reports of bilateral anterior dislocations of the shoulders， 15of which were fracture dislocations， most of them were due to violent trauma or electrocution， and the remaining few were attributed to epileptic or hypoglycemic seizures . In this report we have been represented a rare case of young patient with two days missed bilateral anterior fracture dislocations of the shoulders with a mirror image bilateral greater tuberosity fracture during an epileptic convulsive seizure. The patient was treated by closed reduction of both shoulders anatomically and the bilateral greater tuberosity fractures were reduced and fixed by percutaneous short threaded cannulated screws under image intensifier.\n\n【10】Learning Points\n\n【11】Despite of the rarity of the reported bilateral fracture dislocation shoulder cases， orthopedic surgeons should be aware of shoulder joint injuries in patients with shoulder pain after convulsive seiziires.\n\n【12】Preoperative planning and proper management should be achieved promptly to avoid serious complications.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:05:48", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:07:17", "cost": 89.632}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:45", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:07:18", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:05:48"}

It is hardly contained by hematoma and pericardial adhesions creating a Pseudoaneurysm (PsA) . Urgent surgical repair is required to prevent catastrophic rupture. Surgical repair aims to exclude the necrotic myocardium and aneurysmal area with a patch to preserve the LV geometry and function . We report a case of LV PsA that was surgically repaired with a modified Dor technique.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 74-year old male patient with no significant past medical history was presented with a6-week history of dyspnea. A chest X-ray was performed to evaluate symptoms which depicted enlarged cardiac silhouette. This was followed by transthoracic echocardiography that showed huge posterolateral and basal LV pseudoaneurysm (7 cm x 10 cm)， LV systolic dysfunction (Ejection Fraction (EF)≤20%)， mild Mitral Regurgitation (MR) and Aortic Insufficiency (AI). Consequently， the patient underwent left heart catheterization that revealed a totally occluded left circumflex coronary artery， 80% stenotic lesion in the left anterior descending artery， intimal irregularity in the right coronary artery and large posterobasal and lateral LV pseudoaneurysm.\n\n【7】On the following day， after Intra Aortic Balloon Pump insertion (IABP)， the patient underwent surgical repair of LV PsA (Dor procedure) using the modified technique along with bypass grafting of the left coronary system lesions.\n\n【8】Upon opening the pericardium， dense fibrinous adhesions were found suggestive of reactive pericarditis secondary to contained LV rupture. The pericardial adhesions were gently dissected. After initiating cardiopulmonary bypass， the heart was lifted upwards and contained rupture of a large posterolateral LV PsA was identified. The posterior wall of LV was opened over the PsA area and an organized thrombus， which was sealing off the rupture site， was removed. The diagnosis of LV PsA was confirmed by the absence of myocardial components in the wall (e.g. thinned necrotic myocardium)， formed by organized hematoma and pericardial adhesions. Inside the LV cavity， mitral valve was intact， while the posterior papillary muscle appeared normal with hyperemic borders suggestive of recent ischemia injury. Dacron patch was prepared. Interrupted 2-0Ethibond-pledgeted mattress sutures were placed around the neck of the PsA， then passed through the Dacron patch and tied down .\n\n【9】In addition， the patient underwent bypass grafting of the left anterior descending artery using left internal mammary artery. The cross-clamp time was 135 min， total cardiopulmonary bypass time was 156 min， and total procedure time was 4 h.\n\n【10】IABP extract after 52 h. Postoperative echocardiography showed improvement of LV function (EF ≤ 30%)， mild MR and mild AI. In addition， the Dacron Patch appeared intact with no paradoxical bulging during systole and no flow across .

The two patch techniques may provide an additional benefit over the traditional single layer patch by being less prone to bulging out during systole； hence， they result in better preservation of the LV geometry and function， especially in the early postoperative period. To our knowledge， this is the first reported case of LV PsA repair using two patches.

Gait impairment exacerbates the energy cost of movement activities. This case-control investigation sought to quantify the caloric expenditure and gait movement patterns of a case with a cervical seven， iSCI and an age-，sex-，and height-matched control (CON). Laboratory data were combined with free-living step activity to evaluate the appropriateness of prescribing physical activity using step metrics after iSCI. Participants completed a six-minute walk test and three， paced-walks wearing a portable metabolic cart. Step activity monitors were worn for seven days to capture daily living activity prior to participants returning for three-dimensional gait evaluation. Kilocalories per step， step count， and Lateral Deviation (LD) of the seventh cervical spinal process were compared between the iSCI and CON. Peak oxygen consumption， daily step count， and walking speed were lower while energy cost (of walking) and LD were higher in iSCI compared to CON. Though iSCI took two thirds fewer steps， they expended nearly twice as many calories per step compared to CON. A LD to walking speed index (LDI) was created to represent gait pattern relative to actual locomotion. The iSCI LDI improved by 45% and CON by 21% when walking speed increased； this improvement may represent greater efficiency of movement at faster walking speeds. Walking mechanics impact energy expenditure of walking post-iSCI and step activity recommendations should be reconsidered. Rehabilitation specialists may implement LDI as a clinical metric that represents gait pattern and efficiency.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Individuals post incomplete Spinal Cord Injury (iSCI) are prone to a highly sedentary lifestyles secondary to gait impairment. Musculoskeletal adaptations in an iSCI are more severe than prolonged bed rest， weightlessness (space travel)， and immobilizations . The muscles below the iSCI atrophy with concomitant decreases in metabolism . Moreover， those with iSCI present with a greater concentration of anaerobic muscle fibers (i.e. IIx) relative to those without iSCI， making the musculature more predisposed to fatigue. Those with longstanding iSCI are slow to develop torque below the injury， thereby limiting locomotor function  and efficiency. The diminished gait leads to higher energy cost when completing movement activities (e.g.， daily living， self-care，leisure) . Despite this higher metabolic cost， there is no recommended step count value for those post-iSCI.\n\n【4】A lack of modified step prescriptions leaves a person with iSCI to follow the standardized recommendation of 10，000+ daily steps to be considered “active； a recommendation which was created for able-bodied individuals . Step activity criteria were designed to reflect an overall daily energy expenditure， but this objective measure is exposed to error when gait is impaired. Individuals with functional limitations， such as iSCI， are known to expend more energy during locomotion when compared to non-impaired controls (CON).\n\n【5】The purpose of this study was to investigate the energy cost of Daily Step Physical Activity(DSPA) post-iSCI and compare that to an able-bodied CON of similar physical characteristics. The research team also examined kinematic parameters of gait between iSCI and CON walking to better understand differences noted in walking energy cost. Appraising these changes may help clinicians better prescribe treatment plans to improve quality of movement.\n\n【6】Table 1： Participant demographic data.\n\n|  | Age  | Weight  | Body Fat  | Total Limb Length  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Case  | 36  | 196.5  | 28.1  | 31.9  |\n| Control  | 38  | 179.6  | 18.9  | 32.5  |\n\n【8】Note： Age-years； weight- pounds； body fat- percent； total limb length- in inches\n\n【9】Case-ControlPresentation\n\n【10】One ambulatory male case with an iSCI was recruited. The iSCI was the result of a traumatic head and neck injury (level C5) twelve years prior to participation. There was no evidence of a traumatic brain injury resulting from the accident and the case was scored an ASIA D upon hospital discharge. Chronic repercussions to the iSCI are persistent neuropathic pain treated by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and mild clonus in the lower right limb. One age-， sex-and limb length-matched CON (±2 years and 2 inches) was also recruited. Descriptive statistics for each participant are shown in Table 1.\n\n【11】Volunteers signed an IRB-approved informed consent prior to initiation of data collection. Participants’ limb length (femur and shank) were measured by a licensed physical therapist with a nylon tape. Values were totaled for a summed limb length. Weight and body composition were assessed via bioelectrical impedance (InBody570， In Body USA， Cerritos， CA).\n\n【12】Walking tasks\n\n【13】Session one began with an activity specific warm up followed by a familiarization and fitting of the calibrated portable metabolic cart (Cosmed K4b， Cosmed， Rome， Italy). To assess peak oxygen consumption (VOzpeak)， each participant completed a Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT) on an oval track while wearing the metabolic cart. Participants were asked to walk at the fastest， maintainable pace for six minutes. The case was permitted to use typical daily walking aids (cane and Bioness L300) for all study walking tasks. Heart rate， VO zpeak (using a 15-breath rolling average) ， and total distance covered were collected for each participant.\n\n【14】Matching the paces on the Step Activity Monitor (SAM； Modus Health， Oklahoma City， Oklahoma)， participants completed three-minute walk tests paced at 15 (low)， 35 (moderate)， and 55(high) steps per minute， respectively. Each test was separated by a minimum of five minutes rest. Participants were fitted with a SAM on the dominant limb， immediately superior to the lateral malleolus. Participants wore the SAM for the remainder of the day and for the next seven consecutive days. The monitor was calibrated following a previously established protocol .\n\n【15】Biomechanical analyses\n\n【16】No sooner than seven days after session 1， participants returned to complete the biomechanical assessments during the following tasks：Self-selected and fast-10-meter walk tests (SS10MWT & F10MWT) and balancing on a flat platform (both feet， then alternating single leg attempts). Gold standard ， three-dimensional motion analysis(Qualisys AB， Gothenburg， Sweden)was used to capture gait speed and Lateral Deviation (LD) during SS10MWT and F10MWT. LD was determined by movement of the seventh cervical spinal process (C7) reflective marker along the frontal plane .\n\n【17】Participants safely completed the walking trials without issue； however， the case was unable to maintain the 55 steps per minute cadence. Metabolic and step activity data are presented in Table 2. Visualization of C7's deviation path during the F10MWT is presented\n\n【18】Table 2： Metabolic and step activity data.\n\n|  | iSCI  | CON  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Laboratory Data  |  |  |\n| Peak VO， during 6MWT  | 21.6±1.3 ml/kg/min  | 28.2±2.3 ml/kg/min  |\n| Energy cost of 6MWT  | 0.3 kcal/m  | 0.1kca/m  |\n| VO，slow pace  | 11.9±1.0 ml/kg/min  | 8.5±1.1 ml/kg/min  |\n| VO， moderate pace  | 17.7±2.2 ml/kg/min  | 9.8±0.6 ml/kg/min  |\n| VO，fast pace  | Unable to complete  | 13.2±0.9 ml/kg/min  |\n| Kcal/step slow pace  | 0.4 kcal/step  | 0.2 kcal/step  |\n| Kcal/step moderate pace  | 0.2 kcal/step  | 0.1 kcal/step  |\n| Kcal/step fast pace  | Unable to complete  | 0.1 kcal/step  |\n| Stride rate SS10MWT  | 0.25±0.06 m/s  | 1.37±0.14m/s  |\n| Stride rate F10MWT  | 0.32±0.06 m/s  | 1.90±0.05 m/s  |\n| Gait speed SS10MWT  | 0.20±0.07m/s  | 1.37 ±0.08m/s  |\n| Gait speed F10MWT  | 0.33±0.07m/s  | 1.91±0.10m/s  |\n| LD SS10MWT  | 0.43±0.04m  | 0.09±0.02m  |\n| LD F10MWT  | 0.39±0.02m  | 0.10±0.04m  |\n| Free-Living Data  |  |  |\n| Daily step count  | 2，764±2054  | 8，502±5640  |\n| Steps at slow pace  | 920±313  | 2，094±1450  |\n| Steps at moderate pace  | 1，038±348  | 5，234±3754  |\n| Steps at tast pace  | 256±187  | 1，180±728  |\n| Extrapolated Data  |  |  |\n| Estimated kcal/day from steps  |.8±2237  |.0±1880.2  |\n| Kcals from slow pace  | 978.5±110.8  |.96±1302.8  |\n| Kcals from moderate pace  | 239.8±80.3  | 230.34±412.9  |\n| Kcals from fast pace  | 44.5±32.5  | 115.64±71.3  |\n\n【20】Note： Means ± standard deviation (when applicable)； peak VO， during 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT)； energy cost in kilocalories per meter； ml/kg/min： Milliliters per kilogram per minute； m/s： Meters per second； average daily step count represents both limbs (SAM output multiplied by two)； slow pace- 15 steps per minute； moderate pace-35 steps per minute； fast pace - 55 steps per minute.VO2peat was used to estimate kcals from fast pace walking. in Figure 2.\n\n【21】Discussion\n\n【22】Findings from this case-control investigation support data Tom that those with neurologically impaired gait will exhibit greater caloric expenditure during walking tasks . If we truly consider the concept of step count， we would recognize the goal of such recommendations is about energy cost of movement； the threshold count is a helpful metric for aiming to maintain healthy weight and physiological processes (e.g.， cardiorespiratory， metabolic). Tudor-Locke and Bassett  recognized early that the step goal of10，000 or more a day would likely be unattainable by many， therefore suggesting an adjustment to as low as 5000 to 7500 steps per day to avoid a sedentary classification . Rather than sticking with step counts，however， Marshall et al.  suggested identifying step counts that relate to moderate-intensity walking (3 to 5 METs) to account for effort. Findings from this investigation were that estimating MET values from step counts was prone to considerable error and that walking at a pace greater than 100 steps per minute represented the minimum threshold for attaining moderate-intensity. Another issue with translating steps to METs is the inconsistency of using the resting energy expenditure constant of 3.5 ml/kg/min. The case in this investigation had a standing energy expenditure of 7.35 ml/kg/min(or2.1 METs)， with typical adults having a standing MET value of 1.59±0.37 . Therefore， it is likely inappropriate to standardize activity recommendations based on step metrics or stan dardized MET values for those with functional limitations without first considering their biomechanical and metabolic efficiency.\n\n【23】In the clinical setting， LD is often indicative of an abnormal walking pattern， but is not typically quantified for objective assessments. While both participants increased gait speed between10MWTs， LD did not change as expected. LD decreased in the case and increased with the CON when going from SS10MWT to F10MWT， as shown in Figure 3.\n\n【24】Rather than looking at LD in isolation， it may be relevant for clinicians to consider evaluating a LD and walking speed index (LDI) as a clinical outcome. The case’s LDI (calculated as LD/walking speed) improved from the SS10MWT (2.15) to the F10MWT(1.18). The CON's LD index also improved from 0.66 to 0.52 when walking faster. It is possible that the case adopted a gait pattern that allowed for greater weight bearing on the more impaired limb during the SS10MWT when compared to the F10MWT. Clinicians may consider a more segmental approach to fully gain insight on compensatory mechanisms adopted during self-selected and fast walking after neurological trauma. Rehabilitation specialists may also consider implementing a more objective view of C7 movement when assessing pathologic gait， as it is clearly impacted by altering walking speed.\n\n【25】Unrealistic expectations may heighten perceived barriers， undermine mobility related to self-efficacy， and discourage adoption or adherence of activity behaviors. Exercise prescription based on energy expenditure goals may serve as an alternative mode to individualize daily activity for those with functional limitations. Future research should attempt to establish new recommendations based on functional status for those outside the typical gait norm. Clinicians may also consider evaluating the relationship between C7， pelvic response， trunk flexion， and metabolic cost of walking speeds to better direct therapeutic attention to the component most responsible for the dysfunction.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:07:55", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:08:53", "cost": 57.669}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:45", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:08:53", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:07:55"}

Despite the fact that several practice guidelines recommend Thiopurine Methyltransferase (TPMT) genotyping， phenotyping and/or measurement of metabolites activity， hepatology guidelines do not consider TPMT testing mandatory， due to scarce available information referring to its controversial utility. We report the case of a 56 year-old woman with ecent autoimmune hepatitis diagnosis， who received two months of combined immunosuppressive treatment (decreasing doses of prednisone and azathioprine 50 mg during one month， with later increase to 100 mg per day). She was admitted in the Emergency Room due to severe febrile neutropenia. Azathioprine treatment was discontinued and TPMT genotyping was performed. A genetic homozygous variant (rs1800462) corresponding to homozygous TPMT2 polymorphism was detected. The patient's treatment was modified to prednisone combined with mycophenolate with normalization of liver enzymes and resolution of the adverse event.\n\n【2】Discussion： TPMT is a polymorphic enzyme involved in the metabolism and inactivation of thiopurine substances (such as azathioprine) administered as immune suppressants in the treatment of malignancies and autoimmune diseases. Mutations in the gene that encodes this enzyme may augment the risk of adverse events. Three genetic variants in the TPMT gene (rs12201199，rs1142345， and rs1800460) account for more than 90% of inactivating alleles. There are four nonfunctional alleles responsible of 80% to 95% of low enzyme activity： 2，3A，3B， 3C. Performing genetic testing to determine the TPMT polymorphism prior to treatment initiation with azathioprine has proven to be a valuable tool to prevent severe adverse events.\n\n【3】Conclusion： Routine screening of TPMT polymorphisms in autoimmune hepatitis may prevent severe adverse events in patient with null enzyme activity.\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Treatment with thiopurine analogs is the cornerstone of several immunosuppressive regimens for malignancies and autoimmune diseases. Azathioprine is a purine analog that interferes with nucleic acid metabolism； it is widely used as part of the standard-of-care in several illnesses such as inflammatory bowel disease， acute lymphatic leukemia and autoimmune hepatitis . The occurrence of serious adverse events related to its use is not infrequent： 10% of the patients manifest with bone marrow toxicity， pancreatitis， hepatotoxicity or a combination of these events . Thus， it is important to assess which patients are at higher risk of suffering severe and potentially life-threatening adverse events， since proper dose adjustment may prevent its occurrence/diminish its severity.\n\n【6】Several clinical pharmacogenetics consensus and clinical practice guidelines endorse the determination of Thiopurine Methyltransferase (TPMT) polymorphisms prior to initiation of azathioprine treatment . Different types of polymorphisms affect this enzyme performance， varying from having negligible to intermediate or even high levels of enzyme activity . Thus， the presence of different types of TPMT polymorphisms has been linked to the occurrence of severe side effects， or to the lack of proper immunosuppressive activity in patients receiving standard azathioprine doses .\n\n【7】Despite the fact that TPMT testing is currently a standard practice for internal medicine and gastroenterology guidelines ， it has not been proposed as a mandatory test in the treatment of autoimmune hepatitis， due to scarce data regarding its clinical utility ； thus it is seldomly solicited prior to treatment initiation in daily practice. We will describe the case of a patient with autoimmune hepatitis treated with a combination of steroidsand azathioprine at standard doses that develops severe febrile neutropenia associated with a homozygous TPMT polymorphism with null activity.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A previously healthy fifty-six year-old woman attended to the HPR Liver Unit with jaun dice and elevated liver enzymes (up to forty-times the baseline levels) with preserved liver function. In etiological studies performed， hypergammaglobulinemia and high titles of both antinuclear and anti smooth muscle antibodies were detected. Viral hepatitis and other metabolic illnesses were discarded. The diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis was based on clinical and biochemical findings， and treatment with prednisone 40 mg was initiated with excellent response. Azathioprine was added after two weeks of steroid treatment， initially at a 50 mg dose， and increased after one month to 100 mg. After two months of immunosuppressive therapy， the patient attended the hospital Emergency Room due to acute diarrhea non respondent to antibiotic therapy and paronychia in her left hand middle finger. At admission she was conscious， subfebrile (37.5C) and hyperdynamic (heart rate 100 beats/minute). When examined， oral leukoplakia and small oral ulcers were observed，as well as a small abscess in her left hand middle finger and faint coarse crackles in the base of her right lung without pathological findings on her chest X-ray. In laboratory analysis， bicytopenia (white cell count 589 cells/mm’and platelet count 29，000 cells/mm’) with severe neutropenia(65 cells/mm’)， acute kidney injury (creatinine 1.40 mg/dl with metabolic acidosis) and elevated protein C reactive levels (344.9mg/L) were observed. She was treated as febrile neutropenia with broad-spectrum antibiotics， antifungal and antiviral therapy， as well as with granulocyte colony stimulating factor. Since azathioprine was suspected as a cause of bicytopenia， it was suspended at admission. The patient's general condition as well as her platelet and white blood cell count improved during the course of the following week. She was discharged with a normal complete blood cell count after 8days of hospitalization. To confirm the causality of azathioprine in the development of febrile neutropenia in this patient， the thiopurine methyltransferase genotype and activity was analyzed. The sample was processed following the protocol for extraction and purification of the genomic DNA that could be present in it by magnetic particle technology (Magna Pure Compact-Roche). The amplification of the regions of the TPMT gene is carried out by the Polymerase Chain Reaction (QIAGEN). The amplification products were subjected to restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis using restriction enzymes. (New England BioLabs Inc.). An homozygous variant p.Ala80Pro (rs1800462) corresponding to the genotype TPMT2 was detected， which associates with low o nule enzymatic activity. Thus， azathioprine was not re-initiated and currently the patient is under treatment with low dose prednisone mycophenolate motetil with normal liver enzymes.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Thiopurine S-Methyltransferase (TPMT) is an S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent cytosolic enzyine implicated in the metabolism of thiopurines such as azathioprine. This prodrug requires metabolic activation to generate its active metabolites thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGNs)， which ultimately cause its cytotoxic effects. The majority of these antimetabolites are detoxified by TPMT and to a minor extent by xanthine oxidase. Among enzyme-deficient patients， the alternative pathway via hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase is accelerated， leading to higher amounts of 6-TGN which in turn may cause bone marrow toxicity and even pancytopenia .\n\n【12】TPMT has more than 40 naturally occurring variants， most of which exhibit low or intermediate enzyme activity towards thiopurine substrates. TPMT has a trimodal distribution with 89.5% normal to high methylators， 9.9% intermediates and 0.6% deficient methylators. The TPMT activity can be determined by phenotyping procedures； just three genetic variants in the TPMT gene (rs12201199， rs1142345， and rs1800460) account for more than 90% of inactivating alleles. The majority ofpatients have two normal alleles， 3% to 14% of patients are heterozygous and 0.3% carries two non-functional alleles. There are four nonfunctional alleles responsible of 80% to 95% of low enzyme activity： 2，3A，3B，3C. They are distributed with ethnic differences：3A prevails in caucasians where as 3C predominates in Africans， Asians， and afro Americans .\n\n【13】In Argentina， a mixed ethnicity country， there is heterogeneous information regarding the most prevalent allelic mutation. Some studies have found higher prevalence of 3A， followed by 2 and 4， whereas other recent study refer to 2 allele as the most prevalent inactive phenotype (as described in the present case).\n\n【14】Currently， the determination of TPMT genotype by protein chain reaction obtained from leukocytes's DNA is relatively inexpensive， reproducible and does not have methodological limitations. Since its correlation with the enzyme's phenotype has proven to be adequate， especially for low active alleles， it is the initial study of choice to determine TPMT activity in clinical practice . The detection of the mutant allele would allow classifying patients in three groups normal homozygotes with high enzymatic activity，heterozygous with intermediate activity and homozygotes with the low allele activity. This classification has implications in azathioprine dosing， since patients with high enzymatic activity could receive azathioprine at high doses with less apparent risk oftoxicity， whereas in patients with intermediate and low activity alleles it would be advisable to perform the measurement of TPMT in erythrocytes in order to correlate genotype and phenotype. Ifconfirmed，heterozygous patients should receive doses adjusted to the value ofenzymes and their body weight， whereas patients with low activity would be candidates to alternative drugs with a different metabolic route .\n\n【15】TPMT polymorphisms are not the sole responsible of adverse events due to azathioprine： there are studies reporting the presence of gastrointestinal and bone marrow toxicity despite the presence of normal or near normal TPMT enzymatic activity . Due to this evidence， in cost-effectiveness analysis， the benefit of TPMT testing is still controversial .\n\n【16】In the few existing publications discussing TPMT testing in autoimmune hepatitis patients， TPMT or metabolite dosing were controversial regarding its efficacy in predicting azathioprine toxicity . Currently， experts and hepatology clinical practice recommendations state that close monitoring of azathioprine toxicity should be performed in all patients， and TPMT testing is only recommended if available (although not mandatory) .\n\n【17】Due to the potential life threatening severity of myelosuppression secondary to azathioprine treatment， as portrayed in the presented case，thebenefit ofTPMT testing appears to be clear in all autoimmune hepatitis patients. Further studies， specially including patients of different ethnicities， may provide valuable information to reassess the benefit of TPMT testing prior to azathioprine treatment in patients with autoimmune hepatitis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:52:46", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:53:00", "cost": 13.545}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:45", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:52:59", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:52:46"}

The etiological agent was streptococcus pneumonia， a rare cause in the age of pneumococcal vaccination.\n\n【2】Case Presentation： An elderly gentleman presented with non-specific chest pain. He was suspected to have had a myocardial infarction， treated as such， but was then found to have pyopericardium. There was rapid progression of the disease which led to cardiac tamponade and obstructive shock. Following emergency drainage， refractory septic shock ensued.\n\n【3】Conclusion： The case report highlights key differences and similarities in history， clinical examination and investigations between pericarditis and myocardial infarction. Finally， we conclude with a discussion based on a literature review focused on pyopericardium.\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Acute pericarditis is defined as inflammation of the pericardium which resolves within 6 weeks. Pyopericardium is the presence of pus within the pericardial sac. Pyopericarditis is invariably fatal without administration of antibiotics. Broad spectrum antibiotics have decreased mortality rates to 40%. The most common cause of bacterial pericarditis is Gram-positive cocci from direct intra-thoracic spread. The case report was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee(HREC) (Certificate No.M180581).\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 54 year old gentleman presented at 09：00 to an Emergency Department (ED) with acute-onset central chest pain and non-radiating epigastric pain (grade 10/10)； associated with dyspnea. He had a 30 pack year history of smoking and lived a sedentary lifestyle. He had no fever， syncope or any preceding events leading up to presentation to the ED. He had no medical (hypertension， hyperlipidemia or diabetes) or family history of cardiovascular disease.\n\n【8】The initial clinical examination showed an overweight man. He was fully conscious but distressed. He was apyrexial， hypotensive (96 mmHg/58 mmHg) and maintained oxygen saturation above 96% on 4 L/min nasal prongs.\n\n【9】Further examination revealed no jugular vein distension， no muffled heart sounds and clearlung field auscultation. The first Electrocardiogram (EKG) is reported to have a regular pulse rate of 91/min with ST-segment elevation ofleads V2-V6，limbleads I， AVL， III and reciprocal ST-depression of AVR. At this point， an anterolateral Myocardial Infarction (MI) was suspected. An initial transthoracic 2-dimensional echocardiogram (echo) was unobtainable. Chest radiography showed no abnormalities of the lung fields but an increased cardiothoracic ratio. Given that Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) would not be achieved within 90 min from presentation (door-to balloon time)， it was decided that the patient would benefit from thrombolysis. Serial EKG's were performed and the patient reported relief of the chest pain.\n\n【10】Once stable， the patient was transferred to a facility capable of PCI. Upon arrival he was hemodynamically stable and not in cardiac failure， however， his chest pain was assessed as 7/10. The first echo performed revealed an ejection fraction >50%， hypokinesia of the anterolateral wall， as well as a small pericardial effusion. Subsequently a coronary angiogram (5 h after initial presentation) discovered a distal segment filling defect of the right coronary artery which was recanalized for suspicion of a thrombus. However， on retrospective analysis the EKG changes were discordant to the angiogram findings.\n\n【11】At 15：00， post-procedure， he was transferred to the cardiac care unit. Six hours after transfer his Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) worsened with an increase in serum creatinine from 239 umol/l to 472 umolA(no premorbid creatinine available). During this period the high sensitivity Troponin-T level increased from 45 ng/L to 82 ng/L.\n\n【12】At 24：00， a rapid deterioration to shock. A repeat EKG showed ST-segment elevation in leads V2-V6，IandAVLwith electrical alternans. The cardiologist performed an echo which showed a significant pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade. An emergency echo-guided needle pericardiocentesis aspirated 360 ml of foul-smelling， thick， green， purulent fluid which was sent for Gram stain and culture (MC&S). No drain was left in-situ. Post-pericardiocentesis the patient's hemodynamics improved. The gram-stain revealed gram positive diplococci. Antibiotic therapy (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) and colchicine were commenced.\n\n【13】Over the following 24 h the patient developed multi-organ failure. His level of consciousness deteriorated and he developed type 1 respiratory failure. He was intubated， mechanically ventilated， vasopressor support initiated and transferred to Intensive Care Unit(ICU).\n\n【14】He was in septic shock requiring high-dose vasopressor support(epinephrine at 0.8 rg/kg/min). Investigations were performed to isolate a primary source of infection； including chest X-ray， urine studies and blood cultures. Steroid therapy was initiated and antibiotic regimen changed to tazobactam-piperacillin (loading dose followed by continuous infusion). The choice of antibiotic was empirically based on a community-acquired gram positive organism and to optimize antibiotic concentrations above Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations(MIC) as per ICU protocol. Due to the hemodynamic instability， severe metabolic acidosis and hyperkalemia that persisted despite medical therapy； sodium bicarbonate infusion was initiated. Hemodynamic management was guided by passive leg raise testing and stroke volume variation using continuous invasive hemodynamic monitoring. A repeat echo， in light of continued deterioration， showed recurrent tamponade. Due to the viscosity of the purulent fluid； repeat echo-guided needle pericardiocentesis was unsuccessful. An emergency pericardial window was performed by the surgical team. A further 1000 ml of purulent fluid was drained and sent for MC&S. Marginal hemodynamic improvement enabled initiation of continuous renal replacement therapy for refractory metabolic acidosis， hyperkalemia and anuria. At this stage， the creatinine had increased to 696 umol/l while the procalcitonin was 909 ug/l. Despite these interventions； vasopressor requirements increased over 24 h.A calcium infusion was started for hypocalcemia and positive inotropic effects. Thiamine given for increasing lactate levels. The pericardial drain output was approximately 900 mL/24 h. An echo showed very poor cardiac contractility. Without access to Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO)； the patient ultimately succumbed to multi-organ failure.\n\n【15】The culture result received 24h after his demise reported asensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae， with a MIC<0.03 ug/ml to Cefotaxime， thus indicating that tazobactam-piperacillin was appropriate empiric treatment.\n\n【16】The post-mortem results indicated the presence of an occult pneumonia and thick purulent and hemorrhagic exudate on the epicardium.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】Pyopericardium has an incidence rate of approximately 1/18000cases ofpericarditis. It remains a fatal condition due to tamponade and septic shock. The most common bacterial causes of pyopericarditis are Staphylococcus aureus， Streptococcus pneumoniae， Haemophilus influenza and anaerobic organisms. The incidence of Streptococcus pneumoniae has decreased (51% to 9%) over the past 2 decades， following the roll out of the pneumococcal vaccine . Pericarditis secondary to Streptococcus preumoniae occurs predominantly in children and young adults with a likely source of infection i.e. pneumonia (93%). However， recent studies have shown the average affected age has increased to 49 years of age . It has been claimed that it is not a true primary infection but due to hematogenous or direct spread from a non-radiologically significant pneumonia or other occult infection.\n\n【19】Acute pericarditis presents with increasing severity of chest pain that is worse in the recumbent position， fever and other non-specific inflammatory symptoms (tachycardia， altered level of consciousness and dyspnea). Clinical examination can reveal a pericardial friction rub， pulsus paradoxus and the classical Beck’s triad of systemic hypotension， Kussmaul's sign (paradoxical rise in jugular venous pressure during inspiration) and muffledheart sounds on auscultation.\n\n【20】EKG changes are revealing； typical changes including sinus tachycardia， widespread ST-elevation (saddle shaped ST-segment)， reciprocal ST depression in lead AVR (+- V1)， Spodick’s sign(downward sloping TP segment)， PR depression， flattened or inverted T waves and/or electrical alternans . It is， however， important to note 10% to 35% of patients may have a normal EKG.\n\n【21】Ultimately an echocardiogram revealing a pericardial effusion confirms the diagnosis and while diastolic chamber collapse (right atrial and/or ventricular) indicates tamponade. Troponin concentrations may rise in many forms of cardiac injury including pericarditis. Other relevant investigations are a full blood count， renal functions，inflammatory markers (C-reactiveprotein， procalcitonin) and blood cultures. An angiogram assists to exclude a myocardial infarction， if suspected . Further investigation based on the suspected primary source of the acute pyopericarditis may be appropriate.\n\n【22】To confirm the diagnosis of acute pericarditis the patient must meet 2 of the following 4 criteria： Typical chest pain， pericardial friction rub， typical EKG changes and new or worsening pericardial effsion.\n\n【23】The treatment of pyopericardium incorporates medical and surgical interventions and the urgency of intervention determined by the presence of tamponade. The medical management includes broad spectrum antibiotics for 2 to 4 weeks. Antibiotic choice guided by the most commonly associated pathogens. Provided there are no contra-indications， these of colchicine and ibuprofen are advocated for analgesia. The anti-inflammatory effects of colchicine have been proven to expedite resolution of primary pericarditis as well as prevent recurrences by up to 50%， but use in pyopericarditis not yet studied. It is recommended as first line therapy for up to 12 weeks .\n\n【24】Table 1： Steps to distinguish pericarditis from STEMI .\n\n|  | Relevant electrocardiogram feature  | Presence  | Likely diagnosis  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | Is there ST depression in a lead other than AVR or V1?  | Yes  | STEMI  |\n| 2  | Is there convex up or horizontal ST elevation?  | Yes  | STEMI  |\n| 3  | Is the ST elevation greater in Ill than II?  | Yes  | STEMI  |\n| 4  | Is there PR depression in multiple leads  | Yes  | Pericarditis  |\n\n【26】Early corticosteroid use may actually increase the risk of relapse . Low dose corticosteroids are suggested in septic shock； if fluid and vasopressor therapies are not able to restore adequate hemodynamics. The presence of sepsis and tamponade result in a complex hemodynamic state with a combination of obstructive and distributive shock. The sepsis induced myocardial dysfunction will include poor systolic function， diastolic dysfunction and vasoplegia. Hemodynamic management is not trivial and requires advanced continuous hemodynamic monitoring. Veno-arterial ECMO may be useful for hemodynamic failure in septic shock.\n\n【27】Urgent source control is a priority and would include ultrasound guided emergency pericardiocentesis for tamponade and definitive surgical pericardiotomy or a pericardial window if thick purulent fluid proves difficult to drain percutaneously.\n\n【28】Important complications of pyopericardium are septic shock， cardiac tamponade with obstructive shock， recurrent pericarditis and constrictive pericarditis .\n\n【29】Conclusion\n\n【30】Acute bacterial pericarditis is a diagnosis that requires a high-index of suspicion and is often accompanied by an associated primary infection. EKG changes need to be carefully scrutinized and the echo performed timorously to differentiate between acute myocardial infarction (cardiogenic shock) and acute pericarditis with cardiac tamponade (obstructive shock).\n\n【31】Despite adequate drainage， cardiac tamponade from pyopericardium may well progress to refractory vasodilatory septic shock requiring ECMO.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:38:34", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:38:51", "cost": 17.009}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:45", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:38:50", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:38:33"}

A 49-year-old woman presented with massive hematochezia and multiple erythematous purpuric papules throughout her body after a single-dose inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

Vasculitis is usually idiopathic in nature. The known causes include infection， such as viral hepatitis， HIV， bacterial and fungal infections， or drugs， such as NSAIDs or antibiotics . Additionally， vasculitis in AS may occur due to a paradoxical response to TNF-a inhibitors . Most TNF inhibitor-induced vasculitis occurs within a short period of time after administration and is often limited to cutaneous vasculitis or worsening of existing symptoms. In addition， in many cases， the symptoms are mild enough to improve without the use of steroids or immunosuppressive agents.

SARS-CoV-2 invades endothelial cells and induces a hyper inflammatory response， which can cause vasculitis by depositing immune complexes . Since vaccines contain antigens of these infectious agents， these antigens can cause cross-reactivity and molecular mimicry， and adjuvants added to vaccines to enhance immunity can increase autoimmunity . Additionally， vasculitis can be induced by a mechanism that increases autoimmunity. The reported SARS-CoV-2 vaccination-induced vasculitis is often skin-localized cutaneous vasculitis.

In some severe cases， plasma exchange， cyclophosphamide， and rituximab have been used in addition to GC. GC was also used in our patient； however， the symptoms recurred， and adalimumab， which was used for the patient's original disease and inflammatory bowel disease， was administered.Subsequently， the symptoms improved， and there was no recurrence.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】In conclusion， mRNA vaccination in patients with AS can induce serious vasculitis such as mesenteric vasculitis. Vaccine side effects that do not respond to steroids may improve with TNF-a inhibitors.", "index": 3993, "show": true, "start": 3993, "end": 4012, "province": ["格式规范性", "多余换行"], "isEdit": false, "comment": "表格插入"}], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:38:02", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:38:27", "cost": 24.986}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:45", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:38:27", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:38:02"}

This report describes eight patients with NEC of the stomach. Only one patient had been correctly diagnosed before surgery； the others had been misdiagnosed with tubular adenocarcinoma， poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma， and malignant lymphoma. Five patients had type 2 cancer on macroscopic examination. Histological findings of the resected specimens showed that three NECs were associated with tubular adenocarcinoma and that one was associated with signet ring cell carcinoma. Liver metastases were found in four patients， but none hadperitoneal metastases. The cancer stroma volume and tumor infiltration indicated the medullary type in seven patients and expanding growth type in six. Neither the scirrhous type nor infiltrative growth type was found. All eight patients had moderate or marked lymphatic invasion， and six had venous invasion. Six patients underwent postoperative chemotherapy. The median survival time was 10 months， and the 5-year survival rate was 37.5%. The causes of death were liver metastases in five patients and metastases to the lung and brain in one. One patient with lung metastasis who underwent multimodal treatment comprising surgery， radiation， and chemotherapy with cisplatin+ irinotecan and S-1 + paclitaxel remained alive for 74 months postoperatively. NEC was difficult to diagnose preoperatively. High frequencies of capillary invasion and hematogenous metastasis， such as to the liver， were observed， and the prognosis was poor. However，long-term survival was higher among patients with NEC who underwent multimodal therapy.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】The World Health Organization classification of 2010 defined neuroendocrine carcinoma(NEC) as a subgroup of neuroendocrine neoplasms. Neuroendocrine neoplasms are classified as neuroendocrine tumors or NECs according to their bioactivity， which is determined by the mitotic rate and Ki67 index  . The Japanese classification of gastric carcinoma defines NEC as a special type in the histological classification of gastric tumors and considers NEC to be either small cell type or large cell type .\n\n【4】NECs are characterized by many mitoses  and high proliferative activity (Ki67 index of ≥20%)  . Many NECs show medullary， expanded， and trabecular proliferation， and rosette structures are seen pathologically . Argyrophilic granules， which are stained by Grimelius stain， or argentaffin granules， which are stained by Fontana-Masson stain， are detected in the cytoplasm of NEC cells. Neuroendocrine granules are seen in the cytoplasm of NEC cells on electron microscopy. NECs are positive for neuroendocrine markers such as chromogranin A， synaptophysin， and neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM/CD56) on immunohistochemical staining.\n\n【5】NEC of the stomach is relatively rare， accounting for 0.1% to 0.6% of all gastric carcinomas . It has a high frequency of capillary invasion，lymph node metastasis， and hematogenous metastasis， such as to the liver and lung. Its prognosis is poor .\n\n【6】The details of eight cases of NEC of the stomach resected in our institute are herein presented.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】Patients\n\n【9】From 1994 to2013，2559patients with histologically confirmedprimary gastric cancer underwent surgery at the Department of Surgery， Kurume University School of Medicine， Kurume， Japan. During this time， eight patients (0.31%) were diagnosed with NEC of the stomach. All eight patients were male， and their mean age was 69.6 years (range， 64-76 years). All eight patients underwent (MANEC)\n\n【10】Table 1： World Health Organization 2010 classificatian of neuraendocrine neoplasms.\n\n【11】Mitotic count Ki67 index 88×78mm\n\n| NET G1 (carcinoid)  | <2 per 10 HPF  |2%  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| NET G2  | 2-20 per HPF  | 3%-20%  |\n| NEC (large cell or small cell type)  | >20 per 10 HPF  | >20%  |\n| Mixec adenoneuroendocrine carcinoma (MANEC)  |  |  |\n\n【13】Hyperplastic and preneuroplasticlesions\n\n【14】NET： neuroendocrine tumor； NEC： neuroendocrine carcinoma； MANEC： high-grade， paarly differentiated neuraendocrine carcinama comprises 30% to 70%of the tumor.\n\n【15】Mitatic count： 10 high-power fields (HPF)= 2 mm²， at least 40 fields (at x40magnification) evaluated in areas of highest mitatic density.\n\n【16】Ki67 index： Percentage of 2000 tumor cells in areas of highest nuclear labeling of MIB1 antibody.\n\n【17】clinicopathological examination.

The requirement for informed consent was waived because of the retrospective study design.\n\n【19】Special staining\n\n【20】Grimelius stainingWas performedfor fourpatients. Immunohistochemical staining was performed using chromogranin A antibody for seven patients， synaptophysin antibody for three patients， CD56 antibody for three patients， and neuron-specific y-enolase (NSE) antibody for four patients.\n\n【21】Ki67 index\n\n【22】Ki67 staining was performed immunohistochemically for all eight patients. Ki67-positive cancer cells per 1000 cancer cells were counted in 10 high-power fields (HPF)， and the Ki67 index (%) was calculated.\n\n【23】Mitotic count\n\n【24】Cancer cells with mitoses were counted in 10 HPF.\n\n【25】Survival\n\n【26】Overall survival for all eight patients was calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method.\n\n【27】All eight patients were symptomatic on admission. One patient had early cancer， but the other patients had advanced cancer . Before surgery， only one patient was diagnosed with NEC， five patients were diagnosed with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma， and two patients were diagnosed with tubular adenocarcinoma. Two patients were diagnosed with malignant lymphoma on preoperative diagnostic imaging . Five patients had type 2 cancer， and the NECs of four patients occurred in the lower third (L) of the stomach. A 65-year-old man (Case 3) who underwent distal gastrectomy for a duodenal ulcer 35 years earlier had an NEC arising from the gastric suture line of his remnant stomach. A 64-year-old man (Case 4) had tub1： well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma， tub. moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma， por. poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma， sig： signet-ring cell carcinoma； undiff.undifferentiated carcinoma\n\n| No  | Age/Sex  | Chief complaint  | Macro/Location  | Stage  | Outcome  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | 71/M  | General fatigue  | 2/L  | T2N1HOP0 IA  | 124 ma (Alive)  |\n| 2  | 76/M  | Heartburn  | 0-llc+ lla/L  | T1bN1H0POIB  | 8 mo(H) 11 mo (Dead)  |\n| 3  | 65/M  | Nausea  | 2/remnant stomach  | T4aN2H1P0V  | 5 mo (Dead) (H)  |\n| 4  | 64/M  | Appetite loss， upper abdominal pain  | 2/LD，0-llc/U  | T4bN2H1P0V  | 1 ma (PUL) 2 mo (Dead) (H)  |\n| 5  | 71/M  | General fatigue  | 3/U  | T4aN3H1P0IV  | 10 mo (Dead)  |\n| 6  | 69/M  | Upper abdominal pain  | 2/LM  | T2N0HOPOIB  | 27 mo (PUL) 74 mo (Dead)(PUL， BRA， OSS)  |\n| 7  | 67/M  | Heavy feeling in the stomach  | 0-Ilc(T4a)/M  | T4aN1HOPO IIIA  | 61 mo (Alive)  |\n| 8  | 74/M  | Appetiteloss  | 2/UME  | T4aN3H1P0M1 (PUL，LYM)IV  | 1 mo (Dead) (H)  |\n\n【29】Macro： Macrascopic type， M： Male； U： Upper third of the stomach； M： Middle third of the stamach； L： lower third of the stamach； T1b： tumor confined ta the submucosa， T2： tumor invasion of the muscularis propria， T4a： tumor invasion is contiguaus ta the serasa or penetrates the serasa and is expased ta the peritoneal cavity， T4b：tumor invasian of adjacent structures， NO： na regional lymph node metastasis； N1： metastasis in one ar twa regional lymph nodes， N2： metastasis in three to six regional lymph nades， N3： metastasis in seven or more regional lymph nodes， Ho： no hepatic metastasis； H1： hepatic metastasis， PO： na peritoneal metastasis， M1：distant metastasis， PUL： lung metastasis， LYM： distant lymph node metastasis， BRA： brain metastasis， OsS： bone metastasis， H： hepatic metastasis\n\n【30】Table 3： Preoperative diagnasis.\n\n| No.  | Diagnostic imaging  | Biopsy (local hospital)  | Biapsy (our hospital)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | Malignant lymphoma  | tub2  | tub2  |\n| 2  | Malignant lymphoma  | Malignantlymphoma  | Por  |\n| 3  | Type 2 cancer  | Anaplastic carcinoma  | Por or undiff  |\n| 4  | Type 2， 0-llc  | type 2： por， 0-llc： tub1  |  |\n| 5  | Type 3 cancer  | tub1  |  |\n| 6  | Type 2 cancer  | Anaplastic carcinoma  | por  |\n| 7  | llc-like advanced cancer  | por with neuroendocrine differentiation  | por + sig (neuraendocrine differentiation)  |\n| 8  | Type 2 cancer  | por  |  |\n\n【32】Table 4： Eight patients with neuraendocrine carcinoma of the stomach .\n\n| No  | Surgery  | Pathology/tumor size  | Chemoradiotherapy  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | Distal D2 RO  | small > tub1，MP， med， INFa， ly2， vo 35x30mm  | None  |\n| 2  | Distal D2 RO  | small， SM2， med， INFa，ly2，vo 25x25 mm  | After recurrence：5-FUpo，CDDPia  |\n| 3  | Total D1+R2 (H)  | small， SE， med， INFa，ly3， v3 70x70mm  | 5-FUpo， CDDPia  |\n| 4  | Total D1+R2 (H)  | 1) small， sl， med，INFa，ly3，v2 90×90mm2) tub1，M，ly0， v0 10×8mm  | 5-DFUR， CDDPia  |\n| 5  | Total + S D2 R2 (H)  | large> tub1， tub2， SE， med， INFb， ly3，v288x82mm  | S-1+CDDPia> 5-FU+ CPT-11ia> S-1+PTXia  |\n| 6  | Distal D2 R.O  | small >tub1， MP， med， INFa， ly2，v243x41mm  | After surgery：5'-DFURAfter recurrence： CDDP + CPT-11+RA> S-1+PTXAMR sCBDCA+VP16> NGT>DOC>RA  |\n| 7  | Total + S D2 R0  | large sig， SE， int， INFb， ly2，v1，IM(+) 41×28mm  | After surgery.

At the time of surgery， seven patients had lymph node metastases， five patients had stage T4a or T4b cancer， and four patients had liver metastases. A 74-year-old man (Case 8) had simultaneous liver， lung， and distant lymph node metastases. However， no patients had peritoneal metastases .\n\n【35】Histological examination revealed that five patients had small cell carcinoma and three patients had large cell carcinoma. All patients had moderate or marked lymphatic invasion (ly2 or ly3)， and six patients had venous invasion. Seven patients had medullary type NEC， and no patients had scirrhous type NEC. Six patients had expanding growth (INFa)， and no patients had infiltrative growth(INFc). Case 1 showed medullary and irregular infiltration of tumor cells with little cytoplasm and round or spindle-shaped chromatin-rich nuclei. Some of the tumor cells formed a glandular or trabecular pattern， and necrotic tissue was seen in some areas. In Case 6， the tumor cells were arranged in a sheet formation， and many mitoses were seen. The mean major axis of the tumors was 60.0 mm (range，25-90 mm). Well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma was seen in the superficial region in three patients. A 67-year-old man (Case7) showed non medullary infiltration and signet ring cell carcinoma in the superficial region， with distribution of intramural metastases throughout the entire stomach； this patient remained alive without recurrence for 72 months after surgery . The mean number of cancer cells with mitoses in 10 HPF was 102.8(range，32-183 per 10HPF). The mean Ki67 index was 37.8% (range，23.1%-80.5%). Four tumors were positive on Grimelius staining， and four were positive for NSE. Three tumors were positive for synaptophysin. Six tumors were positive and one was negative for chromogranin.

NSE was upregulated in three of four patients tested. Both carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 were highly upregulated in a 74-year-old man (Case 8) who had liver，lung and distant lymph node metastases and died 1 month after surgery. Although cytokeratin 19 fragment is a sensitive marker for non-small cell lung cancer， it was a very sensitive marker for progression and metastases in a 69-year-old man  .\n\n【40】Surgery\n\n【41】Three patients underwent distal gastrectomy. Four patients underwent total gastrectomy. One patient underwent resection of the remnant stomach. On lymph node dissection (D)， one patient was D1， two were D1+， and five were D2. Four patients underwent curative resection，and four underwent non curative resection due to liver or liver + distant metastases (lung and para-aortic lymph node metastases) .\n\n| doxifluridine 1 2 34456 35 CEA，CYFRA：ng/mLCA19-9：U/mL g Surgery C： d e a b C CA19-9 30 C2520 CYFRA15105 CEA Postoperative months1471013 16 19 22 25 28 31 S4 37 40 43 18 19 52 55 58616187 70 73  |\n| --- |\n\n【43】Chemotherapy and radiation\n\n【44】Sixpatientsunderwent chemotherapyy for metastases OI postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. Two patients did not undergo chemotherapy because they either refused or had a poor general condition due to rapid tumor growth. A 71-year-old man (Case 1) who refused postoperative chemotherapy remained alive for 124months without recurrence. A 76-year-old man (Case 2) with early cancer did not undergo postoperative chemotherapy but underwent chemotherapy after liver recurrence. Four patients underwent intrahepatic arterial infusion (IHA) using 10 or 20 mg of cisplatin(CDDP) for liver metastases. A 67-year-old man (Case 7) underwent postoperative adjuvant therapy only. A 71-year-old man (Case 5) required third-line chemotherapy for liver metastases including IHA using CDDP， irinotecan (CPT-11)， and paclitaxel (PTX) . A 69-year-old man (Case 6) underwent several chemoradiotherapy regimens， including CDDP + CPT-11 + radiation， S-1 + PTX， amrubicinn(AMR)， carboplatin (CBDCA) + etoposide (ETP)， nogitecan (NGT)， and docetaxel (DOC)， for metachronous lung metastases and radiation for brain and bone metastases for 43months. He finally died of brain metastases 74 months after surgery(47 months after recognition of the lung metastases)  .\n\n【45】Prognosis\n\n【46】The median overall survival time was 10 months (range， 1-124months). The 5-year survival rate was 37.5%. Six patients died of recurrence and metastasis of NECs， and two patients were alive without recurrence for more than 5 years after surgery.

The cause of death was liver metastasis in five patients and brain metastasis in one. A 76-year-old man (Case 2) with early gastric cancer died of metachronous liver metastases.\n\n【50】Discussion\n\n【51】Iwafuchi et al.  described four pathogenetic pathways of stomach NEC： from common-type adenocarcinoma， from a carcinoid tumor， from multipotential stem cells， and from immature neuroendocrine cells. Many NECs of the stomach have recently been considered to originate from common-type adenocarcinoma. The cell clone of the endocrine cell carcinoma is believed to originate from intramucosal adenocarcinoma. Differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma is thought to be particularly significant for the occurrence of endocrine cell carcinoma because well-to-moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma is frequently seen in the superficial regions of the stomach in many patients with NEC . In the present study， well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma was seen in the superficial region of the stomach in three patients， and Case 7 showed non medullary infiltration and signet ring cell carcinoma in the superficial region of the stomach. Iino et al.  reported that the biological characterization of NEC depended on the histological type of adenocarcinoma from which it was generated or the component of adenocarcinoma that was dedifferentiated with growth of the NEC. In Case 7，signet ring cells were seen and the NEC cells showed infiltrative growth .\n\n【52】More than 50% of NECs are localized in the lower third of the stomach； approximately 80% are macroscopic type 2， and many NECs show medullary infiltration and expanded proliferation . These features were found in the present study.\n\n【53】NEC has a poor prognosis and is characterized by a high frequency of capillary invasion， lymph node metastasis， and hematogenous metastasis， such as to the liver and lung， either intraoperatively or in the early postoperative phase . Nishikura et al. reported that 75% of gastric NECs were advanced cancers and that 83% of gastric NECs had capillary invasion. Iwafuchi et al.  reported that capillary invasion was detected in 82.4% of 17 early gastric NECs. In the present study， all patients had moderate or marked lymphatic invasion (ly2 or ly3)， six patients had venous invasion， and seven patients had advanced cancer. Hematogenous metastases such as to the liver and/or lung occurred in six patients，including one with early gastric NEC.\n\n【54】Establishment of a definitive diagnosis of gastric NEC before surgery was difficult in the present study because many gastric NECs mainly develop in the submucosal layer. Only one patient in the current study was diagnosed with NECbefore surgery. The differential diagnoses included carcinoid， malignant lymphoma， undifferentiated carcinoma， metastatic carcinoma from small cell lung cancer； solid-type poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma， and poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma .\n\n【55】NSE is reportedly a sensitive tumor marker for neuroendocrine tumors . In the present study， NSE was upregulated in three of four patients. All four patients who underwent immunohistochemical staining for NSE showed positive results.\n\n【56】With respect to the treatment of gastric NEC， the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline recommends multimodal therapy including surgical resection of the stomach and postoperative administration of a regimen for small cell lung cancer， such as CDDP+ETP，CDDP+ CPT-11， or CBDCA +ETP . S-1 alone or S-1+CDDPhas been administered as the standard treatment for advanced gastric cancer . Additionally， several case reports documented good clinical effects of S-1 or S-1 + CDDP for NEC of the stomach in Japan . Hainsworth et al.  performed a phase II trial of three anticancer drugs including taxane (PTX，CBDCA， and ETP) in patients with poorly differentiated NEC of the gastrointestinal tract and reported a response rate of 53% and median progression-free survival time of 14.5 months. Five patients underwent IHA using CDDPforlivermetastases. However， in these patients who underwent IHA， IHA was not thought to be effective for liver metastasis of gastric NECs. Case 6underwent several chemoradiotherapy regimens including CDDP+ CPT-11 + radiation， S-1 +PTX， AMR，CBDCA+ETP，NGT，and DOC for metachronous lung metastasis and radiation for brain and bone metastases for 43 months. He finally died of brain metastases 74 months after surgery (47 months after recognition of the lung metastases). While this patient's first regimen included CDDP + CPT-11 + radiation and the clinical effect was a complete response， a single metastatic nodule was localized to S10 of the left lung； thus， radiation was thought to be effective as local therapy for this metastatic nodule. Moreover， radiation was performed for brain and bone metastases and was thought to be useful for prolonging survival and improving the patient's quality of life. This case suggests that the addition of S-1 and taxane to a small cell lung cancer regimen with radiation prolongs the survival of patients with recurrent NEC of the stomach . In the present study of patients with gastric NEC， we recommended resection of the stomach including the metastatic site. Chemotherapy for small cell lung cancer was also needed as postoperative adjuvant treatment. Multimodal therapy including surgery， chemotherapy， and radiation was needed for management of inoperable and recurrent NEC.\n\n【57】The prognosis of gastric NEC was poor in the present study. In previous studies， the 5-year survival rate and median survival time of patients with gastric NEC were reportedly 24.2% and 7 to 9 months， respectively .In our study， the median overall survival time was 10 months (range， 1-124 months)， and the 5-year survival rate was 37.5%. The cause of death was liver metastasis in five patients， including one with early gastric cancer， and brain metastasis in one patient. The 5-year survival rate of our patients was better than that in previous reports. However， the median survival time of our patients was almost the same as that in previous reports.\n\n【58】Conclusion\n\n【59】In this study， NEC was difficult to diagnose preoperatively. High frequencies of capillary invasion and hematogenous metastasis， such as to the liver， were seen in our patients with NEC， and the prognosis was poor. Even early NEC was thought to require postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. However， patients with NEC whounderwent multimodal therapy had longer-term survival.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:42:56", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:43:21", "cost": 25.289}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:45", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:43:21", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:42:55"}

It is therefore essential to know how to recognize it and treat it quickly in order to reduce mortality.\n\n【2】Methods： This study present a case of a 60-year-old female patient followed in oncology for a recurrent ovarian cancer. She was undergoing a treatment with Durvalumab Bevacizumab，Olaparib and Durvalumab. She subsequently developed fever， dyspnea， anemia and thrombocytopenia， syndrome that was quickly diagnosed as Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). The rapid initiation of treatment with etoposide， dexamethasone and Type G immunoglobulin allowed a normalization of the patient's clinical condition.\n\n【3】Discussion： We postulate two causesthat could have led to this syndrome： First， the infectious origin by EBV， but also the immunological origin by durvalumab. The rapid initiation of treatment with etoposide， dexamethasone and Type G immunoglobulin allowed a normalization of the patient's clinical condition. It is essential to make people aware of HLH and its causes in order to introduce a curative treatment as soon as possible； our objective being the reduction of its mortality.\n\n【4】Keywords： Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis； Pancytopenia； Etoposide； Dexamethasone； Immunotherapy； Viral infection\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Immunotherapies are now recognized treatments in the fight against cancer. They are innovative therapies that have revolutionized the established prognosis ofmany types of cancer. However，some information is lacking， particularly concerning their adverse effects， which can be life-threatening. The latter are on the rise due to the increase in the number of indications for immunotherapies. It therefore seems essential to identify them in order to prevent them. One of the adverse effects of immunotherapy that can be life-threatening is Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) ， which is difficult to diagnose because of its non-specific symptoms. In our article， we report our experience with HLH during the management of metastatic ovarian cancer with a BOLD(Bevacizumab， Olaparib， Durvalumab) combination therapy. Currently， this is the only existing report of HLH under immunotherapy but also with EBV reactivation. We can thus ask ourselves the question of what is the influence of EBV on the pathogenesis of this HLH and what practical therapeutic consequence it can generate.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】We present the case of a 60-year-old female patient followed in oncology for a recurrent ovarian cancer. She had already received several lines of treatment and was in relapse (lymph node metastases and peritoneal carcinosis). She was then included in a protocol called BOLD(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier： NCT04015739). It is a trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of the combination of bevacizumab， Olaparib and Durvalumab (MEDI 4736) in patients with high-grade serous or endometrioid ovarian tumor or other high-grade non-mucinous epithelial tumor， who have received at least one prior platinum-taxane-based chemotherapy regimen， and who have Platinum-Resistant Disease (PRR) or Platinum-Sensitive Relapse (PSR)， regardless of the line of chemotherapy administered at the time of relapse. The patient received a first course of BOLD but presented6 weekslater {fifth course) a poor clinicaltolerance with the appearance of a fever of39° and dyspnea at the slightest effort. Cardiopulmonary auscultations did not reveal any abnormality.On palpation we found splenomegaly with a known left supra-clavicular adenopathy of tumoral origin. Biologically， we found pancytopenia(hemoglobin 6.7 g/L， leukocytes 1.26 G/L including neutrophils 0.66G/L， platelets 12 G/L) with a CRP 174 mg/L. The blood smear did not show any Schistocytes but the haptoglobin was collapsed with LDH at 1440). The liver workup is altered (AST 219，ALT 183， GGT，709， PAL 384， total bilirubin 26). Serum ferritin was measured at28 g/L. Imaging (CT scan) and bacteriological examinations (blood cultures + urinary cytobacteriological examination) were negative. Given this clinical and biological picture， the diagnosis of HLH was evoked. The patient's poor clinical tolerance led to the suspension of immunotherapy and platelet and blood transfusions.\n\n【9】Concerning the etiological work-up， two attempts at myelograms were made but were inconclusive， eliminating however a leukemia or myelodysplasia. The various serologies (Hepatitis B， Hepatitis C， CMV， PVB19 and HHV6) were negative except for an old serology against EBV (identified with positive anti-VCA IgG antibodies but negative anti-VCA IgM) and an EBV viral load was detectable at4.7 log. Macrophagic activation syndrome under immunotherapy is retained in this patient with EBV viral reactivation as a favoring factor. A single course of Etoposide was given with 20 mg of dexamethasone and a dose of 0.4 mg/kg of type G immunoglobulin. The patient's clinical condition was normalized within 48 h after initiation of treatment. Her only symptom was dyspnea for several weeks and she finally returned home with biweekly biological monitoring. At the 30h day follow-up， the patient was symptom free (except for the persistence of the left supra-clavicularlymph node) and her biological check-up was normalized (notably Hb 11.1 and CRP 7 mg/L).\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Among the many etiologies of HLH， immunotherapy  and viral infection  are important to know because they are preventable. Moreover， they have a good prognosis when managed in time. In our case， the onset of immuno-induced HLH was concomitant with EBV infection. This article is the first to report a HLH on durvalumab. The prognosis of EBV-HLH was until recently appalling because no antiviral treatment had been shown to be effective. The use of high-dose dexamethasone  and etoposide (VP-16)  has finally proven to be effective， regardless of the origin of the HLH (immuno-or virus-induced). The estimated survival rate was 59% to 75%. The main predictive factor of response was administration within 2 days of the highest ferritin concentrations. The majority of case reports published to date concerning immuno-induced HLH confirm a clinical and biological normalization a few weeks after initiation of treatment . However， the risk of Etoposide-induced acute myeloid leukemia remains significant. Some protocols offer the option of cyclosporine as a treatment， but no clear benefit has been demonstrated. It avoids exposure to chemotherapy and the risk of bone marrow aplasia associated with etoposide. Etoposide avoids the risk of severe reactions that can be associated with cyclosporine， and may be less immunosuppressive to T cells . Rituximab  suppresses B cells (which are a reservoir for EBV)， whereas Etoposide and Dexamethasone target T and NK cells (and thus promote EBV clearance and elimination ). One study concluded that Rituximab was very effective in patients whose B cells were affected by EBV. It is therefore not effective in patients whose EB V virus affects T and NK5cells. Some studies have shown the therapeutic role of molecules such as Emapalumab or Ruxolitinib in the management of HLH. Their mechanism of action is not cellular but rather against cytokines. It would therefore be useful in future studies to determine whether these latter molecules are sufficiently effective to suppress Etoposide in the management of HLH.\n\n【12】In addition， one study has monitored the efficacy of Nivolumab in the treatment of HLH. Nivolumab was found to be effective against all subtypes of cells affected by the virus (T， B， NK). These results suggest the importance of anti-PD1 molecules in the treatment of MAS . A retrospective study  identified certain factors that increase the risk of immuno-induced HLH. These are mainly age over 60 years， male gender， and the length of time since the start of immunotherapy. Genetics (in particular the PRF1A91V3 gene polymorphism) also plays a role in the development of HLH. The risk of immunotherapy in the occurrence of HLH being established， the knowledge of additional factors is important in order to recognize the clinical warning signs as soon as possible. Cancer itself is a cause of HLH， in this case called paraneoplastic HLH . The latter remains a rare complication but has a survival rate of <25% at one year . The delay in diagnosis is long because this pathology is rare and with a broad and non-specific clinic. Its recognition is a priority in order to initiate adequate treatment as early as possible.\n\n【13】In this case， the basis of treatment of HLH is etiological treatment： A study  reporting MAS in a patient with ovarian cancer. Complete symptom resolution resulted from tumor resection and medical treatment. Unfortunately， malignancy-triggered HLH is associated with increased mortality. A study  present a series of nine pediatric and young adult patients in whom an initial diagnosis of HLH delayed the discovery ofunderlying malignancy and frequently delayed truly curative therapy. All of these patients ultimately died from multiorgan failure with active malignancy present. Both patients who received full-dose chemotherapy are still alive with no evidence of disease. These cases highlight the importance of distinguishing malignancy-associated HLH in ordertolimit morbidity and mortality. One pediatric series  describinga 6-month overall survival of 67%and median overall survival of 1.2 years， with the majority of deceased patients having active malignancy at the time of death .\n\n【14】Conclusion\n\n【15】In this article， we report our experience in the management of immuno- and virus-induced HLH in stage 3B ovarian cancer with Etoposide，Dexamethasone and Immunoglobulin G. New molecular targets appear to offer a therapeutic solution with fewer complications than Etoposide but need to be further investigated. It is important to initiate treatment as soon as possible， especially when the origin of HLH is curable. In other cases， it is necessary to know how to recognize and manage it early because its prognosis remains poor with a low survival rate at 1 year.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:45:10", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:45:17", "cost": 6.904}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:45", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:45:17", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:45:10"}

The pattern of metastases is similar between upper urinary tract and bladder urothelial carcinoma： Lymph nodes，liver，bone and lung. Here we describe a case report where a 43-years-old man affected by urothelial carcinoma of ureter underwent right nephroureterectomy and retroperitoneal lymph nodes dissection and then it was administered adjuvant chemotherapy (4 cycles of cisplatin/gemcitabine). Then， during his clinical and radiological follow-up， some uncommon sites of metastases were found， such as stomach， peritoneum， left axillary， right and left supraclavicular lymph node. At the end of five cycles of first-line chemotherapy， he developed symptoms connected to Leptomeningeal Carcinomatosis(LMC)， which is absolutely an atypical site of relapse for this kind oftumor. Patient was treated with intrathecal methotrexate 12 mg once weekly and second-line therapy with Pembrolizumab 200 mg flat dose for four cycles. In literature we have found only other two case reports which describe LMC in urothelial carcinoma of upper urinary tract and no patient affected by this tumor treated with systemic immunotherapy and intrathecal chemotherapy for LMC. Our patient died three months after the LMC diagnosis， supporting the fact that the prognosis for this site of metastasis is poor.\n\n【2】Keywords： Urothelial carcinoma； Leptomeningeal carcinomatosis； Metastatic\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Leptomeningeal Carcinomatosis (LMC) is a very unusual metastatic localization for urothelial carcinoma of ureter. In this case report we describe a 43-years-old man affected by this kind of tumor with atypical sites of relapse： Stomach， peritoneum， left axillary， right and left supraclavicular lymph node and finally LMC. The treatment for LMC from solid tumors is not established， but Intrathecal Therapy (IT)， radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy according to primary tumor are usually administered . In literature there are not many metastatic presentations like this， as well as few descriptions of treatment based on systemic immunotherapy and IT for LMC.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】In February 2019， a 43-years-old Caucasian man， presented hematuria. He had no concomitant diseases. His familiar history was positive for breast cancer (grandmother and sister). An abdominal ultrasound scan identified right hydronephrosis of grade II-III and pelvic expansion of right ureter. A contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) of chest and abdomen confirmed the presence of right hydronephrosis and a mass of 2 cm ofureter， the bladder had irregular walls，retroperitoneal lymph nodes were enlarged， the major of them of 2 cm × 1.2 cm. A Cystoscopy revealed normal mucous membrane without macroscopic alterations with thickening of the right walls. In March2019， a right nephroureterectomy and retroperitoneal lymph nodes dissection were performed. A macroscopic examination showed 5 cm mass of right ureter. Histological examination found a papillary and not papillary urothelial carcinoma of right ureter， G3， and metastatic involvement of only one of three lymph nodes. According to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)/Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TMN) staging system，8h edition  tumor staging was pT3 pN1 cM0， stage IV.\n\n【7】The patient had good clinical conditions； Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score was 0. His blood examination was normal， in particular serum creatinine was 1.24 mg/dl with estimation Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) >60 ml/min. He was fit for cisplatin-based chemotherapy； in particular he had no cardiovascular， audiometric and neurological alterations. From April to July 2019， our patients received 4 cycles of first line intravenous chemotherapy with gemcitabine 1000 mg/m’on days 1-8 q21 plus cisplatin 70 mg/m’ on day 1-q21 without significant adverse events， except Grade (G) 1 nausea from day 1 to day 3 of chemotherapy and G1 fatigue according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event version5.0 (CTCAE v5.0). There was no relapse of disease at abdominal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and a chest CT scan performed in August 2019. He underwent observation with blood examination， urinary cytology， abdominal ultrasound/MRI and chest CT scan， all of these were negative.\n\n【8】Thirteen months later (September 2020)， patient complained G1left armpit pain， G2 abdominal pain， G2 nausea and G2 vomit.ECOG performance status score was 0. He showed weight loss of 7% in last6 months and reduced oral intake (50%) in past 7 days. An axillary ultrasound showed 5 cm ×1.7 cm ×3 cm mass of left armpit. Urinary cytology was negative for atypical cells. Abdomen ultrasound revealed6 mm mass of posterior portion of bladder. For gastrointestinal symptoms， patient received Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) and underwent Esophageal-Gastro-Duodenoscopy (EGDS) with biopsy that found diffusely edematous， hyperemic and hypertrophic mucosa from fundus to antral region of stomach； duodenal mucosa was edematous andhyperemicwith some superficialerosions. Histological examination revealed neoplastic cells positive for GATA3， CK7，p63at Immunohistochemistry analysis， with a possible urothelial origin. There was no alteration of mismatch repair proteins (MLH1，PMS\n\n【9】MSH2，MSH6).\n\n【10】A (18F) Fluoro-Deoxy-Glucose (FDG) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) in Combination with CT (PET-CT) showed elevated uptake of stomach (SUVmax 10.9) ， left armpit(SUVmax 6.4) ， right and left superclavear lymph nodes(SUVmax 5.5 and 5.6， respectively)  and peritoneum(SUVmax 3.8). Based on the long progression free survival after first line chemotherapy treatment， the good tolerance of first line of chemotherapy， the good clinical condition and young age of patient， between October and December 2020， were administered 4 cycles of intravenous chemotherapy with gemcitabine 1000 mg/m’ on days1-8 q21 plus cisplatin 70 mg/m’ on day 1-q. Then， FDG-PET-CT revealed a partial metabolic response， in particular， there were no uptake in stomach and peritoneum and there was uptake reduction ofleft armpit (SUVmax 2.5)， right and left superclavear lymph nodes(both with SUVmax 3). A Cystoscopy of control was negative. For the disappearance of abdominal symptoms and the recovery of normal weight (/increase of weight)， TPN was interrupted with a gradually intake of oral food. On January 20h， 2021 was administered， the patient was in good clinical conditions， he accused only G1 nausea and G1 vomiting from day 1 to day 3 of chemotherapy and G1 fatigue.\n\n【11】Ten days later after the fifth cycle of chemotherapy， for the onset of frontal headache， diplopia and visual blurring， the patient underwent ophthalmological evaluation showing bilateral hyperemic and edematous papillae with flame hemorrhages and peripapillary exudates. A brain CT scan described intracranial hypertension without brain metastaticlesions. There was mild tortuosity ofthe optic nerves and mild ectasia of perioptic sheaths， and a slight appearance detected of both optic papillae. There were no neurological alterations at clinical examination. So， he was admitted in the Neurology department. Neurological evaluation found diplopia with a deficit of left VI cranial nerve， mild anisocoria major on the left than right. A brain MRI confirmed intracranial hypertension and contrast enhancement involving of leptomeninges. A lumbar puncture was performed. Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) was colorless， transparent， glucose and protein levels were normal (57 mg/dl and 46 mg/dl， respectively)， chloride was 131 mEq/l； cells count was increased(50 cells/uL) with lymphocytes and atypic cells. Cytological CSF examination revealed atypic cells positive for GATA 3 and negative for p63 and TTF1， with a possible metastatic localization ofurothelial carcinoma. Microbiological examination and CSF antibodies research were negative.\n\n【12】Frontal headache was stopped after pharmacological treatment with acetazolamide but there was no benefit in left visual loss and appeared vomiting. The patient was transferred to the Oncology Department， for other evaluation and treatment. He received steroid， anti-emesis and anti-edema therapy. For leptomeningeal carcinomatosis， we decided tOadministeerrIntrathecaal(IT) methotrexate 12 mg weekly and concomitant second line of systemic treatment with the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab at flat dose of 200 mg intravenous on day 1 q21n (a total of four cycles were administered). Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) evaluation of DNA and RNA was performed in CSF of the first IT infusion， identifying uncommon alteration of exon 11 of BRAF gene (G466V)(missense) and of exon 3 of AKT1 gene (E17K) (missense)， did not found alteration of BRCA1 gene. NGS examination performed to the following IT infusion did not identify gene alterations.\n\n【13】After 4 doses of IT chemotherapy， CSF was colorless， transparent， glucose level was normal (54 mg/dl)， protein was 68 mg/dl (elevated)， chloride was 123 mEq/l(normal)， cells count was decreased (1 cells/uL) but cytological CSF examination was still positive for atypical cells， so this treatment was interrupted after five IT methotrexate infusions.\n\n【14】At the beginning of April， he was admitted in the Oncology department because of sepsis from Pseudomonas aeruginosa； during the hospitalization he underwent a brain RMI which showed stable intracranial hypertension without contrast enhancement in leptomeninges. From the middle of April， his clinical condition became worse and worse because of the onset of epileptic seizures and progressive postural instability. He passed away at the beginning of May， three months after the diagnosis of LMC.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Urothelialcarcinoma ofureterandrenalpelvis is rare，representing respectively 1% and 5% of all urothelial cancers. On the contrary， the most common histology of Bladder Cancer (BC) is urothelial one. More often these tumors metastasize to lymph nodes， liver， bone and lung . Our patient showed atypical sites of metastasis， such as stomach， peritoneum， left axillary， right and left supraclavicular lymph nodes. Moreover， he had Leptomeningeal Carcinomatosis(LMC)， which is absolutely an atypical site of metastasis of this kind of tumor.\n\n【17】Leptomeningeal Carcinomatosis (LMC) consists in cancer cell localization in pia mater， arachnoid and in the space between them， called subarachnoid space. It is also called leptomeningeal disease and leptomeningeal metastasis. The percentage of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies that metastasize to leptomeninges is about5% to 8% and 5% to 15%. More often， lung cancer (9% to 25%)， breast cancer (5%to8%)and melanoma (6%to 18%) could show this particular metastatic site， with major incidence in some histological subtypes such as lobular histology and triple-negative molecular subtype for breast cancer and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-mutant disease.\n\n【18】In general， the incidence of LMC has increased because of new detection instruments for diagnosis. Most therapeutic arms are developing to control this kind of disease.\n\n【19】About 1.2 to 2 years occur from diagnosis of systemic solid cancer to LMC . Specifically， our patient developed LMC after 2 years. Onset symptoms were headache and blurred vision. When LMC started， FDG PET/TC showed partial response of the other metastasis sites. To our best knowledge， only two cases of metastatic urothelial cancer of upper urinary tract and LMC were reported in literature. Imamura et al. describe a case report where otologic symptoms (facial nerve paralysis and bilateral hearing loss) were the first clinical presentation of LMC from transitional carcinoma of renal pelvis： these symptoms were connected to the infiltration of malignant cells in temporal bone . In Matsushita et al. case report it is described a transitional carcinoma of bladder and ureter， where LMC symptoms developed sixteenth month after radical cystectomy and right nephroureterectomy， and then patient died six days after LMC diagnosis .\n\n【20】Actually LMC therapy consists in Intrathecal Therapy (IT)， systemic chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Our patient was treated with five administrations of intrathecal methotrexate 12 mg once weekly. Moreover， in February 2021 he started second-line therapy with Pembrolizumab 200 mg flat dose every three weeks for four cycles.\n\n【21】Umezawa et al.  collected 33 cases of LMC and metastatic BC； the majority of them were urothelial carcinoma， except for two cases with different histologies (adenocarcinoma and small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma).\n\n【22】As in most cases described in this review， our patient has developed LMC during the first-line chemotherapy， after the histological diagnosis of gastric relapse. Umezawa et al. reported that twenty-four patients were treated， while nine patients did not receive any treatment because their clinical conditions quickly became worse. 14 of 24 treated patients (58.3%) received IT chemotherapy (methotrexate alone in 13 pts， unknown in 1 pt). Seven patients (29.2%) underwent a radiotherapy treatment (in 1craniospinal radiotherapy，spinal radiotherapy in 1， and whole-brain radiotherapy in 5). Finally， two patients (8.3%) received systemic medical treatment， based on MVAC or Gemcitabina .\n\n【23】In the present case， it was administered a combined treatment (IT and systemic immune-checkpoint inhibitor). If we analyze the review just mentioned， we can observe that seven patients， who underwent IT， received another therapy： Six patients also radiotherapy and one also systemic chemotherapy.\n\n【24】A recent case report describes LMC in a bladder cancer and its treatment： After the clinical and radiological manifestation of LMC， patient received whole-brain radiotherapy (30 Gy) and then immunotherapy， Pembrolizumab 200 mg， but he died of bladder cancer one month after the diagnosis of LMC.\n\n【25】Therefore in literature there is not a description of a treatment similar to our case： IT with MTX 12 mg weekly and Pembrolizumab200 mgq.\n\n【26】According to the prognosis， our patients passed away 3 months after the diagnosis of LMC. Umezawa et al.  confirm the poor prognosis： 35 days (interquartile range： 16 to 134 days) was the median survival time from the diagnosis of LMC， except for rare cases.\n\n【27】In conclusion， advanced urothelial cancer of upper urinary tract has low survival rates ； if we add LMC’s median survival time， the final prognosis becomes really adverse， like in our case report.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": ".\n\n【8】", "content": "【0】Abstract\n\n【1】Renal pelvis and ureter's tumors constitute upper urinary tract tumors， whose histological subtype is urothelial carcinoma， that occurs more frequently in bladder.

The patient was transferred to the Oncology Department， for other evaluation and treatment. He received steroid， anti-emesis and anti-edema therapy. For leptomeningeal carcinomatosis， we decided tOadministeerrIntrathecaal(IT) methotrexate 12 mg weekly and concomitant second line of systemic treatment with the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab at flat dose of 200 mg intravenous on day 1 q21n (a total of four cycles were administered). Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) evaluation of DNA and RNA was performed in CSF of the first IT infusion， identifying uncommon alteration of exon 11 of BRAF gene (G466V)(missense) and of exon 3 of AKT1 gene (E17K) (missense)， did not found alteration of BRCA1 gene. NGS examination performed to the following IT infusion did not identify gene alterations.\n\n【13】After 4 doses of IT chemotherapy， CSF was colorless， transparent， glucose level was normal (54 mg/dl)， protein was 68 mg/dl (elevated)， chloride was 123 mEq/l(normal)， cells count was decreased (1 cells/uL) but cytological CSF examination was still positive for atypical cells， so this treatment was interrupted after five IT methotrexate infusions.\n\n【14】At the beginning of April， he was admitted in the Oncology department because of sepsis from Pseudomonas aeruginosa； during the hospitalization he underwent a brain RMI which showed stable intracranial hypertension without contrast enhancement in leptomeninges. From the middle of April， his clinical condition became worse and worse because of the onset of epileptic seizures and progressive postural instability. He passed away at the beginning of May， three months after the diagnosis of LMC.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Urothelialcarcinoma ofureterandrenalpelvis is rare，representing respectively 1% and 5% of all urothelial cancers. On the contrary， the most common histology of Bladder Cancer (BC) is urothelial one. More often these tumors metastasize to lymph nodes， liver， bone and lung . Our patient showed atypical sites of metastasis， such as stomach， peritoneum， left axillary， right and left supraclavicular lymph nodes. Moreover， he had Leptomeningeal Carcinomatosis(LMC)， which is absolutely an atypical site of metastasis of this kind of tumor.\n\n【17】Leptomeningeal Carcinomatosis (LMC) consists in cancer cell localization in pia mater， arachnoid and in the space between them， called subarachnoid space. It is also called leptomeningeal disease and leptomeningeal metastasis. The percentage of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies that metastasize to leptomeninges is about5% to 8% and 5% to 15%. More often， lung cancer (9% to 25%)， breast cancer (5%to8%)and melanoma (6%to 18%) could show this particular metastatic site， with major incidence in some histological subtypes such as lobular histology and triple-negative molecular subtype for breast cancer and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) with Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-mutant disease.\n\n【18】In general， the incidence of LMC has increased because of new detection instruments for diagnosis. Most therapeutic arms are developing to control this kind of disease.\n\n【19】About 1.2 to 2 years occur from diagnosis of systemic solid cancer to LMC . Specifically， our patient developed LMC after 2 years. Onset symptoms were headache and blurred vision. When LMC started， FDG PET/TC showed partial response of the other metastasis sites. To our best knowledge， only two cases of metastatic urothelial cancer of upper urinary tract and LMC were reported in literature. Imamura et al. describe a case report where otologic symptoms (facial nerve paralysis and bilateral hearing loss) were the first clinical presentation of LMC from transitional carcinoma of renal pelvis： these symptoms were connected to the infiltration of malignant cells in temporal bone . In Matsushita et al. case report it is described a transitional carcinoma of bladder and ureter， where LMC symptoms developed sixteenth month after radical cystectomy and right nephroureterectomy， and then patient died six days after LMC diagnosis .\n\n【20】Actually LMC therapy consists in Intrathecal Therapy (IT)， systemic chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Our patient was treated with five administrations of intrathecal methotrexate 12 mg once weekly. Moreover， in February 2021 he started second-line therapy with Pembrolizumab 200 mg flat dose every three weeks for four cycles.\n\n【21】Umezawa et al.  collected 33 cases of LMC and metastatic BC； the majority of them were urothelial carcinoma， except for two cases with different histologies (adenocarcinoma and small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma).\n\n【22】As in most cases described in this review， our patient has developed LMC during the first-line chemotherapy， after the histological diagnosis of gastric relapse. Umezawa et al. reported that twenty-four patients were treated， while nine patients did not receive any treatment because their clinical conditions quickly became worse. 14 of 24 treated patients (58.3%) received IT chemotherapy (methotrexate alone in 13 pts， unknown in 1 pt). Seven patients (29.2%) underwent a radiotherapy treatment (in 1craniospinal radiotherapy，spinal radiotherapy in 1， and whole-brain radiotherapy in 5). Finally， two patients (8.3%) received systemic medical treatment， based on MVAC or Gemcitabina .\n\n【23】In the present case， it was administered a combined treatment (IT and systemic immune-checkpoint inhibitor). If we analyze the review just mentioned， we can observe that seven patients， who underwent IT， received another therapy： Six patients also radiotherapy and one also systemic chemotherapy.\n\n【24】A recent case report describes LMC in a bladder cancer and its treatment： After the clinical and radiological manifestation of LMC， patient received whole-brain radiotherapy (30 Gy) and then immunotherapy， Pembrolizumab 200 mg， but he died of bladder cancer one month after the diagnosis of LMC.\n\n【25】Therefore in literature there is not a description of a treatment similar to our case： IT with MTX 12 mg weekly and Pembrolizumab200 mgq.\n\n【26】According to the prognosis， our patients passed away 3 months after the diagnosis of LMC. Umezawa et al.  confirm the poor prognosis： 35 days (interquartile range： 16 to 134 days) was the median survival time from the diagnosis of LMC， except for rare cases.\n\n【27】In conclusion， advanced urothelial cancer of upper urinary tract has low survival rates ； if we add LMC’s median survival time， the final prognosis becomes really adverse， like in our case report.", "index": 4496, "show": true, "start": 4496, "end": 4502, "comment": "【9】MSH2，MSH6).", "isEdit": false, "province": ["格式规范性", "多余换行"]}], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:45:18", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:45:57", "cost": 39.357}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:45", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:45:57", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:45:18"}

Infection， stone disease， primary bowel mass， and recurrent urothelial cell cancer are among the causes to consider. Here， we report a case of a 61 year old male who developed hematuria secondary to neobladder varices which was managed with TIPS (Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt) and variceal embolization.\n\n【2】Keywords： Neobladder； Hematuria； TIPS； Cirrhosis； Bladder cancer； Varices\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】The standard of care for muscle invasive bladder cancer is a radical cystectomy. While different urinary diversion techniques are utilized， an orthotopicneobladder allows the patient to utilize the natural orifice for urine drainage . By utilizing bowel， neobladders are uniquely susceptible to pathologies associated with the gastrointestinal system as well as the genitourinary system . This creates a diagnostic problem in these patients when presenting with hematuria. This is a case report of a male with hepatic cirrhosis who developed hematuria from neobladder varices that was managed by TIPS and variceal embolization. To our knowledge， this is the first case of TIPS and variceal embolization being utilized to successfully stop hematuria in this setting.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 61 year old male with idiopathic hepatic cirrhosis who had undergone cystoprostatectomy for muscle invasive bladder cancer with ileal neobladder ten years prior presented with a one month history of hematuria. He maintained follow up after his original surgery as it was complicated by wound dehissence resulting in neobladder cutaneous fistula. It was eventually closed andhe was lost to follow up about 7 years ago. He reports that he was doing well in the interim until he developed hematuria but did not seek treatment until he developed clot retention and went to an outside hospital. There， he had cystoscopy which revealed diffuse mucosal hemorrhage. He continued to have hematuria requiring continuous bladder irrigation and blood transfusion so he was transferred to our academic institution. On presentation， he was actively hemorrhaging from his neobladder so he was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU). His liver function was compromised as he had Child Pugh class B cirrhosis with total bilirubin of1.5mg/dL， albumin at 2.4g/dL， prothrombin time of 16.7s， moderate ascites on CT scan， and no evidence of encephalopathy. After the patient received resuscitation， cystoscopy was performed to evacuate clots revealing hemorrhage emanating from multiple sites but no mucosal abnormalities indicative of neoplasm. CT angiogram did not show active extravasation but did show prominent varices surrounding the neobladder . During the diagnostic workup， he remained in the ICU as his hematuria persisted such that he received a total of 20 units of packed red blood cells， 6 units of platelets， and 8 units of fresh frozen plasma to maintain hemodynamic stability. The medical team's recommendation was to obtain hepatic venous pressure gradient measurement to assess the varices as a cause of the bleeding. His pressure gradient was found to be elevated at 19 mmHg (normal <5mmHg) so 10 mm TIPS endoprosthesis consisting of a nitinol stent with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft was placed lowering the gradient to 6 mmHg  . Unfortunately， variceal flow remained retrograde and his bleeding continued 2 days later so embolization of the neobladder varices was performed with vascular coils and Amplatzer plugs . Subsequently， his hematuria resolved. He remained free of signs ofTIPS complications without development of encephalopathy， fever， or worsening ascites. He was able to void spontaneously by Crede，external compression of the bladder， after foley catheter removal and had low urine residual before discharge.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Hematuria as a result of neobladder varices is a rare entity. Review of the literature only revealed one other case. That patient was unsuccessfully treated with diathermy of the mucosa at the sites of hemorrhage resulting in his death . Additionally， there is a handful of case reports of patients who developed hematuria from varices associated with an ileal conduit. Two of these were successfully treated by a TIPS procedure while another was managed by revision ofthe conduit and ligation of the varix .\n\n【9】Although very few cases have been reported， the etiology of the bleeding suggests this pathology carries a high risk of death. In the current case， the patient was improved a combination of TIPS and variceal embolization. Additionally， he benefitted from having relatively preserved liver function in the face of cirrhosis severe enough to induce varices and ascites.\n\n【10】Conclusion varices. The difficulty associated with managing patients who develop hematuria from varices mandates that liver function and cirrhotic state are factored in when considering type of urinary diversion. Based off the limited number of case reports available， ileal conduit may be a safer option in these patients as management of hematuria from the varices appears to be more successful. Although many factors influence the overall survival of a patient with muscle invasive bladder cancer considering radical cystectomy， underlying hepatic disease must be included.

Six years earlier， liver transplantation had been performed due to hepatocellular carcinoma. This is the second case reported in the medical literature where a recurrence occurred after a strong immunosuppression regimen. The influence of immunosuppression in the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma will be discussed in this case.\n\n【2】Keywords： Liver； Kidney； Transplantation； Immunosuppression； Hepatocellular； Carcinoma； Recurrence； Mycophenolate sodium； Mycophenolate mofetil； Sirolimus and tacrolimus\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】One of the most highly incident cancers in the world is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ； it is the fifth most common cancer in males and the cancer second most related to death . Usually， the treatment of HCC for patients begins at an early stage ofliver disease and with relatively preserved liver function， but this must consider tumor size and number. Curative treatment options include tumor resection， radiofrequency ablation and liver transplantation.\n\n【5】The Milan criteria are widely accepted for the indication of liver transplantation，leading to 4-and 5-yearsurvival rates greater than 85% and 70%， respectively. Although severallimitations， such as organ shortage and tumor recurrence， other extended criteria have shown similar 5-yearsurvival rates ranging from 71 to 87% . The recurrence ratio (10-60%) is related to factors such as tumor number {especially a tumor size greater than 5 cm)， lymphovascular invasion， multifocal tumors， alpha-fetoprotein level greater than 200 ng/dl， poor differentiation， preoperative transparietal biopsy， down-staging of the tumor， and additionally， to the influence of the immunosuppressive drugs .\n\n【6】Schreibman et al.  reported the first case in the literature of a late HCC recurrence after transplantation that could be due to immunosuppression. We report here the second case in the medicalliterature of a late HCC recurrence after sequential liver and kidney transplantation .\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 48-year-old male patient， with type 2 diabetes mellitus， developed secondary cirrhosis due to alcohol consumption. He was at Child-Pugh B level when he received a non-invasive diagnosis of HCC with an abdominal tomographic scan， which discovered four nodules measuring less than 2 cm each， on the right lobe， associated with an Alpha Fetoprotein(AFP) serum level of 350.2 ng/ml.\n\n| Variables  | This author  | Schreibman et al.   |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gender  | Male  | Male  |\n| Age af OL Tx ly old)  | 48  | 69  |\n| Etiofogy of cirrhosis  | ALD  | HVC  |\n| Tumor size (cm)  | 1，6 to 1，7； multifocal  | 4 and 6  |\n| Vascular invasion  | Yes  | No  |\n| Tumor profile  | Edmondson grade withmultifocaldistribution  | Edmondson gradel，with focus of clear cells  |\n| Satellite lesions at Transpfanfation  | No；T4N0Mx  | No  |\n| Kidney graft time posf OLTx  | 6 years  | 4 years  |\n| Reason for Kidney graft  | diabetic nephropathy  | diabetic nephropathy  |\n| Time of HCC recurrence  | 8 years and 5 month (101 month)  | 6 years and 7 month (79 month)  |\n| Recurrence site  | The lungs， pleura and peritoneal membrane  | The abdomen， pelvis， and lungs  |\n| Afpha-fetoprotein at OLTx and recurrence  | At OLTx - 232.6； At HCC recurrence- 350mcg/ml  | At OLTx 350 mcg/ml  |\n| Immunosuppression at HCC recurrence  | Prednisone， Sodium mycophenolate： andSirolimus；  | TAC plus Prednisone  |\n| Surveillance regimen Treatment of the HCC recurrence  | Yearly Sorafenib followedby gemcitabineand oxaliplatin  | 3， 4，and 5 years after OLTx Surgical resection followedby Arginine  |\n| Survival  | Eleventh month after HCC recurrence  | deaminize.adriamycin and thalidomide (study protocol) 9y and 9 month after OLTx and 3 y and 2 m after the kidney grafting and OLTx = orthotropic liver transplantation  |\n\n【10】While waiting for liver transplantation， he underwent two chemoembolization sessions. His liver transplant occurred in May2003； he had been registered on the waiting list for sixteen months. At that time， in Brazil， patients were submitted to transplantation surgery according to their waiting time on the transplant list； the MELD system was introduced in 2006. By histopathological examination of the explanted liver， we found that he was beyond the Milan criteria， showing multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma spread over all liver segments (I to VIII)， with tumor diameters of 1.6 to 1.7cm，trabecular and pseudo-glandular occurrences，Edmonson-Steiner grade III， and also foci of micro-and macro-vascular invasion . The TNM classification was T4N0Mx， as the two lymph nodes removed from the peripancreatic and portal region were free of malignancy. After liver transplantation， the alpha-fetoprotein serum level fell from 350 ng/ml to 4.4 ng/ml.\n\n【11】On the day after liver transplantation， immunosuppression was started with prednisone 20 mg per day， tacrolimus 2 mg every12h and mycophenolate mofetil 500 mg daily. After 21 days of immunosuppression， prednisone was decreased by 5 mg every three weeks， until it was stopped at the end of the third month， as required by our pre-stated protocol. The serum level of tacrolimus ranged from 2 to 13 ng/mL (mean of 8.37 ng/ml).\n\n【12】In 2006 April， three years after the liver transplantation， due to severe diabetes complications， tacrolimus had been replaced by sirolimus， with an initial dose of 2 mg per day， adjusted to 1 mg on alternate days. The serum sirolimus level ranged from 2.5 to 6.2 ng/mL (mean of 3.88 ng/mL) throughout the three subsequent years. Mycophenolate mofetil was maintained throughout the period with adjusted doses， according to clinical and laboratorial evaluations.\n\n【13】Six years after the liver transplantation (December 2009)， the patient underwent a heterologous kidney transplantation from a cadaveric donor due to chronic kidney failure， as a consequence of diabetic nephropathy. The preoperative evaluation， including bone scintigraphy， thorax and abdominal tomographic scans and serum alpha-fetoprotein， showed no evidence of recurrence of the HCC. After the kidney transplant， the immunosuppressive regimen was changed to thymoglobulin (ATG)， 4.5 mg/kg divided in three doses and methylprednisolone 500 mg， followed by prednisone 45 mg/day(0.5 mg/kg) and sodium mycophenolate 720 mg every 12 h. Sirolimus was maintained on 1 mg every day. On the eleventh day after the kidney transplant had occurred， acute rejection of the new organ was treated with a methylprednisolone pulse， 1 g for three days. Then immunosuppression was maintained with prednisone 45 mg/day， sodium mycophenolate 720 mg every 12h and sirolimus 2 mg/day.\n\n【14】Eighteen months after the renal transplant (June 2011)， routine exams showed an increasing alpha-fetoprotein level from 6.7 ng/mL to 232.6 ng/ml. Bone scintigraphy showed no evidence of metastasis. However， a computed tomography chest scan identified nodules with a diameter of 2.5 cm in the right lung . The patient was referred for pulmonary lobectomy， which was not performed due to disseminated tumors on the lungs and pleura. Upon histopathological examination， metastatic HCC in the lungs was diagnosed， 8.5 years after liver transplantation， as demonstrated in Figures 4A and 4B. Thereafter， the patient was treated with sorafenib400 mg twice daily for 80 days， when the treatment was discontinued due to the progression of the metastatic liver tumor. Second-line systemic therapy with gemcitabine and oxaliplatin started， but it was suspended after the second cycle due to myelotoxicity. The patient underwent supportive therapy until progression to death， eleven months after the HCC recurrence.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Tumor recurrence after liver transplantation is “early\"when it occurs within 2 years， “late”when it occurs between 2 and 5 years and those that occur after 5 years of the cancer recovery are considered“very late\"tumor recurrences Most recurrences usually occur within the first two vears after treatment. The literature does not contain many cases of very late recurrences.\n\n【17】Our patient received a liver transplant due to alcoholic cirrhosis and HCC， which was followed by kidney transplantation six years later. He had an HCC recurrence 8.5 years (101 months) after liver transplantation.\n\n【18】During liver transplantation， factors associated with poor survival were discovered： a multifocal tumor，poor differentiation and vascular invasion， known as a predictive factor for tumor reappearance. Although we cannot prove it， we can consider that the balance of these immunosuppressive drugs may have played a role in the long-term survival of HCC in our patient after his liver transplant. On the other hand， we can also postulate that the over-immunosuppression after his kidney transplant， with a triple regimen with ATG，mycophenolic acid and a corticosteroid ， may have been an important influence on HCC recurrence at a very late time point.\n\n【19】The concept of immunosuppression as an important factor for tumor growth was postulated by Yokoyama ， who demonstrated that the time for doubling the diameter of a recurrent tumor in a transplanted liver under immunosuppression was only 37 days， whereas the doubling of the tumor recurrence in un transplanted cirrhotic patients without therapeutic immunosuppression occurred in 273 days. Experimental studies also demonstrated that cyclosporine A (CsA) increases the growth and invasiveness of tumor cells by inhibiting DNA repair functions .\n\n【20】Clinical Studies from the Bologna Group have shown that the cumulative dose of CSA in the first year after transplantation is an important factor in tumor recurrence. They also analyzed two patient groups transplanted because of HCC， one treated with cyclosporine and the other with tacrolimus. As a high relapse rate was noted in both groups， they recommend that calcineurin inhibitors should be used with caution in patients transplanted for HCC . ecent studies have demonstrated that elevated levels calcineurin inhibitors within the first month after transplantation，i.e. tacrolimus> 10 ng/ml or cyclosporine>300 ng/mlare associated with increased relapse of HCC . Another study with approximately36，000 kidney transplant patients demonstrated a higher incidence of cancer in this group of patients than in the general population and， once more， immunosuppression was associated with a carcinogenic effect .\n\n【21】S-adenosyl-L-methionine studies have suggested that sirolimus and everolimus，both inhibitors ofthe mammalian target of rapamycin(mTOR)， are new immunosuppressant drugs with an antitumor effect due to their ability to inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells. It has also been demonstrated that sirolimus and everolimus are safe and increase survival in liver transplant patients with HCC .\n\n【22】Geisseler et al.  showed that sirolimus in liver transplant recipients with HCC do not improve long-term recurrence-free survival beyond 5 years. However， a recurrence-free survival and overall survival benefit was evident in the first 3 to 5 years， especially in low-risk patients. This trial provided the first high-level evidence for selecting an immunosuppression regime in liver transplant recipients with HCC.\n\n【23】Both our patient and Schreibman’s patient had similar high risk factors for HCC recurrence， such as over-immunosuppression and the timing of disseminated HCC recurrence after sequential liver-kidney transplantation， and both patients had a very low chance of effective treatment. Also， the coincident time of HCC recurrence of these two patients after sequential transplantation may focus attention on using a less powerful immunosuppressive regimen after kidney transplantation. The literature associates longer disease-free survival with a milder immunosuppressive regimen . Additionally， we can also postulate about the benefit of screening the patient more often for HCC recurrence after kidney transplantation， in anticipation to the risk of severe disseminated disease on long-term follow-up.\n\n【24】In conclusion， we present the second case of HCC recurrence after sequential liver and kidney transplantation with a combination of risk factors such as tumor size， vascular invasion， over-immunosuppression and double transplantation. Therefore， we can suggest that patients with HCC who undergo to double sequential transplant， during long-term follow-up， should receive the mildest immunosuppressive regimen possible and more frequent screening for HCC recurrence， i.e. at least every 6 months. We highlight the need for further randomized studies to identify the best protocol for immunosuppression in liver transplant patients with hepatocellular carcinoma to prevent the recurrence of the tumor.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:45:30", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:45:47", "cost": 17.032}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:45", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:45:47", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:45:30"}

Two cases had trauma around the elbow joint before ankylosis. At the most recent examinations， the average arc of motion was 85 degrees among patients. Two patients satisfied with surgical outcomes， however， one patient complained of residual pain and numbness. There were some reports about TEA of ankylosed elbow，however， there were few reports limited to ankylosed elbow with RA. TEA for ankylotic elbows in patients with RA is a good surgical option to restore adequate function. To gain a good outcome， it should be evaluated other joints in the extremity in order to properly evaluate the mobility and function of the elbowand to prepare a comprehensive plan of pre- and post-operative management that takes into consideration the full motion of the upper extremity.\n\n【2】Keywords： Ankylotic elbow； Rheumatoid arthritis， Total elbow arthroplasty\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is a common disease characterized by chronic synovitis and resulting in joint destruction. Recent advancements in the diagnostic process and treatment of RA have decreased joint surgery， including synovectomy or joint replacement， over the last decade . Nevertheless， some patients with severe joint destruction occasionally develop severe contractures or ankylosis which impair the Activities of Daily Living (ADL).\n\n【5】The incidence of elbow joint involvement in Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is approximately 50%. Destruction of the elbow joint seriously impairs upper limb function. Moreover， complete ankylosis of the elbow results in severe disability and functional limitations， especially when other joints in the ipsilateral upper extremity also have limited motion . In a previous study not limited to RA patients， the analysis of compensatory movement after arthrodesis of the elbow showed compromised ability， despite a significantly increased dependence on wrist movement . Since the wrist or shoulder joint is occasionally damaged and impaired in patients with RA， ankylosis of the elbow affects ADL more than it would in a patient without RA . Accordingly，an ankylosed elbow， especially in RA patients， generally should be treated.\n\n【6】Elbow contractures are usually treated with arthroscopic surgery or open surgical release and numerous reports have indicated the achievement of good results . However， fewer reports present the results of Total Elbow Arthroplasty (TEA) in ankylosed elbows . Figgie et al.  concluded that stiff elbows are difficult to treat and have a high complication rate. The latter study was reported in 1989 and good anatomical implants were not available at that time. Since implant design and surgical techniques have advanced in recent years， TEA could now be a reliable option to restore function to completely ankylosed elbows damaged by RA. There were some reports of TEA on ankylosed elbow； however， there were few reports about TEA ankylosed elbow limited to RA patient. This report is a retrospective review of TEAs performed in our hospital between 2008 and2015 for ankylosed elbows in patients with RA. We examine complete ankylosis in three elbows of three patients with RA who underwent TEA. All of the patients were women and their average age at surgery was 55 years (range， 29 to 72 years). Herein we report these cases.\n\n【7】Anteroposterior and lateral views after total elbow arthroplasty (TEA).\n\n【8】Case Presentation Case 1\n\n【9】A 29-year-old woman had complained of polyarthralgia when she was16 years old， at which time she visited our clinic and was diagnosed with RA. When she was 27 years old she struck her right elbow when she fell to the ground. After the accident， she was referred to the nearby hospital， where she was diagnosed with a right humeral supracondylar fracture and treated conservatively with a cast. Bone union was achieved 3 months after the injury. However， this patient was referred to our department 1 year after the injury because she noticed a reduction in motion and gradual impairment of her right elbow. Radiographs revealed that her right elbow was completely ankylosed and fused at 20 degrees flexed position . There were no symptoms due to ulnar nerve. In the hope that she would be able to regain the mobility needed to be able to wash her face and hair by her， at 29 years of age she underwent a linked TEA (K-NOW snap in； Nakashima Medical， Okayama， Japan). The posterior Campbell approach was used， and the triceps was incised in an inverted V-shape. First， the ulnar nerve was isolated and protected. Second， the extensor carpi ulnaris and anconeus muscles were released from the ulna. Although osseous ankylosis had occurred， it was easy to identify the landmarks of the original humeroulnar joint. After the radial head was resected， the humeroulnar joint line was carefully opened using a bone saw and mini-osteotomes. The rest of the procedure was almost the same as any standard TEA method. Care was taken to release the anterior part of the capsule to improve extension and the triceps muscle was released from the humerus in order to improve flexion. Under general anesthesia， the range of motion of the elbow ranged from 0 to 125 degrees after the implants had settled. The triceps flap was elongated using the V-Y method. The ulnar nerve was replaced anteriorly from its origin. A radiographic examination after the surgery showed the alignment of components was acceptable . The patient's elbow was immobilized with a splint for 1 week. Under the observation of an occupational therapist， the splint was removed and range of motion exercises were begun with a 30 degrees restriction on extension. Three weeks after the operation， the patient was allowed to move her elbow freely. Any elbow brace was not applied. At the most recent examination， or 65 months after surgery， passive motion of the patient's elbow ranged from 30 to 110 degrees and she did not experience any pain or numbness. She was able to wash her face and hair by herself again and she was very satisfied with the surgical outcome.\n\n【10】Case 2\n\n【11】A 64 year old woman was diagnosed with RA at the age of 30. By age 60 she began to feel pain in her left elbow and motion at the joint gradually declined. When she was referred to our clinic at age64， her left elbow was fused at 45 degrees. Radiographs revealed that her elbow was completely ankylosed . She complained of disability in her left elbow during Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and she hoped to regain motion in her left elbow. This patient underwent a linked TEA using The Discovery Elbow System (Biomet， IN， USA). The surgical approach and technique were the same as described for Case 1 and included a triceps flap elongation and ulnar nerve transposition. Under general anesthesia， the range of motion of the elbow ranged from 0 to 140 degrees after the implant settled. The radiographic examination after surgery showed that there was a good alignment of components . Postoperative treatment was also the same as it was for Case 1. At the most recent examination， or 6 months after surgery， passive motion of this patient's elbow ranged from 20 to 130 degrees and she did not experience any pain or numbness. In addition，her ADL could be performed satisfactorily once again.\n\n【12】Case 3\n\n【13】A 72-year-old woman was diagnosed with RA in a hospital at age 45 and she was treated with disease modifying antirheumatic drugs. She injured her left elbow at age 69 and was diagnosed with a supracondylar fracture of the humerus. Her left elbow was treated conservatively and progressively lost motion. This patient hoped to undergo elbow surgery and was referred to our hospital at age 71. Her left elbow was fused at 90 degrees and radiographs revealed that it was completely ankylosed . At age 72， she underwent linked TEA using The Discovery Elbow System. The surgical approach and technique were the same as those described for Case 1 and included a triceps flap elongation and ulnar nerve transposition. Because a crack occurred on the lateral condyle of the humerus during bone reaming， Kirchner wires were inserted and the fragment was fixed. Under general anesthesia， the range of motion of the elbow ranged anteroposterior and lateral views. (B) Anteroposterior and lateral views after from 40 to 140 degrees after the implant settled. A radiographic examination after the surgery showed that the alignment of the implants was acceptable . The postoperative treatment was the same was described for Case 1. The patient complained of continued numbness in her ring and little finger immediately after the surgery. Therefore， she underwent neurolysis of the ulnar nerve7 months after her primary surgery. The symptoms on the ulnar side of her hand gradually improved after the neurolysis； however，hand numbness persisted at her most recent examination. Passive motion at her elbow ranged from 60 to 125 degrees. The increased range of motion at the patient's elbow improved her ADL， so she was satisfied with her surgical outcome to some extent， despite the handnumbness that persisted.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】There have been several reported case series of TEA for ankylosed elbows . Figgies et al.  reported a 19-case series of TEA using linked implants for ankylotic elbows in patients with a variety of conditions that have included RA. Of the 19 cases， 4 cases were evaluated as excellent， 11 as good， 3 as fair， and 1 as a failure. The failed case occurred after an infection developed around the surgical site and the implants were removed. The authors stated that the functional limitations of patients should be evaluated at the outset and this should include a concurrent evaluation of other upper extremity joints. Mansat et al.  reported 14 cases， 4 of which were rated as excellent， 4 were good， 1 was fair， and 5 were poor. Peden et al.  reported 13 cases： 5 were rated as excellent，3 were good， 4 were fair， and 1 was poor. According to these reports， functional ability restored in most patients postoperatively and was sufficient enough that they could perform ADL normally. In our cases， two of the three patients were very satisfied with the surgical outcome and reported that their ADLs were better than they had been preoperatively.\n\n【16】In the previous reports， the range of motion achieved at the elbows was mostly good. Figgie at al. reported that the mean arc of motion improved from 0 degrees preoperatively to 80 degrees(range， 35 to 115 degrees of flexion) at an average 5.75 years after the operation. Mansat et al.  reported that the mean increase in the arc of flexion was 60 degrees (range， 5 to 115 degrees)， with a mean increase of 33 degrees in flexion and 27 degrees in extension. Peden et al.  reported that the improvement in range of motion at the elbow measured 1 vear after the operation was maintained for all patients after a 12-year follow-up. In our study， the average arc of motion was 85 degrees (range， 65 to 110 degrees) at the most recent examination. This result is similar to that of the Peden et al.  study. Improvement in the range of motion of the elbow improves the ADL for patients with RA. Common complications following TEA are aseptic loosening， infections， ulnar nerve problems， elbow instability， dislocation， subluxation， intraoperative fracture， fracture of the prosthesis， and ectopic bone formation . When performing TEA for an ankylotic elbow， special care should be taken to prevent infection， ulnar nerve problems， instability， and an intraoperative fracture . Infection is not typically frequent， but severe complications can arise if it does occur. In the previous study reported by Figgie et al.  the only case to fail was due to a deep infection and the patient was not a suitable candidate for implant arthroplasty because of noncompliance. Mansat et al.  reported that a deep infection developed in one elbow of two patients with posttraumatic stiffness. One patient had two previous operations prior to the arthroplasty， and the other patient had been operated on four times before. Both of these patients required revision surgery. In another previous report， three patients had deep perioperative infections that required an average of four additional operations . Neurogenic symptoms， especially those pertaining to ulnar nerve disorders， were a relatively common complication after TEA. It was reported that some patients with moderate neurogenic symptoms preoperatively had complete relief after ulnar nerve decompression and transposition， while other previously asymptomatic patients developed ulnar nerve symptoms； however， no pain was attributed to the ulnar nerve . Among our cases， one of the three patients had significant ulnar nerve symptoms after undergoing TEA and required revision surgery(neurolysis). Because kinking or compression of the ulnar nerve can occur after TEA for ankylotic elbows ， perioperative procedures to manage the ulnar nerve should be employed. In previous reports， linked implants have been recommended in order to maintain the stability of elbows over the full course of the period during which they are observed . Our cases had received linked implants and we did not encounter complaints regarding symptoms caused by elbow instability. Intraoperative fracture is one of the most severe complications to try and avoid during this type of operation. Peden et al.  reported that two cases had a fracture of the lateral humeral epicondyle which resolved uneventfully and the ulnar component was malpositioned causing a perforation of the posterior cortex in another case. Mansat et al.  reported that two patients sustained a fracture associated with a loose component. One of our cases had an intraoperative fracture and it was fixed with a Kirchner wire. We noted that the original border between the humerus and ulna was sometimes difficult to identify intraoperatively and this can inadvertently contribute to a fracture when opening up an ankylotic joint.\n\n【17】In conclusion， TEA for ankylotic elbows in patients with RA is a good surgical option to restore adequate function as well as any other spontaneous ankylosis. For the sake of a good outcome， it is necessaryto evaluate other joints in the extremity in order to properly evaluate the mobility and function of the elbow and to prepare a comprehensive plan of pre- and post-operative management that takes into consideration the full motion of the upper extremity.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:46:00", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:46:09", "cost": 9.511}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:45", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:46:09", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:45:59"}

One of the known hematological side effects of the drug is hypofibrinogenemia. We aimed to present a pediatric case with perioperative bleeding because of VPA-related hypofibrinogenemia.\n\n【2】Case Presentation： A 5-year old boy with Canavan syndrome， using VPA for 2 years， was admitted to the hospital for fundoplication and circumcision. Although preoperative coagulation parameters(including fibrinogen) were in the normal range， bleeding was detected from the gastrostomy tract and at the post-circumcision area on the third day of surgery. Coagulation function test revealed decreased fibrinogen (112 mg/dL， reference value： 180 mg/dl to 350 mg/dL) and prolonged Prothrombin time levels (19 sec， reference value： 10 sec to 14 sec). Despite an adequate volume of fresh frozen plasma transfusion， his bleeding continued， and fibrinogen levels still tended to decrease (0mg/dL) on the fifth day. After cessation of the valproate therapy， bleeding was controlled and fibrinogen values increased to normal levels within days.\n\n【3】Conclusion： VPA use can cause hypofibrinogenemia and other coagulation abnormalities. Hence， physicians should be aware of the potential risk of bleeding in patients receiving VPA.\n\n【4】Keywords： Pediatrics； Epilepsy； Hypofibrinogenemia； Valproic acid\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Valproic Acid (VPA) is a broad-spectrum antiepileptic molecule that was first produced in1882， with its potential anticonvulsant activity discovered in 1963. Since then， it has been used successfully for most types of seizures . Notably， children treated with VPA have been noted to have coagulation disorders. Thrombocytopenia， platelet dysfunction， Von Willebrand disease， factor XIII deficiency， vitamin K - dependent factor deficiency， and hypofibrinogenemia might occur during VPA therapy .\n\n【7】VPA-induced hypofibrinogenemia might be associated with an unknown defect in hepatic synthesis . Fibrinogen deficiency can occur independent of the serum VPA level， and therefore， exerts minimal effect on bleeding risk . Herein， we report a case of a 5-year old patient who presented with hypofibrinogenemia during VPA therapy. This case is the third case in the literature regarding hemorrhage associated with hypofibrinogenemia during VPA use.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 5-year old boy with Canavan syndrome and drug-resistant epilepsy was admitted to the hospital for fundoplication (for reflux) and circumcision. He was on VPA (for 2 years， 20 mg/kg/day， 2 doses； serum level： 53 mcg/mL)，levetiracetam， and phenobarbital treatment and his seizures were under control with this politherapy. Preoperative Fibrinogen (Fbg)level (184 mg/dL，reference value： 180 mg/dl to 350 mg/dL) was low but in the normal range. Prothrombin Time (PT) and Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT)levels were mildly prolonged (PT 16.6 sec， reference value： 10 sec to 14 sec； APTT 37.6 sec， reference value： 21 sec to 36 sec). He was not on salicylates or anticoagulants and had nohistory of bleeding and thrombosis. His renal and hepatic functions were normal. Nonetheless， bleeding was detected from the gastrostomy tract and at the post-circumcision area on the third day of surgery. Coagulation function test revealed decreased fibrinogen (112 mg/dL) and prolonged PT levels (19 sec). However， APTT levels， platelet count， and liver function tests remained normal. He received a transfusion of Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP).

On the same day， valproate treatment was discontinued and switched to topiramate treatment. Subsequently， fibrinogen values increased to normal levels. Thirteen days after VPA discontinuation， fibrinogen and PT values were within the normal range . Other laboratory findings indicated low factor 7 (49%) and factor 9 (47%) levels and normal levels of factors 5 and 8.\n\n【13】Informed consent was received from both of family.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】VPA has been widely used in the treatment ofepilepsy for several years. Despite its effectiveness in almost all seizure variants， adverse effects limit its use .\n\n【16】Despite several case reports and studies indicating coagulation abnormalities associated with VPA use， the incidence of significant clinical bleeding complications are rare . Even though few VPA associated hemorrhagic complications have reported， it has always been a major concern during perioperative period in patients with normal coagulation parameters . It is implied that the coagulation cascade might be impaired after surgery because of an inadequate inflammatory response . Although some authors recommend decreasing or changing VPA medication before surgery ， several others oppose treatment changes in patients with normal coagulation parameters . The literature evidences only two hemorrhage cases related to VPA-induced hypofibrinogenemia. One case was postoperative cerebral hemorrhage， and the other was spontaneous intra-articular hemorrhage . Our patient presented as the third case of hemorrhage because of VPA-induced hypofibrinogenemia.\n\n【17】In the literature， there are several case reports， retrospective studies， and prospective studies on VPA-related hypofibrinogenemia. We evaluated 16 publications in the literature . Most studies reported that valproate significantly reduced fibrinogen levels， during either a short or long usage period . Banerjea et al.  reported that 15% (12/80) of children on valproate therapy had a plasma fibrinogen concentration of less than 150 mg/dL. Another study by Koenig et al.  pointed out that this proportion was almost 60% of VPA-treated patients (12/23). Reduced fibrinogen concentration could be explained based on the defect in the liver synthesis or increased consumption of hemostatic proteins . Moreover， in our case， prolonged APTT and PT， and decreased factors 7 and 9 levels were detected. Furthermore Koenig et al.  revealed that 74% of patients with hypofibrinogenemia had other coagulation abnormalities related to valproate. They observed a statistically significant increase in APTT and PT with valproate therapy. The prospective study of Kose et al.  observed a significant decrease in factor 7 levels in 54.1% of patients. Factor 7 is a vitamin K-dependent protein that partakes in the extrinsic coagulation cascade(measured using PT). Nonetheless， there are limited data regarding the decrease in vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors owing to valproate usage. The underlying pathophysiological mechanism has not been elucidated，but coagulation factor abnormalities could be due to the hepatotoxic effect of valproate . Notably， VPA and vitamin K primarily bind with plasma proteins. Therefore， a competition between VPA and vitamin K might shorten its half-life. Moreover， both using the same mitochondrial pathway could be responsible for this mechanism .\n\n【18】Some studies have investigated the effect of VPA monotherapy and polytherapy on the coagulation panel. Banerjea et al.demonstrated that fibrinogen concentration was lower in the polytherapy group， with patients on valproate and phenobarbital therapy showing the lowest levels. Like in our case， a combination of valproate and phenobarbital could be responsible for reduced fibrinogen concentration because of possible increased liver toxicity. In our case， the VPA level was in the therapeutic range when hypofibrinogenemia-induced hemorrhage was detected. Similar to our study， in most studies， no differences were noted between the fibrinogen concentration and serum VPA level . A study by Kose et al.  observed no differences in any coagulation parameters related to serum VPA level (<100 mcg/mL and >100mcg/mL). On the contrary， some studies demonstrated a negative correlation between serum fibrinogen and valproate levels . Contrary to the study of Kose et al. ，Koeing et al.  claimed that high-dose valproate therapy with a serum level greater than100 mcg/mL had exerted negative effects on fibrinogen levels. It was emphasized that most adverse effects on the coagulation system were dose-dependent， and VPA concentration >100 mcg/mL should be avoided unless necessary for seizure control .\n\n【19】Several studies and case reports have revealed increase in fibrinogen levels after dose reduction or discontinuation of VPA. In most cases， fibrinogen levels returned to normal values within 3 to 14 days . In our case， the fibrinogen level increased rapidly after cessation of the drug and reached 155 mg/dL on day 14.\n\n【20】This case report reveals that VPA-induced hypofibrinogenemia is crucial factor in VPA-related bleeding disorder. Therefore， it should be borne in mind that VPA can cause postoperative bleeding owing to VPA-induced hypofibrinogenemia. Contrary to suggestions in the literature ， in cases with a high risk of bleeding， VPA treatment changes can be considered before surgery.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:32:35", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:32:48", "cost": 13.15}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:45", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:32:48", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:32:35"}

The main clinical manifestations of MDS are peripheral blood cell reduction， bone marrow morbid hematopoiesis with or without an increase in bone marrow primitive naive cells， and a high risk of transformation to acute leukemia. The prognosis of MDS in elderly people is relatively poorer. Mast cell hyperplasia is manifested as mast cell infiltration， accumulation， and damage to one or more organs of the human body， such as the bone marrow， skin， or digestive tract， is rare in MDS patients. In addition， it is unknown if gene mutations in MDS trigger the mast cell hyperplasia or whether mast cell hyperplasia affects MDS. Here， we reported a case of MDS with mast cell hyperplasia in an 87-year-old man and reviewed the related literature to discuss the underlying interactions.\n\n【2】Keywords： MDS； Mast cell hyperplasia； Elderly population\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) is a clonal malignant disease originating from multifunctional hematopoietic stem cells that usually affects elderly population， and the incidence gradually increases with the age. At the early stage， MDS is often manifested as excessive apoptosis of bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells， ineffective hematopoiesis and differentiation， and maturation disorders. At the middle stage， malignant clonal primordial cells proliferate and increase in MDS， having an increased risk in transformation to leukemia routine blood test in MDS is usually shown as anemia， leukopenia， and/or thrombocytopenia while the clinical symptoms are often characterized by anemia， dizziness， fatigue and so on. However， due to the insidious onset， clinical missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis of MDS often occur which delays the disease treatment and affects the prognosis. Moreover， the elderly population was more likely to have various underlying medical conditions， and weak immunity， which makes them more vulnerable to MDS， and bring worse prognosis， and can lead to death . Besides， MDS is more often complicated with immune disorders such as arthritis， vasculitis， and autoantibody defects， but its cause remains unclear . Mast cells，regarded as the effector cells of the allergic reaction， are also closely related to immune abnormalities， playing an important role in the early and acute stages of the allergic reaction. However， cases of MDS with mastocytosis are rare and the mechanism is obscure. In this paper， a case of senile MDS with mastocytosis was reported and literature reviewed.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】The patient， a male aged 87 years old， was hospitalized on September 17h， 2020， mainly due to leukopenia for four years， fatigue for more than one year， and precordial pain for two days. In August 2016， the patient had noticed a slight decrease in white blood cells (WBC， 3.46×10/L)，but without fever， chest pain， fatigue， or other discomforts. After oral administration ofleukopenia drug Diyushengbai tablets， the number of WBC increased to more than 4.0×10%/L. However， after the drug withdrawal， the number of decreased again. Since then， the patient visited doctors and orally take a variety of leukopenia drugs， such as burnet root leukopoietic tablets and Astragalus gum leukopoietic capsule. Which were effective at the beginning， but gradually became ineffective. In July Fiqure 2： A gradual downward trend of hemoglobin Hb(g/).\n\n【7】2018， anemia emerged and the bone marrow morphology indicated that there were fewer nucleated cells with erythropoiesis and small cell hypochromic changes， cytochemical NAP，HS；MDS mutant genes were negative， while bone marrow biopsy suggested extremely low hyperplasia. Based on the above results， \"leukopenia， mild anemia was diagnosed， and recombinanthuman granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (150 ug for subcutaneous injection) was prescribed once a week. Consequently， the prescription sustained a WBC count of about 4.0 ×10/L. Therapy for anemia， including supplement iron and other hematopoietic raw materials， was nearly ineffective. In February 2019， the patient developed dizziness， fatigue. Routine blood test showed significantly low WBC (1.48×10/L， neutrophils0.68×10/L)， and moderate anemia (RBC 2.63 ×1012/L， Hb 70g/L). Subsequently， the patient had received long-term treatment of leukopenia drugs， infusion of red blood cells， and Erythropoietin(EPO). On September 154，2020， precardiac pain complicated with asthma， shortness of breath， and panic showed up and lasted for about half an hour without obvious causes. Blood tests showed： WBC1.40×10/L， Hb 69 g/L， and PLT 32×10/L. The electrocardiogram examination showed sinus tachycardia， II， III， aVF qrs， qr type， and ST-T change， but there was no apparent abnormality in the myocardial enzyme spectrum. Then the patient was hospitalized with leukopenia. The admission physical examination indicated that the patient's body temperature was 36.3·C， pulse was 84/min，respiration was 18/min， and blood pressure was 143/62 mmHg. The patient was alert， cheerful， and had severe anemia. He had a bleeding point across his body， but his superficial lymph nodes were not swollen. His skin and mucous membranes were clear of vellow stains. There was no tenderness in the sternum， no anomalies in the heart or lungs， and no contact with the liver or spleen at the subcostal stage. The patient's blood test after admission showed WBC 2.53×10/L，PLT36×10/L， RBC 2.4×10'2/L， Hb 57 g/L， and MCV 82.9 fl. Anemia was corrected by infusion of red blood cells， while Thrombopoietin (TPO) was used to increase platelets. Cardiac dual-source CT examination only revealed mild stenotic lesions in multiple blood vessels. Paroxysmal precardiac pain was relieved when anemia was corrected. During hospitalization， the patient often developed paroxysmal asthmatic symptoms. A check at his medical history indicated that in the past two years， when leukocytopoiesis drugs and other medications were used simultaneously， the patient had developed asthma， shortness of breath， increased heart rate， and other asthma-related symptoms， including a longer period of headache. These symptoms were relieved by antispasmodic and antiasthmatic drugs. A pulmonary function test revealed mild obstructive ventilation dysfunction and a negative relaxation test， ruling out paroxysmal asthma as asthma and pointing to an allergic reaction as the cause of airway hyper-responsiveness. The above symptoms could be prevented by separatingthe leukocytopoiesis drug use from other medications. At the same time， the patient was experiencing severe skin itching symptoms with no visible rashes， and a variety of anti-allergic drugs were ineffective. After the above treatment， the patient's clinical symptoms were partly relieved， but the routine blood tests disappointing appeared progressing， from early leukopenia  to progressive anemia and then to thrombocytopenia . Bone marrow puncture and biopsy performed after admission revealed aggressive hyperplasia， degenerated cells， granulocyte accounted for 50.4%of total cells， primitive cell ratio of 8%， increased early and young granulocyte ratio， and a few middle and young granulocytes with development imbalance and degenerative changes in the nuclear pulp. Erythroid cell accounted for 40% of the cells， the proportion of middle and late-young red cells increased， and some cells were small and the edge of their cytoplasm was irregular. Binuclear young erythrocyte， basophilic stippling， Hao Zhou's corpuscles， megaloblastic changes， and metatypical erythrocytes (tears， target shape) could be observed. In total there were 34 megakaryocytes， with 20 of them being classified as 16 granular， two plates， and two bare karyotypes. Cellular chemistry shows NAP ， HS . Bone marrow pathology indicated that bone marrow hyperplasia was active and the erythropoiesis was dominant， especially in the middle and late stages of the red blood cell cycle. Reduction of megakaryocyte and grain ratio without anomalies in distribution. Hyperplasia of mast cells， scattered or clustered， is diffused in some area . MDS-related genetic mutations of bone marrow cells were detected by flow cytometry， the result suggested mutations of BCORY156fs，STAG2S1058X，ASXL1Q778X， BCORY304fs， U2AF1S34F， DNMT3AR882C， and TET2Q1030R were positive， while Chromosome 46， XY， no abnormal karyotype； BCR/ABL detected by Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH)\n\n【8】A) CD45/SSC scatter map of the bone marrow cells： The immature cells in zone A accounted for 3.59%， the neutrophils in zone B accounted for 62.58%， the lymphocytes in zone C accounted for 5.26%， mononuclear cells in zone D accounted for 0.05%.\n\n【9】B) CD38/CD34 scatter diagram shown after gating the naive cells in A.

The mast cell hyperplasia-related genes were negative； therefore the patient was diagnosed as myelodysplastic syndrome with mast cell hyperplasia.\n\n【13】Due to poor physical condition and low willingness to treat， the patient did not receive demethylation therapy or other radical regimens except for blood transfusion， EPO， TPO， cyclosporine， thalidomide， ossification triol， and system supportive medication. After the treatment， the patient’s WBC was maintained at more than2.0×10/L， Hb maintained at around 80 g/L， PLT maintained at around 50 ×10/L， the general condition promoted and the blood transfusion intervals time was significantly prolonged.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】MDS diagnosis and treatment\n\n【16】The pathogenesis of MDS is still unknown， but recent research had focused on the disease epigenetic changes， gene mutations， and heterozygosity deletion. In most patients， it is thus straightforward to diagnose MDS on the basis of WHO criteria. However， in many cases with cytopenia(s)， it may be quite difficult to establish (or exclude) the diagnosis MDS. These may be patients without a cytogenetic abnormality and only mild cytopenia， patients with a typical karyotype and cytopenia but only slight or absent dysplasia， or patients with transfusion-dependent macrocytic anemia without karyotype abnormalities and without diagnostic dysplasia. The most frequent somatic mutations driving age-related clonal expansions， and the biologic mechanism involved in the transition from clonal hematopoiesis to myeloid neoplasm， including clonal selection and evolution .On accounting ofthe recentadvances inepidemiology， genetics， molecular biology， new diagnostic methods， and the discovery of molecular markers have enhanced our understanding of MDS. The current classification approach adopted by the WHO is based on a combination of morphology， immunophenotype， and genetic features to define distinct clinicopathologic disease entities， independently from the underlying causes that are often unknown. According to this principle， the diagnosis of MDS lies on2 hallmarks， the evidence of myelodysplasia and the proof of clonal hematopoiesis. Diagnostic and classification criteria of myeloid neoplasms with myelodysplasia. The diagnostic approach to MDS includes morphologic studies of peripheral blood and bone marrow aspirate smears to evaluate abnormalities； bone marrow biopsy to assess marrow cellularity， topography and fibrosis； and cytogenetics to identify nonrandom chromosomal abnormalities. Additional investigations are also recommended， including flow cytometry immunophenotyping and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH). The patient in the current case met one of the prerequisites， which was the presence of persistent tricline hemocytopenia for at least one year. Bone marrow puncture showed that the blast cells were significantly increased but did not reach 20%. The pathological erythropoiesis was obvious， and blast cells were also found in bone marrow biopsy. Methylation gene mutations that closely related to MDS， such asBCORY156fs， STAG2S1058X， ASXL1Q778X， BCORY304fs， U2AF1S34F，DNMT3AR882C， and TET2Q1030R were found by using combined gene detection therefore the diagnostic MDS was established. MDS is a heterogeneous disease， and MDS patients are generally older with varying treatment intentions therefore the treatment should be individualized. At present，allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is still the only possible way to cure the disease， but due to the limited HLA matching donor sources， patient physical score， basic disease， age， prognostic risk， or other factors， the elderly patients are generaly not qualified for the transplantation. The treatment aim for most elderly patients is to improve cytopenia and the quality of life while delaying the progression of the disease. Treatment strategies， such as transfusion-supported symptomatic treatment， iron supplement and cytokines therapy， improvement of bone marrow hematopoietic microenvironment， and demethylation drug therapy， should be adapted to non-strengthening and risk assessment (IPSS/R score). Among those， demethylation therapy is important and beneficial， but due to the significant individual differences， bone marrow suppression time after treatment varies a lot， and there is a risk of severe infection and bleeding， which need to be concerned.\n\n【17】Mast cell hyperplasia\n\n【18】Mast Cells (Mast Cells： MCs) are essential immune cells in the human body， derived from CD34 precursor cells in the bone marrow. They are widely distributed in tissues， especially in the skin， respiratory mucosa or gastrointestinal tract， and are considered as effector cells of allergic reactions， especially in the early and acute stages of IgE- mediated allergic reactions. Mast cells are composed of heterogeneous cell groups that can secrete a variety of bioactive factors and affect many physiological processes. Their maturation and phenotypic function are influenced by their microenvironment， which releases a number of bioactive mediators that influence their uniquerecognition and reaction to various stimuli .In the current case， the patient developed anaphylaxis as the disease progressed. The hyperplasia of mast cells in the bone marrow was thought to be linked to MDS， abnormal hematopoietic stem cells differentiation and gene mutation， and changes in the hematopoietic microenvironment in the bone marrow. However， the specific mechanism requires further investigation. Mastocytosis is characterized by the hyperplasia of clonal， immature， or atypical mast cells. In addition to traditional mast cell markers， activation point mutations at codon KIT (c-KIT) 816 could be detected，and abnormal CD25 or CD2 could be expressed. Mastocytosis can also cause multiple clinical symptoms. The most common manifestations are wind-like skin rash and itching， other symptoms such as fatigue， abdominal pain， headache， hypotension， weight loss， tachycardia， dyspnea and sore muscles . Severe cases can lead to multiple organ failure. Pathogenesis of mastocytosis is closely related to a mutation in the KIT gene . In our case， bone marrow pathology showed that mast cells were proliferated，dispersed， or clustered， and diffused in some areas. Nonetheless， no KIT gene mutation was identified in the genetic detectation， and no obvious abnormal mast cell cloning was found in the flow cytology. Therefore， the case was not diagnosed as MDS complicated not with mastocytosis but with the mast cell hyperplasia， which is a rare case. Some studies retrospectively analyzed the mutation genes of MDS with systemic mastocytosis， and found that TET2 and ASXL1 genes mutation have nearly 50% Variant Allele Frequency (VAF)， which indicates that almost all bone marrow cells may co express these mutations in a heterozygous state， suggesting that MDS and mastocytosis may have a common pathogenesis and a common cell origin . However， in this case， further investigations are needed to determine whether MDS and mast cell hyperplasia are independent or have any potential relationship.\n\n【19】Treatment for MDS with mast cell hyperplasia\n\n【20】At present， there are no normative and specific treatment for the elderly MDS patients complicated with mast cell hyperplasia. However， demethylation therapy may play an important role in low-risk patients， and decitabine or azacytidine therapy can improve the prognosis and prolong the survival time of the patients. High-risk patients may be treated with a combination of other treatments depending on the physical fitness score of the patient and underlying diseases . Additional immunosuppressive regulatory treatments such as cyclosporine or lenalidomide/thalidomide may also be effective to relatively low-risk patients. There was a study suggesting that lenalidomide could improve the status of anemia and amend the molecular genetic abnormalities . Patients with mast cell hyperplasia have a high incidence of allergic reactions (up to 20~49percent) ， in which IgE is a major factor. The main inducers are Hymenoptera insects， some food， and drugs . Omalizumab is a drug usually used to treat stubbornness and can reduce the mast cell activity and reactivity therefore the IgE-mediated allergic reactions . Thus Omalizumab can be used in patients who have a poor response to the traditional treatment， but it cannot reduce the number of the mast cells. The patient failed to use demethylation drugs； he was therefore immunomodulated on the basis ofsupporting symptomatic therapy due to his old age and complex basic diseases. The WBC was maintained at more than 2.0×10/L，the Hb fluctuated around 80 g/L， the blood transfusion time was obviously prolonged， the PLT fluctuated around 50 ×10/L， the symptoms improved， and the patient was discharged. Continuous follow-up indicated that he was generally in good condition. In this complex case， we should avoid being too radical in treatment and instead choose an individualized treatment plan to enhance the quality of life and prolong survival time. Further research is needed on the progression， prognosis， and detailed pathogenesis of bone marrow. Due to the old age and complex underlying diseases， the patient could not be treated with demethylation drugs. On the basis of supporting symptomatic therapy， the patient was given immunomodulatory therapy and discharged after his condition was stabilized. Based on this case， we suggest that in order to improve the prognosis and the life quality of elderly patients of this kind， we should avoid radical treatment but choose individualized treatment scheme concerning the pros and cons. Moreover， the progress，prognosis and detailed pathogenesis of bone marrow disease need further study.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:48:49", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:49:06", "cost": 17.653}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:45", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:49:06", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:48:48"}

The reported incidence of uterine perforation is highly variable in developing countries， possibly due to underreporting. Furthermore， there have been various reports of bowel injury as a consequence of uterine perforation； however， none of the cases reported took place in a resource limited setting in which ultrasound was used to diagnose a complex peritoneal fluid collection.\n\n【2】Case Report： A 24-year-old female presented to the Emergency Room in Masaka， Uganda for abdominal pain and swelling. Two days prior to arrival she had an elective abortion performed via dilation and curettage. A bedside ultrasound was performed which revealed a heterogenous， complex fluid collection. After two more return visits， she was taken to the operating theatre for an exploratory laparotomy. It was then discovered that she had suffered a gastric perforation，and one liter of bilious fluid was extracted from her abdomen. To the best ofour knowledge， this is the only reported case ofa gastric perforation following a dilation and curettage.\n\n【3】Conclusion： This case provides insight to a gastric perforation following a dilation and curettage performed during the first trimester and highlights the risks inherit to a procedure such as this. It also highlights the importance ofusing ultrasound as an adjunct to clinical examinations and how it can help with monitoring the progression， or resolution， of a complication from a procedure.\n\n【4】Keywords： Ultrasound； Peritoneal fluid； Dilation and curettage； First trimester abortion； Gastric perforation； Uterine perforation；Uganda\n\n【5】Background\n\n【6】Uterine perforation is the most common immediate complication from a Dilation and Curettage(D&C) and the occurrence rate depends on the indication， with the highest in the setting of postpartum hemorrhage (5.1%). In general， perforation rates tend to increase with increasing uterine size . There is also high variability in the reported incidence of uterine perforation as a result of a D&C performed during the first trimester. A meta-analysis of legal termination of pregnancy procedures reported a uterine perforation incidence that varied between 0.75 and 15per 1，000 women . Although the reported incidence is low， uterine perforation remains the most common immediate complication of a D&C performed during the first trimester and can often go unrecognized . With that said， most of the reported incidence rates are in countries with well-developed healthcare systems. Less is known about the incidence rates in countries with underdeveloped healthcare systems likely due to underreporting. Furthermore， induced abortions are commonly performed by persons without any medical training in developing countries， which can lead to serious complications such as bowel perforation . However， to ourknowledge， there have been no documented cases in the literature of a gastric perforation because of a D&C or of documented bedside ultrasound findings revealing complex peritoneal fluid. The case reported here is of a 24-year-old female in which a first trimester abortion was performed that subsequently led to an exploratory laparotomy being performed. The final diagnosis was a gastric perforation.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 24-year-old Ugandan female presented to an Emergency Room (ER) in Uganda for abdominal pain and swelling. She denied any other associated symptoms and her vital signs were within normal limits. Two days prior to arrival she had an elective abortion performed via Dilation and Curettage (D&C). She was unsure exactly how many weeks pregnant she was prior to the D&C， however she estimated that it was around 7 to 9 weeks. The next day she began to develop some abdominal discomfort and had an outpatient ultrasound scan performed. The scan revealed “pus\"in the rectouterine pouch， dilated bowel loops， and “ascites\". Her abdominal discomfort continued， and she began to develop some mild abdominal swelling that prompted her to visit the ER for further evaluation. Shortly after arrival a bedside transabdominal ultrasound was performed， which revealed a heterogeneous fluid collection in the recto uterine pouch and throughout the rest of the peritoneal cavity . Figures4， 5 are sagittal and transverse views， respectively， of the bladder and uterus showing the fluid collection in the rectouterine pouch， commonly referred to as the Pouch of Douglas. Figures 6， 7 are views of the right and left upper quadrants， respectively， revealing loops of bowel floating in the peritoneal fluid. After she was seen by the senior physician， she was given a dose of Intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone， IV metronidazole， and one liter of IV normal saline and was sent to the ward for monitoring and evaluation by the gynecologist. The gynecologist decided to pursue conservative management and sent the patient home the next day. Six days later she returned to the ER for continued abdominal pain and nausea. Another bedside ultrasound scan was performed， which again showed a heterogenous fluid collection throughout the peritoneal cavity， with slightly increased echogenicity compared to the one prior . Figures 8， 9 are images of the left lower quadrant and right upper quadrant revealing loops of bowel floating in the free fluid. Figures10， 11 are sagittal and transverse views of the bladder and uterus with a large rectouterine fluid collection again demonstrated. Five days later (13 days after the initial procedure)， the patient returned once again with abdominal pain and now was completely PO intolerant. During this visit the senior surgeon of the hospital was consulted and decided to take the patient to the operating theatre for an exploratory laparotomy. During the operation， the surgeon encountered a gastric perforation and approximately one liter of serous fluid. The patient was then sent to the ward with a nasogastric tube and a percutaneous peritoneal drain in place. An ultrasound was performed a few hours after the operation and revealed that the peritoneal fluid collection was gone . Figure 12 is a sagittal view of the uterus showing minimal free fluid present in the rectouterine pouch. Figure13 is a view of the right upper quadrant and right kidney showing that the fluid collection that was present prior to surgery is no longer present. The patient was discharged a few days later in good condition.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Inadvertent uterine perforation is a potentiallyserious complication of a D&C. Some may pass unrecognized； thus， the reported incidence is widely variable . Data from reviews on procedureslike first trimester abortions and diagnostichysteroscopy's， suggest that rates of serious complications， such as perforation or hemorrhage， are remarkably low， however unsafe abortion continues to contribute significantly to this public health problem . The exact rate of maternal death due to illegal vs. legal abortion in Uganda is unknown， however in the 2017-2018； the Ugandan Annual Health Sector Performance report estimated that 5.3% of all maternal deaths result from abortion complications . This can contribute to increased healthcare costs and place a large burden on the Ugandan healthcare system.Overall， it is estimated that 314，300 abortions took place in Uganda in 2013， which translates to a rate of 39 per 1，000women aged 15 to 49 In comparison，the US had an abortion rate of 11.8 per 1，000 women aged 15 to 44 . To complicate matters further， the legal status of abortion in Uganda is unclear. According to the Ugandan Constitution，“No person has the right to terminate the life of an unborn child except as may be authorized by law\". Furthermore， the Penal code of 1950 states that， “any person， who， with intent to procure the miscarriage of a woman whether she is or is not with child，unlawfully administers toher or causes her to take any poison or other noxious thing， or uses any force of any kind， or uses any other means， commits a felony and is liable to imprisonment for fourteen years”. With that said， there are other areas of the penal code that state， “a person is not criminally responsible for performing in good faith and with reasonable care and surgical skill， an abortion for the preservation of the mother’s life\". Whether legal or not， there are many inherent risks to performing an abortion or a D&C. Overall， there have been a few reported cases of intestinal perforation as a complication of a D&C， most of which all involved the small bowel and less commonly the sigmoid colon . There have been no reported cases， to our knowledge， of gastric perforation following a D&C， although， it is very difficult to prove direct causation in the case reported here. Other plausible explanations for the gastric perforation are persistent post-operative vomiting， gastric dilatation， or a previously undiagnosed gastric ulcer that ruptured due to the lack of oral intake following the procedure. Some sources suggest that， unless intra-abdominal contents have been brought through the cervix， a conservative approach to managing perforations is sufficient . Many cases may actually go undetected and if a conservative strategy is employed， observation may be appropriate . However， other sources have suggested that all patients with concern for intestinal perforations should immediately undergo surgical exploration . Perhaps most importantly， management can be guided by clinical IIOS exam and the need for immediate surgical intervention is based on clinical signs and symptoms of peritonitis and any imaging obtained. In the case reported here， although one would assume that the patient would show some peritoneal signs due to the irritation that gastric contents cause to the peritoneum， she did not. However， she did have a significant amount of intraperitoneal fluid present on bedside ultrasound examination. Unfortunately， a major limitation of grey scale ultrasound is the inability to distinguish between various types of body fluids (pus-exudate， blood， ascites， mucous， etc). Interestingly， a recent study performed on a group of Nigerian women reported the most common cause of ascites was pelvic inflammatory disease， followed by hepatitis， tuberculosis， renal diseases， urinary bladder schistosomiasis， and polycystic ovarian syndrome . However， given the clinical circumstances of the case presented here， uterine， as well as bowel/bladder， injury should be excluded. This case also illustrates the importance of developing practitioners that are proficient in performing bedside ultrasound specifically in resource limited settings in which higher level diagnostic imaging is much more difficult to obtain. The closest CT scanner to the hospital in the case discussed here was around 2 h away and many times， financial constraints limit patients'access to adequate transportation.\n\n【11】Conclusion\n\n【12】We reported a case of a gastric perforation following a D&C\n\n【13】carried out for a first trimester abortion. The patient had multiple visits where a bedside ultrasound examination was performed， which revealed complex peritoneal fluid， as evidenced by the internal echoes and gas within the fluid.

There were no axillary's mass during her first pregnancy. General physical examination was unremarkable， without signs of local or systemic infection. The mass became apparent at the last month of her second pregnancy. Finally axillary mass was measuring 3x2 cm. Formation was solitary， soft， oval-shaped， mobile and painless， with normal overlying skin. Mass has fluctuated， and content was white blurred. All routine hematological and biochemical parameters， including leukocytes and C-reactive protein were normal.\n\n【13】Ultrasonography of left axillary mass showed an oval shape just below the skin with anechoic blurred content surrounded by heterogeneous area which has the properties of glandular mammary tissue . In some locations mass had well， and in other ones it had irregulary defined margins. The finding was most consistent with galactocoele. After aspiration of the mass the milk was drained， and definitive diagnosis of galactocele arising in axillary accessory breast tissue was made. Periodic monitoring and， if necessary， drainage was advised.\n\n【14】An accessory breast gland is most commonly located in the axilla and may enlarge during the terminal phase of pregnancy and lactation. The accessory breast glands mainly occur during the first pregnancy， and usually recur in subsequent ones. Sarcoidosis is multi-system disease. Patients are usually not asymptomatic and axillary lymphadenopathy is usually bilateral. Hidradenitis suppurativa is chronic skin infection， and tends to start after puberty. It is characterized by clusters of painful abscesses，epidermoid cysts， sebaceous cysts and pilonidal cysts that most commonly affects apocrine sweat gland bearing areas， such as the underarms， often lead to scarring. The process is usually bilateral. Abscess is accompanied by symptoms and signs of inflammation. Breast cancer metastases are usually rounded， not oval， and commonly associated with pathological changes in the corresponding breast. Awareness of the variety of disease entities and characteristic sonographic findings with ultrasound guided puncture can aid in correct diagnosis of an axillary mass.

Sudden death is one of most frequent adverse event after surgical treatment， mostly due to Serious Ventricular Rhythm Trouble(SVRT). Nonetheless， High Degree atrioventricular blocks (HDAB) are a rare cause of sudden death within those patients， especially when the times from total surgical treatment increase . SVRT are caused by a dilatation of the right cavities and by myocardic's scars (trans-annular patch， ventriculotomy) . HDAB are cause by lesions of the conduction tissue. We describe here the case of a patient suffering of a TOF which presented severe syncope due to a HDAB， confirmed by electrophysiological study.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 49 years old patient consults at the emergency department following multiple faintness with syncope during both rest and effort time. The most interesting point of his medical past history is a regular TOF operated at the age of six followed by a total atrioventricular block during post-operative time which quickly and spontaneously self-resoluted. There was no case of sudden death in the relative. The patient wasn’t taking any medication. The clinical examination was normal， no argument for neurological explanations of that syncope was found.

It is not uncommon that pituitary apoplexy is the first manifestation of the disease， and the choice of optimal tactic is important. Considering the presence of observations of spontaneous resorption of tumors after pituitary apoplexy， the standard approaches to this pathology require revision Objectives： We aim to identifying factors that contribute to tumor resorption and compare conservative and surgical treatment methods.\n\n【2】Methods： We review the results of treatment of 82 patients with pituitary apoplexy. 45 patients were surgically managed and 37 patients were managed conservatively.\n\n【3】Results： Tumor size has a direct link with the rate of spontaneous resorption rates， along with hemorrhage type and localization. Dexamethasone plays an important role in conservative therapy， significantly improving outcome. Conservative treatment methods， when applied with the described algorithm allow for highly efficient results， comparable to urgent surgical intervention.\n\n【4】Conclusion： Based on our results， we propose an updated algorithm for the treatment of patients with pituitary apoplexy. The application of the proposed algorithm will allow in some cases to avoid emergency surgery and obtain a comparable clinical result with lower patient risk.\n\n【5】Keywords： Pituitary apoplexy； Transnasal adenomectomy； Pituitary hemorrhage\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】As is known，hemorrhage into the pituitary macroadenoma is an urgent neurosurgical situation due to a sharp increase in the volume of the tumor and compression of surrounding structures， primarily the optic nerves. The main reason for this condition is a presence of a pituitary tumor， which are not uncommon (up to 14% presence in post-mortem autopsies and up to 22.5% in screening X-ray studies) . In 80% of cases， such hemorrhaging becomes the first manifestation of the underlying disease， and the risk of its occurrence for each tumor carrier increases by 10% for every 2.5 to 5 years of observation . Traditionally， pituitary apoplexy is considered an urgent surgical condition ， at the same time， the rate of spontaneous resorption remain underestimated especially with regard to the possibility of maintaining pituitary functions.\n\n【8】Materials and Methods\n\n【9】We present a series of 82 cases of pituitary apoplexy， managed by both surgical intervention and conservatively. The primary surgical team has experience in transnasal endoscopic surgery on over 4，000 pituitary adenomas and performed all the procedures. More detailed diagnostic issues， morphological features and analysis ofliterature data on pituitary apoplexy are thoroughly discussed in literature and in our previously published works .\n\n【10】The patients were separated into two groups： Group 1 included 45 patients who received surgical treatment within 1 month after diagnosis， of which 10 (22.2%) were urgent surgical interventions； Group 2 included 37 patients who were managed conservatively.\n\n【11】The study was approved by the Ethical Committee (IEC) of the Burdenko Neurosurgical Center.\n\n【12】Results\n\n【13】No significant differences in gender or age were noted between groups (p>0.05). According to tumor size， the tumors were separated into several groups. Smaller tumors prevailed in Group 2 .\n\n【14】Hormonally inactive tumors were most commonly found (in85.4% of cases). Prolactinomas were three times less common， and somatotropinomas were almost 10 times less common.\n\n【15】According to the time from onset of clinical symptoms until the diagnosis was made and treatment started， we conditionally divided the material into three groups of early (<24 h)， timely (1 day to 1month) and late (over 1 month) diagnosis .\n\n【16】Visual field disorder\n\n【17】Visual disturbances were observed in 54 of 82 (65.9%) patients. In 15 of these cases， only conservative treatment was performed. In 39 cases， patients were surgically managed. Dexamethasone was used in the course of treatment in 6 patients in Group 2 and only in 1 of Group 1. Improvement in vision after surgery was noted in35.9% of cases (14 out of 39) and in 61.5% (24 out of 39) there was no change. Worsening was observed in 1 of 39 (2.6%) cases. In Group 2， improvement in visual functions was noted in 46.7% of cases (7 out of 15) and remained unchanged in 46.7% (7 out of 15). Deterioration occurred only in 1 observation (6.7%). The use of dexamethasone with conservative treatment provided an improvement in vision in66.7%(4 out of 6) patients. Conservative treatment without the use of Dexamethasone provided an improvement in only 33.3% (3 out of9). No statistically significant differences were noted between the two groups (p<0.05).\n\n【18】Oculomotor pathology\n\n【19】Oculomotor disorders were noted in 28 out of 82 (34.1%) observations. In half of the cases， they were detected when the hemorrhage was less than 1 month old. In 19 out of 28 (67.9%) cases of oculomotor disorders， time from onset of symptoms did not exceed 3 months. After 3 months the frequency of their detection was significantly reduced. Surgical removal was not performed in 13 of 28 (46.4%) patients. In 5 out of 13 (38.5%) patients with dexamethasone， there was a complete or partial regression  ofnerve insufficiency.\n\n【20】Table 1： Time-based treatment peculiarities.\n\n| Method of treatment  | Time since clinical onset to diagnosis  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Method of treatment  | <24 hours  | Between 1 day and 1 month  | Over1month  |\n| Conservative therapy (n=37)  | 4  | 27  | 6  |\n| Surgical treatment (n=45)  | 4  | 6  | 35  |\n| Total (n=82)  | 8  | 33  | 41  |\n|  | 9.8%  | 40.2%  | 50.0%  |\n\n【22】In the remaining 8 out of 13 (61.5%) patients， conservative treatment without the use of dexamethasone resulted in regression of oculomotor disorders in 5 (62.5%) cases. In 2 cases， the disorder did not regress，and in 1 case there an increase in symptoms was seen. However， these differences were not statistically significant (p<0.05)， but show an important aspect of conservative therapy failure.\n\n【23】Among 15 out of 28 (53.6%) surgically treated patients who had oculomotor disorders， 12 (80%) ofthem had regression of oculomotor disorders by the time of discharge. All patients were operated on within 1 month from symptom onset. In 3 cases， when patients were operated on over 1 month after symptom onset， oculomotor functions did not recover. Dexamethasone was used in the treatment of 2 surgically managed patients， who had complete  and partial regression of disorders after surgery.\n\n【24】Secondary symptoms\n\n【25】Intense headaches were noted in 81.6% of cases. Further， they persisted in 70% of patients for up to 1 week. Pronounced vasospasm was seen in 1 case with the appearance of multiple ischemic foci in the subcortical nodes， severe subcortical symptoms in the form of tremor，hyperkinesia and severe dysarthria were noted， and in 1 case the appearance of static and coordinating disorders was also seen. Emotional lability and depression were noted in 2 patients. Fixation amnesia was noted in 1 case. In 5 cases， there was a decrease in the level of wakefulness from stunning to somnolence.\n\n【26】Pituitary insufficiency was noted in 41.5% of cases. In 19 out of these 34 cases (55.9%)， the duration of the hemorrhage was less than 1 month， and over 1 month in 15 (44.1%). It is necessary to separately note the irreversible nature of pituitary disorders that we revealed when dexamethasone was not used in the acute period of hemorrhage. Of 25 patients who did not receive dexamethasone， panhypopituitarism remained on follow-up in 24 (96%). In contrast， regression was noted in 8 of 9 (88.9%) treated with dexamethasone. This difference turned out to be statistically significant (p<0.05).\n\n【27】A significant risk in emergency surgery is the inabilityto detect and preserve the remnants of the adenohypophysis in the dense imbibed tumor tissue . Of 19 patients with pituitary insufficiency in the first month after the hemorrhage， 7 were surgically treated， and 12patients avoided surgery. Only 1 out of 7 (14.3%) surgically managed patients showed restoration of pituitary function. In contrast， in patients who received only conservative treatment in the first month after the hemorrhage， the restoration adenohypophysis function occurred in 50%(6 out of 12). However， this difference turned out to be statistically insignificant (p<0.05).\n\n【28】MRI - characteristics of a pituitary hemorrhage. To identify the MRI features of the hemorrhage， we used the data on the most traditionally weighted MRI images - T1 without contrast gain and T2. The results of our analysis are presented in more detail in earlier published work . When evaluating the MRI data， an assessment is made on which part of the tumor volume is within the hemorrhage area and whether the hemorrhage focus is represented by a cyst or diffuse imbibition of the tumor stroma .\n\n【29】Morphological evaluation\n\n【30】Morphologically， the removed tumor makes it possible to detect various changes within its stroma： Foci of necrosis， scar tissue，regions unchanged tumor tissue are most common.\n\n【31】Table 2： MRI characteristics of pituitary tumor hemorrhage focus at various times from the moment of hemorrhage.\n\n| Time since hemorrhagebegan  | Number of  | MRl-characteristics  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Time since hemorrhagebegan  | cases  | Diffuse imbibition  |  | Cyst formation  |  |\n| <2 days  | 8  | 8  | 100.00%  | 0  | 0.00%  |\n| 2-7 days  | 18  | 16  | 88.89%  | 2  | 11.11%  |\n| 7-14 days  | 11  | 8  | 72.73%  | 3  | 27.27%  |\n| 14-30 days  | 4  | 3  | 75.00%  | 1  | 25.00%  |\n| 1-2 months  | 8  | 4  | 50.00%  | 4  | 50.00%  |\n| 2-3 months  | 5  | 3  | 60.00%  | 2  | 40.00%  |\n| 3-4 months  | 3  | 1  | 33.33%  | 2  | 66.67%  |\n| 4-5 months  | 5  | 0  | 0.00%  | 5  | 100.00%  |\n| 5-6 months  | 2  |  | 0.00%  | 2  | 100.00%  |\n| 6-11 months  | 6  | 1  | 16.67%  | 5  | 83.33%  |\n| >12 months  | 12  |  | 0.00%  | 12  | 100.00%  |\n| Total  | 82  | 44  | 53.66%  | 38  | 46.34%  |\n\n【33】Choice of treatment tactic\n\n【34】Our surgical group included 45 patients treated via the transsphenoidal endoscopic approach. 37 patients did not require surgery and were managed conservatively. Choice of treatment depended on indications for urgent surgery： Acute hemorrhage， appearance ofneurological deficit (chiasmatic syndrome， oculomotor disorders， cranial pain syndrome)， ineffectiveness of conservative therapy. However， not all acute patients were hospitalized in a timely manner and were later managed conservatively， as they no longer fit surgery requirements by admission time due to the phenomenon of spontaneous resorption.\n\n【35】Spontaneous resorption\n\n【36】Spontaneous hemorrhage resorption is one of the most favorable developments in pituitary hemorrhages. Tumor resorption was seen in 89.2% (33 out of 37) of conservative treatment cases. We found that the probability of complete resorption of small tumors (up to25 mm in size) reached 60%， and for medium and large tumors (26mm to 59 mm) did not exceed 40%. The size hemorrhage resorption in our series of observations turned out to be less than 40 mm， and we further accept this value as a “threshold” when suggesting an algorithm for choosing an optimal treatment option. Resorption of giant tumors (more than 60 mm) was not seen. The probability of resorption was higher when the focus of hemorrhage was represented by imbibed tumor tissue (63.6%) rather than by a cyst (13.2%). This difference turned out to be statistically significant (p<0.001). We did not observe resorption when the hemorrhage was over 3 months old.\n\n【37】Discussion\n\n【38】Traditionally， pituitary apoplexy is considered as an indication for urgent surgical decompression of the sellar and near-sellar region. In most cases after surgery an improvement in vision and oculomotor functions is seen. At the same time， pituitary functions are generally not restored. Existing literature describes cases of spontaneous tumor resorption with the possibility of maintaining pituitary functions . hemorrhages in a pituitary tumor were summarized by a group of British researchers \"Pituitary Apoplexy Guidelines Development Group\"， as of February 2009 via the British Society of Endocrinology. In May 2010， they formulated and later published recommendations for the treatment of hemorrhages in the pituitary tumor -“UK guidelines for the management of pituitary apoplexy\" . The algorithm proposed by British colleagues is exclusively \"surgical\"without taking into account the size of tumors， radiological characteristics of the hemorrhage zone， hormonal activity of the tumor， and even the age of the hemorrhage. The clinical condition of the patient， the severity of symptoms and their dynamics turned out to be decisive in the choice of the treatment method.\n\n【39】Primarily， our results show that treatment effectiveness depends on the severity of the underlying disease and the hemorrhaging complication. Patients treated surgically were mainly subacute and had gradual onset of symptoms， and the hemorrhaging a somewhat anticipated discovery， confirmed by intraoperative visualization and MRI. At the same time， pituitary functions remained intact in the majority of these patients by the time of their hospitalization， despite the fact that dexamethasone was not used in these patients before surgery. In contrast， patients with acute onset， and severe clinical manifestations， required urgent hospitalization， and were treated efficiently as well. A concrete argument in favor of surgical intervention is the possibility of rapid and effective decompression of the optic and oculomotor nerves. At the same time， the likelihood of improvement decreases as the waiting time for surgery increases from the moment of hemorrhage. It is optimal to carry out the operation no later than a month from the moment of hemorrhage.\n\n【40】Unfortunately， when such surgical procedures are performed at such an early stage， it can be very difficult to detect and preserve the remnants of the adenohypophysis in the dense imbibed tumor tissue. Almost none of the urgently operated patients showed recovery of pituitary functions.\n\n【41】Analysis of treatment results in patients who were not surgically managed showed the possibility of recovery with conservative therapy， as well as the possibility of complete tumor resorption. As such， proper management and conservative therapy in some cases provides treatment result comparable and even superior to surgical intervention. The use of dexamethasone significantly improves the results of both surgical and conservative treatment in the acute period.\n\n【42】We therefore suggest conservative treatment to patients with a hemorrhage age of less than 3 months， a maximum tumor size of 40mm， a hemorrhage focus represented by imbibed tissue (not a cyst)， and minimal visual and oculomotor disorders.\n\n【43】Conclusion\n\n【44】The severity of clinical onset， rate of deterioration in the patient’s condition， manifestation and range of neurological symptoms and endocrine insufficiency determine the indications for an urgent neurosurgical operation. Nevertheless， in cases where， for a number of reasons， the patient was not operated on in within the first 10 to 14days from onset of symptoms， it makes sense to clarify the indications for surgery due to the fact that there is a possibility of spontaneous resorption of the hemorrhage， confirmed by the results presented in the article. Conservative treatment， when chosen in accordance to hemorrhage and tumor size， MRI picture， duration of disease and rate of symptom aggravation， provides effective results， while reducing risks of surgical intervention.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:18:55", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:19:38", "cost": 43.746}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:45", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:19:39", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:18:54"}

We report a case of isoniazid induced psychosis in a 31 years old patient pulmonary tuberculosis patient.\n\n【2】Keywords： Tuberculosis； Isoniazid； Psychosis； Substance induced psychosis； Brief psychiatric rating scale\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】ISONIAZID (Isonicotinic Acid Hydrazide)， also called INH is a first-line drug in the treatment oftuberculosis. INH has been in use for the treatment of tuberculosis for many decades. It is one of the first line drugs used in patients of tuberculosis .\n\n【5】South-East Asian region bears the maximum burden oftuberculosis with more than 44% burden oftuberculosis incidence. India has the maximum prevalence of tuberculosis in the world .\n\n【6】Psychosis is a mental disorder which causes people to perceive or interpret things differently from those who are around them . Substance-induced psychosis， also known as drug-induced psychotic disorder， is any psychotic episode that is related to the abuse of an intoxicant . There remains a paucity of evidence of the cases of isoniazid-related psychiatric illnesses. We report a similar case of suspected isoniazid-induced psychosis.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 31-year-old male educated up to high school， shopkeeper by profession， belonging to middle socio-economic strata in urban area with no prior psychiatric history was brought by his wife to the psychiatry outpatient department with the complains of incoherent speech， garbled sentences， paranoid ideation regarding his family (plotting against him and conspiring to steal his belongings)， auditory hallucinations and shouting at people who were not around since the last 2 days. These symptoms were associated with intermittent insomnia and a desire to stay in isolation and darkness.\n\n【9】The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) is one of the commonly used scales to establish about the possible presence and severity of various psychiatric symptoms . The BPRS (Brief Psychiatric Rating Score) was 47 in this patient as evaluated by the psychiatrist on 5h day.\n\n【10】The symptoms started about 4 weeks after he was put on isoniazid 300 mg/day， rifampicin 600mg/day， ethambutol 800 mg/day and pyrazinamide 1500 mg/day， for pulmonary tuberculosis and pyridoxine (vitamin B6)20 mg/day for prophylaxis against neuropathy by the prescribing physician. There was no history of recent ingestion of any psychoactive substances. He had a family history of social anxiety disorder and bulimia nervosa.\n\n【11】The physical examination was unremarkable and the vital signs were stable and testing including a complete blood count， chest X-rayand urine toxicology screening. A thyroid function test initially showed a marginally low Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH) with normal triiodothyronine and thyroxine. A computed tomography scan of the head showed no abnormality. Due to absence of any other imminent cause of this behavior an initial diagnosis of drug induced psychosis due to isoniazid was taken into consideration.\n\n【12】Thereafter， all the anti-tubercular therapy was stopped by the prescribing physician. Although， he responded minimally after the isoniazid was stopped， the paranoid ideation persisted. The patient was put on tablet olanzapine 10 mg/day， tablet lorazepam 2 mg/day. Rifampicin， pyrazinamide and ethambutol were subsequently reintroduced， one by one to monitor a possible relapse of symptoms. Isoniazid was not reintroduced as it was the most likely offending drug taken into consideration for the symptoms and was subsequently replaced with levofloxacin 750 mg/day by the treating physician to complete the anti-tubercular treatment regimen as per the guidelines. Subsequently， the patient became asymptomatic after taking olanzapine for a period of 15 days.\n\n【13】He stopped taking olanzapine 7 weeks after his visit to the treating physician， but agreed for a follow up in the clinic. He remained asymptomatic in the subsequent follow-up visits to the hospital.\n\n【14】The causality assessment of the adverse drug reaction came out to be possible for this case using the Naranjo Causality Assessment Scale. The case was reported to the ADR monitoring center under the Pharmacovigilance Program of India (PvPI).\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Tuberculosis remains a major health problem in India. The incidence and prevalence of the disease has decreased compared to the previous decades， still it accounts for maximum DALYs lost among the various communicable diseases. Some of the factors that maycontributeto an increase in the number of TB cases include HIV infection； social problems such as poverty， homelessness and drug abuse .\n\n【17】In this case the patient was diagnosed as a case of pulmonary tuberculosis and initially treated with a regimen of four first line drugs isoniazid， rifampicin， pyrazinamide and ethambutol. The BPRS is a rating scale which is used by clinicians and researchers to measure psychiatric symptoms such as depression， anxiety， hallucinations and unusual behavior. The scales first published in 1962 is one most widely used scales to measure psychotic symptoms . An expanded version of the test was created in 1993 by Ventura et al.\n\n【18】The presence and severity of various psychiatric symptoms are rated on a Likert scale ranging from 1 (not present) to 7 (extremely severe). The total possible scores vary from 0 to 126 with higher scores indicating more severe psychopathology.\n\n【19】The association of administration of anti-tubercular therapy and the onset of psychotic symptoms in the absence of any previous psychiatric history provided a strong support for a diagnosis of drug-induced psychosis. Isoniazid is implicated in many cases of psychosis， hence it was first considered to be responsible for the psychotic episode.\n\n【20】Besides psychosis， isoniazid has been implicated in a number of other neuropsychiatric conditions including paranoia， obsessive-compulsive disorder， depression andmania， others including peripheral neuropathy， sleep disturbances， headache and blurring of vision have been seen .\n\n【21】In this case the onset of the psychotic symptoms that developed4 weeks after initiation of the anti-tubercular therapy and partial resolution was seen after 7 days of isoniazid discontinuation and completely resolved 15 days after treatment with olanzapine. The symptoms onset and resolution were in contrast to a case of drug induced psychosis with a previously unremarkable personal and familial psychiatric history that presented with psychotic symptoms within 12 days of initiation and resolved completely within 2 days of discontinuation of therapy. The patient remained asymptomatic without medication at a 1-year follow-up .\n\n【22】In another case ofisoniazid-associated psychosis the person had a previously positive psychiatric history. A change in the mental status of this patient was observed within a week of initiation of isoniazid therapy. Psychotic symptoms continued for 5 days after isoniazid was stopped， eventually the patient was completely asymptomatic within a week .\n\n【23】The drug induced psychotic symptoms usually range from a few days to 2 months after treatment onset with isoniazid .\n\n【24】Although the exact cause remains obscure， there are a few suggested mechanisms for isoniazid-associated psychosis.\n\n【25】These mechanisms implicate an over- or underproduction of the monoamine neurotransmitters serotonin， dopamine and norepinephrine.\n\n【26】One of the mechanism involves isoniazid acting as a Monoamine-Oxidase Inhibitor(MAO-I)， thus preventing the degradation of catecholamine's， serotonin and ultimately leading to raised concentration of these neurotransmitters at the synapse .\n\n【27】Another mechanism suggests thatpyridoxine deficiencyultimately leading to a reduction in the concentration of the neurotransmitters. Isoniazid combines with pyridoxal (a form of vitamin B6) to form a complex that inhibits the action of pyridoxal kinase. The action of pyridoxal kinase is to convert pyridoxal to pyridoxal phosphate， which is an important coenzyme in the metabolism of amino acids， including tyrosine and tryptophan (precursors of catecholamines). The result is a decrease in the metabolism of amino acids to dopamine， norepinephrine， and serotonin .\n\n【28】Patients with pyridoxine deficiency excrete a number of metabolites of tryptophan in the urine (e.g.， Xanthurenic acid)， after a loading dose of tryptophan is given. This test could also be used to assess pyridoxine deficiency status in addition to obtaining a blood concentration. However， pyridoxine deficiency is unlikely in our patient， as she was taking a pyridoxine supplement. Although the actual mechanism remains to be elucidated， the clinicians should be wary of the possibility ofisoniazid induced psychosis .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:31:44", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:32:09", "cost": 25.541}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:45", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:32:09", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:31:44"}

It is a benign lesion that composed of angiomatous and lipomatous structure. It can be diagnosed via the magnetic resonance imaging. Spinal cord compression is common and the neurological symptoms may also appear. Surgical resection is the most important treatment that relieved the symptoms. Spinal angiolipoma rarely recurred. However， some residual lesions may cause newly developed neurological symptoms. Adjuvant radiotherapy is a choice after the surgical resection.\n\n【2】Most of the patients underwent surgical resection.

However， it is a kind of rare neoplasm. In the spinal region， spinal cord compression syndrome caused by the angiolipoma can be usually resolved with surgical intervention . Aspinal angiolipoma with malignant behavior extending outside of the spinal region has not been reported previously. Here， we describe a refractory case of a benign tumor that was diagnosed as an angiolipoma.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】Consent was obtained from the patient to publish her case. A 60-year-old woman presented to our hospital with numbness and weakness of the lower limbs and unstable gait for 6 months. The physical examination revealed Lhermitte’s sign and positive Spurling's sign. The blood hemogram revealed normal results. The chest roentgenogram showed spondylosis， degenerative disc disease as marginal spur formation， and a mass lesion at the aortic level. Chest Computed Tomography(CT) revealed an oval mass measuring 3.7 cm x 2.6 cm in the left posterior mediastinum with surrounding bone destruction. The thoracic spine CT showed a 4.8 cm enhancing tumor in the long axis of the spinal canal with left lateral extension into the pleural space .

After surgical treatment， her symptoms improved； however， the presence of malignancy was unclear， and her muscle strength was still poor.\n\n【11】Postoperatively， the microscopic examination  showed an angiolipoma composed of medium-sized to small-sized vessels and many capillaries with mature adipocytes as well as\n\n【12】Table 1： Characteristics of similar patients treated by surgical resection reported in the literature and our case.\n\n| Study  | Age (years)/sex  | Symptoms  | Duration ot symptoms  | Spinallocation  | Extraspinaltumor  | Treatment  | Follow-up duration  | Outcome  | Time of symptomreliet  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Reyes et al.9  | 68/M  | Lumbago  | 3 years  | T12 to L1-L2  | No  | Surgery  | N/A  | Resolvec  | 1year  |\n| Rkhami et al.  | 65/F  | Paraplegia and sphincter disorders  | 7 months  | T7-T10  | No  | Surgery  | 5 years  | Recoverec  | 1 year  |\n| Mohammed andAhmed   | 35/F  | Lower limb paralysis and urinary incontinence  | Acute onset  | T5-T8  | No  | Surgery  | 1year  | Recoverec  | 1 year  |\n| Ramdasi et al.  | 58/M  | Neck and interscapular pain， paraplegiaand sphincter incontinence  | 48 hours  | C7-T1  | No  | Surgery  | 2 years  | Rapid recovery  | 2 years  |\n| Chotai et al.  | 68/M  | LBP and progressiveparesthesia  | 5 years  | T9-T11  | No  | Surgery  | N/A  | Improved  | N/A  |\n| Isutsumietal.| 26/F  | Paraplegia and incontinence  | Acute onset  | T3-T4  | No  | Surgery  | 1 year  | Improved  | 1year  |\n| Akhaddar et al.15  | 47/m  | Back pain，paresthesia completeneurological palsy  | Acute onset  | T2-T3  | No  | Surgery  | >2 years  | Improved  | Immediately  |\n| Lacour et al.   | 17/M  | Acute paraplegia  | Acute onset  | T7-T12  | No  | Surgery  | N/A  | Improved  | 2 months  |\n| Present case  | 60/F  | Numbness andweakness of thelower limbs  | 6 months  | T4-6  | Yes  | Surgery  | 6 months  | Recurrence  |  |\n\n【14】M： Male；F： Female； LBP： Low Back Pain； N/A： Not Applicable occasional myxoid change of the mediastinal tissue. Regarding immune histochemistry findings， the angiolipoma stained diffuse and strongly positive for CD34. These cells failed to express S100， the glial fibrillary acidic protein， CK， epithelial membrane antigen， and D. Therefore， the patient was diagnosed as having an angiolipoma.\n\n【15】Three months later， the postoperative spinal thoracic MRI with contrast showed a mass lesion measuring about 3.0 cm x 1.9 cm ×5.8 cm in the extradural space at the T4-T6 level with extension into the left T5/6 neural foramen. T5 vertebral body involvement  and spinal cord compression were also indicated. The tumor with mass extension into the left paraspinal region that was observed previously was not seen . Thus， she underwent regular Stereotactic Radiation Therapy (SRT) for the suspicious recurrent lesion. developed new neurological symptoms under regular SRT.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】Currently， she is undergoing regular outpatient follow-up and weekly SRT. She has remained in a relatively stable condition. Muscle strength of her extremities has not worsened， and she has not In 1960， the term \"angiolipoma” was first introduced . This tumor commonly originates from subcutaneous tissue in the extended into the left paraspinal region has disappeared. forearms，trunk， neck， and proximal upper extremities，but it is a rare， benign tumor when located in the thoracic posterior epidural spaces. Histologically， it is a benign tumor， and it can be confused with a hamartoma orbenign tumor that develops from dural mesenchymal cells . An angiolipoma with a malignant tendency is very rare.\n\n【18】MRI is the most valuable modali1OSIty for determining the characteristics of an angiolipoma . A lipomatous mass has a different appearance from the spine， which appears as a high-density structure， and this type of mass has a relatively lower density than the bone material when viewed by CT； thus， an angiolipoma may appear as a lipomatous extradural mass. Bone erosion may also be visible because of tumor compression . As its name suggests， an angiolipoma is composed of fat and vascular elements. The vascular part appears as a hypodense lesion on T1-weighted imaging， whereas the fat part appears as a hypo intense lesion on T2-weighted imaging After contrast enhancement with gadolinium， the vascular element appears as trabeculated bone tissue with a netted texture or like a reticular structure. On T1-weighted sequences， fat saturation can be seen clearly. However， the vessel part is hypointense and can manifest an obvious enhancement on T1-weighted sequences with contrast enhancement using gadolinium .\n\n【19】Because of the richness of vessels，a highly vascularized tumor can be predicted preoperatively from a T1 void signal . The differential diagnosis includes lipomas and spinal vascular tumors， such as fistulas， metastases， meningiomas， and hemopathies. Angiography is helpful with the differential diagnosis， and it can be used to assess vascularization of the lesion， which is important for tumor removal using embolization . On T2-weighted images， hyperintensity is a common finding ofvascular content .\n\n【20】Surgical treatment was the only treatment performed in similar patients to ours with the symptom of compression， as shown in Table 1 . All patients in previous studies showed good improvement postoperatively without recurrence. Most patients can achieve complete symptom relief. However， our patient had symptoms of paraplegia only a few days postoperatively. Because of the intra spinal origin and dumbbell shape， a neurologic tumor or malignancy was suspected. Thus， the differential diagnosis included a neurogenic tumor， ganglioma， hemangioma， hemangiopericytoma， or angiolipoma. However， the contrast-enhanced CT showed a strong enhancing lesion， which was considered hyper vascularity that was different from the presentation of a neurogenic lesion. Because of the worsening symptoms on postoperative month 3， an imaging study was performed and revealed a focal mass lesion at the spinal cord， although the prior mass disappeared. For this type of tumor， surgical treatment can be used to easily remove the tumor； nevertheless， some debris may remain without complete removal because ofhyper vascularity of the tumor . It has been reported that treatment of an infiltrating angiolipoma focuses on wide excisionplus radiotherapy in the case of recurrence . Thus， we administered regular radiotherapy in our patient because of her refractory lesion.\n\n【21】In our patient， the entire operation was performed without incident. After total laminectomies of T4-6 vertebrae with resection of the spinal tumor， she underwent VAT'S for resection of the paraspinal tumor. Some authors reported that thoracoscopic tumor removal after laminectomy is the most appropriate and reliable surgical treatment of a spinal dumbbell tumor. Because tumors are vessel-rich， some lesions may infiltrate the vertebral body. Furthermore， the residue may possibly become enlarged and case the prior symptoms to recur. Our patient experienced partial clinical improvement with partial recovery within 1 week postoperatively. In the outpatient department follow-up， the patient experienced weakness of both lower limbsat3 months postoperatively. Radiotherapy was administered because of the newly developed lesion in the spinal region， although surgical pathological results revealed that the prior lesion was benign\n\n【22】Conclusion\n\n【23】Surgical resection should be followed by basic monitoring with a physical examination and imaging study even when the pathological results indicate a benign tumor. Furthermore， radiotherapy may be considered if the benign tumor has any malignant tendency.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:31:03", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:31:35", "cost": 32.268}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:45", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:31:35", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:31:02"}

The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and intubated. Three days later， he presented a massive hemorrhagic infarction and died shortly after.\n\n【2】Keywords： Bradycardia； Vertebrobasilar-ischemic stroke\n\n【3】Case Presentation\n\n【4】We report the case of a 79-year-old man， known to be hypertensive and coronary， admitted to the emergency department for confusion and lipothymia since 4 hours， without fever. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is at 13/15 (E4， V4， M5). The patient wasn’t on anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents. The neurological examination revealed no anomalies.\n\n【5】Shortly after his admission to the vital emergency room (VER)， he presented a bradycardia， his heart rate decreased from 97 to 32 bpm， associated toan arterial hypotension at 73/41 mmHg. A concomitant electrocardiogram with the rhythm disorder objectified an atrial brady-fibrillation. The patient recovered quickly after a bolus of Atropine.

Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a syndrome of excessive immune activation， which can appear secondary to severe infection. Hairy Cell Leukemia (HCL) is an indolent B-cell neoplasm which frequently presents with immunodeficiency due to cytopenia’s. This case report is the first describing this presentation of HCL and thereby it emphasizes the need for recognition of immune-incompetence and investigation of underlying conditions.\n\n【2】Case Report： We report a 34-year-old female patient who was initially admitted with symptoms of fever， coughing and dyspnea on exertion. Laboratory results showed an elevated CRP-level； thrombocytopenia and leukopenia. CMV IgG and IgM were positive which was confirmed by PCR-testing. After six days， she remained subfebrile and laboratory abnormalities persisted. Serum ferritin was determined which was >10.000 ug/L. The diagnosis of secondary HLH was considered and antiviral therapy was initiated. Bone marrow biopsy was performed in which the diagnosis of HLH was confirmed， however this also revealed HCL.\n\n【3】Conclusion： Severe course of CMV infection， or other opportunistic infections， might be the first sign of immunodeficiency and thereby indicate an underlying hematological condition in a formerly healthy patient.\n\n【4】Keywords： Cytomegalovirus； Immunodeficiency； Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis； Hairy cell leukemia\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections are common and usually give mild symptoms in immunocompetent patients， consisting mainly of a sore throat， lymphadenopathy and fever.\n\n【7】However， in immunocompromised patients (i.e.， AIDS patients， solid organ transplant-/hematopoietic stem cell recipients) CMV-infection， or more commonly reactivation， can cause severe disease with devastating organ damage. Therefore， antiviral medication is used in these patients for both prophylactic and therapeutic purposes .\n\n【8】Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a syndrome of excessive immune activation， which can appear either idiopathic or secondary to， most likely， infections or malignancies. The massive immune cell activation can potentially lead to severe organ injuries causing a life-threatening condition . Early recognition is essential for reducing both morbidity and mortality. HLH should be considered in case of the triad of fever， cytopenia’s and splenomegaly. Mild initial symptoms may deteriorate remarkably rapid. Since there exists no test to certainly confirm the diagnosis of HLH， and no delay in treatment would be justified， treatment must be started in case of suspicion based on the international HLH-criteria  .\n\n【9】Hairy Cell Leukemia (HCL) is an indolent B-cell neoplasm which usually presents with cytopenia's， especially monocytopenia， and splenomegaly. Hepatomegaly and lymphadenopathy are seen less frequently. Twenty-five percent of patients is asymptomatic and are diagnosed due to incidental splenomegaly or pancytopenia. Patients are usually middle-aged at presentation and complaints， if present， often only consist of weakness and fatigue . Pancytopenia causes these patients to be anemic and at increased risk for bleeding and severe infections .\n\n【10】We hereby present a young female patient who was initially admitted with a CMV infection， then developed a secondary HLH and finally was diagnosed with HCL through bone marrow biopsy. This case report is the first describing this presentation of HCL and thereby it emphasizes the need for recognition of immune-incompetence and investigation of underlying conditions.\n\n【11】Case Presentation\n\n【12】Patient information\n\n【13】A 34-year-old female presented at our Emergency Department(ED) (day 0) with complaints of spiking fever， malaise， headache， coughing with white-colored sputum， nausea， occasional night sweats， thoracic pain and dyspnea on exertion for nine days. She had no past medical history. Two days earlier， her general practitioner had started her on oral amoxicillin for a suspected pneumonia. There was no hemoptysis， no collapse， no contact with any animals， no sauna or swimming pool visit and no travel history besides a holiday to Spain and France three weeks earlier. She had been fully vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\n【14】Clinical findings\n\n【15】During physical examination， breathing was found to be shallow and accelerated (20 times per minute) yet with proper oxygen saturation (SO， 95%). The blood pressure measured 115/76 mmHg with a heart rate of 93 beats per minute. No cardiac or pulmonic abnormalities were detected.\n\n【16】Muscle tenderness was palpated on her back right-sided of the vertebrae.\n\n【17】Diagnostic assessment and therapeutic interventions\n\n【18】A chest X-ray revealed little bilateral pleural fluid. COVID-19PCR was negative. The electrocardiogram was normal. Laboratory examination revealed multiple abnormalities .\n\n【19】Table 1： HLH-2004 diagnastic criteria .\n\n【20】The CRP-level was elevated (272 mg/L) and the complete blood count showed thrombocytopenia and leukopenia. Renal function and electrolytes were normal. Liver enzymes were elevated， most likely due to either infection or use of amoxicillin. The patient was suspected of having an infection， most likely pneumonia， and was admitted for further diagnostics and treatment. Amoxicillin was switched to intravenous ceftriaxone.\n\n【21】The first day after admission (day 1) the diagnosis of pneumonia was questioned due to clinical deterioration despite treatment for almost 24 h with ceftriaxone and previous treatment with amoxicillin. Doxycycline was added to the ceftriaxone for antimicrobial coverage of atypical microorganisms and a CT-scan of chest and abdomen was performed to search for the focus of infection . This CT-scan revealed multiple abnormalities： Bilateral pleural fluid with compression atelectasis of the lower lung fields； ascites； hepatosplenomegaly and periportal edema. Due to the abdominal ascites and abdominal tenderness， the gynecologist was consulted for possible Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)， which was subsequently excluded based on negative cervical culture and negative PCR-tests for sexual transmittable diseases . Multiple infectious disease tests were performed . On day 5， the serological profiles of both EBV and CMV revealed positive IgM and IgG antibodies. However， the presence of high titers of EBV EBNA IgG and relatively low CMV IgG levels pointed towards an acute CMV infection with cross reactive EBV IgM antibodies. To distinguish a possible acute EBV from CMV infection， qualitative detection by PCR technique of EBVandCMVRNA was performed. The results showed negative EBV and positive CMV RNA confirming acute CMV infection. A pleural punctate was performed of the pleural fluid which also revealed a positive CMV PCR. Antibiotic treatment was then discontinued.\n\n【22】On day 6 the patient remained febrile and leukopenia and mild thrombocytopenia persisted .\n\n【23】Serum ferritin level was determined which turned out to be>10.000 ug/L. Due to the combination of ongoing spiking fevers， cytopenia， highly elevated ferritin level and hepatosplenomegaly， the diagnosis of HLH was considered， which can develop secondary to CMV infection. Therefore， CMV treatment with ganciclovir was started intravenously on day 9， which was switched to oral valganciclovir on day 11. Antiviral therapy was continued for a total duration of 14 days. A bone marrow biopsy was performed on day 10 to confirm the diagnosis of HLH and to evaluate other potential underlying (hematological) disease. Furthermore， despite an already negative PCR on peripheral blood， leishmaniasis could hereby definitely be excluded as possible (additional) cause since this can cause a similar disease course yet requires significantly different treatment.\n\n【24】Table 2： Relevant laboratory results during admission.\n\n| Day  | 0  | 1  | 6  | 8  | 10  | 12  | Reference value  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CRP (mg/L)  | 272  | 288  | 195  | 72  | 33  | 14  | <10  |\n| ESR (mm/h)  |  |  | 66  | 59  | 74  | 91  | <20  |\n| Hemoglabin (g/dL)  | 12.1  | 11.8  | 11.8  | 9.3  | 9.8  | 10.6  | 11.8  |\n| Hematacrit (L/L)  | 0.36  | 0.34  | 0.35  | 0.28  | 0.3  | 0.33  | 0.44  |\n| Erythrocytes (x 104L)  |  |  | 3.6  | 2.9  | 3.0  | 3.4  | 3.0  |\n| MCV(fL)  | 96  | 96  | 97  | 97  | 99  | 97  | 82-98  |\n| Thrombocytes (x 10%/L)  | 132  | 138  | 149  | 148  | 219  | 325  | 150-350  |\n| Leukocytes (x 10/L)  | 2  | 1.5  | 1.6  | 1.5  | 1.9  | 2.8  | 3.0  |\n| Basophils (x107L)  | 0.0  | 0.0  |  |  | 0.0  |  | <0.1  |\n| Eosinophils (x 10%/L)  | 0.1  | 0.0  |  |  | 0.0  |  | <0.3  |\n| Neutrophils (x 10/L)  | 1.3  | 0.9  | 0.6  |  | 1.3  | 1.1  | 1.7  |\n| Lymphocytes (x10/L)  | 0.6  | 0.6  |  |  | 0.5  |  | 0.7  |\n| Monocytes (x 10/L)  | 0.0  | 0.0  |  |  | 0.0  |  | 0.9  |\n| Reticulocytes (x10%L)  |  |  | 18  | 18  | 37  | 81  | 10-70  |\n| Haptaglabin (g/L)  |  |  | 2.73  | 2.34  | 2.44  | 2.49  | 0.00  |\n| Ferritin (ug/L)  |  |  | >10000  | 5419  | 2713  | 1468  | 20-150  |\n| APTT (sec)  |  |  | 37  | 34  | 31  |  | 22-34  |\n| PT (sec)  |  |  | 11.9  | 12.1  | 11.7  |  | 9.5  |\n| Fibrinagen (g/L)  |  |  |  | 1.4  |  | 2.3  | 1.5  |\n| Creatinine (umal/L)  | 60  | 58  | 52  | 48  | 50  | 47  | 44-80  |\n| Bilirubin (umal/L)  | 8  | 8  | 13  | 10  | 10  | 10  | <17  |\n| Alkaline phosphatase (U/L)  | 285  | 304  | 326  | 248  | 218  | 205  | <98  |\n| g-GT(U/L)  | 217  | 267  | 486  | 403  | 341  | 278  | <38  |\n| ALAT(U/L)  | 102  | 100  | 130  | 110  | 152  | 144  | <34  |\n| ASAT(U/L)  | 109  | 121  | 374  |  |  | 117  | <31  |\n| LDH(U/L)  | 314  | 348  | 629  | 433  | 348  | 294  | <247  |\n| Albumin (g/L)  |  |  | 24  | 23  | 26  | 31  | 35-45  |\n| Triglycerides (mmol/L)  |  |  |  | 3.2  |  | 3.7  | <2.2  |\n\n【26】Bone marrow aspirate revealed many macrophages showing phagocytosis of multiple hematopoietic cells， which confirmed the diagnosis HLH . Furthermore， some lymphocytes appeared hairy， suggesting a hairy cell leukemia . No Leishmania parasites were seen.\n\n【27】Flowcytometric analysis of the bone marrow aspirate showed a small， normal polyclonal B-lymphocyte population (1% of the leukocytes) and an abnormal sIg Lambda light chain restricted B-cellpopulation with immunophenotypic marker expression characteristic for hairy cell leukemia (CD19+/ strong CD20+/ CD5-/CD10+/ CD11c+/CD23-/CD25+/ CD43-/CD79b+/ CD103+/\n\n【28】LAIR1 (CD305)+/CD200+/light scattering pattern matching larger and complex cells) . The CD10 expression is atypical but is reported in 10% to 15% of HCL patients .\n\n【29】Follow-up and outcomes\n\n【30】From day 11 on， two days after starting antiviral treatment， the patient remained free of fever and recovered steadily， and so she was discharged on day 14. The weeks after admission her complete blood count fully recovered except for ongoing monocytopenia . Additional lymphocyte subset count revealed decreased B-cells (0.03x10/L)， whereas T-cells were normal (CD4+ 0.56×10/L； CD8+0.88×10/L). Rise of the CMV IgG titer one month after initial testing from 52.1 U/ml to 94.2 U/ml confirmed a primo-CMV infection. Since the HCL probably indirectly caused the severe course of the CMV infection， which indicated some sort of immunodeficiency， treatment for the HCL was considered.\n\n【31】The patient was monitored in the outpatient-clinic，where therapy versus wait-and-see policies were discussed.

Bone marrow diagnastics would be required (and were performed resulting negative). wwwwno observed micro-organisms and/or acid-fast stains.\n\n【59】Discussion\n\n【60】Our patient was diagnosed with acute CMV infection resulting in secondary HLH and HCL as underlying， indirect cause of the severe course of the CMV infection. Diagnosis of HLH in our patient was complicated by thelarge overlap in symptoms of CMV and HLH such as splenomegaly， fever and cytopenia. Treatment with ganciclovir was initiated because of a high clinical suspicion of HLH based on the international HLH-criteria. However， as complete blood counts were already slightly recovering before initiation of the treatment， one could argue if the eventual recovery was either due to the treatment or the natural course of the CMV infection.\n\n【61】To the best of our knowledge， this is the first case report describing a CMV-induced HLH as first presentation of HCL. Both HLH and HCL are rare， yet individually both are associated with CMV . CMV-induced HLH has been described in very few case reports ， which all report an underlying immunodeficient status in their patient， such as HIV  or (treatment of) rheumatoid disease . Disseminated CMV infection is associated with an immunosuppressed condition  and also specifically with HCL as is presented in a case report on CMV-pneumonitis with underlying HCL from Awadallah et al. These findings emphasize the importance of considering immune-incompetence in case of CMV-induced HLH.\n\n【62】Treatment of HLH and， in case of secondary HLH， its underlying cause are mainly based on clinical status of the patient. In case of suspected HLH， identification of the HLH-trigger is essential.\n\n【63】However， if the patient is unstable， steroids (and in some cases intravenous immune globulin) must be initiated before evaluation of this trigger. Further treatment always depends on the underlying cause. For infections such as EBV or leishmaniasis， treatment might be indicated . For CMV infection， treatment is usually only indicated in immunocompromised patients . There is however no consensus on treatment indications in the immunocompetent population. Several case reports describe successful treatment of CMVin immunocompetent patients， yet the majority of thesepatients would most likely have recovered without intervention . In our patient， treatment was initiated due to the secondary HLH， since HLH on itself is an indication for treatment of the underlying trigger.\n\n【64】Conclusion\n\n【65】Conclusively， some lessons can be learned from this case. Clinicians must be aware of immune-incompetence in case of severe course of opportunistic infections， especially in formerly healthy patients.  Reconsidering an initial diagnosis in case of inconsistency between clinical symptoms and this initial diagnosis is extremely important.  Investigation ofan underlying hematological condition is indicated in case of suspected immunodeficiency.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:12:52", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:13:17", "cost": 25.157}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:45", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:13:17", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:12:51"}

The clinical presentation is heterogeneous depending on the enzyme affected. In the case of acute intermittent porphyria， a deficiency of porphobilinogen deaminase is established.\n\n【2】The diagnosis is biochemical by the determination of accumulated precursors. Treatment is based on adequate metabolic input and supply of human hemin. Its association with pregnancy is rare. The patterns of symptoms in the pregnant woman varies considerably between individual patients. The time of maximum risk seems to be in the initial period of pregnancy and in the puerperium where changes in the balance of steroid hormones are more likely to occur.\n\n【3】Keywords： Porphyria； Puerperium； Neurovisceral crisis\n\n【4】Abbreviations\n\n【5】PCT：Porphyria(CutaneeaaTarda；； AIP： ：IntermittentLPorphyria；EPP：Erythropoietic Protoporphyria；ED： Emergency Department； BP： Blood Pressure\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Acute porphyria's are a group of hereditary disorders caused by genetic mutations in enzymes that are part of the biosynthetic cycle of the heme group， essential for the functioning of proteins such as hemoglobin and liver enzymes of cytochrome P450. Depending on the step of the synthetic cycle in which the enzymatic alteration takes place， the accumulation of one precursor or another occurs， giving rise to various types of porphyria’s. They are classified as hepatic or erythropoietic depending on the system in which the precursors are accumulate，liver or bone marrow， respectively. Based on the clinical manifestations， there are three types： Porphyria Cutanea Tarda (PCT)， Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP)， and Erythropoietic Protoporphyria (EPP) .\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】We present the case of a 34-year-old postpartum woman with a history of allergy to penicillin and its derivatives. She was a victim of the 11th of March terrorist attacks in Madrid with traumatic enucleation of the left eye and since then in psychiatric treatment for post-traumatic stress syndrome， with a stable clinical situation.\n\n【10】After the birth， which she attended without incident， she was discharged home. Seven days after discharge， she presented pain in the genital and abdominal areas that forced her to go to the emergency department several times， finally being admitted to the gynecology department due to infection of the episiotomy wound with associated abdominal pain that did not respond to first step painkillers or opiates. She was assessed by the psychiatry and pain unit departments and was diagnosed with anxious-depressive syndrome and neuropathic pain related to the puerperium. When she was discharged， she continued to present episodes of abdominal pain， and she was again thoroughly evaluated without finding any responsible organic pathology. Three weeks later， she was attended by the ED for three episodes of generalized seizures that required orotracheal intubation. Transferred to the nearest center， she underwent a cranial CT scan， which was nonspecific， and a lumbar puncture for a temperature of 38·C. The biochemical result ruled out meningitis. At that moment she is transferred to our center due to a lack of ICU beds. Since her arrival， she noted sinus tachycardia at 150 bpm and Blood Pressure (BP) of 210/120 mmHg. Treatment with labetalol is started. After nonspecific cranial CT findings， a cranial MRI was performed in which hyperintense lesions were observed in the occipital subcortical white matter and in the cerebellar hemispheres that could be suggestive of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy . The patient presented good clinical evolution and could be extubated 12 hours after admission. Since extubation， she had persistently referred colic-type abdominal pain， for which an abdominal CT scan was performed， which revealed marked distension of the large intestine with a cecum of 8 cm in maximum diameter. At the sigma level，an abrupt transition to a normal caliber rectum is observed without any cause that justifies it. After evaluation by surgery department and a colonoscopy without findings， hypotonia of the anal sphincter stands out， which could suggest the existence of aganglionic megacolon(adult Hirsprung). Associated with this， she had a history of acute urine retention after epidural puncture， which led to thinking of conus medullaris syndrome within the differential diagnosis. Lumbar and sacral MRI were requested， which were normal. After4 days in the ICU， she was discharged with a diagnosis of seizures pending ruling out posterior reversible encephalopathy， newly diagnosed hypertension of unknown cause， and constipation with megacolon pending filiation. Four days after being on the hospital ward， the patient was re-admitted to the ICU due to a low level of consciousness. Analytical control revealed severe hyponatremia with sodium 109 mEq/L， plasma osmolarity 236 mOsm/Kg and urine435 mOsm/Kg， compatible with SIADH. During admission， she remains spontaneously ventilated and hemodynamically stable with antihypertensive treatment. She currently associates paresthesia's and dysesthesias in lower limbs. The clinical history is reviewed again and after putting together the entire spectrum of symptoms and signs from the onset of the symptoms， coproporphyrin levels of 3920 mcg/24h(normal value is <250 mcg/24 h) are obtained， when neurovisceral crisis of acute porphyria is suspected. Uroporphyrins value was 504mcg/24h (normal value is <50 mcg/24 h)， total porphyrins was 4，420mcg/24 h (normal value is between 15-300 mcg/24h)， PBG was 30.8mg/24h (normal value is <2 mg/24h) and ALA was 40.8 mg/24 h (<7mg/24h)).Treatment with heme arginate was started at a dose of 150mg/day for 4 days and the deficiency of the aminase PBG enzyme was confirmed in blood tests.\n\n【11】Discussion/Conclusion\n\n【12】AIP is the most common type of acute porphyria， the European study by Elder et al. estimates its prevalence of symptomatic cases at 5.4 cases per million. The pathophysiology of the attacks is still unknown. The influence of female hormones would explain why acute attacks mainly affect women of childbearing age， although there are other possible triggers. Recognition of an acute attack in a patient not previously diagnosed with porphyria is difficult and is often delayed in time， since it occurs only when the patient has been treated on multiple occasions， as in the case we present. The main and most frequent symptom is severe and diffuse abdominal pain accompanied by severe hypertension and tachycardia. It should be noted that 40%to 58% of patients have psychiatric disorders that often present as the only initial symptom. The patient in the clinical case that we present was in psychiatric treatment for a post-traumatic stress syndrome. As diagnosis is delayed and exposure to heme precursor accumulation is prolonged， neurological complications such as seizures， reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome or neuropathy are more likely. Analytical controls are usually within normal limits except for hyponatremia that appears in 40% of attacks. Acute attacks are always accompanied by increased urinary excretion of porphyrins. The treatment of choice is the administration of hemin， which has the ability to suppress the activity of the enzyme delta-amino-levulinic acid synthetase by feedback， reducing the production of porphyrins and heme precursors. The interest of this case lies in how the diagnostic delay in time causes the patient to experience the full spectrum of symptoms of an acute porphyria neurovisceral crisis. Despite the fact that it is a rare entity， it should be considered mainly in those patients with multiple evaluations for non-specific symptoms， as well as psychiatric evaluations， since the diagnostic test is affordable and minimally in vasive.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:52:53", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:53:06", "cost": 12.885}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:44", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:53:07", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:52:54"}

Our aim is to present a case reportthathighlights the fact that procalcitonin can be elevated in patients who are having an allergic reaction to medications， which emphasizes the importance that the physician should not depend solelyon procalcitonin level in differentiating infectious from the non-infectious process， but it should be part of the integral clinical assessment.\n\n【2】Keywords： Procalcitonin； Anaphylaxis reaction； Sepsis\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Procalcitonin is considered one of the acute phase reactants that can be elevated as part of the body's inflammatory response to pathogens ， procalcitonin considered part of the supportive laboratory tests that guide to the diagnosis of sepsis . However， procalcitonin can be elevated in many non-infectious conditions including inhalation injury， burns， pancreatitis， mechanical trauma， extensive surgery or heat stroke .\n\n【5】Our case will present elevated procalcitonin in a patient who is having an allergic reaction to a medication， which emphasizes the importance that clinicians should not depend solely on procalcitonin in differentiating infectious from non-infectious diseases.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】Our patient is a 71-year-old female with a past medical history ofhypertension， Type II diabetes mellitus and adenocarcinoma of the lung status post resection and chemotherapy four years prior， presented to Jersey Shore University Medical Center with chest discomfort and shortness of breath.\n\n【8】She was found to be in acute congestive heart failure secondary to a hypertensive emergency. Blood pressure was normalized with intravenous Nitroglycerin and then oral lisinopril and amlodipine. Two days after was given the first-time dose of Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ)， shortly after， patients started complaining of pruritus， shortness of breath and became diaphoretic. Vital signs including blood pressure were 124/54 mmHg， heart rate 106 beats/min， temperature 96.9F， Respiratory rate 21 and pulse ox 92% on room air. Physical Exam of cardiovascular and lungs showed wheezing in bilateral lung fields with poor air entry， no crackles， no leg edema， no elevated JVD， normal heart sounds.\n\n【9】Initial procalcitonin level on admission was negative， repeat 3 h after onset of symptoms was 88ng/mL (RR<0.5 ng/ml). Tryptase level was ordered and was 45 ng/mL (RR<11.4 ng/ml).\n\n【10】The patient was given a broad-spectrum antibiotic， epinephrine，prednisone， and antihistamine and transferred to the intensive care unit. Repeat procalcitonin level after 9 h was 329 ng/mL. The patient had an allergy to sulfa previously with similar reactions， the patient improved the second day and antibiotics were discontinued as all laboratory data and diagnostic imaging came back unremarkable for infection.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Procalcitonin is a 116 amino acid polypeptide precursor of calcitonin， which is produced in thyroid C cells . In healthy humans， elevated levels of calcium， glucocorticoids， Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP)，glucagon， gastrin， and B-adrenergic stimulation induce CALC-1 gene in C cells of the thyroid to convert preprocalcitonin to procalcitonin and eventually calcitonin . However， during a body's inflammatory response to certain pathogens， production of procalcitonin is altered directly by lipopolysaccharides and other toxic metabolites， or in directly via inflammatory mediators such as IL-6 and TNF-a .\n\n【13】Sepsis is a syndrome， in which the body creates an exaggerated in flammatory response to an abnormal stimulus，commonlyinfection， which may cascade into severe multiorgan failure . The annual incidence of sepsis is estimated to be 300 cases per 100，000 populations with an average annual cost of hospital care of approximately $14billion in the United States . With prompt identification of sepsis， key improving outcomes， clinicians use diagnostic criteria comprised of physical exam findings， along with supportive laboratory data to guide management . Criteria for Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome include Temperature >38 Cor <36 C，Heart Rate>90/min， Respiratory Rate >20/min and White Blood Cell Count>12，000 cells/uL or<4，000 cells/uLOther screening criteria such qSOFA has shown mixed evidence in their effectiveness for assessing sepsis. In the past decade， procalcitonin has increasingly been using to guide clinicians in deciding to give antibiotic therapy .\n\n【14】Procalcitonin elevation occurs within 2hto4h of active bacterial infection， and peaks between 8 h to 24 h . Low levels of serum procalcitonin are also useful for confirmation of viral infection， to safely discontinue antibiotics . Procalcitonin has also been shown to be elevated in many non-infectious causes including inhalation injury， burns， pancreatitis， mechanical trauma， extensive surgery or heat stroke . In these non-infectious causes of elevation， ranges of value and peak time may vary depending upon etiology . There have also been case reports of elevated procalcitonin in the setting of different severity ranging from DRESS Syndrome to anaphylactic shock ， implying its potential role as a marker. However， a case review of 8 different allergic reactions showed that only 3 of 8 cases have a significant elevation of procalcitonin .\n\n【15】In the case reported by Hiroyuki et al.  the patient developed an anaphylactic reaction to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 12 days after starting therapy， like our patients， the patient had a marked elevation of procalcitonin and did receive antibiotic therapy for presumed sepsis. Cases reports of Drug Rash with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) Syndrome， a type of delayed allergic reaction， by Bonaci-Nikolic  and Benoit et al.  showed patients with marked procalcitonin elevation. A study conducted by Sun-Young et al.  compared procalcitonin and C-Reactive Protein (CRP) to differentiate infection and drug hypersensitivity reactions. They showed that procalcitonin was a better marker than CRP to differentiate between infection and hypersensitivity and that procalcitonin was normal in nearly 79% of patients with hypersensitivity . Sun-Young et al.  did， however， show that the level of procalcitonin did have a positive correlation with the severity of the Allergic Reaction.\n\n【16】In the case reports study， clinicians tended to initiate antibiotic therapy with signs of SIRS and elevated procalcitonin . From reviewing these cases， we believe that clinicians must be aware of alternate causes of procalcitonin elevation. Furthermore， with anaphylaxis having an overlapping presentation with possible sepsis， additional studies should be done to further evaluate the role of procalcitonin in the setting of hypersensitivity reactions.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:08:01", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:08:18", "cost": 16.868}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:44", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:08:17", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:08:00"}

We report a case of a 58 year old female， presenting with fever， night sweats and painless submandibular and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. The left axillary lymph node excisional biopsy showed complete effacement of architecture by small mature lymphocytes. There were scattered pseudofollicles with pale nodular appearance containing large lymphocytes with open chromatin. The neoplastic cells were small with round nuclear contours， coarsely clumped chromatin and scant cytoplasm and they diffusely expressed CD20， CD5 and CD23 consistent with SLL/CLL. Ki-67 (20%) was increased outside of the proliferation centers. Flow cytometry revealed a clonal kappa population with coexpression of CD20， CD5 and CD23.Karyotyping revealed a complex abnormal karyotype with two neoplastic clones and several rearrangements， including a gain of 2p resulting from der  t (2；14)， confirmed by concurrent FISH showing a MYCN (2p24) signal in the der . CLL with 2p gain is usually associated with unfavorable cytogenetic deletions (11q， 17p)， unmutated status of immunoglobulin heavy chain(IGHV) and increased CD38. However， in our case， FISH showed loss of 13q and CD38 was low(5%)， findings more often associated with a favorable prognosis. population that extended through the capsule and involved perinodal adipose tissue. The infiltrate consisted of small round lymphocytes with condensed nuclear chromatin and scant cytoplasm . Admixed at regular intervals were proliferation centers which imparted a vague， pale nodular appearance. The proliferation centers were composed of larger lymphoid cells with more abundant cytoplasm， open nuclear chromatin and more conspicuous nucleoli. Ki-67 showed increased proliferation (20%) outside the proliferation centers  that raised some concern of early transformation to large B cell lymphoma. However， confluent sheets oflarge cells were not observed. The small maturelymphocytes weakly expressed CD20， CD5 and CD23  and more strongly expressed BCL2. Cyclin D1， CD10 and BCL6 were not expressed by the neoplastic cells . Scattered reactive CD3 positive T lymphocytes were present. Flow cytometry revealed a clonal kappa positive， B cell population that co-expressed CD5， dim CD20 and CD23. CD38 was low (5%). These findings were consistent with SLL/CLL， stage II. Karyotyping revealed a complex abnormal karyotype with two neoplastic clones and several rearrangements， including a gain of 2p resulting from der  t (2；14)， confirmed by concurrent FISH showing a MYCN (2p24) signal in the der  . The FISH panel for SLL/CLL showed loss of 13q14 (Rb gene) with no abnormality in other FISH probes.\n\n【2】Discussion\n\n【3】The terms SLL and CLL are used interchangeably， the former presenting with a leukemic picture and the latter being limited to disease inlymph nodes . The most common clinicalpresentation is an asymptomatic patient with an incidental finding of SLL/CLL. The peripheral blood smear shows lymphocytosis with small mature lymphocytes and smudge cells (fragile degenerating leukemic cells). SLL/CLL is the most common malignant cause of generalized lymphadenopathy in an elderly population (>50 years) with nonspecific symptoms of anorexia， fever， night sweats and weight loss. In some cases， SLL/CLL may be associated with warm or， less often， cold autoimmune hemolytic anemia .\n\n【4】Peripheral blood lymphocytosis in an elderly patient should raise suspicion for SLL/CLL. The diagnosis of malignancy is established with flow cytometry revealing a monoclonal B cell population. In cases with lymphadenopathy， the lymph node architecture is completely effaced by small mature lymphocytes having condensed nuclear chromatin. Pseudofollicles have pale nodular appearance due to the proliferation of large lymphocytes having open nuclear chromatin and more abundant cytoplasm. SLL/CLL is a low grade B-cell malignancy having a low proliferation index except the pseudofollicles which may show increased Ki. The expression of CD20，CD5 and CD23 by the neoplastic cells either by flow cytometry or by immunohistochemistry is consistent with SLL/CLL.\n\n【5】SLL/CLL is clinically heterogeneous with an indolent course in most patients with good prognosis who may survive without treatment for a considerable period of time . In some patients， SLL/CLL behaves as a progressive malignancy with decreased survival. The current staging systems，Rai and Binet， identify patients with advanced stage disease， who require treatment； but these staging systems are not able to predict the clinical course . The prognosis of SLL/CLL depends upon pregerminal versus postgerminal origin of malignancy . Several molecular and cytogenetic markers are used to classify SLL/CLL into distinct groups with prognostic significance.\n\n【6】The clinical course of SLL/CLL depends upon the somatic hypermutation status of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable(IGHV)region. The somatic hypermutation ofIGHV increases affinity of the B cell receptor with antigen during an immune response. The unmutated IGHV status (>95% homology to germline sequences) is consistent with pregerminal center origin and poor prognosis. The mutated IGHV status is consistent with postgerminal center origin and predicts good outcome . CD38， a cell surface antigen and 70-kd zeta-chain T-cell receptor-associated protein kinase(ZAP-70) are used as surrogate markers for IGHV mutation statusThese biomarkers can be evaluated with flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry. Increased CD38/ZAP-70 expression > 30%is consistent with unmutated IGHV status， pregerminal center origin and poor prognosis in SLL/CLL patients.\n\n【7】Recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities represent independent markers for disease progression in SLL/CLL. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is the standard for detection of cytogenetic abnormalities . Loss of 13q14 (Rb gene) is established as a favorable prognostic marker. Trisomy 12 is associated with intermediate prognosis. Loss of 11q22  and 17p13 (ATM gene) carry poor prognosis . SLL/CLL has low proliferative index； therefore， limiting the role of conventional karyotyping in evaluation of cytogenetic abnormalities.\n\n【8】Whole genome sequencing， comparative genomic hybridization and single nucleotide pleomorphism (SNP) arrays have been used in the evaluation of novel cytogenetic abnormalities in SLL/CLL from a prognostic standpoint . There are a few studies that have identified gain of short arm of chromosome 2 (2p) as a rare novel cytogenetic abnormality in SLL/CLL. These studies have linked the2p gain with poor prognostic markers such as CD38/ZAP-70 high expression and loss of 11q22 and 17p. The rare 2p gain is considered to be a marker of adverse prognosis in limited studies. The gene transcription profiling has identified a few proto-oncogenes， mapped to 2p， such as MYCN and REL. The dysregulation of these oncogenes is suggested as a potential pathogenetic mechanism for progression of SLL/CLL .\n\n【9】MicroRNAs areshort， noncodingsingle-strandedRNA molecules with length of approximately 22 nucleotides. MicroRNAs may be useful as prognostic markers for B-cell malignancy because their expression allows specific cell differentiation stages to be identified . The pathogenesis of CLL is better understood after studying the expression ofmiRNAs. Loss ofmiR-15a/16-1 cluster was identified from 13q14 locus in 2002. This cluster regulates BCL2 and apoptosis， which explains BCL2 overexpression in CLL . Some studies showed that expression of miRNA-29 decreased as the disease progressed， suggesting its role as a favorable prognostic marker.\n\n【10】The 2p gain has been reported in at least 86 cases of CLL. Overall， unfavorable cytogenetic deletions (11q22，17p13) were more frequent in 2p gain cases as well as unmutated IGHV status and increased CD38/ZAP-70 expression . However， in our case the 2p gain was associated with favorable biomarkers， including low CD38and 13q14loss. This case studywarrants additionalstudies to establish the prognostic significance of 2p gain in SLL/CLL. Furthermore，even though mitotic activity is very low in CLL， karyotyping should be attempted because novel cytogenetic abnormalities can be identified， which can be further evaluated by FISH .\n\n【11】Conclusion\n\n【12】The prognosis of SLL/CLL depends upon recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities and somatic hypermutation status of immunoglobulin heavy chain region. The rare 2p gain in SLL/CLL has been reported to occur with poor prognostic markers. In our case， 2p gain is associated with low CD38 and loss of 13q14， often considered favorable prognostic markers. This paradoxical association of 2p gain in our case warrants further studies on its role as a prognostic marker in SLL/CLL.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:40:57", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:41:05", "cost": 8.855}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:44", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:41:05", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:40:56"}

All patients underwent routine abdominal，IVIM，DTIand DKI scans， and the main MRI parameters of kidney and clinical characteristics were measured. The diagnostic performance of AKI was compared， and the relationships among these indices， Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) and AKI staging were analyzed. Finally， all parameters were analyzed by single- and multiparameter regression.\n\n【3】Results： Compared with the non-AKI group，the percentage of CD3+ CD4+ T cells and CD4/CD8+ratio in peripheral blood increased significantly. The fast ADC value and Ff ADC value of the renal medulla in the AKI group were significantly lower than those in the non-AKI group. The FA value in the renal cortex was significantly lower than that in the medulla and significantly lower than that in the non-AKI group. The renal medulla MK value in the AKI group was significantly lower than that of the non-AKI group and had the best diagnostic value for AKI in SAP patients， which was positively correlated with AKI staging and negatively correlated with the eGFR. MK values， the percentage of CD3+ CD4+ T cells and CD4+/CD8+ ratio were independent risk factors for AKI by multiparameter logistic regression analysis.\n\n【4】Conclusion： The measurement of renal DKI parameters combined with CD4+ T lymphocytes is practical for early diagnosis and predicting the severity of renal injury in SAP patients.\n\n【5】Keywords： Acute severe pancreatitis； Acute kidney injury； Intravoxel incoherent motion imaging； Diffusion tensor imaging； Diffusion kurtosis imaging\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】Acute Pancreatitis (AP) is a systemic disease with immune disorders， especially Severe Acute Pancreatitis (SAP). Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common complication in hospitalized patients and manifests as a sudden decrease in renal excretion. The mortality rate can be as high as 70%when AP is combined with AKI . However， the onset of AP-induced renal injury is insidious， and its early clinical manifestations are nonspecific. The levels of serum Creatinine (sCr) and Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) indicators may be normal， while renal lesions are still in a reversible stage， and active treatment can reduce or delay the occurrence of renal injury . Therefore， early detection of AP kidney injury and understanding its immune mechanism can delay the occurrence and development of AP kidney injury， which are of great significance to improve the curer and reduce mortality . T lymphocyte subsets participate in the formation of the body's immune system， which mainly maintains the body's immune balance through the T cell network of helper T cells， namely CD4+ T cells and suppressor T cells， namely CD8+ T cells.\n\n【8】In recent years， functional kidney MR imaging has developed rapidly， making it possible to noninvasively evaluate the morphology and function of the kidney . With the continuous improvement of biological tissue diffusion technology， the IVIM two-compartment model was first proposed by Bihan et al.， which measures the microcirculation perfusion and diffusion of the kidney through the observed signal attenuation at different B values. Therefore， IVIM has shown great potentialinthe diagnosis andevaluation ofkidney diseases by revealing the pathophysiological changes of the disease. DTI indirectly reflects information on kidney function changes by detecting the degree and direction of limited diffusion movement of water molecules in human tissues . With the extensive application of parallel acquisition technology and plane echo imaging， the application of DTI in organs other than the central nervous system is expanding and becoming a hot topic . In addition， the kidney is characterized by high perfusion， high water content and radial arrangement of various structures (renal tubules， collecting ducts， and blood vessels)， which lays a theoretical foundation for renal DTI imaging. DKI was derived from DTI model. Due to the impediment of cell membranes， compartments and special cell morphological changes in the lesion area， water molecule diffusion does not always follow a Gaussian distribution. The newly developed DKI was employed to describe the non-Gaussian distribution. Kurtosis， as a dimensionless metric， was employed to quantify the degree of non-Gaussian diffusion and characterize tissue heterogeneity . At present， some scholars use a 3.0 T MRI scanner to study kidney DKI in healthy volunteers， and they have confirmed its application value in the kidney . As DKI is a newly developed functional imaging technology， there are no reports on the evaluation of renal function in AP patients.\n\n【9】In addition， our previous clinical studies have confirmed the value of DTI in the quantitative diagnosis and severity evaluation of AP . Therefore， we applied the above imaging techniques to further explore the early diagnostic value and severity classification of acute kidney injury in SAP patients， as well as the change of T lymphocyte subsets.\n\n【10】Materials and Methods\n\n【11】Patient population\n\n【12】The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College， and all participants signed informed consent forms. Consecutive patients with a clinical history of SAP in our institute between January 2017 and June 2020were initially considered in this study. SAP diagnosis was based on the Atlanta classification criteria revised in 2012 and is presented in Table 1 . The diagnosis of organ failure was performed using the modified Marshall scoring system ， as shown in Table 2， which included the respiratory， circulatory and urinary systems. Organ failure could be diagnosed if any of the three systems reached 2 points or more. Local complications could be aseptic or bacterial within 4weeks and after 4 weeks. Systemic complications refer to basic diseases(such as coronary heart disease) aggravated by the exacerbation of AP . Patients with chronic pancreatitis， tumor and chronic liver disease， chronic renal disease， hypoproteinemia， severe systemic infection or hemorrhagic disease， and poor compliance in MR examination were excluded.\n\n【13】Allpatients were divided into AKI and non-AKI groupsaccording to serum creatinine levels. The AKI diagnostic and grading criteria conformed to the 2012 guidelines for improving the prognostic organization (KDIGO) of global kidney disease . The diagnostic criteria were as follows：  Serum creatinine increased more than26.5 umol/L within 48 h，  serum creatinine levels increased by 1.5times over the baseline within 7 days； and  the urine volume in six consecutive hours was less than 5 mL/kg/h. The AKI staging criteria are detailed in Table 3. All patients completed the determination of serum creatinine levels one day before the MRI examination. The formula for calculating the eGFR based on the epidemiological collaboration (CKD-EPI) for chronic kidney disease is as follows ：\n\n【14】MR technologies\n\n【15】All subiects were scanned in the supine position on a 3.0T MRI scanner (Discovery MR 750； GE Medical Systems， Milwaukee， WI.) with a 50 mT/m maximum gradient length and 200 T/m/s maximum slew rate using a 32-channel body array coil with sixteen anterior and sixteen posterior elements . The routine scan sequence included transverse T1WI， T2WI， coronal T2WI and three-phase dynamic enhancement scans covering the two kidneys. To avoid increasing the burden on the kidneys， AP patients with abnormal renal function did not receive enhanced MR scans. Details of the scanning parameters are shown in Table 4 . The patient fasted without water for 6hours prior to MR examination.\n\n【16】Table 1： Classification criteria for acute pancreatitis in Atlanta 2012\n\n| Severity  | Definition  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Mild  | No organ failure， no local or systemic complications  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Moderate  | Organ failure time <48 h or the existence of local and systemic complications  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Severe  | Organ failure time >48 h  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Table 2： Improved Marshall scoring system.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Organ system  |  | O point  | 1 point  | 2 points  | 3 points  | 4 points  |\n| Respiration (PaO2/FiO2)  |  | >400  | 301-400  | 201-300  | 101-200  | ≤101  |\n| Kidney (serum creatinine)  |  | ≤134  | 134-169  | 170-310  | 311-439  | >439  |\n| Cardiovascular (systolic pressure)  |  | >90  | <90， reaction during infusion  | <90， no reaction during infusion  | <90，PH<7.3  | <90，PH<7.2  |\n\n【18】Cardiovascular (systolic pressure) <90， reaction during infusion <90， no reaction during infusion <90，PH<7.3 <90，PH<7.2\n\n| Staging  | Serum creatinine  |  | Urinary volume  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | 1.9 times of the base value or increase 2 26.5 umol/L  |  | <0.5 ml/kg/h duration 6-12 h  |  |\n|  | 2.9 times the base value  |  | <0.5 ml/kg/h duration over 12 h  |  |\n|  | Start renal replacement therapy or 3 times base value or creatinine 2 umol/L 353.6  |  | <0.3 ml/kg/h duration over 24 h or anuria duration over 12 h  |  |\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n\n【20】Table 4： Sequences and parameters of the 3.0T MRI scan of the upper abdomen.\n\n|  | TR [ms)  | TE (ms)  | Flip angle  | Thickness [mm；  | Gap [mm}  | Matrix  | FOV(cm)  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| AX 3D LAVA-Flex  | 4.2  | 2.6/1.3  | 15-20°  | 5  | 0  | 384x224  | 26-33  |\n| AX FRFSE T2W  | 10000-12000  | 90-100  | 90°  | 5  | 0.5  | 256x192  | 36×34  |\n| COR SSFSET2W  | 2500-3500  | 80-100  | 90°  | 5  | 0.5  | 384x256  | 39x33  |\n| AX SSFSE T2W  | 2500-3500  | 80-100  | 90°  | 5  | 0.5  | 320x256  | 39x33  |\n| MRCP  | 3045  | 1300  | 90°  | 40  | 40-50  | 384x224  | 32×34  |\n| AX 3D LAVAC+  | 4.2  | 2.6/1.3  | 15-20°  | 5  | 0  | 384x224  | 26-33  |\n\n【22】Ff ADC map (E).\n\n【23】Breath-holding DTI and free-breathing IVIM and DKI scans of the kidneys were performed in the transverse position before enhanced scanning. The DTI parameters were as follows： TR 2500ms， TE minimum ms， section thickness =5 mm， intersection gap=0mm， FOV= 28 cm to 36 cm， bandwidth 250 Hz，NEX=1 and matrix=256×192. Auto shim： on， diffusion-encoding directions =9， b-value=500 s/mm². The IVIM and DKI sequences were both based on single shot DW spin echo planar imaging with a fat-suppressed sequence， and the IVIM-specific parameters were as follows： b-factor values(0， 50， 100， 150，200，300，500，800，1000 and 1500 s/mm)， TR/TE=4000 ms to 4500 ms/90 ms to 100 ms， matrix= 192~256×192~256， FOV= 28 cm to 36 cm， section thickness =5 mm， and intersection gap=0 mm. The DKI parameters were as follows： b-factor values (0，1000，2000 s/mm)， diffusion-encoding directions =30， TR 8000 ms， TE minimum ms， thickness =5 mm， intersection gap =0mm，NEX=2. The average scan times of DTI， IVIM and DKI were 21 sec， 2 min to 3\n\n【24】MR image analysis\n\n【25】The original DTI， IVIM-DWI， and DKI images were loaded onto a workstation (Advantage Workstation 4.4； GE Healthcare). The FuncTool 2 software package was used to process all raw data， and maps of the corresponding parameters were then obtained by automatic pixel-wise analysis on the GE workstation . Images of the surrounding fat， bone， gas and other tissue were removed by applying the threshold definition method. The parameters of the renal cortex and medulla were quantitatively measured， including DTI-associated ADC， Fractional Anisotropy (FA)， IVIM-associated standard ADC， perfusion fraction (Ff ADC)， pseudodiffusion coefficient (fast ADC)， diffusion coefficient (slow ADC)， DKI-associated Mean Kurtosis (MK)， mean corrected diffusion coefficient(MD) and FA value.\n\n【26】To avoid the effect of cardiac motion on the image， the right kidney was selected as the target Region of Interest (ROI). Renal ROIs were manually delineated on the b=0 DW images with the aid of T2-weighted images as a reference for distinguishing the cortex and medulla. In each kidney， the ROI of the renal cortex and medulla was an irregular area with a size of 15 ± 2 mm and contained at least 10to 15 pixels. ROIs were manually drawn at the level of the renal hilum carefully avoiding artifacts， the kidney collection system， and the edge of the kidney. Then， the measurement was repeated three times， and the average values were recorded . All parameters were measured by a radiologist with more than five years of experience in abdominal MR. After 3 days， the second time was measured by the same method， and the results were averaged as the final results of statistical analyses.\n\n【27】Laboratory biochemical tests\n\n【28】Biochemical laboratory indicators were determined by an automatic biochemical analyzer (Mindray BS-22) according to the operation procedure and carried out by special personnel in the laboratory of our hospital. These indicators included serum Creatinine (sCr)， Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN)， Serum Uric Acid(UA)， Serum Cystatin C (Cys-C)， Fasting Blood Glucose (FBG)， Serum Amylase (AMY)， Serum Lipase (LIP)， Serum Cholinesterase(CHE)， Total Protein (TP)， Albumin (ALB)， Globulin (GLOB)，Total Bilirubin (TBIL)， Direct Bilirubin (DBIL)， Total Bile Acid (TBA)， Glutamate-Propionate Aminotransferase (ALT)， Glutamate-Oxalate Aminotransferase (AST)， R Glutamate Transferase (GGT) and Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP).\n\n【29】CD4+， CD8+ T cell subgroup detection\n\n【30】Peripheral blood lymphocyte counts were analyzed by flow cytometry (Mindray BriCyte E6， Shenzhen) and supporting reagents to detect specific fluorescent antibodies on the surface of immune acid and eGFR were 340.6 pmol/L， 21.6 mmol/L， 343.7 pmal/L， and 65.4 ml/min， respectively. cells. The specific operation was strictly in accordance with the kit instructions and performed by a dedicated person in the laboratory of our hospital. The percentages of total T lymphocytes (CD3)， Th lymphocytes (CD3+ CD4) and Ts lymphocytes (CD3 CD8) were reported， as well as the CD4+/CD8+ratio.\n\n【31】Statistical analysis\n\n【32】Continuous variables were tested for normality， and normally distributed variables were expressed as the means ± standard deviation. The classification variables were represented by the composition ratio. Multiple independent samples t tests were used to compare the differences in MR parameter values between the two groups. Spearman correlation analysis was used to evaluate the correlation between renal parenchymal parameters and eGFR and renal injury grade. Chi-square test was used for classification variables. A Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was established to analyze the diagnostic efficacy of IVIM， DTI， and DKI. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to predict the risk factors for AKI. All statistical analyses were performed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows (Version13.0， Chicago， IL， USA). P<0.05 was considered to be significant.\n\n【33】Results\n\n【34】General information of SAP patients\n\n【35】In total， 68 patients were included in the study， and 12 patients were excluded (1 with chronic pancreatitis， 2 with tumor and chronic liver disease， 3 with chronic renal disease or renal failure， 2 with hypoproteinemia， 2 with severe systemic infection or hemorrhagic disease， and 2 with poor compliance in MR examination). The final study group consisted of 56 consecutive patients with SAP， including21 women and 35 men with an average age of 59.2±15.9 years (20to 81 years)， 14 of whom were diagnosed with AKI according to the KDIGO criteria . The number of AKI patients with stage I， II， and III disease was 7， 5， and 2， accounting for 50%， 36%， and 14%， respectively. The proportion of men was higher than that of women (28.6% vs. 19.0%， P<0.05). The basic information of all patients is shown in Table 5. The indicators were not significantly different between the AKI and non-AKI groups， which included age (P=0.732)， FBG (P=0.421)， AMY (P=0.219)， TP (P=0.080)， ALB(P=0.057)， GLOB (P=0.286)， TBIL (P=0.473)， DBIL (P=0.225)，TBA(P=0.226)， ALT (P=0.876)， AST (P=0.432)， GGT (P=0.722) and ALP (P=0.560). Compared with the non-AKI group， the blood urea nitrogen， creatinine and uric acid were significantly increased in the AKI group， while the blood LIP， CHE and estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) were significantly decreased (P<0.05).\n\n【36】Comparison of T lymphocyte subsets\n\n【37】The changes in T lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood in both groups are shown in Table 6. The percentage of CD3+ CD4+T cells and CD4+/CD8+ ratio of peripheral blood in the AKI group were significantly lower than those in the non-AKI group (P<0.05). Although the percentages of CD3+ and CD3+ CD8+ T cells in the AKI group were also lower than those in the non-AKI group， the differences were not statistically significant (P>0.05).\n\n【38】Analysis of IVIM， DTI， and DKI parameters\n\n【39】No serious artifacts were found in the MR images of any of the subjects. The results ofthe main renal IVIM，DTIand DKI parameters in both groups are shown in Tables 7-9， respectively. In IVIM mode， the fast ADC and Ff ADC of the renal medulla in the AKI group were lower than those in the non-AKI group (P=0.043； 0.037). The slow ADC values in the renal cortex and medulla were not significantly different between the AKI and non-AKI groups (P>0.05). In DTI mode， the FA value of the renal cortex in both groups was lower than that in the medulla (P=0.013；0.041)， and the FA value of the renal cortex and medulla in the AKI group was significantly lower than that in the non-AKI group (P=0.419；0.026). However， there was no significant difference in ADC values between the renal cortex and medulla (P=0.438；0.429). In addition， the renal cortex FA value in the AKI group was significantly lower than that in the non-AKI control group (P=0.045)， and there were no significant differences between renal cortex ADC and medullary ADC in the two groups (P=0.331；0.349). In DKI mode， the MK value of the medulla was higher than that of the cortex (P=0.045)， and the MK value in the AKI group was also higher than that in the non-AKI group (P=0.041).\n\n【40】Comparison of the diagnostic efficacy of IVIM， DTI， and DKI in the diagnosis of AKI\n\n【41】To further explore the diagnostic efficacy of positive parameters for AKI， a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was established by taking the AKI group as the positive sample， and the analyzed indices were divided into several segments according to the numerical range of the total level of the sample (broken line). According to the ROC analysis， the above five indicators have high diagnostic value， as shown in Table 10 and Figure 6. However， MK of the medulla had the highest diagnostic efficiency， and its sensitivity， specificity， and Youden index were 0.793， 0.818， and0.611，respectively.\n\n【42】Correlation analysis\n\n【43】To further analyze the relationship between each parameter and eGFR， we performed a Spearman correlation test on AKI patients. The results showed that eGFR was positively correlated with IVIM-\n\n【44】Table 5： Comparison of general clinical data.\n\n| Clinical index  | non-AKI(n=42)  | AKI (n=14)  | P  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Age  | 58.65±15.62  | 60.83±13.68  | 0.732  |\n| Gender (female/male)  | 118/24  | 4/10  | 0.039  |\n| Bun (mmol/L)  | 6.02±2.85  | 16.41±8.43  | <0.001  |\n| Cr (pumal/L)  | 75.57±23.97  | 358.37±266.33  | <0.001  |\n| UA (umol/L)  | 292.03±102.65  | 383.94±171.58  | 0.025  |\n| eGFR(ml/min)  | 108.67±20.34  | 82.45±21.37  | <0.01  |\n| FBG (mmol/L  | 7.70±3.22  | 7.23±3.86  | 0.421  |\n| AMY(U/L)  | 852.77±507.00  | 869.33±872.52  | 0.219  |\n| LIP (U/L)  | 803.77±518.69  | 719.80±947.56  | 0.037  |\n| CHE (U/L)  | 6675.78±1921.20  | 4685.22±1874.63  | <0.001  |\n| TP (g/L)  | 63.47±6.29  | 58.52±9.52  | 0.080  |\n| ALB (g/L)  | 37.08±4.64  | 33.63±6.68  | 0.057  |\n| GLOB (g/L)  | 26.66±5.23  | 24.88±6.23  | 0.286  |\n| TBIL (pmal/L  | 40.65±46.44  | 31.34±26.51  | 0.472  |\n| DBIL (pmal/L  | 19.69±28.84  | 12.17±14.99  | 0.224  |\n| TBA (umol/L  | 34.45±69.10  | 13.15±22.82  | 0.225  |\n| ALT(U/L)  | 168.13±188.50  | 172.39±226.09  | 0.866  |\n| AST (U/L)  | 147.65±209.97  | 110.83±140.16  | 0.432  |\n| GGT (U/L)  | 271.03±316.83  | 270.00±251.27  | 0.711  |\n| ALP (U/L)  | 130.31±99.02  | 134.33±93.97  | 0.550  |\n\n【46】Table 6： Comparison of Tlymphocyte subsets between AKl and non-AKl groups.\n\n| Tcell  |  | non-AKI (n=42)  |  | AKI(n=14)  | f  | P  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| CD3+(%)  |  | 62.23±15.19  |  | 53.83±11.82  | 0.98  | 0.076  |\n| CD3+CD4+(%)  |  | 41.78±10.45  |  | 27.81±8.44  | 2.34  | 0.021  |\n| CD3+CD8+(%)  |  | 22.13±5.69  |  | 24.73±6.62  | 0.29  | 0.460  |\n| CD4+/CD8+  |  | 1.72±0.36  |  | 1.21±0.29  | 1.95  | 0.043  |\n\n【48】represents Pe0.05 aRepresents P<0.05 compared with the cortex by t test； b represents Pe0.05 compared with the non-AKl group by t test fast ADC value， DTI-FA value， CD4+/CD8+ ratio and CD3+ CD4+T cell percentage (fast ADC of medulla： r=0.513， P=0.012； fast ADC of cortex： r=0.548， P=0.009； medulla FA： r=0.40， P=0.016； cortex FA： r=0.36， P=0.021；CD4+/CD8+ ratio： r=0.45， P=0.014； CD3+ CD4+T cell percentage： r=0.507， P=0.011)， and it had a highly negative correlation with the MK value (medulla MK： r= -0.882， P=0.000). Since the MK value had the highest correlation with eGFR ， we further grouped the AKI patients according to the stages of AKI and compared the MK differences among different stages of AKI patients. The comparison between groups showed that there were significant differences in renal medulla MK values among patients with different AKI stages (F=46.09， P=0.000)， MK values increased with increasing AKI stage ， and there was a positive correlation between renal medulla MK values and AKI stage(r=0.789， P=0.000). We found that there were significant differences in renal medulla MK values among patients with different AKI stages(F=46.09，P=0.000). As the AKI stage increased， the MK value showed an increasing trend ， and the renal medulla MK value was positively correlated with the AKI stage (r=0.789， P=0.000).\n\n【49】Table 7： Comparative analysis of renal lVIM parameters in the Akl group and non-AKl group.\n\n|  | slow ADC  |  | fast ADC  |  | Ff ADC  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Group  | Cortex  | Medulla  | Cortex  | Medulla  | Cortex  | Medulla  |\n| Non-AKI  | 1.34±0.21  | 1.26±0.25  | 22.71±2.38  | 17.25±1.25  | 0.42±0.05  | 0.25±0.02  |\n| AKI  | 1.35±0.24  | 1.33±0.28  | 20.63±2.87  | 16.86±1.12a.b  | 0.38±0.03  | 0.22±0.02ab  |\n\n【51】Represents P<0.05 compared with the cortex by t test； b represents Pe0.05 compared with the non-AKl group by t test.\n\n【52】Table 8： Comparative analysis of renal DTI parameters in the AKl group and non-AKI.\n\n|  |  | FA  | ADC  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Group  | Cortex  | Medulla  | Cortex  | Medulla  |\n| Non-AKI  | 0.28±0.02  | 0.57±0.17a  | 2.24±0.17  | 2.20±0.19  |\n| AKI  | 0.23±0.05  | 0.41±0.16ab  | 2.16±0.29  | 2.12±0.28  |\n\n【54】Table 9： Comparative analysis of renal DKI parameters in the Akl group and non-AKl group.\n\n|  | FA  |  | MK  |  | MD  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Group  | Cortex  | Medulla  | Group  | Group  | Group  | Group  |\n| Non-AKI  | 0.22±0.04  | 0.26±0.03  | 0.40±0.03  | 0.42±0.02a  | 2.67±0.34  | 2.42±0.26  |\n| AKI  | 0.21±0.04  | 0.24±0.05  | 0.41±0.07  | 0.49±0.03a.b  | 2.39±0.47  | 2.35±0.32  |\n\n【56】Represents P<0.05 compared with the cortex by ttest； b represents Pe0.05 compared with the non-AKl group by ttest\n\n【57】Table 10： Comparison of ROC curve analysis results of each positive parameter of IVIM， DTI， and DKI.\n\n| Index  | AUC (0.95 CI)  | Theoretical threshold  | Sensitivity  | Specificity  | Youden index  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Medulla fast ADC  | 0.682(0.469~0.991)  | 17.0  | 0.704  | 0.671  | 0.385  |\n| Medulla FfADC  | 0.705(0.564~0.881)  | 0.24  | 0.702  | 0.706  | 0.408  |\n| DTI cortex FA  | 0.728(0.550~0.963)  | 0.26  | 0.748  | 0.704  | 0.452  |\n| DTI medulla FA  | 0.755(0.592~0.962)  | 0.50  | 0.764  | 0.751  | 0.515  |\n| Medulla MK  | 0.804(0.714~0.906)  | 0.44  | 0.793  | 0.818  | 0.611  |\n\n【59】Regression analysis of acute pancreatitis combined with AKI is between 0% and 30%. However， a study found that of 414 SAP patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)， 287(69.3%) developed AKI. In this study，25% of SAP patients (14/56) developed AKI， which is consistent with the KDIGO guidelines. The proportion of men with AKI was higher than that of women (28.6% vs.19.0%). This result is consistent with previous reports， indicating that male patients with acute pancreatitis are more likely to develop AKI.\n\n【60】Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that sex (OR=0.316， P=0.048)， CHE (OR=0.886， P=0.003)， eGFR (OR=0.865， P=0.005)， BUN(OR=1.049，P=0.001)，CR(OR=1.202，P=0.001)，UA(OR=1.006， P=0.002)， FA value (OR=0.999，P=0.001)， percentage of CD3+ CD4+T cells (OR=1.448，P=0.001)，CD4+/CD8ratio (OR=1.203，P=0.001) and MK value (OR=1.554， P=0.001) were important predictors of AKI in acute pancreatitis. After further multivariate logistic regression analysis， we found that the percentage of CD3+ CD4+T cells (OR=1.312， P=0.001)， CD4/CD8 ratio (OR=1.256， P=0.001)， and MK value (OR=1.530， P=0.001) were independent risk factors for acute pancreatitis with AKI.\n\n【61】Discussion\n\n【62】Important clinical indicators for predicting AKI in acute pancreatitis\n\n【63】AKI is a clinical syndrome defined as a sudden (within 48 h) and persistent decline in renal function caused by a variety of factors， including renalhypoperfusion，nephrotoxic substances， inflammatory factors， and urinary tract obstruction. At present， there are still no specific clinical treatment measures， and the mortality rate remains high. AKI is one of the common complications of acute pancreatitis， and its morbidity is between 1% and 14%， while the mortality rate Renal injury in AP is a complex disease caused by multiple factors， and various factors induce kidney injury through mutual intersection in the process of disease occurrence and development. Therefore， it is particularly important to discover multiple new molecular markers to realize the early prediction of AKI. In our study， there were no differences in liver function indices (TP， ALB， GLOB， TBIL， DBIL， TBA， ALT， AST， GGT and ALP) between AKI and non-AKI groups in SAP patients. These results suggested that liver function indicators should not be used to predict AKI in AP patients. In addition， blood urea nitrogen， creatinine， and uric acid levels were significantly increased in AKI patients， while serum LIP， CHE， and eGFR were decreased， which indicated that AP patients with AKI have severe renal damage. Univariate regression analysis showed that these variables may be important indicators for predicting AKI in acute pancreatitis.\n\n【64】The value of T lymphocyte subsets in the prediction and diagnosis of AKl in acute pancreatitis\n\n【65】The T lymphocyte subset is an important part of the body's immune system. Studies have shown that an imbalance in their proportion may lead to necrosis， infection and even death in AP patients . In this study， we found that the percentage of CD3+CD4+ T cells and the ratio of CD4+/CD8+ in peripheral blood in the AKI group were significantly lower than those in the non-AKI group， suggesting that the body exhibits immunosuppression in SAP patients. This result was consistent with previous reports. Therefore， our results showed that immunosuppression can occur in SAP patients at an early stage， and the decrease in the percentage of CD3+CD4+ T cells and CD4+/CD8+ ratio could indicate the possibility of exacerbation of SAP patients with AKI.\n\n【66】Research value of IVIM， DTI， and DKl in acute pancreatitis with AKI\n\n【67】At present， blood Cr， BUN and urine volume is often used to evaluate renal function. However， the early diagnostic value of these indices is extremely limited， and they are vulnerable to some non-renal factors . However， renal function MR imaging has become a hot topic in kidney research . Kidney DTI studies are mainly used for the evaluation of renal pelvic ureter obstruction in children ， diabetic nephropathy ，polycystic kidney disease in children and adults ， and ischemia- reperfusion injury of transplanted kidneys . Renal IVIM research reports are mainly used for the identification of renal tumors  and the assessment of renal function damage caused by different reasons . There are several reports on the application of DKI technology in the kidney . In addition， our previous clinical studies have confirmed the value of DTI in the quantitative diagnosis and severity assessment of AP. Therefore， we attempted to apply multimodal DWI technologies to the further assessment of AKI in SAP patients.\n\n【68】In this study， to avoid the influence of cardiac motion on the image， we selected the right kidney as the parameter measurement object. Furthermore， many studies have confirmed that there is no significant difference in the FA， ADC， and MK parameters of the left and right kidneys . Therefore， we have reason to believe that the right kidney can represent the body's renal function.\n\n【69】IVIM uses the observed signal attenuation of different b-values to determine renal microcirculation perfusion and diffusion， which can accurately reflect tissue DWI information. In this study， slow ADC values were not significantly different in the renal cortex and medulla， and there was still no difference between the two groups. However， the fast ADC and FfADC values of the renal medulla in the AKI group were significantly lower than those in the non-AKI group， and both of them had good diagnostic performance for AKI in SAP patients； the AUCs were 0.682 and 0.705，respectively. Moreover， the fast ADC values were moderately positively correlated with eGFR， which is consistent with research reports by Zhang et al.  and Liang et al. Our results indicate that renal microcirculation perfusion and effective blood flow are significantly reduced when SAP is combined with AKI. It is speculated that the causes are related to pathological changes， such as swelling and bleeding of glomerular cells， dysfunction of endothelial cells， increase in vascular permeability and infiltration of inflammatory cells.\n\n【70】The results of this study showed that the FA value of the renal cortex was significantlylower than that of the medulla in the DTI and DKI models， and the FA value of the renal parenchyma in AKI patients was lower than that in the control group and had good diagnostic performance for AKI in SAP patients. These results were inferred from two observations. On one hand， the kidney has a complex and special anatomical structure. The renal medulla， which consists of many blood vessels and straight tubules， is arranged in parallel and radial into the pelvis and sinus. The renal cortex is composed of many renal corpuscles and tubules， and the former is mainly composed of capillary globules distributed tortuously. It is precisely because of the difference in the microstructure of the renal cortex and medulla that the diffusion of water molecules in the renal medulla is more directional. On the other hand， when SAP is combined with AKI， pathological changes， such as decreased renal microcirculation perfusion， renal tubular injury， and renal tubular fibrosis， will cause limitations in the multi-directional diffusion of water molecules； as a result， the difference in anisotropic diffusion is relatively reduced， and the FA value decreases. Our results are consistent with the results of previous studies ， which confirmed that FA can reflect pathophysiological changes in early renal injury in SAP patients. Although the ADC value of the renal cortex medulla in SAP patients with AKI was lower than that in the non-AKI group， there was no significant difference in value between the two groups. This result indicates that FA values are more sensitive than ADC in detecting renal functional changes in SAP patients， and the results were also supported in subsequent studies on the correlation between the FA values of the renal cortex and medulla andeGFR(r=0.696 and 0.689).\n\n【71】MK is the characteristic index of DKI， which reflects the average level of complexity of organizational structure in each direction. The MK value increases as the tissue complexity increases. In this study， we found that the MK value in the renal cortex in SAP patients was lower than that in the medulla， while the MK value in the renal medulla of AKI patients was significantly higher than that in the control group (P<0.001). We speculate that this may be related to the complex tubular structure of the renal medulla. In addition， when SAP is combined with AKI， pathological changes， such as swelling， necrosis and shedding of renal tubular epithelial cells； narrowing or occlusion ofthe official cavity； formation of an intracavitary tube type； infiltration of a large number of inflammatory cells； and a decrease in extracellular space， lead to an increase in the complexity of renal tissue. Therefore， MK is eventually increased. Moreover， we found that the renal medulla MK was negatively correlated with eGFR and positively correlated with AKI stage， which had the best diagnostic performance for AKI. Similarly， Mao et al.  found that renal parenchymal MK was negatively correlated with eGFR in chronic kidney disease. Therefore， our results showed that the MK value might be a supplementary indicator for diagnosing and determining the severity of kidney injury in SAP patients.\n\n【72】Correlation analysis\n\n【73】In this study， we found that eGFR was negatively correlated with renal medulla MK and positively correlated with the percentage of CD3+ CD4+ T cells and the CD4+/CD8+ ratio. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the renal medulla MK value， percentage of CD3+ CD4+ T cells and CD4+/CD8+ ratio were independent risk factors for SAP patients with AKI. Therefore， using DKI combined with T lymphocyte subsets to determine the stage of renal injury in SAP patients may contribute to the diagnosis of AKI before eGFR reduction and provide the possibility for early interyention.\n\n【74】Research limitations\n\n【75】The number of SAP patients with AKI 25%(14/56) may have introduced a slight bias into our results. Moreover， SAP patients are in serious condition and have poor compliance in MR examination， which can affect image quality. Therefore， more patient data will be included in our future study.\n\n【76】Conclusion\n\n【77】In conclusion， the kidney IVIM， DTI and DKI parameters in the kidney had good early diagnostic value for AKI in SAP patients， especially the MK value of the renal medulla， which was positively correlated with AKI staging and negatively correlated with the eGFR. The decrease in the percentage of CD3+ CD4+ T cells and the CD4/CD8+ ratio in peripheral blood indicate immunosuppression， which underscores the possibility of exacerbation of SAP patients with AKI. Therefore， the measurement of renal DKI parameters combined with CD4 T lymphocytes is practical for early diagnosis and predicting the severity of renal injury in SAP patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:47:15", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:47:47", "cost": 31.855}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:44", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:47:47", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:47:15"}

Here we present a case of Mondor’s disease in an orthopedic surgeon after wearing a tight-fitting lead vest during surgery. Physicians and staff should be aware of the possibility of venous compression and thrombophlebitis from wearing tight clothing in the OR.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Thrombophlebitis of the superficial veins， or Mondor’s disease， is a benign and self-limiting condition which typically occurs in the anterior chest well， although it can also occur in the groin/penis， breast， antecubital fossa， or posterior cervical region . Mondor’s disease is rare with only roughly 400 reports in the literature. It typically affects middle aged women (three times more frequently than men) and occurs most often after breast surgery .\n\n【4】The typical presentation of Mondor’s disease involves the sudden onset of a tender and erythematous cord which subsequently becomes asymptomatic， although visible. This subcutaneous cord like induration typically occurs on the thoracoabdominal wall and most often involves the superior epigastric system or the lateral thoracic vein .\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】Here we present a case of a 34-year-old male who presented for evaluation of firm palpable cord on the left side of the chest and abdomen. He first noted linear erythema and tenderness within 24 h of wearing a tight-fitting lead vest during surgery. The tenderness lasted for two weeks， and he was afebrile. He presented to the dermatology clinic three weeks after onset with a 15 cm to 20 cm firm palpable cord on the left lateral chest extending onto the abdomen toward the umbilicus. The patient denied history of malignancy or hypercoagulability. He declined duplex ultrasound of the affected area to rule out deep venous thrombosis. He was diagnosed with superficial thrombophlebitis of the thoracoepigastric vein (Mondor’s disease). He was treated with NSAID's and warm compresses as needed.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】The etiology of Mondor’s disease is unknown； however， vessel wall damage， hypercoagulability， and venous compression can lead to development of this condition. Pressure on the vein with stagnation of blood， or trauma to the vein itself can lead to inflammation and development of a thrombus. This can secondarily lead to sclerosis on the vein and connective tissue proliferation resulting in the clinical cord like presentation .\n\n【9】Mondor’s disease， although typically benign， can often be confused with more serious pathologies such as breast malignancies， axillary metastases， or Spigelian hernias. It additionally can lead to involvement of deeper veins resulting in the possibility of pulmonary embolism . Thus， although the diagnosis is usually clinical， testing such as ultrasonography， or histologic diagnosis via biopsy， can be used to rule out more serious pathologies.\n\n【10】The condition typically concludes in spontaneous remission after roughly 6 to 8 weeks.\n\n【11】Treatment for Mondor's disease consists of rest and reassurance as well as topical or systemic medical treatments if an underlying disease is suspected. Examples of treatments include only warm compress and NSAIDS if occurring without underlying medical diseases， while adding anticoagulation options such as heparin， and/or aspirin if underlying hypercoagulability is present. Surgical treatment with thrombectomy or resection can be utilized if the disease is refractory to all other treatment.\n\n【12】Conclusion\n\n【13】Mondor’s disease is a rare clinical entity which can result after trauma， exercise， or compression of the thoracoabdominal wall. Mondor’s disease is typically benign； however， it is important to keep it in mind as it can often mimic more serious diagnoses.

Zygomatic abscesses are extremely rare； their presentation can easily be confused with other pathologies such as external otitis， which will lead to a delay in diagnosis andtreatment， and an increase in morbidity. We present a clinical case with an interesting differential diagnosis that reminds us ofthe importance of knowing these types of unusual complications.\n\n【2】Keywords： Otitis； Complications； Abscess； Zygomatic； Temporal\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】The Acute Otitis Media (AOM) is one of the most common infections in childhood. It has its highest prevalence in the first year of life， decreasing during the second and third years . Temporal root abscesses rare complications of acute otitis media that originate in the zygomatic cells of the temporal bone and extend into the soft tissues .\n\n【5】There are few cases of zygomatic abscesses published， however， it is important to know their existence as they involve potentially serious complications whose presentation form can be confused with other conditions.\n\n【6】The purpose of this work is to present a case of a zygomatic abscess showing the images that were necessary to make a diagnosis and its correct treatment.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】Eleven-year-old schoolchild with no relevant medical history who presented with a two-week history of left earache without otorrhea， vertigo， fever or headache. The outer ear was in normal position with painless mastoid palpation. At otoscopy， the External Auditory Canal (EAC) showed diffuse edema and whitish discharge that did not allow the eardrum to be seen. Diffuse External Otitis (DEO) was diagnosed and topical ciprofloxacin was prescribed.\n\n【9】The patient came to the emergency room on two occasions due to increased earache， and six days after the first visit presented with a painful left preauricular swelling of progressive appearance with a rubbery touch. He had no fever and the otoscopy was the same. The C-reactive protein was13.72 mg/dL with leukocytosis of 14.89×10/uL and neutrophilia of 10.14×10/uL (68.10%).\n\n【10】In the Computed Tomography (CT)， a 26 mm x 15 mm x 31 mm collection (AP x T x CC) was observed under the temporal muscle from the coalescing cells of the temporal squama and zygomatic process. In addition， at this level there was a solution of continuity with communication to the Middle Cranial Fossa (MCF) without intracranial involvement .\n\n【11】A left myringotomy was performed using general anesthesia obtaining scarce purulent material and a Transtympanic Ventilation Tube (TVT) was placed. The content between the squama and the temporal muscle was drained retroauricularly， a closed mastoidectomy was performed confirming the absence of purulent material and cleaning the coalescing cell with reconstruction of the bone defect towards MCF .\n\n【12】The culture result was Streptococcus pneumoniae. During the admission， 2 g of Cefotaxime was administered every 8 h， the patient evolved favorably. The control CT scan prior to discharge showed clear improvement without collections.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】The complications ofotit is have decreased with antibiotic therapy. They are classified as intracranial and extracranial or intratemporal. It is estimated that 0.45% of suppurative AOM's can develop extracranial complications . Within the extracranial， mastoiditis is the most frequent form and is the starting point for subperiosteal abscess， which consists of an abscess that affects the mastoid cortex and usually presents as a painful retroauricular swelling that detaches the outer ear forwards.\n\n【15】The zygomatic abscess and zygomatitis is a rare complication that occurs in pneumatized zygomas in which the infection progresses to thepreauricular region. They can be formedby direct extension， caused by bone erosion through the epithympanic cells of the temporal root， or by phlebitis. If the affectation progresses， the presenting symptoms may include trismus as a result of a temporal muscle myositis ， however， the clinical presentation can be confusing， as in our patient， simulating DEO without trismus and without affecting the general condition.\n\n【16】Its differential diagnosis must include Luc's temporozygomatic abscess described by Henri Luc in 1913 when studying cases of subperiosteal abscesses without mastoiditis； he suggested that an infection in the middle ear traveled through the Rivinus fissure and the branch of the deep auricular artery， affecting the cortex of the EAC and forming an abscess that obstructs the duct and ends up fistulizing the posterior wall of the EAC (Gelle's fistula) . His theory has been questioned； Fernandez et al.  affirm that in most cases Luc's abscess is related to mastoid occupation. Luc's abscess can be confused with abscessed otitis externa， but imaging tests clarify the diagnosis. In our case， the DEO image was clear， no fistula was found in the EAC and no purulent material was found in the mastoid. However， it did cause involvement of the preauricular region， fistulizing towards the temporal muscle and forming an abscess， for which it was diagnosed as a zygomatic abscess.\n\n【17】The diagnosis of these complications is usually delayed due to the latent onset of the symptoms，but it is necessary to insist on dubious presentations， in performing imaging tests such as CT， especially if we have low-dose CT. In the treatment， surgical drainage that includes mastoidectomy is necessary when CT suggests occupancy .\n\n【18】In conclusion， although temporal root abscesses are rare today， they need to be known as they represent a potentially important complication of AOM that can easily be confused with several clinical presentations，including external otitis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:49:04", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:49:16", "cost": 12.431}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:44", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:49:16", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:49:04"}

Liquid Biopsy for Detection of T790M Mutation in Patient with EGFR-Mutant Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer with Leptomeningeal Metastases.A Case Report. Ann Clin Case Rep. an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License， which permits unrestricted use， distribution， and reproductionin any medium， provided the original work Management of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) increasingly relies on the detection of molecular abnormalities whose presence trigger specific treatments that generally result in a better quality of life or prognosis than conventional chemotherapy. However， availability of tumor tissue for analysis maybelimited and a smallbiopsycannot reflecttumor heterogeneity . The application of liquid biopsy is increasingly common thus offering new possibilities to optimize patient care. Recently， the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) and the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) placed liquid biopsy as reference diagnostic method in a context of inaccessible tumor tissue . This situation can be encountered in the context of Leptomeningeal Metastases (LM)， occurring in 3% to 5% of advanced NSCLC patients and 9% to10% of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-mutant NSCLC patients . The Circulating Cell-Free DNA (cfDNA) from plasma or Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) may provide genetic material needed for the diagnosis and management of patients with LM progression . However， evidence is lacking about how to use it in practice and the operational characteristics of this test. The choice of body fluid to analyze in the context of LM involvement in EGFR-mutant NSCLC is unclear. The following clinical case illustrates this context.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 38-year-old Chinese female presented with a 2-month history of back pain. She had no family history of cancer and no smoking history. Suspicious metastatic bone lesions were highlighted on a dorsal spine radiography. The 18-Fluorodeoxyglucose PositronEmissionTomography-Computed Tomography (FDG PET-CT) demonstrated an FDG-avid hypermetabolic process within the left lower lobe associated with a left pleural effusion， disseminated pulmonary micronodules in both lungs， ipsilateral and contralateral mediastinal hilarlymphadenopathy and multifocal bone metastases. Gadolinium-enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple cortical supratentorial lesions without signs of LM. Cytological analysis of the left pleural effusion by thoracic puncture led to the diagnosis of stage IVb lung adenocarcinoma . Next-generation sequencing detected an EGFR exon 19 deletion  from the pleural effusion. Afatinib was started. During 14 months， the patient showed an excellent tumor response with a complete extra-cerebral metabolic response and a partial intracranial response. She tolerated rather well Afatinib with some skin rash， nausea and vomiting. After 14 months of therapy， neurological symptoms (headache， increased in vomiting and a few weeks later， visual disturbances) appeared with a significant deterioration of her general condition. Gadolinium-enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed florid LM. A FDG PET-CT confirmed the complete extra-cerebral response (bone， pleural and lung). The patient was started on Dexamethasone. Given the absence of an accessible lesion for biopsy，plasma and CSF were collected. CSF cytology was collected twice by lumbar puncture and showed a white blood cell count of 17 per mm'(lymphocytosis of 66%) the first time and 16 per mm'the second time (lymphocytosis of 63%)， respectively， but no malignant cells in both samples. There was a proteinorachia of0.42 G/L the first time and of 0.62 G/L the second time (normal values0.15 G/L to 0.45 G/L). A Droplet DigitalPCR(ddPCR) was performed both on plasma and CSF confirming the presence of an EGFR exon19 deletion and evidencing the T790M resistance mutation in exon20.Osimertinib was started. A rapid improvement in the clinical and neurological condition was observed in the next weeks. Few months later， a complete cerebral and extra-cerebral response was observed with a complete regression of LM based on Gadolinium-enhanced brain magnetic resonance and FDG PET-CT， respectively. She has a sustained intracranial response for 24 months now.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】We observed in NSCLC a rapid evolution in the identification of targetable genetic markers for new therapies over the last decade. The development of liquid biopsies performed from different body fluids could revolutionize the genetic and molecular analyses for targeted therapies in lung cancer in the future. Many recent studies found a good concordance in mutational status between blood cfDNA and DNA from tissue biopsies . Prabhash et al.  found 82.9%concordance between plasma and tissue testing. The sensitivity and specificity of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) were 68.4% and90.1% in plasma and tissue， respectively. Several other studies investigated the diagnostic accuracy of cfDNA in NSCLC patients who progressed on prior EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKI)， showing a very wide range of concordance rate with the tumor tissue analysis . Some studies suggested that liquid biopsy would be more representative in terms of mutational analysis than tissue biopsy because of the heterogeneity in the tumor or metastatic sites and the risk of limited tissue samples by the volume and quality. Liquid biopsy is a minimally invasive method associated with low morbidity and mortality， improving patient acceptability . It also offers economic benefits being cheaper and faster than tissue biopsy， thanks to a reduction in turnaround time Moreover， tumor tissue is not always accessible for biopsy， as it is the case with LM metastases. Aside from initial detection of an EGFR mutation， cfDNA analysis by ddPCR is also effective in detecting the T790M resistance mutation after first- or second-generation EGFR TKI therapy  with comparable accuracy to conventional histologic or cytological samples . A meta-analysis by Zhang et al identified 11 studies that provided diagnostic accuracy values of ddPCR for the detection of the EGFR T790M mutation in plasma cfDNA showing that it achieved a 70.1% sensitivity and 86.9%specificity . The study of Oxnard et al.  confirmed the high positive predictive value of the T790M mutation plasma genotyping by ddPCR in NSCLC with acquired resistance to EGFR TKI， in coherence with previous studies . In contrast， in the event of a negative result， its low negative predictive value cannot obviate the need for a standard tumor tissue biopsy . An increasing number of reports were interested in Central Nervous System (CNS) progression including LM in EGFR-mutant NSCLC after first- or second-generation EGFR TKI treatment given its steadily increasing incidence. Indeed， the survival of EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients is significantly prolonged  allowing more time for CNS metastases to develop， and the 15/2nd generation EGFRTKIhave poorpenetration across the blood-brain barrier which may allow the development of CNS metastases . LM involvement in lung cancer has a bad prognosis and is prone to clinically devastating complications .In the case of CNS progression without extracranial progressive disease， obtaining a tissue biopsy is extremely difficult and yet absolutely necessary for detecting a targetable resistance mutation . Moreover， it has been shown that， most likely due to the distinct brain microenvironment ， the genomic alterations found in CNS metastases may differ from the primary tumors . CSF cytology is currently the only minimally invasive method for molecular analysis of CNS progression. However， its analysis is only possible if neoplastic cells are present (which is not the case in this case report) and its sensitivity remains unknown despite multiple examinations. Several studies have demonstrated that cfDNA has been shown to be present in the CSF of patients with brain tumors In2020 a study of Chunhua Ma et al.  compared the molecular characteristics from CSF cfDNA with plasma cfDNA， plasma CTC(Circulating Tumor Cells)， and brain tissue specimens in patients with brain metastases from NSCLC. They found that assessment of CSF cfDNA could provide a snapshot of what actually occurs in brain metastases and found a higher mutation detection rate in patients with LM than in those with brain parenchymal metastases. De Mattos-Arruda et al.  had already shown in 2015 that CSF cfDNA is more abundant and representative of CNS tumor genomic alterations than plasma， with a significantly higher sensitivity than plasma， probably due to the blood-brain barrier. These results were also confirmed in the particular case of LM progression ， allowing to identify the presence of multiple resistance mechanisms emerging in the therapeutic course with TKI . Such phenomenon can be explained by the fact that tumoral cfDNA constitutes a very small fraction of cfDNA in plasma due to the presence of DNA released by normal cells. In CSF， significantly fewer normal cells are present， resulting in an increase in the percentage of tumoral cfDNA. The CSF cfDNA can also be used to monitor CNS progression as it follows the same trend as the variation in brain tumor burden . These findings mean that liquid biopsy may allow the diagnosis ofLM by mutation detection (as illustrated by this case report)， in addition to clinical and gadolinium-enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging. In our case， the T790M mutation was detected in the CSF cfDNA by ddPCR method， corresponding to what is described in the literature. Moreover， the T790M mutation was also detected in the plasma by the same technique. Previous reports demonstrated that EGFR T790M are more likely to occur at extracranial sites. These findings may suggest that taking two samples， CSF and plasma， may increase the chances of detecting the T790M mutation. Several studies have also shown that the use of repeated ddPCR-based cfDNA genotyping increased the sensitivity of resistance mutation detection. Although EGFR TKI are the standard first-line treatment for EGFR mutant lung cancer， the development of acquired resistance limits Progression-Free Survival (PFS) to 10 to 12 months for first-and second generations TKI . The acquisition of the T790M mutation in the EGFR gene is the most common resistance mechanism to 15l/2nd generation TKI， accounting for 50% to 60% of cases . The third generation T790M mutant-selective EGFR TKI Osimertinib showed an efficacy superior to that of standard EGFR TKI in the first-line treatment of EGFR-mutant advanced NSCLC in terms of PFS (17.2 vs. 8.5 months) in the FLAURA trial . Based on these results， the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines included Osimertinib as a first-line treatment option， particularly in patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer . Thus， this particular case will naturally concern fewer patients in near future. Nevertheless， it should be highlighted that EGFR T790M is not the only mechanism of resistance to 1y/2nd generation EGFR TKI. As the treatment duration increases，the likelihood ofthe development of several secondary resistance mechanisms to EGFR TKI also inicreases .Moreover，theoccurrence ofEpithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)phenotype is closely associated with the metastatic dissemination and treatment failure in lung cancer. Liquid biopsy may identify very early in the time the expression of EMT markers . The question of the best sample to analyze in case of LM progression will arise again in the future as new drugs devoted to the treatment of Osimertinib resistance mutations are developed. The performance of an NGS on a liquid biopsy will open the possibility to study the different mechanisms of resistance to TKI. In case of LM progression EGFR-mutant NSCLCunder TKI，the search for a resistance mutation using CSF cfDNA can be useful. Indeed， as Xi Wu et al. showed after analyzing the genetic profiling of cfDNA in CSF and plasma， the LM and extracranial lesions are thought to develop independently. To increase sensitivity repeating sampling of plasma and CSF cfDNA may be appropriate .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:51:24", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:51:56", "cost": 31.947}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:44", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:51:55", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:51:21"}

Patient was started on1g1Haloperidol starting with 5 mg and increasing up to 20 mg over 3 weeks. There was symptomatic improvement of his psychotic symptoms， but in the 3rd week patient presented with jaundice， poor appetite， and yellowish discoloration of urine. On liver function test elevated AST， ALT， GGT， ALP and bilirubin were noted. At this point， patient was on Tablet Haloperidol 15 mg and Tablet Trihexiphenidyl 2 mg. Patient had no diagnosis of chronic liver disease in the past， baseline LFT was within normal limit. In Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) is a means of assigning points for clinical， biochemical， serologic and radio-logic features of liver injury which gives an overall assessment score that reflects the likelihood of injury is due to a drug.\n\n【2】Keywords： Haloperidol； Hepatotoxicity； RUACAM\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI) is a common drug reaction that may lead to acute liver injury ranging in severity from mild， asymptomatic elevations in liver biochemistry to acute liver failure resulting in death or liver transplantation. Liver is the major organ responsible for concentrating and metabolizing a majority of medications， therefore， it is a prime target for medication-induced damage.\n\n【5】Many pharmacological agents can cause liver damage， including anesthetics， anticancer drugs， antibiotics， antituberculosis agents， antiretrovirals etc. In addition， a range oftraditional and herbal remedies may also be hepatotoxic. Depending on the duration of injury and the histological location of damage， Drug-Induced Liver Injury (DILI) is categorized as acute or chronic， and either as hepatitis， cholestatic， or a mixed pattern of injury .\n\n【6】We present here a case of hepatotoxicity associated with Haloperidol use. Haloperidol is a psychotropic drug of the butyrophenone family.\n\n【7】Haloperidol as a first-generation antipsychotic has the potential to cause the Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS)， which includes a group of movement disorders of dystonia， akathisia， tardive dyskinesia and Parkinsonism. Antipsychotic drug induced EPS is caused by the blockage of central dopamine Dreceptors.\n\n【8】Apart from such common side effects， antipsychotics are also known to cause asymptomatic alterations ofliver function. Liver injury of the hepatic (Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)， Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)， or Glutamate Dehydrogenase (GDH) elevations) or the Cholestatic(Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) and bilirubin elevations) type have both been described. Serious liver cell damage is well examined and described in Chlorpromazine treatment， occurring in approximately 1% of the patients.\n\n【9】Cholestatic icterus was described frequently (1% to 10%) with Chlorpromazine treatment and rarely with perphenazine， promazine， thioridazine， trifluoperazine， triflupromazine， and tiotixene treatment. The incidence is even lower under fluoridized phenothiazines such as fluphenazine or butyrophenones such as haloperidol. Here， cholestatic icterus may be accompanied by eosinophilia. Most authors agree that elevations of liver enzymes in neuroleptic treatment are a benign phenomenon， usually not requiring discontinuation of therapy. Therefore， further monitoring while continuing drug therapy is recommended if transaminases do not exceed a limit of 100 U/L .\n\n【10】Case Presentation\n\n【11】A 45-year-old male presented with psychotic symptoms with total duration of illness of 5years with poor compliance to medications. Upon admission， following diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia， patient was started initially on Olanzapine. Following adequate trial， with no improvement in symptoms Risperidone was tried but poor response to it too.\n\n| Table 1： Dose of medications with chronological liver function test values.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Time  | Bilirubin  | SGOT  | SGPT  | ALP  | GGT  | haloperidol  | THP  |\n| 8 weeks before Haloperidol started  | 0.3  | 30  | 45  | 84  | 19  |  |  |\n| 0  | 0.2  | 34  | 49  | 91  | 23  | 5mg  | 2mg  |\n| 3wks  | 6  | 1230  | 1221  | 147  | 162  | 20mg  | 2mg  |\n| 3 wks 2days  | 7.6  | 1076  | 1166  | 153  | 143  | Withdrawn  | Withdrawn  |\n| 5 weeks  | 9.6  | 71  | 231  | 112  | 72  | None  | None  |\n| 8 weeks  | 2.1  | 84  | 82  | 84  | 36  | Restart  |  |\n| 9 weeks  | 1.5  | 79  | 93  | 82  | 35  | 10mg  | 2mg  |\n| 10 weeks  | 2.2  | 94  | 106  | 97  | 36  | 10mg  | 2 mg  |\n| 11 weeks  | 2.3  | 94  | 113  | 99  | 39  | 15mg  | 2mg  |\n| Next day  |  |  |  |  |  | withdrawn  | withdrawn  |\n\n【13】Patient was started on Haloperidol starting with 5 mg and increasing up to 20 mg over a period of 3 weeks. There was symptomatic improvement of his psychotic symptoms， but in the third week patient presented with jaundice， poor appetite， and vellowish discoloration of urine. On liver function test elevated AST， ALT， GGT， ALP and bilirubin were noted. At this point， patient was on Tablet Haloperidol 15 mgand Tablet Trihexiphenidyl2 mg. Patient had no diagnosis of chronic liver disease in the past， baseline Liver Function Test (LFT) was within normal limit. All his medications withdrawn over next 3 weeks and his LFT returned to normal， but during this period his psychotic symptoms again aggravated and at times was unmanageable in the ward. Owing to his good response to Haloperidol and poor response to both Olanzapine and Riperidone， patient was again started on Tablet Haloperidol， starting with 5 mg and increasing up to 10 mg over 2 weeks.Over next 2 weeks his LFT was estimated weekly， towards end of 2n week， his hepatic enzymes again started to rise forcing to stop Haloperidol， subsequently he was started on Tablet Aripiprazole and currently he is doing better.\n\n【14】In Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) Roussel Udaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) is a means of assigning points for clinical， biochemical， serologic and radio-logic features of liver injury which gives an overall assessment score that reflects the likelihood that the hepatic injury is due to a specific medication. Introduced in 1993， RUCAM is now widely used in assessing causality of drug induced liver injury， both in the published literature and in support of regulatory decisions regarding medications implicated in causing hepatic injury . Applying RUCAM in our patient， total score came out to be 7， (0 or less indicate that the drug is “excluded”as a cause；1 to 2 that it is “unlikely； 3 to 5 “possible； 6 to 8 “probable； and greater than 8， “highly probable\") which suggests Haloperidol as the probable cause for deranged Liver function in our patient .\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Mr. A had presented with clinical jaundice three weeks after Haloperidol was started. Any neuropleptic including haloperdiol is known to cause asymptomatic alterations in liver function. Liver injury of the hepatic Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST)， Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT)， or Glutamate Dehydrogenase(GDH) elevations) or the cholestatic Alkaline Phosphatase (ALP) and bilirubin elevations) type have both been described. GLDH is present in the liver cell mitochondria， and its elevation in the blood is quite specific for liver cell damage. Serious liver cell damage is well examined and described in Chlorpromazine treatment， occurring in approximately 1% of the patients. Incidence of such hepatic damage is very low with antipsychotics like Haloperidol， although few case reports have been published. In most cases it has been suggested that such elevation of liver enzymes is a benign phenomenon so that discontinuation of antipsychotic is rarely required with careful monitoring until transaminases exceed level of 100 U/L.\n\n【17】Bjornsson ， put an effort to categorize medications based on their potentials to cause hepatic injury. This categorization is based on published case reports of individual drugs， with five categories(category A， 50； category B， 12-49； category C， 4-11； category D， 1-3； category E， none). Haloperidol comes under category B with 25 case reports till May， 2015 out of which there were no fatalities or in none of the cases re-challenge was done .\n\n【18】In a case reported by Fuller et al.  patient with diagnosis of schizophrenia had presented with symptoms of anorexia， nausea， vomiting， lethargy， fever and lower extremity rash 5 weeks after initiation of Haloperidol. His total bilirubin， 4.2 mgper 100 ml； SGOT100 IU per liter； and SGPT， 130 IU per liter. Following Haloperidol discontinuation，on examination a general red erythematous macular rash over the lower extremities and palms. On examination of the abdomen， mild right upper quadrant tenderness was noted， but no liver or splenic enlargement. On liver biopsy， pathological impression was that the changes represented a hypersensitivity reaction， predominantly cholestatic， but also hepatocellular. All symptoms resolved after few weeks and liver function test returned to normal.\n\n【19】In another case Fuller et al described a 27-year-old female presented with jaundice after four weeks of initiation of Haloperidol at a dose of 15 mg to 20 mg. After detailed evaluation drug Haloperidol induced intrahepatic cholestaisis was diagnosed. After four weeks of discontinuation of Haloperidol her liver function test returned to normal In another case Dincsoy and Saelinger had reported in a15-year-old male malaise， fever， jaundice， generalized pruritus， vague abdominal pain， dark urine after 4 weeks of initiation of Haloperidol. Combination of hepatic dysfunction with jaundice and eosinophilia developing 4 weeks after administration of haloperidol and benztropine mesylate in this patient was highly suggestive of a drug-induced hypersensitivity reaction .\n\n【20】In our case symptoms started after 3 weeks of initiation of Haloperidol which matches with the latent period described in previous case reports. Also， reduction in hepatic enzymes within 3weeks following discontinuation of Haloperidol is similar to previous case reports. Unique feature in our case is the upward trend of hepatic enzymes within one week following re-challenge， although continuation beyond that period is ethically unjustifiable， because of which re-challenge up-to previous dose and duration could not be achieved. Still， signs of positive re-challenge with objective evidence by RUCAM is sufficient to consider Haloperidol as the causative agent for deranged liver function test in our patient.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:54:32", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:55:14", "cost": 41.413}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:44", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:55:14", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:54:32"}

Depending on the patient reaction and the approach of breaking bad news， the diagnosis of cancer，especially ifit is an advanced stage， can lead to physical and psychiatric deterioration.\n\n【2】Case Report： We present a case of a fifty-five year old female diagnosed with advanced-stage adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon， the diagnosis results in a negative impact on the patients behavioral and psychiatric status.\n\n【3】Conclusion： Early referral to palliative care is the most suitable approach for a patient diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer； also， delivering bad news using a patient and family-centered approach is more reliable to minimize the negative psychiatric impact of unpleasant news\n\n【4】Keywords： Advanced cancer； Palliative care； Patient and family-centered approach\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Delivering bad news is one of the dreadful challenges to the physicians and can be a source of distress for the patient. Bad news can be defined as a cognitive， behavioral， or emotional deficit in the person receiving the news that persists for some time after the news is delivered. The delivery of bad news is a subjective topic， and it is difficult to anticipate a particular impact on each patient and their families because patients respond differently to bad news； studies showed that patients diagnosed with cancer could react to the bad news with shock， fright， tWacceptance，sadness， or not worried. Also， the language barrier can result in a misunderstanding and contribute to distress after delivering bad news. Physician training represents a crucial element of breaking bad news， and the lack of proper delivery can negatively impact the patient and their families and the subsequent treatment plans. Despite the enormous amount of information available about breaking bad news， many peer-reviewed published studies showed a lack of adequate training in communicating bad news to the patients and their families. The functional decline at the end of life is significantly different between patients diagnosed with cancer and other advanced organ diseases.Patients diagnosed with terminal stage cancer may experience various physical and psychiatric symptoms that can negatively affect their awareness about the progression of the disease and their prognosis. We reported a case diagnosed with advanced-stage colon cancer at the time of admission to the hospital， which results in a negative impact on patient behavior and perception.\n\n【7】Discussion.Ann Clin Case Rep.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】Fifty-five years old female presented to the emergency room at our hospital with fatigue and weakness. Her vital signs were within the normal limit. Fecal occult blood was positive； hemoglobin level was 6 mg/dl； other complete blood count parameters were normal. Carcinoembryonic antigen was elevated. Further workup revealed metastatic lesions in theliver andlung from adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid colon. Hematology/Oncology specialists were consulted and decided the patient will not benefit from curative therapy as her Karnofsky scale was 30 and advised for palliative care. A long discussion was conducted with the patient about her diagnosis and prognosis， and the patient decided to go for home hospice. The next day， the patient returned to the hospital because she had a mechanical fall not complicated by injury. The physical exam was normal， and her lab results were not changed compared to the previous results. The patient was admitted for observation. During her stay at the hospital， she inquired about the reason for her fall and asked if it could be related to the side effect of chemotherapy. The patient claimed that she received chemotherapy at our hospital. We had a lengthy discussion with her， and the treating physicians explained that she is not eligible for chemotherapy； however， the patient insisted that she got chemotherapy at our hospital， and she is due for the next cycle of chemotherapy. A psychiatric specialist was consulted and screened her for depression or hallucination， no need for psychiatric intervention as she is not experiencing any psychiatric issues， and her behavior probably due to the denial of her diagnosis. Unfortunately，\n\n【10】The patient died on the same day from cardiac arrest.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Advanced cancer patients commonly have misunderstandings about the intentions of treatment and their overall prognosis. Several studies have shown that large numbers of patients receiving palliative care hold unrealistic hopes of their cancer being cured by such therapies. This review aimed to explore the factors associated with patients developing unrealistic expectations； the implications of having unrealistic hopes and the effects of raising patients awareness about prognosis， and patients and caregivers perspectives on disclosure and their preferences for communication styles. This could be due to doctors reluctance to disclose terminal prognosis or using facts and logic to distance themselves from the patient，and the patient’s ability to process or accept such information . The major factors have profound effects on patients' comprehension of the presented information including Patients barriers and communication style . Barriers were classified into four subgroups： structural and physical (inadequate access to care and public transportation)， supportive (lack of support， resources and technology， and less access to healthcare)， or culture barriers(language differences， illness beliefs， and low levels of cancer care knowledge). The proper approach to communicating the information can clarify the patient's confusion about the diagnosis， treatment plan， or prognosis. The patient and family-centered approach are more reliable to communicate information about patient condition， in this approach， the physician focus on and respect the values and needs of the patient and their support system including cultural， spiritual， and religious belief， besides， inpatient and family-based approach， the patient is involved in the discussion about the goals of care， this is in contrasts with the emotional centered approach in which the physician focus on the sadness of the information by demonstrating excessive sympathy. Early palliative care improves patients quality of life，less end-of-life treatment，and decreased medical costs； also，early palliative care reduces depressive disorder and improves outcomes in a cancer patient. Early palliative care improves the quality of life of the patient's family and ameliorates end-of-life care aggressiveness. Palliative care， unlike hospice， can be used simultaneously with disease-modifying or curative therapies.

Although physicians often feel challenged by the need to deliver difficult prognostic information to patients， especially for those with a life-limiting illness， while at the same time support their hopes， the use of patient and their family-centered approach is more reliable to reduce the negative psychiatric impact of the unwanted news， as such approach is more aligned with patient's values and wishes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:22:09", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:23:16", "cost": 67.244}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:44", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:23:16", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:22:09"}

Other possible causative factors are bacterial and viral infections. Vaccination induced Stevens Johnson Syndrome is a rare occurrence. In this paper， we reported a case of Stevens Johnson Syndrome in a 62-year-old- male， 1 week after receiving 3 dose of COVID-19 vaccine. His initial 2 doses were an inactivated form of the COVID-19 virus given 6 months ago. His 3r dose was an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. This case demonstrates a rare dermatological complication using heterologous vaccines.\n\n【2】Keywords： Stevens johnson syndrome； COVID-19； Vaccinations； Heterologous\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) is a rare， acute and life-threatening mucocutaneous disease that is often drug-induced. It is a result of extensive keratinocyte cell death resulting in significant scalded skin appearance. Other rare causes include infections and immunizations. The average mortality rate of Stevens Johnson syndrome in elderly is 1% to 5% and those with very large epidermal detachment has 25% to 35% mortality rates . Stevens Johnson Syndrome is essentially diagnosed clinically. Constitutional symptoms such as fever， malaise， pain in swallowing and joint pains were recorded in the patient’s history. Skin manifestations usually present as erythematous purpuric macules which eventually coalesce forming large patches. Most of the time， cases will show oral manifestations described as painful crusts and erosions . In 2019， SARS-CoV-2 caused a pandemic. This led to the emergence of COVID-19 vaccines. Due to its novelty， little is known regarding its side effects. Since the start of vaccinations， many dermatological manifestations have been described. McMahon et.al defined subset of vaccine-related eruption following COVID-19vaccination . With the current recommendation of having a 3n dose， heterologous COVID-19vaccines have been granted emergency use to accelerate vaccine roll-out worldwide， especially in low and middle-income countries . However， the safety profile ofusing heterologous vaccination has not yet been well elucidated. In this case report， a serious dermatological adverse event after giving booster dose using heterologous vaccination will be discussed.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】Investigation\n\n【7】This is the case of 62-year-old Filipino male a known case of hypertension， diabetes mellitus with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease for years presented with 1 week history of fever and skin lesions. Per patient， he was apparently well until， 1 week after receiving his 3rd dose using mRNA-1273 (mRNA platform， Moderna) COVID-19 vaccine， he experienced multiple erythematous purpuric rashes mostly on the trunk accompanied by fever， pain on swallowing and malaise. He then sought consult with a private physician and was given topical corticosteroids， anti-pyretic and anti-histamines. Only slight relief of symptoms was noted. After 3 days， his skin lesions became more generalized and his eyes were now affected. He went to the emergency room and subsequent admission was advised.\n\n【8】Diagnosis\n\n【9】Onphysical examination he looked unwell. His vital signs were within normal limits. Cutaneous examination showed generalized brown to hyperpigmented purpuric macules with surrounding erythema with few areas showing bullae， accompanied by tenderness. Mucosal involvement was present in the form of hemorrhagic crusts over thelips， erythema of the buccal mucosa， redness and discharge from the eyes . Patient was also complaining of difficulty of swallowing due to pain around the oral mucosa but no erosions noted. Stevens Johnson Syndrome was suspected. Detailed drug history was elicited which revealed that for the past 2 years patient had been taking ace inhibitor for his hypertension， sitagliptin for his diabetes and salmeterol fluticasone puff for his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Since taking all these medications， there were no side effects noticed. No other recent medications taken that can contribute to the development of skin rashes. He did not report any allergies to medication and food. He denied smoking and drinking alcoholic beverage drink. His initial 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccine were completed 6 months ago， using inactivated whole-virus vaccine (Sinovac). During this time， no adverse event observed. In this case， the diagnosis of Stevens Johnson Syndrome from 3 dose of COVID-19 vaccine was made based on the timeline， disease course and morphology of the cutaneous findings described as sudden appearance of generalized erythematous purpuric macules coalesced into sheets of necrosed skin with mucosal lesions and constitutional symptoms.\n\n【10】Table 1： Laboratory work ups were requested which include CBC， BUN， creatinine，liver enzymes， electrolytes， HBA1c.\n\n【11】Table 2： Laboratory work ups were requested which include CBC， BUN， creatinine， liver enzymes， electrolytes， HBA1c.\n\n| Test  | Result  | Range  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| BUN  | 83.76(H)  | 17.00 mg/dL  |\n| Creatinine  | 2.25(H)  | 0.30 mg/dL  |\n| SGPT  | 373.5(H)  | 5.00 U/L  |\n| SGOT  | 198.1(H)  | 5.00 U/L  |\n| Sodium  | 128.2(L)  | 135.00 mEg/L  |\n| Potassium  | 4.27  | 3.50mEg/L  |\n| Chlorine  | 101.5  | 97.00 mEg/L  |\n| HBA1c  | 4.5%  | 4.0%  |\n\n|  | Results  | Normal Values  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Hemoglobin  | 109.0(L)  | 120.00 g/L  |\n| Hematocrit  | 0.33  | 0.47  |\n| RBC  | 3.77  | 4.10x1012L  |\n| WBC  | 9.3  | 5.00x10%/L  |\n| Neutrophils  | 0.85  | 0.65  |\n| Lymphocytes  | 0.09  | 0.35  |\n| Monocytes  | 0.06  | 0.05  |\n| Platelet count  | 205  | 150.00x109L  |\n| MCV  | 87.5  | 80.00 fL  |\n| MCH  | 29.5  | 27.00 pg  |\n| MCHC  | 337.0  | 290.00 g/dL  |\n\n【14】Treatment and outcome\n\n【15】On admission， he was placed in an isolated room to avoid infection. Laboratory work ups were requested which include CBC，\n\n【16】BUN， creatinine， liver enzymes， electrolytes， HBA1c . He had elevated creatinine and liver enzymes on admission. Serial monitoring was done during his stay in the hospital. Referral to Dermatology and Ophthalmology were immediately placed. He was started on Hydrocortisone 100 mg/IV every 8 h for 5 days and Diphenhydramine/IV. Topical skin care was plain petroleum jelly. Application was instructed to be in a sterile environment. Mouthwash composed of mixed 120 mL Aluminum hydroxide and Magnesium hydroxide， 120 mL diphenhydramine solution， 2% lidocaine solution and 20 mL distilled water was instructed to be gargled three times a day to relieve the pain in the oral mucosa. Ophthalmology immediately treated him with fusidic acid ophthalmic solution and preservative-free hydrating eye drops. Contact precaution was strictly followed. After 5 days， his lesions started to regress as well as his constitutional symptoms. Hydrocortisone/IV was discontinued. Complete resolution of skin lesion was noted after 24 days and his laboratory parameters improved. He was discharged well.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】Stevens Johnson Syndrome is a rare， severe and potentially fatal delayed-type-four-hypersensitivityyrreaction. Medications are by far the most common trigger of this condition. In very rare instances， Stevens Johnson Syndrome could be caused by vaccination. Incidence is 1.2 to 6.0 per million person-years for Stevens Johns Syndrome and 0.4 to 1.2 per million person-years for Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis . Diagnosis is essentially clinical. It presents with a prodrome usually recorded as sore throat， fever， malaise and arthralgia proceeded by cutaneous manifestations. Morphology of the skin lesions can initially start as erythematous， dusky red or purpuric macules and have tendency to coalesce. Ninety-percent of the time， erosions of the buccal， ocular and genital mucosa are present. In this case report， our patient experienced mucocutan manifestations with fever which clinically fits Stevens Johnson Syndrome 1 week after initiation of 3 dose of COVID-19 vaccine using mRNA-1273. Per patient， he was able to tolerate his first 2 doses6 months ago， using inactivated whole virus COVID-19 vaccine. This posts a question for a possible serious adverse effect of having heterologous COVID-19 vaccination. Stevens Johnson syndrome is extremely rare with vaccination. There were few reported cases in the literature and some of the vaccination mentioned to cause Stevens Johnson Syndrome were combined measles， mumps， rubella vaccine and influenza vaccine. Lately there were also cases noted after giving COVID-19 vaccine . COVID-19 vaccines are newly developed vaccines， which were proven to be effective in preventing severe infection. It has two components： Virotropes and excipients. Both can cause severe drug reactions . Different platforms have been used to produce COVID-19 vaccines， and these include nucleic acid(DNA and RNA)， viral vector， and protein subunit and whole-virus platforms. These have been widely administered， but challenges have arisen， including vaccine supply shortages， rare adverse events and waning vaccine immunity. Heterologous prime-boost vaccination refers to a scheme in which the booster vaccination and prime vaccination utilize different platforms . Due to large demands， supply became inadequate. Heterologous prime-boost vaccinations were proposed to respond in these challenges most especially in low to middle income countries. However， the immunogenicity and reactogenicity remain largely unclear. To date there are no published data examining the safety of having heterologous COVID-19vaccines. Although， some reports mentioned that heterologous boost appeared to have increased reactogenicity .\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】There are multiple COVID-19 vaccines that have been approved for emergency use to accelerate vaccine roll-out. Heterologous prime-booster has been implemented most especially in low to middle income countries. However， this should be further studied and investigated with regards to its safety. This case adds to the evidence of a possible rare severe dermatological side effect of having heterologous vaccination.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:14:04", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:16:15", "cost": 130.973}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:44", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:16:15", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:04"}

There are many complications in tooth extraction especially Inferior Alveolar Nerve (IAN) injury and Iatrogenic Fracture of Mandible (IFM).

So it is important to protect the INA and molar.\n\n【2】Case Presentation： A 22-year-old man was referred to the Department of Implantology， Stomatology Center， and Central South University Xiangya School of Medicine Affiliated Haikou Hospital with a chief complaint of the molar miss in the right side.

To extract deeply impacted wisdom tooth is one of the highest risks and it is easy to cause postoperative complications. It is highly demand for dentist to prevent these risks.\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\n【10】A 22-year-old man was referred to the Department of Implantology， Stomatology Center， and Central South University Xiangya School of Medicine Affiliated Haikou Hospital with a chief complaint of the molar miss in the right side. Intraoral examination revealed absence of right mandibular third molar， mesial impaction of right mandibular second molar with mesial II° caries. CBCT revealed that the tooth was found in the apex of first molar and near inferior alveolar nerve canal . The patient was admitted for surgery under Local Anesthesia (LA) after thorough physical examination and routine blood investigations. Prior to the surgery a duly signed written informed consent was obtained from the patient. A full thickness mucoperiosteal flap was reflected. The posterior part of the buccal wall of the #47 tooth was breached by rosette round bur over teeth #47 and #48， the lateral wall was also resected till the posterolateral wall was approached， guttering of the bone was done around the tooth， distal retractor was used and the #47 tooth was retrieved along with the help of a curette. The #48 tooth was found in the apex of first molar and near Inferior alveolar nerve canal， the vertical and buccal bone of the #48 tooth was to be removed with piezosurgery carefully， the #48 tooth was discovered， then it was split in the neck， but cementum of the #48 tooth close to the IAN was retained， remove the root of it， crown was divided into two pieces then extracted from beneath the #46 tooth， the socket was filled with Bio-OSS and PRF， the wound was sutured . Post-operative recovery was uneventful； the patient was prescribed analgesics and antibiotics. He was followed up for three months and found to have no complaint.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Tooth extraction is a very common procedure in oral surgery. The complications include Inferior Alveolar Nerve (IAN) injury， hemorrhage， surgical site infection  pain， dental fracture， the displacement of teeth or fragments， iatrogenic damage or luxation of the second molar ， soft tissue damage， subcutaneous emphysema， trismus， swelling， and iatrogenic mandibular fracture. How to prevent these problems above all?\n\n【13】The incidence ofIAN injury reported in the literature ranges from1.3% to 5.3% which depend mainly on the position of the impacted tooth in relation to the inferior alveolar canal before surgery. If there is close proximity between the IAN and the roots， the incidence may be as high as 19% and may be temporary or permanent injury， therefore proper presurgical planning is required to reduce the risk of injury to the IAN . The minimally invasive extraction operation， originally described in the late 1900s， is an approach to the anterior wall of the maxillary sinus by making a full thickness flap， but in the present case we had to modify this approach as the tooth was located posteriorly in inferior alveolar nerve canal， Minimally invasive extraction  of mandibular impacted wisdom tooth is better than traditional method. So a vestibular incision was given starting from tooth #46 till distally to tooth #48. The use of a surgical navigation system  together with an interocclusal splint enabled the retrieval of a close proximity to the mandibular canal impacted wisdom tooth in a safe and minimally invasive manner without damaging the surrounding vital structures. Removal of deeply impacted tooth using the described techniques is safe with regard to mandibular nerve injury and neurologic damage .\n\n【14】Iatrogenic Fracture of Mandible (IFM) related to the removal of teeth is a rare complication . Subcutaneous emphysema is not very common . The use of piezosurgery can accurately remove the bone wall； effectively preserve the thickness of the mandible， thereby reducing iatrogenic fractures. And because the piezosurgery does not require high pressure gas as a driving force， it can also prevent the occurrence of emphysema. The antibiotic administration showed a decrease in pain suffered by patients but a higher incidence of gastro- intestinal side effects. Chlorhexidine gel (CHX) is superior to a placebo in reducing the incidence ofalveolar osteitis after mandibular third molar extraction. There were no significant differences in soft tissue closure at any time point and provide any additional benefit to enhance the soft tissue closure of extraction sockets .\n\n【15】In this case， the position of the Mandibular Canal (MC) in CBCT is close to the #48 tooth and absence of cortical bone between the root of the #48 tooth and MC； and the minimum distance between the MC and the third molar is 0 mm， the actual distance was <0.5 mm. The crown ofthe #48 tooth is proximity connects to the distal apex of first molar， the #47 tooth is upon it and there are caries in the mesio-crown. Under the guidance of CBCT， the resistance of bone tissue and adjacent tooth was removed with piezosurgery carefully， #47 and#48 were removed by precise surgical procedure. It is safe to extract teeth without any complications.\n\n【16】Conclusion\n\n【17】With the development of high resolution imaging technology， we can clearly understand relationship between the impacted tooth and the surrounding tissue， the blindness of extraction can be reduced because of CBCT accurate guidance. The impacted wisdom teeth were removed safely by precise surgical procedure.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:13:19", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:13:31", "cost": 11.366}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:44", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:13:30", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:13:18"}

PET imaging with BGa-PSMA ligands has been recently introduced in the imaging algorithm of patients with prostate cancer . The spleen is a PSMA-expressing organ showing physiologic uptake of the tracer . We report a case of post splenecomy abdominal splenosis as a potential cause for pitfall on 6BGa-PSMA PET/CT by abdominal metastatic spread.99mTc-dRBCs SPECT/CT study has been used for re-assuring the diagnosis of splenosis. We also review other unexpected settings of benign PSMA expressing tissue as potential pitfalls on 6Ga-PSMA PET/CT interpretation.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 69-years-old male patient with a newly-diagnosed Gleason 9(5+4) prostate adenocarcinoma， was referred for staging with Ga-PSMA PET/CT. Serum level ofPSA was 1.68 ng/ml. Eight months earlier the patient underwent Transurethral Resection ofthe Prostate (TURP) due to Benign prostatic hyperplasia. PET/CT was acquired following administration of 156 MBq (4.2 mCi) 6Ga-PSMA. In addition to uptake at the primary tumor site at the prostate gland， multiple foci of increased tracer uptake SUV of 4.15± 1.15 was detected corresponding to multiple soft tissue masses ranging in厂size between 8.0 mm to 40.0 mm at the left abdomen subdiaphragmatically， at the anterior abdomen adjacent to the abdominal wall and on the transverse colon serosa .\n\n【9】Absence of normal spleen on CT has raised the suspicion of post splenectomy splenosis. Patient's history revision has revealed a post-traumatic splenectomy two decades earlier. A subsequent 99mTc-dRBCs scan， planar and SPECT/CT was performed using a hybrid SPECT/CT camera (Optima 640， GE Healthcare).\n\n【10】There was a full matching betweenmTc-dRBCs and Ga-PSMA uptake in the abdominal lesions confirming that the lesions seen on PET/CT represented physiologic uptake in splenosis and not metastatic spread .\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】There is accumulating clinical data showing a high diagnostic accuracy of the novel 6Ga-PSMA PET/CT technique for staging of patients with newly diagnosed intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer. Diagnostic accuracy of the study interpretation is based on familiarity with potential pitfalls caused by unexpected sites of physiologic uptake or uptake with non-tumoral lesions. Several previous publications presented cases of increased 5BGa-PSMA uptake in benign lesions including adrenal adenomas， paravertebral schwannoma， Paget’s bone disease， splenic sarcoidosis， follicular thyroid adenoma， meningioma， serous cystadenoma of the pancreas， Pseudoangiomatous Stromal Hyperplasia (PASH) of the breast， liver hemangioma， subacute stroke and newly formed blood vessels， tuberculosis and Healing nonmalignant fracture . Celiac lymph nodes were reported to show physiologic uptake and so were PSMA-expressing organs such as spleen . Therefore as shown in the current presented patient， ectopically located splenic tissue may lead a false-positive misinterpretation of PET/CT confusing ectopic sites of normal splenic tissue with physiologic tracer uptake and metastatic spread. Ectopic splenic tissue is manifested in two distinct forms， accessory spleens and splenosis. Accessory spleens are congenital ， while splenosis may be found following trauma in 26% to 65% of cases and following elective splenectomy for hematologic disorders in 16% to 20% . Splenosis detection is usually incidental， and no therapy is indicated when asymptomatic. It can be found with any shape and size， usually with no expression of typical architecture such as hilum or defined capsule . Splenosis is of clinical significance in the case of bleeding， local compression on adjacent structures and when misdiagnosed as tumor . 99mTc-dRBCs imaging is a highly specific since the tracer is taken almost exclusively by splenic tissue . It is a sensitive imaging technique given the high contrast between splenules and surrounding tissues. Performing the scan using a hybrid SPECT/CT camera allows both， diagnosing the tissue of the lesion in question as composed of splenic tissue and locating the ectopic splenic tissue in the abdomen . In the presented case SPECT/CT and PET/CT could be correlated for each suspected lesion.\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】Abdominal sites of BGa-PSMA uptake may be detected in case of splenosis. These lesions may be misinterpreted as metastatic abdominal spread in patients with prostate adenocarcinoma.

Cardiovascular diseases that are associated with primary adrenal insufficiency include hypotension， arrhythmias， and heart failure. Heart block and symptomatic bradycardia，however， have not been reported to be associated with adrenal insufficiency. Herein， we are presenting a case of symptomatic heart block associated with primary adrenal insufficiency that resolved after the initiation of steroid treatment.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Primary adrenal insufficiency is a condition in which there is a decreased production of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid hormones from the adrenal cortex . Autoimmune adrenalitis is the major cause of primary adrenal insufficiency (90%) with other causes (10%) consisting of genetic， drug induced， and infectious etiologies . Common manifestations include electrolyte abnormalities such as hyponatremia， hyperkalemia， and skin hyperpigmentation. Cardiovascular manifestations of primary adrenal insufficiency include hypotension， arrhythmias， and heart failure . We present a case of symptomatic heart block that manifested via multiple falls that resolved completely after starting steroid treatment.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】Our patient is a 71-year-old African-American male with a past medical history significant for systemic lupus erythematosus maintained on chronic steroids， hypertension， and a history of alcohol abuse who presented to our hospital with the complaint of falling over the last several days. The patient denied having headaches， weakness， numbness， visual changes， dizziness， vertigo， hearing difficulties， chest pain， shortness of breath， fevers， chills， or loss consciousness. Upon arrival， his heart rate was 45 bpm， his blood pressure was 90/50 mmHg， and his temperature was 97.8°F orally. On exam， the patient was lethargic， following commands， awake， alert， oriented to place， person， and time. His pupils were equal，round，and reactive to light with intact extraocular muscles， moist oral mucosa， and had a supple neck. There was no neck lymphedema， no conjunctival pallor， and no scleral icterus noted. The patient had normal heart sounds with no murmurs， rubs， or gallops appreciated. His lungs were clear to auscultation with good air entry bilaterally. No skin rashes or bruises were seen. His abdomen was soft， non-tender， non-distended， and no organomegaly or masses were felt on exam. Bowel sounds were auscultated over all four quadrants. No joint swelling， erythema， or tenderness was noted. The patient had 2+ radial and dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally with no edema， clubbing， or cyanosis seen. He had no apparent neurology deficits. His initial blood work demonstrated the following： Sodium 137 mmol/l， potassium 3.2 mmol/l， chloride 109 mmol/l， bicarbonate 22 mmol/l， anion gap 6， glucose 113 mg/dl， BUN 19 mg/dl， creatinine 1.33 mg/dl，TSH2.4 U/ml， albumin 2.1 g/dl， total bilirubin 0.4 mg/dl， alkaline phosphatase 137 IU/l， AST 124 IU/l， ALT 51 IU/l， initial lactic acid 4.2 mmol/l， repeat lactic acid 2.2 mmol/l and 1.6 mmol/l， WBC count5.3 K/ul， hemoglobin 11.6 gm/dl， hematocrit 35%， platelet count is 162 K/ul， urine analysis was negative for nitrites， trace leukocytes，3 to 5 WBC. The patient was given 2 L IV 0.9 normal saline， sepsis protocols which consisted of one dose ofimipenem， gentamicin， and vancomycin，and a stress dose of steroids. The patient then underwent CAT scan of the head without contrast which was negative for any acute pathologies including bleed or ischemia. Chest X-ray was negative for any infiltrates or pleural effusions. CAT scan of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast demonstrated a small left pleural effusion， mild abdominal ascites， distension of the gallbladder with possible sludge， and thickening ofthe descending and sigmoid colon with possible colitis. Follow up gallbladder ultrasound showed evidence of acalculous cholecystitis. Initial electrocardiogram(EKG) showed junctional bradycardia with a heart rate of 44 bpm.\n\n【6】Subsequently， the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and was started on a dopamine drip as his blood pressure was unresponsive to fluid resuscitation efforts. His repeat blood pressure measured 85/50 mmHg after 2 L IV 0.9 normal saline fluid administrations. All blood cultures were negative， Influenza A and B were negative， Legionella and Strep pneumococcal antigens in the urine were negative. Staph nasal screen by PCR was positive for MSSA and negative for MRSA. Two days later， the patient was vitally stable and was transferred to the hospital's general medical floors. He was kept on broad spectrum antibiotics including vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactam IV. The patient then left against medical advice while on the general medical floors. Several dayslater，thepatient was found unresponsive by his family at home and was transferred emergently to our hospital for cardiac arrest. He was found to have pulse less electrical activity and Return of Spontaneous Circulation(ROSC) was attained two minutes after the patient was coded. Post cardiac arrest EKG showed junctional bradycardia with a heart rate of 26 bpm . The patient was subsequently intubated， given 2L 0.9 normal saline IV， and a stress dose of steroids. He was evaluated by cardiology with no need for emergent transvenous pacing as his heart rate improved to 50 bpm with a blood pressure of 90/60 mmHg. The patient was again transferred to the ICU.\n\n【7】His blood cultures were negative and he remained afebrile throughout his hospital stay. He was maintained on broad spectrum antibiotics including IV vancomycin and piperacillin/tazobactamⅣV. Additionally， diagnostic cardiac catheterization was done， and it showed no evidence of coronary artery disease. Sinus Node dysfunction was excludedby electrophysiological study.The patient was deemed to have primary adrenal insufficiency based on cosyntropin testing and was started on maintenance dose steroids His blood pressure was 130 to 150 mmHg/60-80 mmHg with a heart rate of 60 bpm-100bpm. He was extubated a few days later. His repeat EKG demonstrated sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 110 bpm and first degree heart block . The patient was discharged home several days later on maintenance steroids.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Primary adrenal insufficiency is a condition concerning the decreased production of glucocorticoid and1mineralocorticoid hormones from the adrenal cortex . More than 90% of cases are due to autoimmune adrenalitis with other causes including infectious， drug induced， or genetic factors . Cardiovascular manifestations of primary adrenal insufficiency include arrhythmias， congestive heart failure， and rarely ischemic heart disease . Previous reports describe the development of Torsade de Pointes with hypopituitarism and complete resolution after treatment with steroid and thyroid hormones . Similarly， cardiac arrhythmias can be related to electrolytes abnormalities associated with adrenal insufficiency . A temporary heart block associated with adrenal insufficiency has not been reported in prior literature. In our case， the patient has no history of heart block and has no history of medication use that impacts the cardiac conduction system. He was exhibiting symptoms consistent with symptomatic bradycardia via his multiple falls prior to admission. His heart rate was initially20 bpm to 40 bpm and his EKG showed evidence of junctional bradycardia. After starting maintenance steroid therapy， the patient became asymptomatic with complete resolution of his symptomatic bradycardia. Previously published cases report the association between primary adrenal insufficiency and dilated cardiomyopathy. Our patient's echocardiography showed no structural heart disease with normal systolic left ventricular function. The mechanism behind cardiac conduction abnormalities in adrenal insufficiency is not well understood to date. The mainstay of adrenal insufficiency treatment is with both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. For patients with concomitant decompensated acute heart failure， the use of fludrocortisone needs to be used with caution as it will exacerbate acute heart failure by retaining sodium and thereby increasing cardiac after load . In summary， this case elucidates the increased cardiovascular risk in patients with adrenal insufficiency. Patients should be educated with regards to the clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency for earlier diagnosis and management. Regular follow up with a cardiologist is recommended for earlier detection of cardiovascular diseases associated with adrenal insufficiency", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:16:36", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:18:42", "cost": 125.786}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:44", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:18:42", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:16:36"}

It is classically taken for two days while awaiting antibiotic effect. It is available without a prescription in the United States under the trade names： Azo Urinary Pain Relief， Uricalm， and Uristat. Common adverse reactions include urine discoloration， rash， pruritus， nausea， dyspepsia， and headache. Phenazopyridine has been reported to cause methemoglobinemia in overdose， though rarely with therapeutic doses.\n\n【2】Case Report： We report a case of an 82-year-old woman who had been taking phenazopyridine at a therapeuticdose for three months whenshepresented toemergencydepartmentwithhypoxia.Arterial bloodgasrevealeda methemoglobinemialevelof15%.Patient'shypoxia corrected withadministration of methylene blue. Why should an emergency physician be aware of this?： Phenazopyridine toxicity， most commonly reported with acute overdose， can lead to methemoglobinemia by converting the iron molecule in hemoglobin to methemoglobin. Administration of methylene blue is typically curative. This case highlights the importance of considering methemoglobinemia in patients who present with hypoxia while taking phenazopyridine.\n\n【3】Keywords： Methemoglobinemia； Phenazopyridine； Hypoxia； Methylene blue\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Methemoglobinemia refers to a disorder characterized by abnormal levels of methemoglobin in the blood resulting from the oxidation of iron in hemoglobin from the ferrous (Fe’) to ferric (Fe’) form. The oxidized ferric group has an impaired ability to bind oxygen； in addition， oxygen affinity for any remaining ferrous hemoglobin is increased， thereby shifting the oxygen dissociation curve to the left. As a result， oxygen cannot be appropriately released， leading to tissue hypoxia .\n\n【6】While there are several congenital causes， methemoglobinemia is most commonly caused by medications that contain oxidizing chemicals such as nitrites， nitroglycerin， nitroprusside， trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole， inhaled nitrous oxide， and aniline derivatives .\n\n【7】Phenazopyridine has been described in the literature as an agent causing methemoglobinemia， hemolytic anemia and renal failure in the adult and pediatric overdose situation ， and in the therapeutic usage in patients with renal impairment . Few case reports describe the development of methemoglobinemia at therapeutic doses in patients with normal renal function ，though no similar cases have been reported in the emergency medicine literature.\n\n【8】Since phenazopyridine is available without a prescription， it is essential that emergency physicians appropriately recognize the adverse reaction of methemoglobinemia in patients taking urinary anesthetics. A case of an 82-year-old woman with a methemoglobinemia level of 15% from prolonged use of phenazopyridine is reported.\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\n【10】An 82-year-old woman presented to the emergency department by ambulance for hypoxia. Patient had no known pre-existing cardiac or pulmonary conditions. During routine vitals assessment at her assisted living facility， the patient's pulse oximeter was noted to be 83%. She received albuterol without improvement in the pulse oximeter reading， and transferred to the emergency department for further evaluation. Paramedics put the patient on 15 liters of oxygen via a non-rebreather for transport.\n\n【11】On arrival to emergency department， the patient denied chest pain or shortness of breath. Past medical history was significant for multiple sclerosis and deep vein thrombosis； patient also had a chronic indwelling Foley catheter. Medications included warfarin4.5mg once a day， baclofen 10mg as needed and phenazopyridine200mg three times a day. Patient began taking phenazopyridine three months prior to presentation for urinary irritation secondary to the indwelling Foley catheter.\n\n【12】On general examination， the patient was well appearing. The vital signs were： temperature 36.7’C， blood pressure 146/62 mmHg， pulse77bpm， respiratory rate 18/min， and oxygen saturation of92% on 15L oxygen via a non-rebreather. The patient appeared mildly cyanotic. Cardiovascular and pulmonary examinations are unremarkable. The urinary catheter was in place with orange colored urine in the bag. The remainder of the physical examination was unremarkable.\n\n【13】Arterial blood gas with co-oximeter was obtained with the following results： pH 7.44， pCO， 44， pO， 461， HCO， 28， O， sat 98， Carbon monoxide 3.1，O.content arterial 10，OxyHemoglobin 80.8%， Methemoglobin 14.9 %on15L oxygen via non-rebreather.\n\n【14】On further laboratory testing， electrolytes and kidney function were unremarkable， as were the troponin and B-type natriuretic peptide. Complete blood count results were WBC 8.4 with normal differential， Hemoglobin 8.5， Hematocrit 27.9， MCV 99， MCH 30.4， MCHC 30.5，RDW 18.7，and Platelet 269.The INR was 2.2.\n\n【15】The patient received IV methylene blue 1mg/kg for a total dose of 80mg and within minutes her pulse oximeter improved to 98% on room air. The patient was observed in the hospital for 24 hours and had no further episodes of hypoxia. She was then discharged back to her assisted living facility.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】Phenazopyridine is utilized for its local anesthetic properties in patients suffering from urinary tract infection，though its use should be limited to 48 hours and discontinued after appropriate antibiotics have lessened symptoms. In the case presented， a patient developed toxicity from a therapeutic dose of phenazopyridine for a prolonged duration.\n\n【18】Methemoglobinemia can develop from medications that lead to the oxidation of the iron molecule in hemoglobin. In healthy individuals， a reducing enzyme cascade converts methemoglobin back to hemoglobin. In the case of phenazopyridine toxicity， the reduction cascade is overwhelmed，leading to the accumulation of methemoglobin .\n\n【19】Patients with methemoglobinemia can present with hypoxia or cyanosis， though the PaO2 on arterial blood gas is normal. Patients may be asymptomatic at low levels， but may experience fatigue， headache， dizziness， tachycardia， weakness， dyspnea， bradycardia， seizures，coma，and death at progressively higher levels . Treatment is determined by associated symptoms and may range from discontinuing the offending medication in a minimally symptomatic patient with a low methemoglobin level to administration of intravenous methylene blue at a dose of 1-2mg/kg over 5 minutes with a repeated dose in 1 hour if the level remains high. If a patient presents in shock， then blood transfusion or exchange transfusion may be initiated. Additional therapies have included hyperbaric oxygen administration with anecdotal success  and N-acetyl cysteine， though a randomized controlled trial demonstrated no reduction in methemoglobin levels .\n\n【20】In the case described above， the patient was on prolonged use of phenazopyridine and presented with hypoxia on pulse oximeter but a normal oxygen level on ABG； the methemoglobin level was 15% on co-oximeter. This patient received intravenous methylene blue and achieved normalization of the level within minutes.\n\n【21】Conclusion\n\n【22】The diagnosis of methemoglobinemiailsSatime-sensitive emergency. As therapeutic use of over-the-counter phenazopyridine may result in methemoglobinemia， emergency physicians must consider this adverse reaction in patients who present with cyanosis or hypoxia.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:38:18", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:38:32", "cost": 13.98}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:44", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:38:31", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:38:17"}

The differential diagnosis is broad and includes infection， structural abnormalities， arrhythmias， cardiomyopathies， toxidromes， and high output state. This case report highlights the importance of considering toxic ingestion when evaluating severe pediatric heart failure. This patient presented as a transfer to our institution for consideration of Extracorporeal Life Support (ECLS) initiation in the presence of poor ejection fraction and hypotension refractory to pressor management. Initial labs were significant for elevated cardiac markers and leukocytosis with decreased left ventricular systolic cardiac fuinction demonstrated on echocardiogram. Prior to ECMO initiation， the patient's blood pressures improved and she self-extubated on hospital day two. After stabilization， further medical history was elicited from the patient and her family and she was noted to be taking guanfacine and dextroamphetamine-amphetamine at home. Consultation with Poison Control confirmed the suspicion that the association of patient's presenting vital sign and mental status abnormalities could be secondary to co-ingestion of the patient's home medications； further history revealed an intentional overdose of guanfacine and dextroamphetamine-amphetamine. The patient recovered on the pediatric floor after supportive management and was then transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility for further care. She was discharged in good condition after 15 days with outpatient cardiology follow up. This patient's case reveals the importance of including toxidromes in the differential for pediatric heart failure and highlights how co-ingestions maylead to a misleading initial clinical picture.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Heart failure is a relatively uncommon occurrence in the pediatric population that requires careful attention to detail， evaluation， and management. When determining the etiology of a pediatric patient’s heart failure， the differential is broad and includes congenital heart disease， cardiomyopathies， arrhythmias， ischemia， infection， and high output state . Initial evaluation should include electrocardiogram， echocardiogram， chest radiography， and basic lab work including cardiac enzymes and markers . While cardiac injury is often a result of infection， it is important to consider other inciting causes in cases in which the case progression does not follow a traditional course， regardless of presumed likelihood. As such， cardiac failure secondary to toxic ingestion should always be considered. Evaluation for ingestion includes thorough past medical history， detailed inquiry regarding access to medications， urine drug screen， and serum ingestion labs. Common toxic ingestions that lead to cardiomyopathy include chemotherapeutic medications， alcohol， cocaine，anti-retroviral agents， carbon monoxide， amphetamines， and heavy metal exposure . The consideration of this etiology is often compounded by the fact that accurate diagnosis of this condition relies on the accuracy and cooperation of the patient. This case highlights a mixed ingestion leading to cardiac failure in a pediatric patient and the importance ofan accurate and thorough history.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】The patient in this case is an 11-year-old female with history of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) controlledwithguanfacine and.extended release dextroamphetamine-amphetamine who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with complaint of abrupt-onset， severe chest pain and shortness of breath. Prior to presentation， the patient reported she was in her usual state of health. Associated symptoms included dizziness， fatigue， and intermittent somnolence. In the ED， she was hypoxemic with oxygen saturation of 77% on room air， tachypneic， and hypertensive without tachycardia. She was placed on a non-rebreather which initially yielded improvements in her oxygen saturation. Chest X-ray was obtained and showed hazy and patchy airspace opacity at the bilateral lung bases . Initial labs revealed elevated high sensitivity troponin I (695 ng/L， nl <18)， elevated D-dimer (1.45 ug/mL)， polycythemia (hemoglobin 19.7 g/dL， Hct 58%)， leukocytosis (20.7K/uL)， normal coagulation factors， normal ferritin， normal CRP(<0.5 mg/dL)，and normal BNP (55.1 pg/mL). In light of her overall clinical status and lab work， the patient was admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU). Poison Control was contacted on admission and did not， at that time， think her presentation was consistent with a toxidrome. Despite being on a non-rebreather， the patient developed worsening hypoxemia and required transition to high-flow nasal cannula. The patient continued to require increases in respiratory support with worsening hypoxemia andWas ultimately intubated to better manage her respiratory status. Echocardiogram was obtained in response to her abnormal cardiac labs and demonstrated moderately decreased systolic function with ejection fraction of 36%. Repeat troponin increased to 1636 ng/L. At that time， she was started on milrinone and dobutamine infusions and transferred to a quaternary care center PICU for consideration of Extracorporeal Life Support (ECLS) given her severe degree of cardiac dysfunction . Following transfer， the patient remained hypotensive and hypoxemic despite multiple pressors， stress-dose hydrocortisone， and mechanical ventilation. While ECLS was initially considered， clinical improvement was noted following inotropic medication titration and ongoing volume resuscitation. Over the following day， the patient was weaned off pressor support and extubated on hospital day two. On day three， she no longer required respiratory support and left ventricular systolic ejection fraction had returned to normal on echocardiogram. Troponin and pro-BNP gradually decreased throughout her hospitalization. After transfer to the floor， further chart review revealed that the patient was recently seen twice by her primary care provider for depression. Poison Control was contacted and it was discerned that a guanfacine ingestion combined with dextroamphetamine-amphetamine could explain her initial presentation. The patient initially denied any intentional ingestion or self-harm， but further questioning revealed an intentional attempt to take guanfacine and dextroamphetamine-amphetamine as an attempt to end her life. It was estimated she took about two weeks’ worth of each medication， as no pills were found at home. Once medically stabilized， the patient required a ten-day psychiatric admission. During the hospital stay， she was started on fluoxetine for depression and methylphenidate in place of guanfacine and dextroamphetamine-amphetamine for ADHD. Since discharge， she has continued outpatient mental health follow up for ADHD and depression. The patient was seen in follow up by pediatric cardiology approximately one month after discharge from the inpatient pediatric cardiology service； at that time， her echocardiogram and EKG were both reassuringly normal . During that visit， the plan for six month follows up with repeat echocardiogram and EKG was made. If studies remain normal at her six month follow up， she will no longer need to follow with pediatric cardiology.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Toxidromes of ADHDmedications have been studied throughout the years and are well-documented in pediatric literature. While there is abundant data regarding individual toxicities， data surrounding overdoses of multiple ADHD medications have not been as thoroughly documented. Amphetamine toxicity has been described as a primarily sympathomimetic syndrome with some psychiatric symptoms . The cardiac symptoms associated with amphetamine overdose include dysrhythmia， tachycardia， and hypertension . Guanfacine overdose has been shown to lead to multiple cardiac adverse events， including cardiogenic pulmonary edema ， hypotension and bradycardia ， as well as the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation . With our patient’s mixed initial presentation of hypertension， bradycardia， severely depressed ejection fraction， and elevated cardiac markers， her symptoms and work up did not seem to be consistent with a known toxidrome， which led to a more dedicated pursuit of other causes for her presentation. The lab and imaging abnormalities of markedly elevated troponin， leukocytosis， and echocardiographic findings of decreased left ventricular systolic function for this patient were reflective of a severe myocarditis. This was supported by the patient’s history of feeling fatigued， dizzy， and diaphoretic. There was initial concern for Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children(MIS-C) or other viral process. Her presentation was not thought to be consistent with an arrhythmia or infarction in the setting of normal EKG and absence of risk factors； such has family or personal history of cardiac pathology. While the patient presented critically ill， she was able to wean off vasopressor support in a relatively brief periodandhad return of normal cardiac function oncehertoxidrome resolved (a presentation inconsistent with infectious myocarditis or other causes of severe cardiac dysfunctions). With the patient's rapid improvement， our team decided to further investigate the possibility of toxic ingestion， as patients with infectious myocarditis usually do not improve so rapidly. Once a more detailed history of depression was elicited， combined with the patient’s home medication list， we developed an increased suspicion for a toxidrome after intentional ingestion.\n\n【8】Conclusion\n\n【9】This case highlights the profound cardiac effects of combined guanfacine anddextroamphetamine-amphetamine toxidromes， which has not been well-documented in the current pediatric literature. Additionally， our case serves as an important reminder to maintain a broad differential diagnosis for pediatric heart failure， including intentional ingestion， especially in critically ill patients when a thorough history is not always available. Future studies may look into the benefits of hydrocortisone use in patients who are critically ill secondary to a toxidrome of this nature. While steroids were used in the setting of multiple pressor-resistant hypotension，the patient improved quickly after initiation of the steroids； however， it is difficult to know if our patient’s rapid improvement was directly linked to the steroid administration or if it was a combination of an additional pressor， fluid resuscitation， and the natural course of the ingested medications. Overall， this case illustrates the potential life-threatening complications of combined ADHD medication overdoses as well as the importance of thorough history taking and differential diagnoses development.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:50:57", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:51:05", "cost": 7.817}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:44", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:51:05", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:50:53"}

It often manifests as a chronic respiratory illness like interstitial lung diseases.

Chest radiograph revealed findings bilateral consolidation in the lower lobes. Pathology micrograph of the bilateral consolidation showing lipid-filled vacuoles. On further questioning， the patient received a total amount of 500 ml paraffin oil due to intestinal obstruction one month before admission. After anti-infective and anti-inflammatory treatment， the symptom of fever did not improve. However， the patient's temperature returned to normal after intravenous fluids were discontinued.\n\n【3】Conclusion： Our case illustrates an unusual ELP presenting with drug fever that makes differential diagnosis more complicated. Clinicians should be aware of ELP pneumonia， which may manifest as infectious pneumonia.\n\n【4】Keywords： Lipoid pneumonia； Drug fever； Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Exogenous Lipoid Pneumonia (ELP) is a rare lung condition because of the inflammatory reaction caused by the presence of foreign fatty substances in the alveoli， its imaging findings are easily misdiagnosed as interstitial pneumonia or lung cancer. Diagnosis confirmation necessitates special staining of the Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid (BALF) or lung biopsies . Drug fever is particularly problematic whenever it occurs among patients with non-infection， and drug fever can result in overutilization of anti-infectives and other agents trying to treat non-existing infections， possibly resulting in an increase in the risk of complications. By comparison and summary， Baron“et al\". found that all individuals with acute ELP had fever for several days to weeks \"while all the patients with chronic ELP had no fever\". However， this study did not describe in detail the patients fever type and peak body temperature . The clinical manifestations of ELP vary， patients mainly presenting chronic cough， and a small number of patients will have chest pain，hemoptysis， weight loss， intermittent fever and so on . The diversity observed with cases of drug fever makes it difficult to form general conclusions. No study has shown a pathogenetic correlation between ELP and drug-induced fever， the complicated with drug fever in present case remind us that fever in ELP patients may not be associated with ELP.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 76-year-old never smoking female， was admitted with fever and slight cough for 3 weeks. Fever symptoms occurred on December 06h， 2020 with a thermal peak of 39.5…C. Cough slightly with white foamy phlegm. Chest CT on December 09t， 2020 indicated diffuse inflammation in both lungs. One week after anti-infection treatment with cefoperazone/sulbactam and levofloxacin， reexamination on chest CT showed no improvement in the lung lesions. Then treatment with fluconazole and meropenem for 10 days， the patient's fever did not ease. Her past medical history consisted of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) and cerebral infarction for many years. On December 25h， 2020， the subiect was transferred to our hospital for further treatment. Her WBC (White Blood Cell) count was 6.07 ×10° cells/L，N% 84.7%， C-reactive protein was 120mg/L. Procalcitonin was 0.08 ng/ml. Body temperature was 38.2C. To rule out infectious fever， on December 28h， 2020， high throughput sequencing of the blood samples was detected， and test results showed that 36 sequences of Epstein-Barr virus and 4 sequences ofcytomegalovirus.On December29h，2020， blood samples were negative for aspergillus antigen test and cryptococcus gel qualitative test. Chest computed tomography scan on December 304， 2020，which shows bilateral consolidation in the lower lobes . Ultrasonic bronchoscope examination was performed on December 304， 2020， reveals that the wall of the air tube was mildly edematous， without of pus or necrosis . Cell classification results of BALF showed that neutrophils were 50%， lymphocytes 20%， histological cells 10%， columnar epithelial cells20%， and tumor cells were not found. Then the patient continued to be treated with antibiotics for an extra week， nevertheless the patient's fever persisted.\n\n【9】On January 06\"， 2021， pathological results of dorsal segment of the lower lobes reported that lipid-filled vacuoles associated with lipid-laden macrophages in alveolar septum and alveolar lumen. On further questioning the patient was hospitalized for intestinal obstruction 1 month before admission， she received a total amount of 500 ml paraffin oil， and aspiration occurred for 3 times. Therefore， the diagnosis of ELP was made. Then， from January 06，2021， the patients were given methylprednisolone 60 mg/day for 6days. From January 12h， 2021， prednisone dose was reduced to 40mg/day. The puzzle was that the patient still had fever symptoms after anti-infective and anti-inflammatory treatment After excluding other factors， the possibility of drug fever was considered. Intravenous medication was stopped on January 084， 2021， and oral medication was retained. The patient's body temperature returned to normal on January 104， 2021. On January 15h， 2021， the patient had stable vital signs， without fever symptoms， and was discharged with prednisone 30 mg/day oral administration. The patient feels well and without adverse or unanticipated events during prednisone oral administration. The reexamination of chest CT on January 29h，2021indicated that the lesion in the lung was improved .\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】ELP is an uncommon type of pneumonitis， resulting from exogenous lipids of mineral， vegetal， or animal origin ， which reach the alveoli by inhalation of volatile hydrocarbons ， or by aspiration of oil-based substances. Most ELP cases originate from mineral oil aspiration present in laxatives and oily nose drops . The typical clinical manifestation of ELP constitutes a chronic cough manifesting with or without dyspnea along with the presence of diffuse interstitials infiltrates on imaging assessment of chest . While， the patient in this case presented with persistent fever as the main clinical feature.\n\n【12】The clinical manifestations of ELP depend on the type， dosage，and frequency of lipids inhaled. Acute heavy inhalation can lead to fever， cough and dyspnea while chronic long-term inhalation may not show symptoms or only mild cough， expectoration， weight loss and other non-specific symptoms . Hemoptysis is uncommon， with only one reported case in English language literature . The symptoms of this patient in present report are insidious onset of cough， as well as fever， without dyspnea， similar to infectious pneumonia. We initially considered infectious fever according to the patient's lung lesions， so we gave adequate anti-infective therapy. However， chest CT reexamination 1 week after anti-infective treatment indicated that the patient's pulmonary lesions had not improved and fever was still present. After the patient's lung lesions were pathologically confirmed to be ELP， we adjusted the treatment plan and added methylprednisolone， but the patient's body temperature was still not well controlled. After excluding other factors， we considered that the patient might have a drug-induced fever. Due to the poor physical condition of the patient and the long duration of fever， there was not enough time to stop intravenous drugs successively to observe the changes in the patient's body temperature， so we chose to stop all intravenous drugs of the patient. The patient had no fever after discontinuation of intravenous drugs. Although we do not know exactly what medication caused the patient's fever， the patient's body temperature returned to normal after the intravenous medication was discontinued， so the diagnosis of drug-induced fever in this patient should be confirmed.\n\n【13】Physical exam findings of EL Pare those ofinterstitial lung disease. The lungs can be clear or have fine rales. As seen in our patient， we could hear distinct rales in the lower lobes of both lungs， which was consistent with the radiographic findings ofthe patient.\n\n【14】Due to its association with aspiration， the CT scan of ELP is usually patchy ground glass with thickening of intralobular septa and consolidation in both lower lungs along the bronchial vascular bundle . In addition， it can also be shown as isolated nodules with lobes and burrs， or mass shadow ， and these lesions may have high uptake during PET-CT and are difficult to distinguish from lung cancer.\n\n【15】ELP diagnosis is often a challenge because the symptoms， signs， along with the radiographic results are all a bit nonspecific. Although aspiration is the most common cause of ELP， patients may not be aware of inhaling irritating drugs because repeated small amounts of the fatty substance might not cause a significant cough-stimulating reflex . Notably， not all ELP cases originate from aspiration； some cases result from inhalation and nasal drop. Case reports have demonstrated that ELP can develop among vaper. Chronicinhalation of e-cigarette which contain of vegetable glycerin caused the patient to manifest with insidious onset cough， night sweats， progressive SV dyspnea on exertion along with fever， and was in respiratory failure on admission to hospital . While， the clinical use of mineral oils is even more widespread. Thus， the history of exposure to exogenous lipids substances is a remarkable clue to the diagnosis of ELP. Histopathological examination is the gold standard for the diagnosis of ELP. Microscopically， foamy lymphocytes in the alveolar space can be seen. Floating oily foamy substance and fat globules are found in BALF， which are also of high diagnostic value for this disease.\n\n【16】It is evident in our case that the patient's diagnosis was delayed for several reasons. First of all， the patient was an elderly woman with fever， so the pulmonary lesions were primitively considered infectious disease.Secondly， there is a lack of detailed inquiry on the specific treatment of intestinal obstruction， causing the omission of a history of chemical irritants inhalation. In addition， the patient had no respiratory symptoms other than a cough， nonspecific clinical features. What's more， this patient had a clear history of cerebral infarction and GERD. A multicenter review revealed an incidence of80% ELP caused by aspiration in patients with intestinal obstruction and chronic constipation accompanied by GERD while using liquid paraffin and Vaseline as a laxative . This reminds us that patients with a history of chemical irritants aspiration， especially those with GERD or cerebral infarction， should be highly suspicious of ELP.\n\n【17】To date， ELP standardized treatment regimens have not been established. Recommendations for treating ELP are on the basis of clinical experience and not long-term observational studies. Because ELP is often associated with aspiration， prevention is important. Avoiding ongoing exposure， as well as providing supportive care constitutes the main stay of treatment. Antibiotic therapy alone is usually ineffective. Systemic corticosteroid treatment has been utilized successfully in some cases to dampen inflammatory response. Nonetheless， corticosteroids might not be applied routinely on account of the severe side effects， and could be utilized if the lung injury is severe and ongoing. It has been reported that corticosteroid therapy on kerosene aspiration was ineffective . In this case our patient responded well to corticosteroids and CT assessments were improved after a month of treatment with corticosteroids. Bronchoscopic Alveolar Lavage (BAL) has treatment implications in some cases. Numerous case reports documented the effectiveness of treatment lung lavage for lipoid pneumonia， which washed away lipids directly， as well as improved lung opacities . However， in patients with respiratory failure or severe complications， BAL cannot be performed. Localized lobectomy may also be considered if medical treatment fails. In present case， two BAL were performed on the patient， but the results were not satisfactory.\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】In conclusion， we report an exogenous lipoid pneumonia case associated with liquefied petrolatum that was complicated with drug fever. To the best of our knowledge， it is the first case which report that ELP complicated by drug fever. The clinical manifestations of ELP vary greatly， ranging from asymptomatic to severe life-threatening. As can be seen from this patient， patients with ELP still need to be alert to the possibility of complicated with other diseases when they have fever symptoms.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:12:23", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:12:30", "cost": 6.904}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:44", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:12:30", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:12:22"}

Online platforms， especially YouTube， have been a very rich source of information for patients. We aimed to evaluate the videos in YouTube related with breast cancer and COVID-19 released during the first 6 months of the pandemic and to determine their reliability and quality for patients and healthcare providers in circumstances of the pandemic.\n\n【2】Methods： A YouTube search was performed by using search terms “breast cancer， COVID-19， breast cancer， Corona and breast cancer， pandemic. Videos in English language were evaluated for inclusion. Duplicated videos were not included. A playlist containing 142 videos was created. Videos were categorized according to their content (informative， patient experience， news)， source of upload and their target audience. Video characteristics (number of views， duration， likes， dislikes， comments) were noted. Reliability and quality of videos were assessed by validated tools (DISCERN， VIQI scores， respectively).\n\n【3】Results： Informative videos had significantly higher DISCERN scores when compared with patient experience and news videos. News videos had significantly higher scores in flow of information’parameters， when compared with other subgroups. Informative videos had significantly higher and patient experience videos had significantly lower information accuracy scores when compared with other groups.\n\n【4】Conclusion： YouTube is a very rich source of medical information for breast cancer patients during thelockdown. Even though there are useful videos for patients， many unreliable videos are uploaded by non-professional individuals， as well.\n\n【5】Keywords： Breast cancer； COVID-19；Health services\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】In December 2019， a Coronavirus subtype， later named as COVID-19， emerged in Wuhan， China and affected almost every country in the world with more than 5 million people infected and more than 350，000 people deceased . During these pandemic， daily routines of people， especially patients have changed drastically and reaching the hospitals has become limited. Many surgeries， radiotherapy and chemotherapy sessions are postponed and cancer patients are particularly concerned by these changes that cause delay in their planned treatments.\n\n【8】As known； breast cancer is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality and is the most commonly encountered malignancy among the female population . During this era of pandemic， breast cancer patients inevitably seek information about the course of their disease， while they have limited access to hospitals. Online video platforms， including YouTube which was launched in2005， is the most commonly used among all video sharing platforms， have been a major source of informative and also misleading medical information . The quality of content in YouTube gains even more importance during these times where patients cannot attend their regular appointments with their healthcare providers. Even though there are many informative and reliable contents uploaded by professionals healthcare providers， misleading and unreliable information are also present and these videos may harm breast cancer patients both clinically and psychologically.\n\n【9】In this study， we aimed to evaluate the videos in YouTube related to breast cancerand COVID-19which was released during the first 6 months of the pandemic， and to determine their reliability and quality for patients and healthcare providers.\n\n【10】Methods\n\n【11】A YouTube search was conducted on May 22nd， 2020 and performed by using search terms “breast cancer，COVID-19， breast cancer， Corona' and breast cancer， pandemic. Videos in English language were evaluated for inclusion. Duplicated videos were not included. A playlist containing 142 videos was created.\n\n【12】Classification of videos\n\n【13】Videos were categorized into three categories according to their contents. The categories were determined as ‘informative， patient experience'and news. The target audience of the videos was also classified as healthcare providers’and patients’. The up loaders of the videos were classified as professional individuals’， non-professional individuals'， ‘news agencies’ and “hospitals and academic centers'. Video characteristics were noted in terms of video duration， number of views， number of likes’ and ‘dislikes' and ‘days passed since upload.\n\n【14】Evaluation of reliability and quality\n\n【15】Reliability of videos was evaluated by modified five point DISCERN tool . T'point was given for each of the following criteria if the answer to the question is Yes'and0' point was given if the answer is No.\n\n【16】DISCERN tool\n\n【17】1. Were aims clear and achieved?\n\n【18】2. Were the sources of information reliable?\n\n【19】3. Is the information balanced and unbiased?\n\n【20】4. Are additional resources to learning provided?\n\n【21】5. Does the video address areas of controversy/uncertainty?\n\n【22】Quality ofvideos were assessed by Video Information and Quality Index (VIQI)， which is a modified version of Global Quality Scale(GQS). The VIQI scale was created to evaluate the quality of videos， specifically. Each criteria of VIQI scale was given a point from1 (poor quality) to 5 (high quality).\n\n【23】Video information and quality index (VIQI)\n\n【24】Flow of information\n\n【25】Information accurac\n\n【26】Quality (one point each for use of still images， use of animation， interview with individuals in the community， video captions， and use of a report summary)，\n\n【27】Precision (level of coherence between video title and content).\n\n【28】Two independent physicians (BAU， CS) graded the videos for reliability and quality assessment and final scores were achieved by consensus. Since YouTube is a public website， and the study does not include any patient data， Institutional Review Board approval was not obtained.\n\n【29】Statistical analysis\n\n【30】Statistical analysis was done using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences . Normality of distribution of the variables was checked by Shapiro-Wilk test and Q-Qplots. ANOVA test was used for comparison of the normally distributed variable between the 3 groups， and Kruskal-wallis test was used for none normally distributed data. Post-hoc analysis was used for comparison between groups. The Tukey test was used in the groups with normal distribution， and the Games Howell test was used in the groups without normal distribution. P values represent two-sided statistical tests with statistical significance at p<0.05.\n\n【31】Results\n\n【32】Among 142 videos included in the study， 96 (67%) videos were‘informative， 26 (18%) videos were patient experience' and 20(14%) videos were ‘news'videos. Number of views were significantly different between groups (p=0.001) and news videos had remarkably higher numbers ofviews. Groups had significantly different DISCERN scores (p=0.001) and the mean DISCERN score of informative videos were higher when compared with other groups. Characteristics of the videos in different content categories were compared and results are listed in Table 1.\n\n【33】Pairwise comparison of groups was performed for parameters which were identified to be significant. Informative videos were significantly longer and news videos were significantly shorter in duration， when compared to other groups. Informative videos had significantly higher DISCERN scores when compared with patient experience and news videos. Pairwise comparison of different parameters is listed in Table 2.\n\n【34】The quality assessment of videos was performed by VIQI scoring system and results are listed in Table 3. Being the lowest possible score in the scoring system as 5 and the highest possible score as 25， the mean total VIQI score was identified as 16.0± 2.5. Comparison of video qualities in different content categories was performed and results are listed in Table 4. Total VIQI score of each group and the scores of flow of information， information accuracy'and ‘quality criteria were significantly different among groups. The precision score(level of coherence between video title and content) was comparable among groups.\n\n【35】Pairwise comparison of VIQI parameters， which were identified to be significantly different among groups， was performed. News videos had significantly higher scores in flow of information'parameter， when compared with other subgroups. Informative videos had significantly higher and patient experience videos had significantly lower information accuracy scores when compared with other groups. Results of these pairwise comparisons are listed in Table 4.\n\n【36】Discussion\n\n【37】Breast cancer is a very common health problem being the leading type of cancer in women with high morbidity and mortality rates， with 245，000 new cases diagnosed each year， according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data visualizations . Early diagnosis and treatment remains a very important aspect of breast cancer management and restricted access to hospitals during pandemic is a major concern for patients and their relatives. Patients tend to seek information online and YouTube remains to be a very important source of both useful and misleading information. In this perspective； we aimed to evaluate the videos regarding breast cancer and COVID-19， in terms of their characteristics and quality， to gain insight about their usefulness during the pandemic era.\n\n【38】There are studies in the literature which have evaluated the importance of social media andYouTube for breast cancer mean ± standard deviation\n\n【39】Table 1： Analysis of video characteristics by content category.\n\n| Characteristics  | Informative  | Patient experience  | News  | p  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Number of videos  | 96  | 26  | 20  |  |\n| Audience interaction parameters  |  |  |  |  |\n| Number of views  | 145.4±208.2  | 329.2±289.7  | 2820.6±6123.1  | 0.001  |\n| Video length (min)  | 22.1±21.5  | 7.7±8.9  | 3.1±2.0  | 0.001  |\n| Duration on YouTube (days)  | 39.0±18.8  | 31.1±17.4  | 41.4±17.7  | 0.101  |\n| Views per day  | 3.7±4.6  | 13.3±15.1  | 89.4±228.2  | 0.001  |\n| Likes  | 2.6±4.7  | 10.5±12.6  | 37.1±76.9  | 0.001  |\n| Dislikes  | 0.1±0.3  | 0.3±0.7  | 3.0±6.5  | 0.001  |\n| Comments  | 0.5±2.6  | 3.0±4.4  | 19.3±47.7  | 0.001  |\n| DISCERN score  | 3.4±0.9  | 1.1±0.4  | 1.8±1.1  | 0.001  |\n| Source of upload  |  |  |  | 0.001  |\n| Professional individuals  | 19  |  |  |  |\n| Non-professional individuals  | 69  | 20  |  |  |\n| News agencies  | 2  | 5  | 20  |  |\n| Hospitals， Academic centers  | 6  | 1  |  |  |\n| Target audience  |  |  |  | 0.010  |\n| For doctors and healthcare providers  | 17  |  |  |  |\n| For patients  | 79  | 26  | 20  |  |\n\n【41】Table 2： Pairwise comparisons of video groups according to content.\n\n| Characteristics  | p value  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Characteristics  | Informative vs. Patient experience  | Informative vs. News  | Patient experience vs. News  |\n| Number of views  | 0.013  | 0.151  | 0.19  |\n| Video length (min)  | 0.001  | 0.001  | 0.048  |\n| Views per day  | 0.01  | 0.239  | 0.318  |\n| Likes  | 0.01  | 0.138  | 0.299  |\n| Dislikes  | 0.313  | 0.128  | 0.168  |\n| Comments  | 0.021  | 0.209  | 0.304  |\n| Source of upload  | 0.001  | 0.001  | 0.001  |\n| Target audience  | 0.022  | 0.041  | NA  |\n| DISCERN  | 0.001  | 0.001  |  |\n\n【43】Values of p<0.05 were accepted as significant and marked bold mean ± standard deviation\n\n【44】Table 3： Detailed content analysis of videos based on VIQI scores and pairwise comparison of groups.\n\n|  | Mean VIQI score  | Informative  | Patient experience  | News  | p  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Flow of information  | 4.2±0.9  | 4.1±0.9  | 3.9±0.9  | 4.8±0.6  | 0.002  |\n| Information accuracy  | 4.4±1.0  | 4.8±0.7  | 3.2±1.1  | 4.0±0.9  | 0.001  |\n| Quality  | 2.7±0.9  | 2.5±0.8  | 2.6±1.2  | 3.5±0.6  | 0.001  |\n| Precision  | 4.8±0.6  | 4.8±0.6  | 4.8±0.5  | 4.9±0.5  | 0.418  |\n| Total VIQl score  | 16.0±2.5  | 16.3±2.2  | 14.5±3.1  | 17.2±1.9  | 0.001  |\n\n【46】Brachtenbach et al.  investigated the quality of YouTube videos relating to breast cancer and developed their own scoring system for quality assessment. They have individually attended scores for different components of videos including screening， risk factors， symptoms， diagnosis， classification and management. After evaluating133 videos， they have concluded that many of the videos contain misleading and false statements and high quality videos with reliable information are needed. A different study conducted by Basch et al. assessed the YouTube videos regarding mammography for breast cancer screening. They have evaluated 173 videos by their numerical characteristics and also presence or absence of information regarding different components of mammography， including preparing for the test， pain， emotional component， last mammography visit， test results， age and medical/family history. They have concluded that misleading information is present in many videos and new ways should be developed in the future for patients to identify the reliable video from the videos with misleading and false information.\n\n【47】The DISCERN tool was initially developed in 1999 by Charnock， in order to evaluate the quality of written medical information . Many studies in the literature adopted this reliability score to assess the medical content in certain resources. In our study， we have detected a very high number of informative videos in YouTube with high reliability scores. However， informative videos had remarkably lower number of views when compared with patient experience and news videos. This was partly due to higher subscribers to the channels of news agencies and individuals with breast cancer， in contrast to lower subscribers of health care professionals and academic centers. So， highly useful and reliable information should reach a higher number of viewers， by promoting these channels with new solutions. Additionally， even though news videos had a remarkably higher mean number of views when individually compared with informative and patient experience videos， because of the presence of extreme values in regards to number of views； the p value was not statistically significant due to the non-normal distribution pattern among news videos.\n\n【48】Table 4： Pairwise comparisons of video groups according to VIQl scores.\n\n|  | p value  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Informative vs. Patient experience  | Informative vs.News  | Patient experience vs. News  |\n| Flow of information  | 0.621  | 0.001  | 0.002  |\n| Intormation accuracy  | 0.001  | 0.006  | 0.018  |\n| Quality  | 0.989  | 0.001  | 0.007  |\n| Total VIQl score  | 0.022  | 0.13  | 0.002  |\n\n【50】Quality assessment of online contents was performed by several authors in the literature. As an example， Nagpal et al.  analyzed the reliability and quality of YouTube videos as a source of medical information during the Ebola hemorrhagic fever epidemic. They have created new scales (VIQI and MICI) to assess the quality of videos by their overall video quality and medical content. These scales are revised versions of GQS， which was originally developed to evaluate the quality of websites . Our quality assessments revealed a clear superiority of informative videos over news videos in information accuracy score. However， news videos scored significantly higher in flow of information and quality scores， when compared with informative videos. We emphasize that these results are due to the structured，high quality content and professional production of news agencies， with regards to healthcare providers， which are commonly the main presenters in informative videos. These informative videos can reach more number of views by integrating more images， video captions and animations， which will attract more attention by the viewers and facilitate the spread of reliable and useful information.\n\n【51】The source of upload is another important variable， regarding the reliability of the uploaders and the gaining the confidence of the viewer. Vast majority of the videos were uploaded by non-professional individuals and news agencies (62% non-professional individuals， 19% news agencies). Even though the uploaders were non-professionals， the majority of the speakers in those videos were either doctors or healthcare providers. This improves their reliability and the quality of information contained in the video. We emphasize that the most reliable source of upload is the academic centers and hospitals， which represent the most agreed-upon medical information that can be presented to the public. However， the least number of videos were uploaded by these professional centers (0.4%) and increasing these informative and truly useful videos would benefit most for the breast cancer patient population.\n\n【52】Our study has several limitations. The reliability and quality S es were determined by two independent physicians and final scores were reached by consensus meeting by the same interpreters. Instead， assessment of intra-observer and inter-observer variability would be a more reliable interpretation of data. Due to the limited number of videos uploaded during a short period of time， further studies with higher number of content， wouldreveal more trustworthy results. However， we intently chose the first 6 months period of the COVID-19 pandemic since there was no general consensus about the treatment and surgical planning ofbreast cancer patients.\n\n【53】In conclusion， YouTube is a very rich source of medical information for breast cancer patients. Even though there are useful videos for patients， many unreliable videos are uploaded by non-professional individuals， as well. Increasing the videos uploaded by professional individuals and academic centers would be very useful for patients， especially in times like pandemic， where hospital access is limited.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:48:20", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:48:47", "cost": 26.462}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:44", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:48:46", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:48:19"}

The similarities of MIS-C with Kawasaki Disease (KD) and Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) suggest that the syndrome represents a spectrum of diseases. MIS-C， which is initiated by an overactive immune response in children， puts pressure on the heart， as inflamed blood vessels become incapable of carrying adequate blood， hence producing cardiac complications. Here we describe the clinical and laboratory characteristics of 23 patients who were admitted to our unit and diagnosed with MIS-C. The outcome was favorable for all patients after receiving treatment with a combination of Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIG)， aspirin， and， for some patients， a corticosteroid. Only one patient required intensive-unit care. The average hospital stay was 7 days， and no mortality occurred. For some patients， MIS-C's unopposed inflammatory state progresses rapidly to multiorgan failure. Cardiovascular complications consisting of shock， myocarditis， decreased cardiac function， and coronary artery dilatation was noted in 43% of the patients in our study. The goal of our study is to identify clinical features and laboratory results， if any， associated with severe clinical outcomes of MIS-C. Such information would help in the decision to initiate targeted immunotherapy quickly.\n\n【2】Keywords： Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C)； Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome (PIMS)； Hyperinflammatory shock； Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome2 (SARS-CoV-2)； Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19)； Children； Pediatric\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Shortly after the World Health Organization (WHO) classified COVID-19 as a pandemic in March 2020 reports begun to emerge a post-infection syndrome with multisystem involvement with circulatory shock and systemic inflammation in children aged 0 to 19 years. A health alert from the United States described the condition， instituted mandatory reporting of cases， and the Center of Disease Control (CDC) created a case definition on May 13h. This syndrome， which has similarities with Kawasaki Disease (KD)， the most frequent vasculitis in children， and Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS)， was formally named Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). By mid-January 2022， 6，431 children in the United States have been diagnosed with MIS-C， and 55 children have died from it .\n\n【5】Early on， it was suspected that MIS-C is associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). One evidence is that 98% of MIS-C patients reported in the CDC website had a positive test result for SARS-CoV-2， and the remaining 2% of patients had contact with someone with COVID-19 . Reports continue to emerge of children with MIS-C among communities with high rates of COVID-19， with the peak of MIS-C usually lagging the peak of COVID-19 wave by a few weeks . The lag suggests that the development of the KD-like disease is likely the result of a post-viral immunological reaction. Per the WHO， a confirmed case of MIS-C TTO凸PC is defined as follows： An individual aged 21 years or less， presenting with fever，laboratory evidence of inflammation， and evidence of clinically severe illness requiring hospitalization， with multisystem(more than 2) organ involvement (cardiac， renal， respiratory， hematological， gastrointestinal， dermatological， or neurological)； and no alternative plausible diagnoses； and positive test result for current or recent SARS-CoV-2 infection by real-time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)， serology， or antigen test； or COVID-19 exposure within the 4 weeks before the onset of symptoms .\n\n【6】Many children with MIS-C meet the criteria for complete or incomplete KD. An exaggerated systemic inflammatory response(cytokine storm) leading to vascular endothelial damage and1e immune-mediated tissue damage is observed in both MIS-C and KD. Epidemiologically， however， there are important differences between MIS-C and KD. While classic KD has a higher incidence among children of Asian descent， data from the United States shows that MIS-C was diagnosed more in Black and Latino children than other ethnic groups . While the average age of patients suffering from KD is 2 years old， and 75% are under 5 years old， only 24%of children diagnosed with MIS-C were in that age group . Most children diagnosed with MIS-C are children and adolescents who were previously healthy and had a median age of 10 years .\n\n【7】Methods\n\n【8】We describe a retrospective study of 23 cases that were diagnosed with MIS-C from November 264， 2020， to January 11h， 2022. The study was performed in the Pneumo-allergology and pediatric Infectiology Department at the Children’s Hospital in Rabat. The inclusion criteria were set in accordance with the MIS-C criteria definition published by the WHO . Data analysis was performed on anonymized clinical data.\n\n【9】All children who meet diagnostic criteria for MIS-C are managed in the inpatient setting. At admission， the patients were considered as suspected cases of COVID-19 and were managed according to the recommendations of the countrys Ministry of Health. All patients undergo testing for SARS-CoV-2 at the time of presentation， and infection control precautions are used pending the results of initial testing. SARS-CoV-2 infection tests were based on RT PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs， as well as serological tests to detect the presence of antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 (IgM and IgG in the blood/serum ofthe patients). When the first RT-PCR test for a patient returns a negative result， we perform a second test for confirmation. A positive serological test (IgM or IgG， or both) associated with a negative RT-PCR test was considered consistent with a previous or current infection.\n\n【10】COVID-19 waves in Morocco\n\n【11】The first COVID-19 case in Morocco was reported on March 2nd. The epidemic curve of COVID-19 cases in the country recorded three waves at different time intervals： the first wave from April 2nd to 8h， 2020， was followed by a second， larger wave between April 184and April 26h， 2020， coinciding with the large clusters registered in industrial， commercial， penitentiary and family settings. The third wave， which was less pronounced， occurred between April 28th and May 2nd. The positivity rate among children was initialy high； at 20.8% in March 2020， it slightly exceeded the rate for the rest of the population， but it dropped to 6.5% in May of the same year. For comparison， when the total number of cases in Italy reached 58，000in March 2020， only 597 cases (1%) were children aged 18 years or less. During the first wave， a single death was recorded in a 17-month-old infant admitted with a severe picture of respiratory distress， a history of delayed weight (7 kg at 17 months) and renal failure . Among children aged 14 years or less， 57.3% of cases were asymptomatic， 39%had mild symptoms， and they were moderate for 3% of the patients. About 0.6% of cases had severe symptoms.\n\n【12】Table 1： Presenting symptoms (comparison with published reports ).\n\n【13】The patients described in this study presented to our hospital， which is one of the major referral public university hospital centers. Our findings support already published observations of the post-COVID-19 inflammatory syndrome in 5 children from a different region in Morocco .\n\n【14】Results\n\n【15】Patient age demographics\n\n【16】The 23 patients in our study were predominantly male (19 males and 4 females) and were 7.5 years old in average. While published report indicate that only 24% of children diagnosed with MIS-C are less than 5 years old ， the proportion of patients in our study in that age group is 48%. In particular， 3 of the four female patients in our study are under 5 years old. None of the patients had a significant medical history， or prior pathological conditions.\n\n【17】SARS-CoV-2 test results\n\n【18】Results from RT-PCR tests to detect SARS-CoV-2 in nasal swabs were negative for all patients. For each patient in our study， we performed RT-PCR tests twice， and both results were negative. Only one patient had a confirmed COVID-19 infection 4-week before presentation. SARS CoV-2 IgM and IgG were both positive for 3 patients (13%). IgM serology was negative and IgG serology positive for 19 patients (83%)， indicating previous infections. For one patient， IgM was positive and IgG serology negative. Contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case was reported in 11 cases (3 to 5 weeks prior to the consultation).\n\n| Symptom  | Reported in   | % Cases in our study  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Persistent fevers  | 100  | 100  |\n| Gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain， vomiting， diarrhea)  | 60 to 100  | 71  |\n| Rash  | 45 to 76  | 53  |\n| Conjunctivitis  | 30 to 81  | 76  |\n| Mucous membrane involvement  | 27 to 76  | 100  |\n| Neurocognitive symptoms (headache，lethargy， confusion， seizures)  | 29 to 58  | 18  |\n| Respiratory symptoms (tachypnea， labored breathing)  | 21 to 65  | 29  |\n| Sore throat  | 10 to 16  | 71  |\n| Myalgias  | 8 to 17  | 6  |\n| Swollen hands/feet  | 9 to 16  | 12  |\n| Lymphadenopathy  | 6 to 16  | 47  |\n|  |  |  |\n\n【20】Table 2： Laboratory results (comparison with published reports ).\n\n| Laboratory Finding  | Units  | Normal Range  |  | Study Results  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Laboratory Finding  | Units  | Min  | Max  | Median  | Min  | Max  |\n| Hemoglobin level  | g/dl  | 13  | 16.5  | 11  | 8.7  | 14  |\n| Platelet count  | 10%L  | 150  | 400  | 208  | 102  | 776  |\n| Leukocyte count  | 10%L  | 4  | 10  | 11.2  | 3.8  | 20.6  |\n| Neutrophil count  | 10%L  | 1.5  | 7  | 9.3  | 2.4  | 16.4  |\n| Lymphocyte count  | 10%L  | 1  | 4  | 1.5  | 0.61  | 5.8  |\n| Eosinophil's count  | 10%L  | 0.1  | 0.4  | 0.5  |  | 0.61  |\n| C-reactive protein level  | mg/L  |  | 5  | 180  | 97  | 364  |\n| Erythrocyte sedimentation rate  | mm/h  |  | 10  | 64  | 17  | 125  |\n| Serum ferritin  | ng/ml  | 21  | 274  | 450  | 90  | 2500  |\n| Sodium level  | mmo/L  | 136  | 145  | 129  | 119  | 138  |\n| Urea level  | g/L  | 0.15  | 0.55  | 0.2  | 0.18  | 1.09  |\n| Creatinine level  | mg/L  | 5.7  | 12.5  | 5  | 3  | 19.7  |\n| Alanine aminotransterase level  | U/L  |  | 55  | 26  | 19  | 57  |\n| Aspartate aminotransterase level  | U/L  | 5  | 34  | 30  | 13  | 148  |\n| Triglyceride's level  | g/L  | 0.3  | 1.3  | 5  | 0.75  | 5.93  |\n| D-dimer  | ug/mL  |  | 0.5  | 26  | 0.7  | 43.7  |\n| Fibrinogen  | g/L  | 2  | 4  | 30  | 3.6  | 12  |\n\n【22】Table 3： Patients with severe manifestations.\n\n| Patient  | Sex  | Age (Months)  | KD  | MAS  | Severity  | Kobayashi score  | Corticosteroids  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | M  | 56  | Complete  |  | 5  | 1  |  |\n| 8  | M  | 108  | Incomplete  |  | 5  | 3  |  |\n| 19  | M  | 50  | Incomplete  |  | 5  | 2  |  |\n| 17  | M  | 96  | Incomplete  | Yes  | 2，3，4  | 6  | Yes  |\n| 22  | M  | 168  | Incomplete  |  | 2.3.4  | 4  |  |\n| 12  | M  | 56  | Incomplete  | Yes  | 2，3，4，5  | 4  | Yes  |\n| 21  | M  | 192  | Incomplete  | Yes  | 2，3，4，5  | 7  | Yes  |\n| 7  | M  | 180  | Incomplete  | Yes  | 2，4，5  | 6  | Yes  |\n| 14  | M  | 188  | Incomplete  | Yes  | 2，4，5  | 6  | Yes  |\n| 16  | M  | 28  | Complete  |  | 2.5  | 4  |  |\n\n【24】Severity codes： 1： Admitted to ICU； 2： Decreased cardiac function； 3： Shock； 4： Myocarditis； 5： Coronary artery abnormality； 6： Death\n\n【25】Presenting symptoms\n\n【26】The patients presented to our hospital 9 days in average after onset of symptoms. They all had prolonged fever (5 to 18 days， with an average of 9 days). All patients had been given antipyretics for fever control before their presentation to our unit， but none of them responded to the treatment. Nineteen  patients had been given antibiotics， but none of them responded to the treatment. Table 1compares the incidence of various symptoms among our patient vs. the incidence rate reported in other studies Nineteen patients (83%) had digestive manifestations： 9 patients had diarrhea； 10 had vomiting； and 12 patients had abdominal pain. Extremities changes were noted in 6 patients (26%)： 3 patients had palmar-plantar erythema， and 1 had palmar erythema； 3 had swelling of the dorsal hands， and 1 patient had swelling of the dorsal hands and feet.\n\n【27】Skin rash was noted for 17 patients (74%) in various forms：Macular rash (10 patients)； maculopapular rash (3 patients)，urticaria rash (3 patients)， perineal rash (3 patients)， and BCG reactivation scar area (1 patient). Lips and oral cavity changes were observed for21 patients (91%)： Cheilitis， 17 patients； pharyngitis， 14 patients， and glossitis， 4 patients. Fourteen patients (61%) presented with cervical lymphadenopathy (9 unilateral and 5 bilateral). Only one patient had Oliguria. Aseptic conjunctivitis was noted in seventeen patients(74%). Three patients (13%) had rhinorrhea.\n\n【28】Respiratory manifestations were observed for 13 patients (57%)：Cough (11 patients)， thoracic pain (2patients)， polypnea (4 patients)， hypoxia (1 patient)， and dyspnea (3 patients).

Hypotension was observed for 3 patients (13%). All other patients had normal hemodynamic variables. Most of the children had no significant respiratory involvement， although two patients who had less than92% oxygen saturation.\n\n【34】Six (26%) children in our study met criteria for complete KD while 15 patients (62.5%) had incomplete KD.\n\n【35】Imaging results\n\n【36】Echocardiography results were normal for 12 patients (52%). Coronary artery aneurysm/dilation was observed for 5 patients(22%). Coronary vessel parietal thickening was observed for 5 patients(22%). Myocarditis associated was noted for 6 patients (26%). It was associated with left ventricle hypokinesia (6 patients)， tricuspid valve regurgitation (5 patients)， mitral insufficiency (5 patients)， left ventricle dilatation (3 patients)， right ventricle dilatation (2 patients)， left ventricle hypokinesia (2 patients)， aortic insufficiency (1 patient)， mitral valve prolapsed (1 patient).\n\n【37】Chest X-ray showed abnormalities for 10 patients (43%)：Bronchial syndrome (6 patients)， cardiomegaly (7 patients)， isolated blunting of the costophrenic angle (3 patients).\n\n【38】Brain scans were performed for two patients (9%) whopresented a meningeal syndrome. For one patient， the scan showed enhancement of the meninges and falx cerebri and decreased ofenhancement of the posterior longitudinal sinus， caused by cerebral thrombus.\n\n【39】Chest computed tomography was performed for 4 patients and it showed： ground glass opacity for 3 patients and pachypleuritis for l patient.\n\n【40】Abdominal echography was performed for 4 patients. The results were normal for 1 patient， mesenteric adenolymphitis for 1 patient and peritoneal and pelvic effusion for 1 patient.\n\n【41】As shown in Table 2， the Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR) and elevated C-Reactive Protein (CRP) are elevated for all patients， indicating a marked inflammatory state. Microcytic hypochromic anemia was present in only 2 patients (9%). Leukocytosis with a predominance of neutrophils was noted in 4 patients (17%). Lymphopenia was found in 11 patients (48%). Thrombocytosis was observed in 3 patients (13%) and Thrombocytopenia in other 3patients (13%). Hyper eosinopenia was identified for 5 patients (22%). Hyponatremia was found in 11 patients (48%). Hypertriglyceridemia was noted for 8 patients (35%). Hepatic cytolysis with Aspartate Aminotransferase (ASAT) was identified in 3 patients (13%). There were 3 cases (13%) of renal failure. Macrophage activation syndrome was noted in 4 cases (17%). Cytobacteriological examination of the urine revealed aseptic leukocyturia in 6 patients (28%). D-dimer was elevated for all patients. Hyperferritinemia was observed for 11patients (48%).\n\n【42】Blood culture test was performed in 14 patients (61%) and was negative for all ofthem. Lumbar puncture was performed in 4 patients and was also negative for all of them.\n\n【43】Severe manifestations\n\n【44】Ten patients (43%) presented with severe manifestations， which included state of shock， decreased cardiac function， myocarditis， and coronary artery abnormality . Table 3 shows the combination of features for each patient who showed a severe manifestation， and the type of severe manifestation. We note that patients who required corticosteroids have a high Kobayashi score(and thus are insensitive to IVIG) and had MAS manifestations.\n\n【45】As shown in Table 4， slightly more than half the male patients in our study had severe manifestations. None of the female patients had such manifestations. Only one third of patients with complete KD exhibited severe manifestations， but half the male patients with incomplete KD had severe manifestations. Two thirds of the patients with MAS also had severe manifestations.\n\n【46】Discussion\n\n【47】Patientsin 011rstudypredominantlyhad feveerrwith gastrointestinal (79%)， cardiovascular (50%)， and mucocutaneous(71%) manifestations， which is consistent with other reports about MIS-C. Respiratory manifestations other than cough were observed in 30% of our patients. All but one patient had highly elevated levels of C-Reactive Protein (CRP)， suggesting that a hyperinflammatory state.\n\n【48】In the addition to the epidemiological differences between KD and MIS-C discussed earlier， MIS-C patients meeting KD diagnostic criteria have lower white blood cell count and lower platelet levels， but greater levels of CRP and ferritin compared with classic cases of KD . MIS-C cases exhibit greater prevalence of multisystem involvement， notably cardiac abnormalities such as myocarditis and shock . These differences were confirmed for the patients in our study.\n\n【49】One of the most severe complications of KD is coronary artery aneurysm . Possible mechanisms of myocardial involvement are speculative and include direct viral invasion of myocyte and systemic inflammatory response triggering myocyte injury， which can be compounded by myocardial ischemia secondary to hypotension Without adequate treatment， 20% of untreated children can develop a Coronary Artery (CA) aneurysm which poses a significant risk of thrombosis and myocardial infarction later in life. Large aneurysms can rupture and lead to death. The incidence of Coronary Artery(CA) abnormalities in our patients was 23%， slightly outside the range reported in the literature ， highlighting the importance of routine echocardiography in all children with MIS C， regardless of apparent sub-phenotype.\n\n【50】Management of MIS-C has evolved over the course of the pandemic， and the American College of Rheumatology has published recently， the guidelines for the treatment of MIS-C， recommending using immunoglobulins and/or high dose corticosteroids as a first-line treatment. Since all patients meet criteria for incomplete or complete Kawasaki Disease (KD)， standard therapies for KD were administered， including Intravenous Immune Globulin (IVIG)，and aspirin， and glucocorticoids in the event of Macrophage Activation Syndrome(MAS)and in the event ofcardiac involvement(myocarditis and significant aneurysm). Glucocorticoids are used in this event of MAS or cytokine release syndrome (CRS； also called cytokine storm) because it may not respond to IVIG therapy. The dosing for IVIG is 2g/kg， administered in a single infusion over 8 h to 12 h. Acetylsalicylic acid was administered in anti-inflammatory doses (80 mg/kg/day to100 mg/kg/day) upon admission of the patients and was maintained until thermal defervescence with regression of the biological inflammatory syndrome， then continued in anti-aggregating doses (3mg/kg/day to 5 mg/kg/day) for 12 weeks. Glucocorticoid therapy is administered as intravenous methylprednisolone in bolus for 1 to 3days at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day was administered. In case of persistence of fever 36 h after the end of the IVIG infusion， a second dose of immunoglobulins was given. The treatment response was defined as a resolution of clinical signs and inflammatory markers. This approach is consistent with published guidance from American medical bodies pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2\n\n【51】All patients in our study were administered IVIG， aspirin， and， tor some patients， methylprednisolone per recommendations based on Kobayashi score： IVIG at 2 g/kg， and aspirin at 50 mg/kg to 80 mg/kg per day (Kobayashi score <5) for 5 days or aspirin at 30 mg/kg per day plus methylprednisolone at 2 mg/kg per day for 5 days (Kobayashi score 25)， followed by a tapering of methylprednisolone over 2 weeks. Aspirin was maintained until 48 h after defervescence， and then continued at an anti platelet dose of 3 mg/kg to 5 mg/kg per day for8 weeks. Response to treatment was defined as the normalization of vital signs， CRP， and blood tests， and the resolution of symptoms and signs.\n\n【52】Patients with persistent or recurrent fevers， persistently elevated or rising inflammatory markers， and/or worsening clinical status are considered to have an inadequate response. Assessment of the patient's response to initial therapy is typically made over 1 to3 days； however， it may be reasonable to wait a longer duration in patients without severe manifestations. Adjunctive therapies include interleukin 1 inhibitors (e.g.， anakinra， canakinumab)， interleukin 6inhibitors (e.g.， tocilizumab)， high-dose (pulse) glucocorticoids， and convalescent plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients\n\n【53】Conclusion\n\n【54】Our study shows that the similarities of MIS-C with Kawasaki Disease (KD) and Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS) suggest that MIS-Crepresents aspectrum of diseases. Usingimmunoglobulins as a first-line treatment， and corticosteroids either at the presence of MAS features or when Kobayashi score is greater than 6 is effective. The factors linked with severe manifestations are mostly correlated with MAS or Kabayashi score.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:34:13", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:34:33", "cost": 19.923}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:44", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:34:32", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:34:12"}

They can occur anywhere in the spine but most frequently around the sacral nerve roots. Most TCs lack obvious clinical symptoms and usually present as incidental finding， but about 20% of TCs are symptomatic. The symptoms of TCs include low back pain， radiculopathy， leg weakness， and paresthesia in the lower limb. TCs are usually single or sporadic and are rare in large clusters. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can clearly reflect the number， size and shape of cysts， which is the first choice for the diagnosis of this disease. We present a 61-year-old female who presented with mild lumbosacral pain， but sometimes accompanied by numbness in the posterior thighs on both sides. MRI images suggested that the patient had multiple cystic lesions on both sides of the spinal canal， which was considered as TCs.\n\n【2】Keywords： Multiple； Nerve root cyst； Perineural cyst； Tarlov cyst\n\n【3】Case Presentation\n\n【4】A 61-year-old female patient was admitted to the orthopedic outpatient department of our hospital dueto the abnormal results of her physical examination. Her Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI) report performed in October this year showed multiple cystic lesions on both sides of the spinal canal in the T12-S3 level plane. We asked the patient about her condition and found that her symptoms were unremarkable. The patient said that she was always in good health at ordinary times， and had occasional lumbosacral soreness over the past year， but the pain was mild and could be tolerated. After further understanding of the patient’s condition， we found that she usually had the habit of morning exercise， such as running and practicing tai chi， and had not fallen or been injured recently， and had no chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes. The family history was unremarkable. On physical examination， the patient did not have significant lumbosacral tenderness or percussion pain， and the muscle strength of both lower limbs was normal. However， when she does squats or side presses， she has a slight numbness in the back of both thighs. Our initial clinical differential diagnosis included lumbar disc herniation， lumbar spinal stenosis， or lumbar muscle strain. A close review of the MRI images surprised us. On the dehiscent plane of MRI， it was evident that there were numerous， multiple， sequential， beaded cystic lesions on both sides of the spinal canal . From the coronal view， the spinal canal was dilated at the level of the T12-S3 vertebral body， and part of it bulked out of the bilateral intervertebral foramina， showing a circular long T1 and long T2 signal shadow， and the cauda equina nerve ran inside it. After comprehensive consideration， we initially diagnosed multiple Tarlov Cysts(TCs) on both sides of the spinal canal. We have never seen such a large number of TCs in the orthopedic clinic. We immediately contacted the imaging department for technical treatment， and three-dimensional images of these cysts were reconstructed. These cysts were of different sizes， symmetricallyarranged，located on both sides of the spinal canal， and partially wrapped around the nerve root . Considering the absence of obvious symptoms， no special treatment was given to the patient for the time being.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】Tarlov Cysts (TCs) are rare， often asymptomatic disorder， characterized by isolated or multiple nerve-root cysts， which were first described by Dr. Tarlov in 1938  as perineural cysts filled with Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) that originate from the dorsal ganglion or the spinal posterior nerve root. It usually occurs in the sacral spine， near the dorsal root ganglion， between the perineurium and endoneurium . This cyst is also known as perineural cyst， nerve root diverticulum， meningeal cyst， sacral cyst， arachnoid cyst， etc. Most TCs lack obvious clinical symptoms and usually present as incidental finding ， but some cysts can cause corresponding nerve root symptoms. TCs can occur in any segment of the spine， such as cervical， thoracic and lumbar vertebrae， but lumbosacral involvement is most common. According to the literature， about20% of TCs are symptomatic . The symptoms of TCs include low back pain， radiculopathy， leg weakness， and paresthesia in the lower limb， but sometimes it can also present with many rare symptoms， such as sacral radiculopathy， urinary incontinence， bowel disorders， and dyspareunia . At present， it is generally believed that the characteristic manifestation of Tarlov cysts is the presence of nerve fibers in the cyst wall or the presence of nerve fibers in the cyst cavity itself. Although the etiology is still unclear， micro-communication with the subarachnoid space at the Dural sleeve of the nerve root may function as a valve， allowing CSF influx and restricting CSF efflux， causing formation of the cysts . This ball-like mechanism causes cysts to fill and expand in size， and may compress neighboring nerve fibers， resulting in neurological symptoms . At present， Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)， Computed Tomography (CT)， or myelography can be used to confirm TCs， with MRI being the gold standard modality . MRI can well show the subarachnoid space， spinal cord， spinal nerve root epidural fat， and even can show the linear spinal meninges， so that the adjacent relationship and scope of the lesion can be correctly inferred， and then achieve the correct diagnosis of the location and quality of the lesion. Although most people with TCs are asymptomatic throughout their lives， they are a type of lesion that may grow progressively larger and make their symptoms progressively worse. As the cyst grows， the sensory nerve roots around the lesion are stretched， and other nerve roots and surrounding bone will also undergo compressive changes， resulting in pain and sensory disturbance. Treatment is usually not required for asymptomatic Tarlov cysts . Approximately 20% of these cysts are symptomatic， and the role of specific surgical and nonsurgical interyentions remains controversial.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:18:46", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:30:25", "cost": 698.699}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:44", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:30:24", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:18:45"}

This patient received a transplanted kidney from her mother because of chronic renal failure. She developed chronic humoral immune transplant rejection (chronic renal rejection) four months before developing BP， and her BP started at the same time as acute cell-mediated immune graft rejection (acute renal rejection). After one month of BP treatment， her BP showed improvement， but the titer of anti-BP 180 non-collagenous16a (NC16a) antibody remained in a high range. The recrudescence of her BP would be cause for concern is apprehensive because of the high titer of anti-BP 180 NC16a antibody. Type XVII collagen (BP180) is a common antigen between the skin and kidney. Her BP and the high titer of anti-BP 180 NC16a antibody might be related to the transplant tissue. We were concerned about the recurrence of the BP， and we removed the transplanted kidney. After three weeks of nephrectomy， her skin condition was improved， and the anti-BP 180 NC16a antibody titer was quickly reduced. We present the case of BP in a young female， and six other cases of BP in younger people (less than30 years old) related to the rejection ofa transplanted kidney have been reported.\n\n【2】Keywords： Bullous pemphigoid； Kidney； Nephrectomy； Rejection； Transplantation； Type XVII collagen\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Bullous Pemphigoid(BP) usually occurs in elderly people， and cases of this disease in individuals younger than 30 years old are rare. Diseases that can be comorbid with BP include Diabetes Mellitus(DM)， dementia， Parkinson’s disease， autoimmune diseases ， and psoriasis vulgaris . Cases of BP related to renal transplantation are rare， with a total of seventeen such cases having been reported  . Only six BP cases related to renal transplant rejection in individuals less than thirty years old have been reported in addition to our case  . These BP cases might be related to immune cross-reactivity between epidermal and glomerular basement membrane antigens . One effective treatment for BP related to renal allograft rejection is nephrectomy.\n\n【5】A 24-year-old female developed bullas， erosion， and erythema on her whole body， and her skin condition did not improve. She had not been eating well due to oral mucous and tongue erosion， and her skin condition worsened. Our diagnosis was BP based on the clinical findings ， the results of skin biopsy (subepidermal bulla and mainly lymphocytes and eosinophils infiltrate， superficial and deep perivascular dermatitis) ， and the high titer of anti-BP180 non-collagenous 16a (NC16a) antibody (2980 U/ml) . The Bullous Pemphigoid Disease Area Index (BPDAI) scores were bulla and erosion 53/120， erythema 30/120， and mucous membrane11/120.\n\n【6】Her medical history is as follows. Chronic renal failure of unknown origin started at thirteen years of age， and she received renal transplantation from her mother nine years ago. The origin of her chronic renal failure was not detected. She developed chronic humoral immune transplant rejection (chronic renal rejection) and restarted dialysis beginning at twenty three years of age， and then (after four months) she developed acute cell-mediated immune graft rejection (acute renal rejection) and BP at twenty four years old.\n\n【7】We began treating her BP using steroid ointment， steroid tablets(prednisolone 15 mg/day； 7.5 mg/day for immunosuppression and7.5 mg/day for BP treatment) and antihistamine tablets. After one month of treatment，her skin condition and BPDAI score improved， although her anti-BP180 NC16a antibody titer remained high (2820U/ml) . Because the high titer of BP-180 NC16a antibody might have been caused by the transplanted kidney， we removed the transplanted kidney at seven weeks of BP treatment. After the allograft was removed， the titer of BP-180 NC16a antibody quickly decreased. Thirteen weeks after the transplanted kidney was removed， her skin condition was good (BPDAI score： Bulla 0/120， erythema0/120 and mucous membrane 0/120) and then the dose of steroid gradually were decreased with the improvement of her skin condition and the titer of BP-180 NC16a antibody .\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Generally， BP is a chronic autoimmune blistering skin disease in elderly people. Patients with BP usually contract comorbid diseases such as DM， dementia， Parkinson's disease， or autoimmune diseases. Our patient did not exhibit any of these comorbid diseases. Based on the course of her BP， the development of BP in this case might have been related to chronic and acute renal rejection and we speculated that our patient's BP was caused by an immune cross-reaction between herskin and allograftkidney. The target ofthe autoimmune reaction in BP is located in the skin， basement membrane， and hemidesmosome. There are three protein molecules， namely plectin， BP 230， and BP180 (Type XVII collagen： BPAg2) in the extracellular components of the basement membrane. Type XVII collagen (BPAg2) is a component of hemidesmosome， an adhesion molecule in the skin basement membrane. The main target of BP is type XVII collagen(BP180) ，and many BP patients possess autoantibodies against the extracellular NC16a domain of collagen XVII .Recently， type XVII collagen was detected in the glomerular basement membrane  in a report that connected skin and kidney immune reactions. Matsumura  reported that anti-basement membrane autoantibodies react with the NC16a domain of BPAG2. The titer of anti-BP 180 (anti-BPAg2) antibodies is used to determine the Table 1： Cases of BP related to renal allagraft rejection.\n\n| Age  | Sex  | Type of Graft Rejection Reaction  | Reference No  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 10  | F  | Chronic  |   |\n| 9  | M  | Chronic  |  |\n| 15  | F  | Chronic  |   |\n| 27 13  | M M  | Chronic Chronic  | |\n| 15  | F  | Chronic  |   |\n| 25  | F  | Chronic Acute  | Our case  |\n| 47  | F M  | Chronic Chronic  |    |\n| 5246  | M  | Acute  | |\n| 5246  | M  | Acute  | |\n| 50  | M  | Chronic  | |\n| 39  | M  | Chronic  |   |\n| 59  | F  | Chronic  |   |\n| 34  | F  | Chronic  | |\n| 49  | M  | Chronic  |   |\n| 32  | M  | Unknown  |   |\n| 63  | M  | Acute  |   |\n| 46  | F  | Chronic  |   |\n\n【11】activity of BP . Patients with DM， dementia， Parkinson’s disease， and autoimmune diseases may be at risk of developing BP if they possess a positive titer of anti-BP 180 antibodies. Suzanne et al.  described that the occurrence of anti-BPAg2 antibodies may be secondarily triggered by the initial cutaneous aggression through the phenomenon of epitope-spreading. Hashimoto et al.  found that the analysis of epitope-spreading in skin diseases may provide insight into pathogenic mechanisms in transplantation immunity. Type XVII collagen was detected in the glomerular basement membrane ， and it is a common antigen between the skin and kidney. In these reports， type XVII collagen (BPAg2) is an essential antigen in the mechanisms of epitope-spreading in BP in patients with transplanted tissue. We speculate that antibodies against the BP-180 antigens in the skin and glomerular basement membrane could have been produced via epitope-spreading during chronic renal rejection， and an immune reaction between BP antigens and anti-BP180 antibodies might have been provoked during acute renal rejection in this case. A quick decrease of the titer of BP-180 NC16a antibody occurred after the nephrectomy，and this suggests that the slow change of the titer of BP-180 NC16a antibody after the skin improved could be related to the allograft kidney. Patients with BP sometimes develop comorbid diseases， possibly due to the presence of type XVII collagen in the bladder， buccal mucosa， conjunctiva， and neurons of the central nervous system， ocular cornea， placenta， retina， upper esophagus， and umbilical cord . Careful observation of elderly people with diseases in these tissues is needed， with a focus on the potential for developing BP.\n\n【12】Conclusion\n\n【13】A 24-year-old young female developed bullous pemphigoid related to allograft renal rejection with the high titer of anti-BP180NC16a antibody.

These conditions are often diagnosed incidentally during angiography， nevertheless they usually present with stable angina， atypical precordial pain， or acute coronary syndrome. A 56-year-old male patient is presented in this article after arriving at a local hospital with intense， retrosternal oppressive chest pain associated with nausea and diaphoresis and a history of chronic ischemic heart disease. After a 12-lead Electrocardiogram (EKG) was performed， he was diagnosed with an inferolateral acute ST-Elevated Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) and was admitted to a cardiac catheterization laboratory for coronary angiography， the procedure showed evidence of both CAA and CAE. The main cause of CAA in the adult population is arteriosclerosis and presents as local dilation of the coronary artery， whereas CAE presents as diffuse involvement. Unlike aneurysms， ectasia is more frequently seen in association with atherosclerosis， still， both conditions increase the risk of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) and should be considered in any patient with high clinical suspicion and a history of angina or acute myocardial infarction. Angiography is considered the first-choice diagnostic study.\n\n【2】Keywords： Coronary ectasia； Coronary aneurysm； Myocardial ischemia； Hemodynamics\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】CAA and CAE are uncommon serious conditions that can lead to a variety of complications including myocardial ischemia. Although these two diseases are recognized as distinct clinical entities they often present together. Both CAA and CAE have been associated with disadvantageous outcomes and increased cardiovascular risk . While the underlying cause of these conditions is not yet fully understood， they are associated with atherosclerosis and inflammation； genetic factors have also been identified . Excessive vascular remodeling has been recognized as a major pathophysiological mechanism for both diseases . The main risk factors identified for CAA and CAE include genetic susceptibility， connective tissue disorders， vasculitis， as well as cardiovascular risk factors (including hypertension， dyslipidemia， obesity， and smoking . The first-choice study for both of these conditions is coronary angiography， however， they are most often diagnosed incidentally when coronary angiography is employed for other diseases. The clinical picture for both conditions involve a wide range of symptoms depending on the degree of involvement. It is usually characterized by stable angina， atypical precordial pain， and/or acute coronary syndrome.Dilatation of the coronary arteries increases the risk of thrombus formation due to turbulent blood flow. Other complications for both CAA and CAE include fistula formation and peripheral embolism. The clinical spectrum is also influenced by elevated inflammatory markers such as Interleukin-6(IL-6)， Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) and Red cell Distribution Width (RDW). Although the pathophysiology is poorly understood， the presence of elevated inflammatory markers has been associated with higher mortality .\n\n【5】It is estimated that 3% to 5% of patients with STEMI have an ecstatic infarct-related artery. Right coronary artery involvement， with predominance of the proximal segments， accounts for 68% of CAE . The lack of information available regarding these cases presents technical challenges and requires elaborate decision-making strategies. Here we present a case of a patient with inferolateral STEMI， and evidence of CAA and CAE demonstrated by angiography\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 56-year-old male patient with a history of chronic ischemic heart disease presented to a local hospital with intense， retrosternal oppressive chest pain associated with nausea and diaphoresis. EKG revealed an acute inferior STEMI. After unsuccessful thrombolysis， he was referred to the National Institute of Cardiology (Instituto Nacional de Cardiologia， INC). On admission to the INC， EKG confirmed the diagnosis of inferolateral STEMI. He was admitted to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for coronary angiography and rescue Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI). During the procedure， an aneurysmal area in the proximal and middle segments was observed in the Anterior Descending Artery (ADA)， followed by an eccentric tubularlesion in bifurcation with the first diagonal . A focal lesion was observed in the ostial proximal segment of the Right Coronary Artery (RCA)， ending in an aneurysmal dilation and ectasia . Unsuccessful balloon angioplasty was performed. A myocardial perfusion study revealed parameters consistent with a high risk of ischemia. Coronary revascularization surgery was performed， with a left internal mammary artery graft to the ADA and an extensive endarterectomy arteriotomy with radial artery roof. The procedure was successful， and the patient gradually recovered.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】CAA represents a focal dilation of a coronary artery while CAE is a diffuse dilation . Although the etiology is not completely understood， atherosclerosis is the main cause in the adult population and Kawasaki disease is the main cause in the pediatric population. Atherosclerosis is the most common etiology of CAA， other causes include congenital aneurysms， connective tissue disorders and vasculitis (Kawasaki disease primarily in children) . CAE constitutes an increased risk for AMI and has been reported as an in dependent predictor of Myocardial Infarction with Nonobstructive Coronary Arteries (MINOCA) in patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction . CAA are characterized by a localized dilation of a segment more than 1.5 times the adjacent normal segments； its incidence ranges from 0.3% to 5.3%. CAA are frequently diagnosed incidentally when patients undergo coronary angiography or when they present symptoms of ischemic heart disease (including but not limited to angina and AMI) . Both CAE and CAA are independent risk factors for AMI and require high clinical suspicion if they are to be diagnosed before the patient presents with angina or AMI. High risk patients should be considered candidates for coronary angiography or imaging modalities， such as high-resolution CT scan and MRI， for the diagnosis of both CAA and CAE. Unlike aneurysms，ectasia is more frequently seen in association with atherosclerosis or as a compensatory mechanism in those cases in which a proximal stenosis is noted in the opposite coronary artery； ectasia is also seen in some coronary artery anomalies， such as anomalous origin from the pulmonary artery， or as a result of a high-flow state， as seen in coronary artery fistulas .\n\n【10】Regarding CAA， there is no unified opinion on the primary management for patients with this disease， treatment should be adapted to the context of each specific patient. The clinical presentation， physical findings， and medical history should be taken into account when making a decision； an emphasis must be made on atherosclerosis as well as the size， location and progression of the aneurysms since one of the main lines of treatment is through PCI. Stent placement through PCI is recommended although there is still controversy surrounding its potential complications， such as bleeding(CAA often requires anticoagulation) and stenosis， thrombosis，and implantation impairment due to proximal narrowing of the artery There is a risk of new aneurysms developing with the use of Drug-Eluting Stents (DES) . When conventional stent placement is not the most convenient option， alternatives such as coil embolization or autologous saphenous vein-covered stent grafting are available. Surgical options should be considered in symptomatic patients with a history of embolization or severe coronary artery disease， as well as any patient with an aneurysm with rupture potential. CAA near a large branch bifurcation， progressive growth of a CAA with angiographic documentation， fistulas， compression of cardiac chambers or a giant CAA (where dilation surpasses the referenced artery diameter by four times) are also indications for surgery over PCI. Aneurysm ligation or excision combined with bypass grafting is the preferred option in patients not candidates for PCI . In the management of CAE， especially when coexisting with CAD， the presence of obstructive lesions and persisting symptoms of cardiac ischemia after medical management are an indication for invasive therapy. Surgical and percutaneous procedures are available， both with positive short and long-term prognosis.

A strategy implementing autologous Stromal Vascular Fraction(SVF) cells from adipose tissue represents a novel approach in this chronic and devastating disease. Here we present a case study of a 71 year old woman who underwent SVF cell therapy during one surgical procedure. Clinical status of the patient was closely monitored with regular spirometry before and up to 14 months after SVF cell therapy. Nine months after SVF therapy patient did not require anti-fibrotic drugs and spirometry showed improvements that continued further at14 months. SVF therapy is a rapid， safe， and cost-effective method which can be easily applied in patients with pulmonary fibrosis and other chronic lung diseases.\n\n【2】Keywords： Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis； Chronic lung disease； Chronic asthma； Stromal vascular fraction； Stem cells\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and disabling lung disease characterized by irreversible loss of lung function due to scarring of the lung tissue ultimately resulting in death. The median of survival is 3-5 years after diagnosis . Typical pathological features of IPF are scarring and fibrosis of the interstitial lung tissue due to activation of fibroblasts and accumulation of myofibroblasts into the alveolar space， leading to dysfunction and failure of the lung. Clinical manifestations include respiratory deterioration， dyspnea on exertion and heart failure eventually leading to death. Aging， smoking， bacterial or viral infection， industrially processed food and air pollution are the most critical risk factors of IPF. Physical， environmental and genetic factors may also contribute to the pathogenesis and development of the disease . Current conventional therapy relies mainly on the reduction of symptoms or slowing the progression of the disease， including corticosteroids and beta-mimetics， unfortunately is frequently associated with various side effects. Oxygen supplementation is needed for patients with advanced IPF. Typically， conventional medicine cannot cure IPF. A promising novel strategy implements regenerative medicine based on Mesenchymal Stem/stromal Cells (MSCs) which can be easily obtained from adipose tissue together with other regenerative cells as Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) cells. MSCs have strong homing effect to the sites of injury and ischemia， inhibit chronic inflammation， and contribute to tissue restoration  and so have potential to be used for the treatment of IPF. SVF cells can be readily isolated from adipose tissue obtained by a standard liposuction， and administered during one surgical procedure . Previously， we described that SVF cells containing MSCs have a great regenerative potential in a large cohort of 1128 patients with osteoarthritis  including elderly . Here we demonstrate how autologous SVF cell therapy can contribute to lung regeneration and cure of a patient with IPF without any serious side effects.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】Seventy one years old female ex-smoker suffering from IPF for 2 years underwent autologous SVF cell therapy after signing the informed consent. Adipose tissue was obtained by tumescent liposuction under local anesthesia. SVF cells were isolated from adipose tissue and treated as previously described . Briefly， 150 ml of adipose tissue was obtained， SVF cells isolated and resuspended in normal saline and administered intravenously during one surgical procedure. Clinical status of the patient was closely monitored during said procedure. For the long-term follow-up， data including spirometry with objective measurements of the Functional Vital Capacity (FVC) of the lungs as well as Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) were monitored closely. These data were measured starting 2 months before through 14months after SVF cell therapy.\n\n【7】Results\n\n【8】Seventy one years old female， ex-smoker with IPF for 2 years preceded by 4 years of chronic asthma， had been suffering from a chronic dry and stifling cough， tiredness， shortness of breath and significant decrease in her quality of life. Her lung functions were also objectively monitored by spirometry on a regular basis. During last 2 years， she was on continuous oxygen therapy via nostrils， and underwent pulmonary rehabilitation. She received standard medications including inhaled corticosteroids and beta-mimetics， oral prednisolone 10 mg to 80 mg per day， and omeprazole 20 mg/day. She was also taking supplements with calcium 2 mg x 500 mg daily and Vitamin D3 800 IU daily. Her situation was complicated with pneumonia 5 months before SVF cell therapy. Pneumonia required hospitalization and intensified medical care including oxygen， antibiotic and other supportive therapy. After that acute pneumonia resolved， she remained quite weak， in a wheelchair and unable to walk more than about 10 meters due to severe dyspnea. She remained on her medications above and on continuous oxygen delivery at 6 1/min. via nostrils. Chest X-ray demonstrated progression of the lung fibrosis with diffuse alveolar changes. Due to constant deterioration of health， the patient decided to undergo autologous SVF cell therapy during one surgical procedure. She underwent autologous intravenous SVF cell therapy using 2.38×10/kg ofher body weight of nucleated SVF cells with viability 99% isolated from 150 ml of adipose tissue. No serious side effects were documented in association with the cell therapy procedure. Besides SVF cell therapy， she received recommendations to avoid calcium supplementation and initiate magnesium supplementation together with trace minerals containing zinc， selenium and manganese (Anti-Aging Minerals) and vitamin supplementation containing vitamins B1， B2， B3， B6， B12， folic acid， pantothenic acid， vitamin C， D3， and K2 (Anti-Aging Vitamins) for12 months. One month after the SVF therapy， she was able to reduce her standard prednisolone and beta-mimetic medication， and her spirometry showed mild improvement . She was constantly improving further. She was able to stop inhaled beta-mimetics and corticosteroids 5 months after SVF cell therapy， and was able to wean herselfoff oral prednisolone by 9 months after SVF cell therapy. Nasal oxygen was reduced to 3-4l/min. At 12 months after SVF celltherapy， she became independent of oxygen only when inside her house， may be psychologically dependent， as she tended to use it when walking outside the house. Spirometric examination 9 months after SVF cell therapy revealed dramatic improvements in lung functions (FVC104%， FEV1 92%) and similar and stable results were documented at14 months after SVF cell therapy (FVC 102%，FEV1 97%) . Clinically， the patient felt very good， was able to walk without oxygen， and without a need for anti-fibrotic or anti-asthmatic medications. Her quality of life had improved dramatically. No respiratory tract infection was documented during the 14 months period since SVF cell therapy.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Because current conventional treatment of IPF is limited and ineffective， including serious side effects and the disease progressively deteriorates and often ends with lung transplantation or death，novel therapeutic approaches， including regenerative medicine， are needed. Various stem cells therapies have been used for IPF treatment in clinical studies， for example bone marrow isolated MSCs ， Adipose Tissue-Derived Stem Cells (ADSCs) ， placenta-derived MSCs  or alveolar type II progenitor cells . As was described previously， adipose tissie-derived MSCs are more genetically stable and can be safely and easily isolated in much higher quantities from adipose tissue by a standard liposuction as a part of SVF . SVF therapy was successfully clinically used in treatment of many disorders including pulmonary diseases such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease(COPD) ， IPF  and pulmonary emphysema . As we described previously， SVF cells have a distinctive tissue regeneration potential in patients with osteoarthritis . Moreover，International Consortium for Cell Therapy and Immunotherapy has experience with neurodegenerative diseases ， and pulmonary diseases including COPD.\n\n【11】Stem cells have pleiotropic effects in the place of lung injury that include anti-inflammatory， immunomodulatory， anti-fibrotic and paracrine effects . They are able to differentiate into various local cell types， including cells in bronchioles， alveoli， and pulmonary vasculature and also contribute in activation of the resident stem cells. Typically， large amounts of SVF may be obtained from 200ml of adipose tissue (10° nucleated SVF cells per each ml of the adipose tissue) when CT-SVF-03 Kit is used  leading to clinical application of more than 2×10/kg of body weight nucleated freshly isolated SVF cells. Based on our clinical experience， this amount leads to optimal clinical result， i.e. complete cure of chronic and debilitating disease such as IPF. These non-manipulated autologous SVF cells may be directly administered intravenously to the patient with no serious side effects. Another route， i.e. endotracheal application of SVF cells in IPF patients has also been described . Here we were able to demonstrate that only one application of SVF cells is sufficient to initiate the immunomodulatory and regenerative processes in the lung. Obviously， other parameters may affect the clinical results of the cell therapy， including age， disease stage， extent of tissue damage， and other diseases of the patient.\n\n【12】Here we document for the first time to our knowledge， the IPF cure using autologous SVF cells isolated and administered during one surgical procedure. This treatment is safe with no serious side effects. It may represent a promising new therapeutic approach for the treatment ofIPF. Definitely， this method is still at an experimental stage and large multicenter randomized trials should be performed to further evaluate the efficacy of SVF cells as a treatment for this devastating chronic lung disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:08:55", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:10:12", "cost": 76.37}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:44", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:10:12", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:08:55"}

Chest CT showed left pneumothorax and bilateral pulmonary cysts. We performed lung cyst resection using video assisted thoracoscopic surgery. Pathological diagnosis revealed lung metastasis of Epithelioid Sarcoma (ES). During the four months following the development of left pneumothorax， right lung cysts gradually increased. We performed a right lower lobectomy and a further pathological diagnosis of lung metastasis of ES was made. Five months after the right lower lobectomy the patient felt a swelling in her left calf. A soft tissue tumor was present in the soleus muscle. We took a pathological biopsy from the soft tissue tumor， and its pathological diagnosis was ES. Twenty one months following the development of pneumothorax， the patient died due to disease progression.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Epithelioid Sarcoma (ES) is a rare mesenchymal tumor that occurs more often in the dermal or subcutaneous area of the distal extremities of young adults， typically in men. ES has a poor prognosis owing to its aggressiveness； it frequently recurs locally and can undergo metastasis， usually to the lymph nodes， soft tissues， bones，lungs， or brain . Spontaneous pneumothorax with cystic lung metastasis has been reported previously， although to our knowledge just six patients have been reported in the literature  . We describe a rare case of ES diagnosed with the development ofpneumothorax. A 42-vear-old woman was admitted to St. Marianna University Hospital due to a left pneumothorax. Chest CT revealed bilateral pulmonary cysts . She underwent left thoracotomy and received a pathological diagnosis of metastasis of ES.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】The patient was a 42-year-old woman who had undergone total hysterectomy salpingo radial because of stage IIA cervical cancer two years previously. She was admitted complaining of chest pain. Chest CT revealed left pneumothorax and bilateral pulmonary cysts. We initially considered pneumothorax to be caused by the rupture of lung metastasis from cervical cancer， and performed thoracoscopic lung cyst resection. Histopathological examination revealed the tumor had formed bullae and consisted of circular epithelioid cells. The specimen was immunohistochemical positive for cytokeratin， and negative for Integrase Interactor 1 (INI-1) . The pathological diagnosis was lung metastasis of ES. Four months following the development of pneumothorax， right lung cysts showed an increasing trend， so we performed right lower lung lobectomy， and a further pathological diagnosis of lung metastasis of ES was made. Five months after the right lower lung lobectomy， the patient felt swelling in her left calf. We performed MRI and PET scans. Soft tissue tumor was present in the soleus muscle， with a maximum standardized uptake value of 28.2. A biopsy of the soft tissue tumor resulted in a further pathological diagnosis of ES. She received three cycles of chemotherapy with Doxorubicin (DXR). However， progression continued resulting in enlarged inguinal lymph nodes and brain lesions. The patient then received three cycles of docetaxel and gemcitabine therapy， and 1 cycle of Ecteinascidin 743， and showed a poor response to both treatments.

Pulmonary metastases of soft tissue sarcomas commonly manifest as solid nodules， but a few cases of cystic pulmonary metastases have been described. Pneumothorax may have also been caused by distension of alveoli through the ball-valve effect， permitting passage of air along the interlobular septa to the pleura， where cysts may have formed and eventually ruptured . To our knowledge only six patients who developed pneumothorax caused by lung metastasis of ES have been reported in the literature . Of these six patients with ES， our patient represents the first reported case of a diagnosis made following the development of spontaneous pneumothorax. The clinical presentation of ES is indolent， so this case was diagnosed by lung lesions prior to the detection of the left calf lesion.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:10:46", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:10:57", "cost": 11.222}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:44", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:10:56", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:10:45"}

Therefore， enterogenous cysts at ectopic locations should be kept in mind.\n\n【2】Keywords： Mesenteric cyst； Enterogenous； Mediastinal；Mass\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Mesenteric cyst is one of the rare abdominal tumors. They usually arise from developmental abnormalities of the mesenteric lymphatics or from their traumatic rupture . The lack of characteristic clinical features and radiological signs may result in great diagnostic difficulties. So they are discovered either accidentally during an abdominal radiological examination for another reason or during a laparotomy for the management oftheir complications such as torsion， rupture， haemorrhageof the cyst or adjacent organ obstruction .Nearly 75% of mediastinal enterogenous cysts are recognized in the childhood. For unclear reasons， there is a two-to-one predilection for these cysts to be on the right side. Common symptoms are cough， dyspnea and occasionallystridor. The characteristic CT and MRI findings are identical to those of bronchogenic cysts apart from its wall which may be thicker and in near contact with the esophagus .\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】30-years-old woman was admitted to the hospital due to a chest pain of 3 months duration. Pain was often felt as a dull ache in the right hemi thorax. She did not have fever， cough， dyspnea， and hemoptysis or weight loss. She also did not report any arthralgia or any mucocutaneous， gastrointestinal or urogen ital symptoms. She was a married housekeeper andlived with herhusband and two children. She was not alcoholic or a smoker. Her general appearance was good and she did not seem ill. Her vital signs were as follow： BP= 120/80 mmHg， pulse rate =86 per minute， respiratory rate=12 per minute， and temperature=37C. Her physical examination was all normal including her lungs which were clear. Electrocardiography was also normal too. Blood indices， electrolytes urinalysis and renal function tests were normal. Her Erythrocyte Sedimentation (ESR) was 12 with Tuberculin skin test， acid fast stain， culture of gastric contents and bronchoalveolar lavage all negative for mycobacterium tuberculosis. Moreover， the hydatid agglutination test was 6 U/L (with upper limit of 15U/L). Chest- X-ray showed an opacity in the middle and lower zone of the right lung . Computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed a mass in the mediastinum . A Bronchoscopy was then performed with no abnormal findings. This was followed by the right thoracotomy. At the operation， a thick walled cyst was located in the anterior mediastinum. The cyst was then resected from the right side of the anterior mediastinum. No communications between the cyst and esophageal lumen or any other viscera was observed. Gross pathological examination revealed a yellowish-to-brown cystic mass measuring 14 x5cm with dark inner surface. The microscopic findings were compatible with a mesenteric cyst.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Primary cysts ofthe mediastinum account for approximately 20 percent of all mediastinallesions. The majority ofenteric cysts are discovered in childhood. Theyare uncommon inthe mediastinum but can result in tracheal or esophageal obstruction. These cysts are lined by gastric， intestinal， or stratified squamous epithelium； and those containing gastric mucosa may develop ulcerations， hemorrhage， and perforation . Different clinical manifestations were seen in mesenteric cyst. Some of them can be found incidentally， where as others in cavitary abdomen cause abdominal symptoms. No specific symptoms were seen in mesenteric cysts， sometimes symptoms can be confused with appendicitis， ovarian torsion， diverticulitis and bowel obstruction. Mesenteric cyst is very rare in mediastinum and adults form. Our patient experienced dull chest pain for 3 mounts. Mesenteric cysts commonly occur as single lesions， also multiple lesions have been reported. They can be unilocular or multilocular and may contain serous， chylous， hemorrhagic， or infective fluid. Cyst contents are sometimes related to their etiologic derivation. Cysts that develop after occult trauma may contain hemorrhagic content； chylous fluid may be found in jejunal cysts and in cysts that are intimately involved in the lymphatic pathway； and serous fluid is typically encountered in cysts of the ileum and colonic mesentery. Usually， the mediastinal enterogenous cysts were seen in the posterior mediastinum. We reported a very rare adult mesenteric cyst in the anterior mediastinum. All of the symptoms were relieved after the resection. Therefore， adult enterogenous cysts at ectopiclocations should be kept in mind. Accurately mesenteric cyst diagnosis depends on performing an exact physical examinations， conducting appropriate radiological studies and surgical resection .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:12:28", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:12:34", "cost": 6.078}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:44", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:12:33", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:12:27"}

This disease was first reported by Leibow and Hubbell in 1956 . Although there are many reviews and case reports about pulmonary sclerosing hemangiomas， cases with lymph node metastasis are still very rare. Here， we described a case of PSH with lymph node metastasis.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 30-year-old Asian woman came to our hospital for the treatment of a solitary pulmonary mass in her left lung. The tumor was found in the routine chest CT examination during the treatment of acute pancreatitis. The chest CT examination showed in theleftlowerlobe，there were multiple high-density nodules with different sizes which subsequently exhibited intense enhancement . The patient did not have cough， hemoptysis， dyspnea， chest pain or other pulmonary symptoms. Tumor markers and physical examination of the patient were both negative. The IF-FDG PET-CT examination showed multiple soft tissue masses and nodules in the left lower lobe had partial central necrosis and abnormal tracer concentration. The nodules， of which the SUV max was 6.7， were considered to have low-grade malignancy possibly. Besides， the bilateral hilar lymph nodes， of which the SUV max was 3.0， were considered to be reactive lymph node hyperplasia. The patient underwent thoracoscopic resection of the left lower lobe and systemic lymphadenectomy under general anesthesia.\n\n【9】Macroscopically， the sample of the left lower lobe of lung was about 13 cm × 8 cm × 4 cm. A 9cmx5cm x 4 cm lobulated ill-defined tumors with a grey-white section can be found in the sample. The pathology showed that the tumor was composed of round cells and surface cells. The immunohistochemistry demonstrated the positive expression of TTF-1 (Thyroid Transcription\n\n【10】Table 1： The review of pulmonary sclerosing hemangioma with lymph node metastases.\n\n| Author  | Age  | Gender  | Primary tumor location  | Metastatic lymph node，n  | Site of Metastatic lymph node  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Tanaka l 1986  | 22  | male  | RLL  | 1  | hilum  |\n| Devouassoux-Shisheboran M 2000   | 18  | temale  | LLL  | 2  | hilum  |\n| Yano M 2002   | 67  | temale  | RLL  | 5  | hilum mediastinal  |\n| Kim KH 2003   | 19  | temale  | LLL  | 11  | hilar interlobar intrapulmonary  |\n| Miyagawa-Hayashino A 2003   | 10  | temale  | RML  | 1  | regional  |\n| Miyagawa-Hayashino A 2003   | 45  | temale  | RUL  | 3  | hilum  |\n| Miyagawa-Hayashino A 2003   | 45  | male  | LLL  | 1  | mediastinal  |\n| Miyagawa-Hayashino A 2003   | 56  | temale  | LLL  | 1  | intralobular  |\n| Chan NG 2003   | 19  | male  | LUL  | 2  | interlobar  |\n| Kim GY 2004   | 37  | temale  | LLL  | 1  | supraclavicular  |\n| Wang L 2005  | 56  | temale  | RLL  | ND  | hilum  |\n| Katakura H 2005  | 35  | male  | LLL  | 1  | mediastinal  |\n| Li JC 2006  | 70  | temale  | LLL  | 1  | mediastinal  |\n| Jiang ZN 2007   | 59  | temale  | RLL  | 1  | interlobar  |\n| Vaideeswar P 2009   | 23  | male  | RUL  | several  | hilum  |\n| Chien NC 2009   | 18  | male  | LUL  | 1  | mediastinal  |\n| AdachiY 2014   | 40  | temale  | LLL  | 1  | mediastinal  |\n| Xu HM 2015  | 26  | temale  | RUL  | 1  | hilum  |\n| Pokharel S 2016  | 33  | temale  | LLL  | 1  | not available  |\n| Soo IX 2017   | 40  | temale  | RLL  | 5  | intraparenchymal  |\n| Present case  | 30  | temale  | LLL  | 11  | interlobar hilum mediastinal  |\n\n【12】Factor-1) EMA (Epithelial Membrane Antigen) in the primary tumor with round and surface cells ， as well as the positive expression of TTF-1 in the metastatic lymph node . According to clinical manifestations and histological features， the patient was diagnosed as pulmonary sclerosis hemangiomas with lymph node metastasis. The patient had no signs of local relapse and distant metastasis in 1-year follow-up after surgery despite of lymph node metastases.\n\n【13】Furthermore， in order to explore the molecular structure of this tumor， the mutations of 295 tumor-related driver genes are detected by a high-throughput sequencing test (Guangzhou Burning Rock Biotechnology Inc. China). All 295 genes are described as previously report . We use the patient blood DNA as basic line to analyze the tumor tissue， after ruling out genetic variations， 2 tumor-related somatic mutations of AKT1 and mTOR are confirmed， of which AKT1 missense mutation with abundance of 34.6% and mTOR missense mutation with abundance of 5.3%. These gene analysis results were consistent with the current molecular studies.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】Pulmonary sclerosing hemangioma is a relatively rare lung tumor， which was first reported by Liebow and Hubbell in 1956 . PSH， which occurs in Asia mostly， primarily affects middle-aged women with the male and female prevalence ratio of 1：5 . The tumors are mostly found in routine CT examination without obvious symptoms， and the size of PSH is mostly between 0.3 cm to 8cm. There is usually a regular well-defined round or oval tumor without obvious lobulation or speculation in chest CT. The tumor usually showed faint uptake of contrast agent with mild elevation of SUV max， which indicates the possibility of low-grade malignancy. It is more difficult to differentiate PSH with enlarged Mediastinal lymph node from lung cancer， whence pathology plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of PSH.\n\n【16】PSHis mainlycomposed ofsurface cells and round cells. Immuno-histochemical staining showed that both of the two cells expressed epithelial membrane antigen and thyroid transcription factor-1， of which TTF-1 expressed specifically in mature type II alveolar cells， Clara cells and embryonic alveolar epithelial cells. Further studies found that the expression of CK pan， CK-7， CAM5.2 and surfactant proteins were only positive in the surface cells， and barely he in round cells . Therefore， the researchers concluded that the surface cells were induced by reactive hyperplasia of type II alveolar cells， whereas round cells were most likely produced by pluripotent primitive respiratory epithelial cells . The study found that in some female patients with sclerosing hemangiomas， the expression of estrogen and progesterone receptor play a significant role in not only promoting transformation from the primitive epithelial cells to the of surface cells and round cells， but also promoting tumor growth， differentiation and surfactant production .\n\n【17】In the past pulmonary sclerosing hemangioma was considered to be benign. However， with more and more cases about PSH with lymph node or liver metastases reported ， many researchers believe that PSH have malignant potential. There is also another reported case which showed relapse as a bone metastasis after surgery， which initially showed node metastasis . As the same as benign tumor， the prognosis of PSH is good. Surgical resection of the lesion is the main treatment for PSH . The conventional procedures include partial lung resection， pulmonary lobectomy， and systemic lymphadenectomy in case of lymph node metastases. The preoperative diagnosis of PSH is difficult， for it is usually misdiagnosed as adenocarcinoma by intraoperative frozen section. Therefore， postoperative histological and immuno-histochemical examinations are the main way to diagnose PSH.\n\n【18】The literature search revealed a total of 21 cases reported PSH with lymph node metastases， of which 17 were described in English and 4 were in Chinese. The patients age was between 10 to 70， with an average age of 37.5 and a median age of 36. In these cases； there were 6 males and 15 females， with a gender ratio of 2：5. The average age of males and female was 27 and 40.7， respectively. Of the 21 cases， we found 10 primary tumors were in the left lower lobe， 3 were in the left upper lobe， 2 were in the right upper lobe， and 1was in the right middle lobe， and 5 was in the right lower lobe. Nine of the patients had hilar lymph node metastases， and seven ofthem had Mediastinal lymph node metastases. Earlier， Devouassoux Shisheboran et al.  conducted a detailed analysis of 100 PSH cases. Among these 100patients， patients were between 16 to 76 years old， with an average of 46 years old. There were 17 males and 83 females， with a gender ratio of 1：5. For the location， 46% of the tumors were found in the left lung and 54% were found in the right lung. According to the data statistical analysis， it indicates that PSH mainly occurs in the middle-aged women， and there is no significant difference in the location of the tumor.\n\n【19】According to the case review， pulmonarysclerosinghemangiomas have the potential of malignancy. Literature review and analysis suggest that lymph node metastasis may be related to the age， sex， tumor size and location of the tumor. Although PSH can be with lymph node metastases， there is no significant difference in prognosis between patients with or without lymph node metastases. Currently， the complete surgical resection of the tumor is still the only effective treatment for PSH.\n\n【20】Although the histogenesis of Pulmonary Sclerosing Hemangioma(PSH) is thought to originate from respiratory epithelial， the molecular mechanisms that mediate its occurrence and development are not clear. Studies showed that highly frequent AKT1 gene mutation could be found in PSH including somatic mutations and copy gains. As we knew， the protein kinase v-AKT Murine Thymoma Viral Oncogene homolog (AKT) plays an important role in cell survival and proliferation， which functions downstream of PI3K. Recurrent AKT1 mutation was first reported in breast cancers. However， the frequency of AKT1 mutations in PSH was much higher than other tumors . Although AKT1 mutations in PSH are relatively common， approximately 40% of PSHs exhibited neither driver mutation nor CNA mutation (Copy Number Alterations)； this result showed that the epigenetic and genetic origin of PSH had not been determined . Some studies showed that aberrant mTOR signaling may play a role in the development of PSH， and its vascular nature may be due partially to high levels of VEGF caused by dysregulation of mTOR signaling . Therefore， PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway may play a role in the occurrence and development of PSH， but the mechanism of action is still not clear. However， the mutation of AKTlwith high abundance was also found in the gene test of this patient， which might provide a guide for the treatment of PSH in the future.\n\n【21】Conclusion\n\n【22】The preoperative diagnosis of PSH is difficult， postoperative histological and immuno-histochemical examinations are the main way to diagnose PSH. The PSH with lymph node metastasis is relevantly rare. The effective treatment for PSH is surgical resection and it is rarely relapse or metastasize after surgical resection. Completely surgical resection should be the first choice of the treatment due to the risk of malignancy. This uncommon case we delivered shows several gene mutations， including AKT1missense mutation and mTOR missense mutation. Although the medical treatment focus on gene target is not a mainstream， the gene research and further study of PSH is necessary and meaningful.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:39:54", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:40:16", "cost": 22.101}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:44", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:40:16", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:39:53"}

The respiratory system is the most commonly affected. Many case reports have emerged which show neurological symptoms and signs， although rare neurological symptoms should be expected and treated promptly. We hereby present a relatively rare case of COVID-19 related encephalitis.\n\n【2】Case Report： A 21-year-old female with no significant comorbidities， who was tested positive for COVID-19 4 weeks ago and was self-isolating， came to the hospital with H/o high fever of 38.8℃， and altered mental status. She was febrile and delirious in the Emergency Department. Repeat testing of COVID-19 was positive. MRI showed an area of subtle restricted diffusion，Lumbar puncture was done， which was indicative of viral meningitis. Viral panels for all the known viruses that cause meningitis were negative. COVID-19 PCR in CSF could not be sent because of non-availability. EEG showed abnormal slowing with no epileptiform discharges. She was given IV antibiotics， acyclovir and Keppra， after which her mentation improved in 2 days. She was discharged on day 4after discontinuation of all antimicrobials.\n\n【3】Discussion： COVID-19 is majorly known to cause respiratory illness in patients with multiple comorbidities. Nervous system symptoms are uncommon but prevalent. Most of the nervous system signs are from strokes which are secondary to coagulopathies. Encephalitis-like syndromes are very less noted in COVID-19， and even when noted carry bad prognosis. This case is unique for the fact that it is present in a 21 year old with no known co-morbidities and had a quick resolution.\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Wuhan city of China in December 2019 and rapidly spread to more than 200 countries . World Health Organization made a report of its first case on Dec 31， 2019. By Jan 07， 2020， genetic analysis of viral isolates from affected patients indicated that the etiologic agent was a novel coronavirus distinct from those causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome(SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) . As of Mar 11， 2020，COVID-19 had been recognized in 172 countries and was declared a global Pandemic .\n\n【6】As of Jun 01， there were 6，264，742 cases and 375，513 deaths [JHU.edu].\n\n【7】The respiratory system is the most commonly affected； neurotropism also has been shown in some case reports. According to some observational studies， COVID-19 patients have presented with complaints of headache， nausea， vomiting， myalgia， dizziness，  hypogeusia， hyposmia， and impaired consciousness  symptoms that are consistent with the involvement of nervous system. The exact mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 penetrates the Central Neryous System (CNS) is not known. However， there are two theories which might have an explanation for CNS symptoms： 1. Hematogenous spread from the systemic circulation to cerebral circulation， wherein the slower blood flow is conducive to the virus， which damages the capillary endothelium and gains access to the brain.\n\n【8】2. Dissemination through the cribriform plate and olfactory bulb .\n\n【9】Neurological complications in COVID-19 infected patients have not been widely reported .

In the retrospect， since all the investigations were done on the CSF but COVID-19 PCR was not obtained in the CSF and Serum was positive for COVID-19， it was concluded that she had COVID-19 encephalitis.\n\n【42】Discussion\n\n【43】COVID-19 had created a global challenge when it broke out as a pandemic on Mar 11， 2020. It is a severe acute respiratory syndrome secondary to SARS-CoV2. So far， 6，927，639 cases are confirmed globally and 400，290 deaths. [JHU]\n\n【44】COVID-19 has various manifestations， most common of which can beasymptomatic，rangingto Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome and Multi-organ failure . The most studied manifestations of the disease are often respiratoryand coagulopathies . Central Nervous system manifestations are most often in the form of stroke due to coagulopathies， but other symptoms have been rare and reported in small numbers .\n\n【45】Coronaviruses are positive sense， single-strand enveloped RNA viruses which belong to Coronaviridae subfamily. The name comes from the Latin corona， meaning crown. Viral envelope under electron microscopy appears crown-like due to small bulbar projections formed by the viral spike (S) peplomers. Coronaviruses and Toroviridae combined form the order Nidovirales .\n\n【46】Genetic analysis of SARS-CoV2 shows a high similarity to bat SARS-like virus， belonging to the beta coronavirus.\n\n【47】Recent researchhdataonnrespiratory coronaviruses have demonstrated the capacityofthese viruses togobeyond the respiratory system to enter the nervous system and establish persistent brain infection of animals with or without induction of neurological illness.\n\n【48】Some coronaviruses experimentally can spread from airway mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors to the medullary cardio-respiratory centers . Viruses can also access the nervous system via the circumventricular organs that generally lack a Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) and via dorsal root ganglia and autonomic (including cardiac) ganglia， both of which have no Blood-Nerve Barrier (BNB).\n\n【49】Endothelial microvascular dysfunction leads to vasoconstriction with subsequent organ ischemia，inflammation with associated tissue edema，and a pro-thrombotic state.Endothelial dysfunction is also an essential factor.\n\n【50】During the epidemic outbreaks of SARS in China and MERS in Saudi Arabia， neurological signs and symptoms were reported in small numbers of patients infected with the respiratory coronaviruses SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV，respectively . Additionally， SARS-CoV-2 may incite non-inflammatory encephalopathy， which has been previously implicated in SARS-CoV-1 infection. Neurological manifestations ofSARS-CoV-1 includeeseizure，generalized polyneuropathy， mixed axonal neuropathy， and primary myopathy. Similarly， in MERS， viral encephalopathy has been reported around the world.\n\n【51】Among the proposed treatments are the protease inhibitor drugs， remdesivir， the anti-IL6 monoclonal antimalarials (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine)， antibody tocilizumab， and convalescent serum or immunoglobulin have proven efficacy， yet more than 200 clinical trials are underway. No treatment has demonstrated high-level evidence of success with confusion， coma， ataxia， and focal motor deficits .\n\n【52】Treatment with IVIG and corticosteroids has been variable. IVIG may mitigate severe cytokine storming and alleviate secondary vasogenic edema. Seizures should be managed with AEDs and， given anecdotal evidence， anti-inflammatories/anti-parasitics， hydroxychloroquine， and viral protease inhibitors such lopinavir and ritonavir may be beneficial. Special attention should be paid to increasing intracranial hypertension by using dehydrating agents such as mannitol and furosemide. The median hospital-stay for those discharged alive is ten days Considered .\n\n【53】Various neurological aspects of coronaviruses have been reported from strokes due to coagulopathy to hemorrhagic encephalitis. Things to be noted are that with most COVID-19associatedencephalopathies the prognosis has been poor so far in the few reported cases. It is interesting to note that a young female without any comorbidities except obesity， could recover very fast and was able to return to her baseline in 2-3 days.\n\n【54】Conclusions\n\n【55】2. Most of the encephalitis/encephalopathy associated with COVID-19 is in patients with multiple comorbidities and elderly，but it can also be seen in younger population with few comorbidities.\n\n【56】3. Contrast to older people with comorbidities， younger patients has a much benign course， with eventual recovery.\n\n【57】4. As we suspect fewer complications in younger populations， it is important to look out for specific symptoms which might be related to COVID-19.\n\n【58】5. Because some of the neurological sequela of this disease can be devastating， the neuroscience community must be aware of the neurological impact of COVID-19 and how to approach it.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:47:01", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:47:30", "cost": 29.629}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:44", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:47:30", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:47:00"}

However， the term \"epidermolysis\" is not correct as epidermal disruption is not the primary change in two of the main categories of EB. Currently，there is no definitive and curative treatment for EB. Hence， the mainstay of treatment is symptomatic， supportive and preventive. The maior challenge encountered in the care of a neonate with EB is optimum skin care and expert nursing care.\n\n【2】Keywords： Epidermolysis bullosa； Optimum skin care\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) is a heterogeneous group of inherited， mechanobullous disorders characterized by extreme fragility of the skin and mucous membranes which gives rise to the formation of blisters and ulcers following minor trauma .\n\n【5】However， the term \"epidermolysis\" is not correct as epidermal disruption is not the primary change in two of the main categories of EB . According to the recent data， the prevalence of EB has estimated to 8 to 10 million per live birth. The pathophysiology is mutations in various structural proteins in the skin . Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex (EBS)， functional epidermolysis bullosa and dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa are the three major types. EBS is the most common among them . EBS may manifest either at birth or during the neonatal period.\n\n【6】These 3 subtypes are differentiated according to the level at which the tissue separates and the blisters form， that is， depending on whether this happens above， within， or below the epidermal basement membrane .\n\n【7】The disease is always painful， is often pervasive and debilitating. It affects 1 out of every 50，000live births and those born with it are often called Butterfly Children because as the analogy goes their skin is as fragile as the wings of the butterfly . There is no treatment or cure .\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 2.1 kg， single term male， small for gestation age was born to third degree consanguin ity to a second gravida mother. The mother was booked at 31 weeks of gestation； subsequently she had regular antenatal visits. There was history of previous sibling death at day 12 of life due to bullous lesions. The present baby did not require any resuscitation at birth and cried immediately after birth with Apgar score of 8 at 1 minute and 9 at 54 minute. Baby had bullous lesions at legs at birth. He was started on IV antibiotics (Inj Vancomycin) as blood culture grew Methicillin-Susceptible Staphylococcus Aureus (MSSA). Lumbar puncture was not done. Dermatologist opinioned that bullae could be Epidermolysis bullosa . In view of reappearing bullous lesions， baby was sent to higher center on day 9 of life for further management. The baby was referred and admitted in neonatal intensive care unit of our tertiary care facility. There was appearance of new lesions and healing of older one on friction sites. There was no history of poor feeding/recurrent vomiting/decrease urine output/top milk feeding/umbilical discharge\n\n【10】Skin lesions\n\n【11】Epidermolysis Bullosa (Junctional type)： In view of waxing and waning course of bullae， skin consultation was taken and same diagnosis of EB (Junctional type most likely severe form) was made. Genetic consultation was taken and sample for molecular diagnosis was sent. Parents were counseled regarding skin care， prognosis. Gradually， there was worsening of dermatological status in form of new appearance of bullae leaving denuded skin behind. There was bleeding from denuded skin area and oral mucosa on minimal handling.\n\n【12】Respiratory\n\n【13】On day 14 of life， baby had respiratory distress in the form of increased respiratory rate， new appearance of crepitation in bilateral lung field and frequent desaturation. So， the baby was intubated on day 17 and started on SIMV mode of ventilation.\n\n【14】On day 14 of life， baby had abdominal distension along with decreased urine output (0.5 ml/kr/hr) with increment in serum urea. NS bolus was given and dehydration correction @75 ml/kg was started. Fluid was continued @150 ml/kg/day. Baby also developed metabolic acidosis with pH of 6.9 and BE-18 for which sodium bicarbonate was given after discussing with Pediatric nephrology team. There was further worsening of renal status in the form of decreased urine output and deranged RFT. Peritoneal dialysis was started.\n\n【15】Hemodynamic\n\n【16】On day 18 of life， baby was having feeble pulse and increased tachycardia. So， NS bolus (10 ml/kg) was given and later dopamine and dobutamine was added. In view of poor pulses， adrenaline was added.\n\n【17】Feeding and nutrition\n\n【18】Baby had abdominal distension on day 14 of life， so baby was kept NPO. Earlier OG feeds and Katori spoon feed was given.\n\n【19】Lethargy/Late onset sepsis\n\n【20】In view oflethargy and abdominal distension， baby was evaluated for sepsis. CBC revealed leucopenia with thrombocytopenia. Inj Piperacillin-Tazobactam， Amikacin and Vancomycin were started in renal modified doses. Child was having persistent thrombocytopenia and required multiple platelets transfusion. Blood culture grew klebsiella (blood culture reported after the demise of baby).\n\n【21】Hyperkalemia\n\n【22】On Day 15， baby had high potassium， so potassium was omitted from IV fluid and NaHCO3 was given. Repeat value was 4.8 mEq/l.\n\n【23】Anemia with thrombocytopenia\n\n【24】Baby was transfused with PRBC and PRP as Hb was 7.7 gm% and Platelets were 13000/mm.\n\n【25】Terminal Events\n\n【26】Baby had refractory shock and had sudden cardiac arrest at 2pm of day. CPR was started and child received 3 doses of adrenaline， but baby could not be revived and expired at 2：15 pm. Parents were counseled for autopsy but consent was not given.\n\n【27】Cause ofDeath\n\n【28】Immediate cause Septic shock.\n\n【29】Antecedent Cause\n\n【30】Sepsis with Acute renal failure with DIC with Epidermolysis bullosa.\n\n【31】Discussion\n\n【32】Epidermolysis bullosa has no gender， geographical or racial preponderance Epidermolysis bullosa simplex is the most prevalent phenotype whereas autosomal recessive dystrophic and junctional EB are rare . In families with EB or those at risk for having a child with EB， prenatal and preimplantation diagnosis is possible in order to appropriately guide the prospective parents. Prenatal diagnosis using DNA has 98% accuracy .\n\n【33】Currently， there is no definitive and curative treatment for EB. Hence， the mainstay of treatment is symptomatic， supportive and preventive . The supportive management includes： Prevention of skin trauma to avoid new blister formation by gentle handling of the infant， use of loose-fitting clothing， padding bony prominences， and avoiding adhesives or direct rubbing of the skin， infant should be maintained in cool， air-conditioned environments as overheating can increase skin fragility. The major challenge encountered in the care of a neonate with EB is optimum skin care and expert nursing care， more so， with a preterm， low birth weight neonate who undergoes many invasive skin procedures as in the index case .\n\n【34】EB is not a contraindication for any vaccination . A key to successful management is expert nursing care. Special precautions need to be taken for older children in the use of adhesive tapes， sphygmomanometer cuffs， tourniquets and other instruments that cause shearing of skin or mucous membranes . The erosions should be cleaned with sterile normal saline and covered with non-adherent dressings.Non-adhesive dressing pads or Vaseline impregnated gauze covered by soft， bulky dressings are ideal. The treatment plan must be individualized， and optimal communication among team members is a vital factor in obtaining good results. Nutritional support is important for adequate growth and development and to promote optimal wound healing. To families of affected children， prenatal diagnosis using molecular techniques offers genetic counseling .\n\n【35】Diagnostically， EB remains a challenge. The definitive diagnosis of inherited EB is made with Transmission Electron Microscopy(TEM)， Immunofluorescence antigen mapping (IF)， and EB related monoclonal antibody testing as well as mutational analysis. In order to make a correct diagnosis， it is important that the skin biopsy should be performed properly， as described by Intong and Murell . In index case， skin biopsy was not done due to unwillingness of parents.\n\n【36】Conclusion\n\n【37】Epidermolysis bullosa， a genetically determined skin fragility disorder with variable degrees of extracutaneous involvement. The clinical spectrum ranges from localized skin disease to a life- threatening and disabling disease with extensive extracutaneous involvement. All three major types of EB， namely EB simplex， Junctional EB， Dystrophic EB， can present with blistering and erosions at birth and cannot be distinguished clinically in the newborn period. The diagnosis of EB can be confirmed via a skin biopsy for immunofluorescence mapping. Although the clinical features are multiple and varied， treatment still remains a major challenge. There is still a long way to go， meticulous skin care and good nursing care， and gene therapy could possibly significantly alleviate the suffering of the neonates in the future.\n\n【38】Contribution\n\n【39】Dabas Heena has the prime responsibility of data acquisition and draft preparation and review of literature.

It is a humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor A and impairs its binding to vascular endothelial growth factor receptor typel and type2 and leads to tumor shrinkages. the basic mechanisms is that， antiangiogenesis treatment normalizes tumor flow initially resulting important tissue oxygenation and decreased interstitial pressure with increasing the delivery of cytotoxic agents to tumor. They confer better efficacy in combination with chemotherapy during earlier treatment because late stage breast cancer expresses many different angiogenic factors such as fibroblast growth factors in contrast early cancer express more vascular endothelial growth factors. If in future the biomarker would be a clinical practice，especially circulating tumor cells， it is possible to select and predict the activity of the disease and targeted therapy with bevacizumab to be done on precise time of tumors with angiogenesis activity . Probably， considering the breast cancer carcinogenesis starting with a very small size tumor activity， it is possible to control the tumor more efficiently by antiangiogenesis drugs， may be attempting for curability of breast cancer in next decades.\n\n【4】Because of its antiangiogenesis effects on central nervous system metastasis， in future it can be a preventive drug therapy delaying seeding oftumor in life threating site of body which is difficult to control by oncologist.

She had been using the drug for seven months at a dose of 800 mg daily for a chronic interstitial cystitis. Although an attempt was made to taper the medication to discontinuation， severe urinary pain impeded this process， and the patient could only accept a reduction in dose to 600 mg daily. Nonetheless， the hemoglobin improved from 9.1 g/dl to 10.4 g/dl after just one month on the lower dose. Several months later， while still taking 600 mg daily， the hemoglobin continued to improve to11.9 g/dl.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Phenazopyridine hydrochloride (DPP) is a urinary analgesic used to treat patients experiencing pain，burning， urgency， or frequency caused by lower urinary tract mucosa irritation. These maladies may be due to infection， trauma， surgery， endoscopic procedures， imaging studies， or catheters . PPD is able to ease patients' discomfort by providing a local anesthetic effect on the urinary tract mucosa. However， the precise mode ofaction of DPP is unknown.\n\n【4】DPP is found in a medication called AZO， and is sold over the counter in many states. The recommended dose for adults is 200 mg three times a day after meals for a maximum of 2 days in patients with normal renal function. While there is no definitive dose adjustment for renal impairment， drug labeling states that “the dose must be lowered in those with impaired renal function ”.\n\n【5】DPP (2-6-Diamino-3-Phenylazo Pyridine) is hepatically metabolized via hydroxylation to produce 2，3，6-triaminopyridine， or aniline . It is also excreted unchanged， as shown in Figure. The ease with which DPP can be acquired as an OTC product sets the table for patients suffering complications from longer term use of this drug. It has been reported that chronic use can cause hemolytic anemia in the elderly ， those with G6PD mutations ， those with mild renal failure， and others . This case report will demonstrate yet another example of chronic DPP use leading to hemolytic anemia.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 68-year-old woman with history of type 2 diabetes， hypertension， hyperlipidemia， hypothyroidism， osteoporosis， obstructive sleep apnea， previous pulmonary emboli， migraines， and interstitial cystitis was experiencing onset of shortness of breath， nausea， decreased appetite， dizziness and diarrhea over several weeks. In July of that year， her primary care provider found that she had a progressing case of anemia of unknown etiology.\n\n【8】The patient then contacted a pharmacist for a medication consult on August 16h， 2020. The pharmacist perused her medications， labs， and problem lists. Based on her labs from early August， as well as her history of recently beginning dailyhigh dose DPP， the pharmacist suspected she might be experiencing DPP-induced hemolytic anemia. The patient reported she had been taking two 100mg DPP tablets four times daily since January 2020. Clinically relevant labs included： Hgb of 8.7 g/dl， an MCV of 110 fL， haptoglobin of <10 mg/dl，LDH 383 U/L， a reticulocyte count of 295(11%)， and normal iron labs. The pharmacist recommended that she be referred to a hematologist for a complete work-up and diagnosis. At the behest ofthe pharmacist， she attempted to gradually taper off the DPP. However， this process was stalled because of the exacerbation of urinary pain at the lower doses.\n\n【9】By 9.1.20， the patient had managed to reduce the dose of DPP to 200 mg TID and had her first hematology visit. Her lab results at that visit yielded a Hgb 9.1 g/dl MCV of 108 fL， haptoglobin <10， mg/dl and LDH 267 U/L， all which suggested hemolytic anemia. Due to negative Direct Anti-globulin Tests (DAT) also done at that time， hematology felt they had ruled out autoimmune hemolytic anemia. As a result， the suspicion of DPP-induced anemia was strengthened.On 9.10.20， a decrease in the DPP dose from 200 mg TID to 200 mg BID was attempted. However， it was not successful， and 200 mg TID dose was resumed. During this time， she also visited a urologist in an attempt to find other remedies toward relieving her interstitial cystitis- related pain.\n\n【10】At the time of her second hematology appointment on 9.29.20， she was still taking DPP 200 mg TID. However， at the slightly lower dose， the patient's labs showed some improvement. Her Hgb was increased from 9.1 to 10.4 g/dL， MCV decreased from 108 fL to 103fL， haptoglobin increased from <10 mg/dl to 23 mg/dl， LDH dropped slightly from 267 U/L to 256 U/L. As a result， the hematologist concluded that there was no emergent need to completely taper her off the medication. Therefore， the patient wished to continue on DPP200 mg TID.

Results showed an Hgb increase to 11.9 g/dL， an MCV decrease to92.7 fL， and all other lab results in normal ranges. The hematologists chose to not repeat haptoglobin or LDHlevels.

As previously mentioned， the drug is hepatically metabolized via hydroxylation to form aniline and its congeners . Of course， the higher the dose， the higher the concentrations of these oxidizing metabolites. At some critical individual-specific“threshold”level， the oxidizing effect of the aniline derivatives exceeds the endogenous reducing capacity of the enzymes within the host's RBCs. This then results in the net increased catabolism of hemoglobin and the clinical manifestation of hemolytic anemia .\n\n【19】In this case， the anemia was quite significant on 800 mg a day of DPP. The hemoglobin fell below 9 g/dl； and， the patient possessed symptoms of systemic hypoxia. Meanwhile， over a period of a few months， reducing the DPP dose 600 mg a dayyielded an improvement nthiee hemoglobin to 11.9g/dl withLSsome commensiirate improvements in other labs and exercise tolerance. The findings of a low haptoglobin and elevated LDH in this case were other classic characteristics of hemolytic anemia， and these normalized as early as late September . Initially， it was hoped that the drug could be stopped altogether， but the continuance of urinary symptoms precluded the patient from doing this. This case shows that， in patients who do symptomatically require longer term daily use of DPP， a small reduction in dose could possibly reduce the magnitude of a drug-induced hemolytic anemia.\n\n【20】There have been several published reports of hemolytic anemia from the use of DPP in the literature . Previous cases have shown an association of hemolytic anemia with chronic use of this drug in the elderly population， those with renal impairment， and those with G6PD mutations . The patient in this case was 68years old with multiple comorbidities， but she had normal renal function. A G6PD test was not done. The hematologists confirmed the pharmacist's suspicion through their clinical experience and the use of serial labs such as the hemoglobin， haptoglobin， LDH， and elevations in MCV levels. What made this particular case so unique was the stark difference in the magnitude ofthe anemia seen between the 800 mg and 600 mg daily doses.\n\n【21】Although DPP is not labeled for long term use， there are patients who can find no other modality for controlling bladder pain. All patients on long term DPP should be monitored for hemolytic anemia， especially if on higher doses. However， if hemolytic anemia does occur， a complete discontinuation ofthe medication may not be necessary.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:47:34", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:47:53", "cost": 19.218}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:44", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:47:53", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:47:33"}

Among these， water borne diseases like diarrhea， typhoid， infectious hepatitis etc. are on rise. Waterborne diseases are very common in developing countries like Bangladesh due to intake of contaminated water from local water supply authority， along with inadequate sewage and water drainage systems. Multiple infections can occur with contaminated water. Viral hepatitis and typhoid fever are endemic in our country. Both are transmitted feco-orally and are associated with poor sanitation， poor hygiene. Sometimes more than one type of infection along with coexisting febrile illness makes the diagnosis and management a challenging task . Few studies have shown the co-existence of these two together， but still the diagnostic dilemma whether clinical manifestations are due to viral hepatitis or a feature oftyphoid hepatitis， always challenge a physician . We report a case of Co-infection of Salmonella Typhi with Hepatitis A virus infection.\n\n【5】A 10 year old young girl came to us with complaints of low grade intermittent fever for last 10days， yellow discoloration of eyes and urine for last 5 days and upper abdominal pain and nausea for last 3 days. There was no a chill， arthralgia， myalgia， diarrhea， night sweats， nor preceding weight loss. There was no past history of jaundice， blood transfusion or surgical procedures. She had family history of Salmonella infection. There uncle was positive for salmonella 10 days back She gave history of consumption of un-boiled water of WASA. On examination， the patient was febrile， had icterus. Patient was fully conscious and had no evidence of bleeding from any site. Urinary output was adequate. Vitals were pulse rate of 100/min， respiratory rate 24/min， blood pressure 110/60 mmHg and temperature 100 degree F on per abdomen examination there was no abdominal distension， liver was palpable 5 cm below right costal margin with span of 12 cm. It was soft and tender. There was no other organomegaly. Spleen was not palpable. There was n evidence offree fluid in abdomen with shifting dullness present. Other systemic examination reveals nothing abnormality. Investigations showed hemoglobin of 10.8 gm%， totalleukocyte count 17，000cells/cumm with 65% polymorphs. Platelets were 170，000/cumm. Peripheral blood film showed anisopoikilocytosis with few microcytes. Serum biochemistry showed-total bilirubin 3.88 mg/dl， AST 895 U/L， ALT 1196 U/L， alkaline phosphatase 270 U/L， albumin 2.8 gm%， PTI of 12.2 sec with INR 1.01. Renal functions and electrolytes were normal. Among viral markers IgM anti HAV came out to be positive. HBsAg was negative. Blood culture isolated Salmonella typhi. Widal test was positive in high titers. Salmonella typhi IgM found positive. X-ray chest PA view showed nothing abnormality. Ultrasound Abdomen showed hepatomegaly 14.7 cm vertically parenchymal echo texture is uniform with prominent periportal echoes. Gall bladder lumen narrowed with thickened wall (7.1 mm). A diagnosis of Enteric fever with Hepatitis A was made and patient was started with intravenous Ceftriaxone and supportive care (rifaximin， lactulose， domperidone， zinc). Patient became afebrile on day 4 of admission，oral intake and general well being status was improved. Patient was discharged on oral antibiotics. On follow up she was afebrile， with no evidence of fever or tender hepatomegaly， icterus was reduced. Patient was advised to avoid consumption of unboiled water from WASA and for Vi-Poly-saccharide typhoid vaccine after 4 weeks.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Enteric fever is endemic in Bangladesh with more than 100，000cases of enteric fever occurring each year . Although clinical hepatitis is unusual (probably fewer than 25% of all cases)， liver involvement is present in almost all cases. Establishing a diagnosis of salmonella hepatitis may be difficult for us as we are in developing countries， because the manifestations are similar to those of other forms of acute hepatitis， including viral hepatitis， leptospirosis and malaria. The clinical presentation of salmonella hepatitis resembles that of viral hepatitis， but certain features help in differentiation. In particular， high fever (often more than 40℃) and bradycardia(inappropriate response of heart rate to degree of fever) seem to be more common among patients with Salmonella hepatitis.In addition， the biochemical profile is significantly different from that of viral hepatitis and suggests the presence ofan infiltrative process in the liver rather than hepatitis . In a comparison of 25 cases of Salmonella hepatitis each year in Bangladesh ， the cases of Salmonella hepatitis were more likely to have a disproportionately increased serum alkaline phosphatase level and that serum aminotransferase values were far lower than with acute viral hepatitis . Also unlike， viral hepatitis， salmonella hepatitis was associated with fever and a left shift of white blood cells. Jaundice is unusual， and many cases of Salmonella hepatitis are anicteric. In untreated patients， jaundice may be delayed from the second to the fourth week of the illness. Jaundice was noticed in the starting of second week of illness in our patient. Our patient was initially diagnosed as enteric fever due to positive Salmonella IgM for Salmonella typhi. Co-infection of hepatitis with enteric fever was suspected because of association ofhigh grade fever with markedly raised liver enzymes. As in our setting typhoid fever and viral hepatitis are common ailment and Salmonella hepatitis is a rare incident so， we like to highlight the case to reduce causality in the future. The timely institution of antimicrobial therapy has reduced typhoid case-fatality rates from 15% to 20% to less than 1%. Ascites or pleural effusion may occur as a part of complications. The exact mechanism is unknown， though immune complexes have been cited as possible etiological factor. Pleural effusion is a possible benign and early complication of acute hepatitis A infection that resolves spontaneously regardless of illness out-come. But due to early detection and starting of parenteral antibiotic therapy we can avoid the hassle smartly .\n\n【8】Conclusion\n\n【9】Co-infection should always be kept in mind while dealing with cases of enteric fever or viral hepatitis with atypical features. In order to reduce the burden of disease， vaccination against typhoid and Hepatitis A should be included in the immunization schedule Despite restricted finances in our country vaccines against typhoid and Hepatitis A cannot be incorporated in the national immunization schedule at present but these vaccines can be offered on an individual basis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:23:58", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:25:08", "cost": 69.475}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:44", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:25:08", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:23:59"}

These tumors may secrete hormones； however 60% are considered ‘non-functional'. FunctionalpNETs are known to secrete insulin， gastrin， glucagon， vasoactive intestinal peptide or somatostatin. A small number of case reports have also identified pNETs secreting ACTH in patients who presented with clinical features of Cushing’s syndrome. We report the case of a patient treated for a known pNET believed to be non-functioning， who went on to develop features ofectopic ACTH syndrome(EAS).\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 59-year-old man with type 2 diabetes was diagnosed with a pNET following investigation for unintentional weight loss. The patient was then admitted to hospital for a subtotal pancreatectomy and splenectomy in addition to medical treatment with the Somatostatin analogue“Lanreotide\".He had a complicated post-operative course and remained in hospital for an extended period due to recurrent infections， reduced mobility， confusion and hallucinations of unknown cause. During this time his blood pressure and blood glucose were persistently difficult to control.\n\n【8】Six months after surgery the patient was referred to hospital due to a routine blood test which had found neutrophilia with a White Cell Count (WBCs) of over 46.0 ×10/L. He complained of persistent fatigue and reduced mobility but had no other symptoms. A bone marrow biopsy indicated reactive changes but showed no evidence of a primary hematological diagnosis. He was also found to be hyperglycemic， hypokalemic with a plasma potassium of 3.1 mmol/L and his liver function was deranged with ALP 153 IU/L and ALT 233 IU/L. A recurrence of the pNET with evidence of lymphatic spread was found on CT.\n\n【9】Two months later the patient was readmitted with shortness of breath， cough and leg weakness. His mobility had significantly deteriorated， and he now required a wheel chair to mobilize. He was confused and complaining of hallucinations.\n\n【10】Table 1： The patient's blood results.\n\n| Laboratory  | Results  | Reference range  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Haemoglobin  | 136 g/L  | 130-180 g/L  |\n| Platelets  | 337x109L  | 150-400x10%L  |\n| White cells  | 19.0x109L  | 4-11x10°L  |\n| Neutrophils  | 17.64x10  | 2.5x10  |\n| Lymphocytes  | 0.67x109L  | 1.5x10/L  |\n| Monocytes  | 0.61x10%L  | 0.9x109L  |\n| Sodium  | 142 mmol/L  | 135-145 mmol/L  |\n| Potassium  | 3.4 mmol/L  | 3.3mmol/L  |\n| Calcium (corr.)  | 2.47 mmol/L  | 2.6mmol/L  |\n| Urea  | 4.0 mmol/L  | 2.7 mmo/L  |\n| ALP  | 323U/L  | 30-130 U/L  |\n| ALT  | 48 U/L  | 5-35 IU/L  |\n| Glucose  | 11.0mmol/L  | 3.5 mmo/L  |\n\n【12】ALP： Alkaline Phosphatase； ALT： Alkaline Transaminase\n\n【13】He also had increased oxygen requirement， thin skin， and reduced tone and sensation in the lower limbs. The patient had persistent hypokalemia. His blood glucose， WBCs and LFTs also remained elevated . A whole spine MRI ruled out cord compression but showed degenerative changes and multiple fractures of the vertebrae. A chest CT revealed consolidation and a new sternal fracture.\n\n【14】Despite improvement of the chest infection after treatment， the patient continued to suffer with confusion， fatigue， poor mobility as well as intractable hypertension， hyperglycaemia and hypokalemia. Tests were， therefore， carried out to screen for Cushing's syndrome. These results are indicative of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome.\n\n【15】A pituitary MRI was carried out， which did not find evidence of a pituitarylesion. Inferior petrosal sampling would normally be carried out to definitely exclude a pituitary source of ACTH； however the patient was not eligible for this invasive procedure due to his poor functional status. As a result of the known neuroendocrine tumour， the very high ACTHleveland the persistent hypokalemia， a diagnosis of ectopic ACTH Cushing's syndrome secondary to metastatic pNET was made. The patient was started on Metyrapone， a reversible inhibitor of 11β-hydroxylase which blocks cortisol biosynthesis， with dexamethasone on a block and replace regimen. He also received a prophylactic treatment for Pneumocystis jiroveci in addition to prophylactic anti-coagulation.\n\n【16】Since initiation of treatment， the patient’s quality of life has greatly improved. He has had a significant reduction in the frequency of infections， his blood sugars have improved， his blood pressure is now well controlled on Spironolactone and he has regained some mobility. However， a recent CT has found marked enlargement of the pNET recurrence and he is now being considered for peptide receptor radionucleotide therapy.\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】We report a rare case of EAS in a patient with a complicated post operative course after the resection ofa pNET.\n\n【19】Most of the cases reported to date of this condition were for patients presenting with Cushing syndrome， where the tumour was discovered during investigations for the source ofthe ACTH.\n\n【20】Table 2： Screening for Cushing's syndrome.\n\n| Laboratory  | Results  | Reference range  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Mid night Cortisol  | 1583 nmol/L  | fnormal <50 nmol/L)  |\n| ACTH  | 534 pg/mL  | normal range 10-60 pg/mL  |\n| Overnight dexamethasone suppression test： Cortisol level  | 1314 nmol/L  | normal <50 nmol/L  |\n\n【22】We therefore wish to highlight the importance of including cortisol and ACTH levels in screening for neuroendocrine activity in pancreatic tumors. This patient had many of the complications related to Cushing's syndrome and an earlier screening and diagnosis could have helped ameliorating his symptoms and halting disease progression.\n\n【23】Diagnosis of functional pNETs is typically guided by clinical symptoms and confirmed by elevated plasma levels of the hormone. An ACTH-secreting pNET will lead to clinical presentation with Cushing’s syndrome. These patients present with a variety of Cushing features such as truncal obesity， hirsutism， bruising， striae， muscle weakness and wasting， fatigue， mood disturbance， recurrent infection，hypertension， osteoporosis and hyperglycaemia .One case series of ACTH-secreting pNETs reported patients presenting with hypokalemia and severe fatigue before the classical symptoms of Cushing's syndrome， which they suggest is due to a rapid increase in serum cortisol.\n\n【24】Cushing’s syndrome can be screened for using midnight cortisol levels， urinary free cortisol， dexamethasone suppression test and salivary cortisol. If hypercortisolism is confirmed， serum basal ACTH should be measured to differentiate ACTH-dependent or independent causes.\n\n【25】ACTH-dependent Cushing’s syndrome is most commonly caused by pituitary adenomas . This should be investigated by pituitaryimaging， inferior petrosal sinus sampling and Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone (CRH) tests. The CRH test would show a marked rise in cortisol in pituitary-dependent disease compared to ectopic disease . Cross-sectional imaging studies and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy can be used to localize tumors which may be an ectopic source of ACTH hypersecretion . Central and ectopic sources of ACTH may also be differentiated by plasma ACTH level(typically very high in ectopic disease)， high-dose dexamethasone suppression test (basal cortisol suppression more likely in pituitary-dependent disease) and serum potassium (hypokalemia nearly always seen in ectopic disease).\n\n【26】Management of functioning pNETs requires treatment for both the hormone-excess state and the tumour itself. Surgical removal of the tumor is essential as malignant behavior is reported in >50%of pNETs . Where surgery is ineffective in controlling hormone hypersecretion， medical treatment is essential in reducing morbidity and mortality. Suppression of cortisol hypersecretion can be achieved with inhibitors of steroidogenesis such as metyrapone， mitotane and ketoconazole . While these agents offer rapid control of hypercortisolism， there is a risk of cortisol “escape”with long-term use . The somatostatin analogue pasireotide may be beneficial in these patients through its direct anti-tumors effects . Peptide receptor radionucleotide therapy has also been identified as helpful in controlling EAS .\n\n【27】Conclusion for ACTH-dependent Cushing’s syndrome in patients with pNETs especially if they present with non-specific symptoms.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:46:56", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:47:13", "cost": 16.571}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:44", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:47:12", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:46:56"}

It is a disease identified since World War II when it caused significant mortality and morbidity in the soldiers posted in Southeast Asia . But there has been a significant decline in the number of cases in the subsequent decades. It is spread by the bite of tick and in 45% to 55% of cases it is associated with Eschar at the site ofthe bite . In scrub typhus， there is significant focal and disseminated vasculitis which involves the spleen， liver， heart， and lungs， sometimes present with nonspecific multi-organ involvement . The prevalence and outcome of kidney involvement in scrub typhus like AKI are largely unknown . There is a paucity of literature to prove immune complex-mediated glomerulonephritis in Rickettsial infection in the pediatric population. Like malaria scrub typhus can also cause nephrotic syndrome， hence it is important to keep in mind the possibility of Akl in patients of Scrub typhus . Infection Related Glomerulonephritis (IRGN) is an immune complex mediated renal injury occurring simultaneously with the infection. Till date， though rare， all the reported cases of IRGN were either caused by Streptococcus or Staphylococcus sp. IRGN caused by Rickettsial infection， its disease course and fatality are largely unknown till date.\n\n【4】A 9-year-old girl presented to the emergency department with complaint of persistent low-grade fever for two weeks which was followed by progressive swelling of the face starting with periorbital puffiness and bilateral lower limbs for five days. It was associated with oliguria and gross hematuria for two days. It was not associated with loose stool， vomiting， or burning micturition. There was no history of similar episodes in the past nor was there any other significant medical history. During admission， she was conscious， oriented， febrile (axillary temperature 101.

There was bilateral non-tender cervical lymphadenopathy， periorbital puffiness， hepatomegaly， pitting pedal edema and ascites marked by presence of shifting dullness.\n\n【5】On admission her investigation revealed urine albumin ++， urine RBC-10/HPF， pus cell 10-12/HPF， serum albumin 2.8 mg/dl， serum cholesterol- 137 mg/dl， complete hemogram showing Hb10.3 g/dl，platelets being 2.1 lakhs， total leukocyte count serum C3  and negative ANA serum urea was 69 mg/dl and creatinine value being 1.15 mg/dl which gradually decreased to urea 26 mg/dl and creatinine being 0.9 mg/dl serum ASO titer being negative and so was the Malaria MP-ICT. CRP was 8.1 mg/dl and LFT revealing serum Bilirubin (total)-0.4 mg/dl， serum bilirubin (direct)-0.2 mg/dl， AST-23 IU/L，ALT-26IU/L，ALP-110 IU/L.\n\n【6】In view of persistent fever and pending urine and blood culture report， she was treated with empirical intravenous antibiotics(ceftriaxone) and oral amlodipine to control blooddpressure. However， she had continued fever， cultures reports were negative but with persistent high CRP (42 mg/dl)， non-response to antibiotics， persistent fever， hypertension， negative culture， low C3 (46 mg/dl)， gross hematuria， hypertension，lymphadenopathy，and hepatomegaly， further work up was done to rule out unusual infection. Investigations for scrub typhus revealed positive IgM positive， suggestive of infection. Based on lab reports Infection Related Glomerulonephritis(IRGN) was considered and she was treated with Doxycycline (4 mg/kg/day) and after 3 days fever subsided and after 5 days the edema started subsiding patient was discharged in a hemodynamically stable condition with a diagnosis of infection related glomerulonephritis due to scrub typhus and resolving AKI with hypertension which was controlled with medication.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】It is not common to find renal involvement in scrub typhus. In the background of a febrile illness patients can present with acute kidney injury. The urine examination with albuminuria， microscopic hematuria and proteinuria is most common presentation . In this case report we have presented a 9-year female child with hematuria， hypertension and edema with fever suggesting a nephro-nephrotic syndrome like presentation initially which was later confirmed to be infection related glomerulonephritis due to scrub typhus. Glomerulonephritis may be rarely caused by Rickettsial infection. Rickettsial infections have been overlooked as a cause of AKI， especially in children. Rickettsial infection has not been reported as a cause of AKI in children as per a recent study in central India . However lower incidences of AKI (2-10%) have been reported in certain studies. As per Yen et al.， AKI is a rare but serious complication in scrub typhus infection . The main mechanism of AKI being impaired renal perfusion because of volume depletion or an increased vascular permeability. Overall kidney involvement is believed as a part of multi-organ involvement in patients with severe scrub typhus disease . According to Dumler et al.， prerenal azotemia is the most common pathophysiology of renal failure in case of typhus related systemic vasculitis . Glassock et al.  in a recent study proposed a nomenclature for glomerulonephritis associated with infections and classified them under two heads； post-infectious glomerulonephritisSanddInfection Related Glomerulonephritis(IRGN). Here our patient had few clinical findings like fever， weight gain， edema without having any latent period which is suggestive of IRGN， related to the primary infection. In contrast to PSGN， most other pathogens cause glomerulonephritis when infection is still active， hence the term Infection Related Glomerulonephritis (IRGN) has been suggested .\n\n【9】Conclusion\n\n【10】Scrub typhus can have varied clinical presentations and is being under diagnosed due to low index of suspicion and lack of awareness among physicians. Considering the prevalence of scrub typhus in India， patients presenting with persistent fever and AKI should be investigated for scrub typhus. Early diagnosis and treatment will reduce the mortality as well as morbidity significantly.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:31:04", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:31:11", "cost": 7.141}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:44", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:31:11", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:31:00"}

It is responsible for most of the non-traumatic amputation of the lower limb .\n\n【1】Amputation of a digit in the foot causes a change in the biomechanics of the amputated limb. This potentially creates higher pressure areas and new bony deformities that leads to another ulcer and subsequently leads to amputation， especially with first ray amputation . A study by Izumi and associates found that there is an increased risk of reamputation of the same limb within 6months after the initial amputation .\n\n【2】Diabetic foot infections have a spectrum of clinical presentation， varying in severity and this present a great challenge in the management. There is difficulty in identifying the optimal treatment for specific patient with different clinical presentation. The debates focus around the roles of antibiotic therapy only， combined antibiotic therapy with limited debridement or a more radical surgery such as amputation.\n\n【3】Aragon-Sanchez classified osteomyelitis in diabetic foot ulcer in order to guide the optimal method oftreatment . His system comprised 4 classes of osteomyelitis that assess the presence of ischemia and soft tissue involvement .\n\n【4】He observed 82.2% of total 94 patients who presented with infected diabetic foot ulcer， had osteomyelitis. There was no amputation performed in class 1. However， 37.5% of class 2 (n=16)，82%of class 3 (n=17)， and all 23 patient in class 4 had amputation . This confirmed the positive correlation between presence of soft tissue involvementand ischemia with higher rate ofamputation. The findings also support the notion that presence of osteomyelitis does not necessitate amputation. However， the weakness of this classification is that the presence of soft tissue involvement can only be confirmed intraoperatively.\n\n【5】Virtual amputation falls under the category ofconservative surgery. It is defined as any procedure in which bone and non-viable soft tissue are removed without amputation of any part of the foot is undertaken . The procedure is aimed at preserving the physical appearance of foot while removing the infection load . This is coupled with antibiotic therapy to achieve remission in infection. The antibiotic duration should be tailored according to wound condition and culture with infective markers as guidance to predict remission of acute infection.\n\n【6】Table 1： Osteomyelitis grading system in diabetic foot ulcer.\n\n| Class  | Description  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Class  | Osteomyelitis  | Soft tissue involvement  | Ischemia  |\n| 1  | Yes  | No  | No  |\n| 2  | Yes  | No  | Yes  |\n| 3  | Yes  | Yes  |  |\n| 4  | Yes  | No  | No  |\n\n【8】The end result is minimal disruption in the biomechanics of the foot， therefore avoiding the creation of another high-pressure point within the same foot， which in turn creates another ulcer. Furthermore，the psychological effect on patient is greater in a positive way as patient is able to keep the normal appearance of the foot.\n\n【9】Proper wound care and bandaging while waiting for the wound to heal in a normal axis following the other toes.

The management was conservative and the patient discharged after 16 days of hospital admission. We reporting， acute pancreatitis is the presenting feature however in previous reports of COVID-19， it may be a complication. Therefore， clinicians should be aware of gastrointestinal symptoms in the current pandemic.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 63-year-old female patient presented to the emergency department at Mediclinic Parkview Hospital， Dubai， United Arab Emirates， with history of moderate to severe central abdominal pain without radiation of seven days’ duration. She had episodes of fever， chills， nausea with loss of taste and smell. She lives with her husband had tested positive PCR COVID-19 nasal swab. She had neither respiratory nor urinary symptoms. The patient's background was healthy and had a good lifestyle， although had history of right nephrectomy during childhood due to a severe pyelonephritis infection. There was no history of taking any drug or any other significant medical illness.\n\n【4】On the day of admission， her Temp was 36.9°C， pulse rate 98 beats per min and regular， blood pressure 145/80 mmHg， respiratory rate 18 breaths per min and oxygen saturation 97% on room air despite having bilateral basal crepitations. Abdominal pain was central， 7 out of 10 in severity with localized tenderness. Acute pancreatitis confirmed according to Atlanta criteria of abdominal pain and significant high levels of serum amylase 209 U/L (25 to 125) and lipase 528 U/L (8.0 to78) however， CT scan of the abdomen was normal. Chest X-ray and HRCT chest confirmed mild to moderate COVID-19 pneumonia  and nasal PCR swab was positive of the same.

The presence of pancreatic damage triggered by this virus can deteriorate the clinical condition of patients and the mortality rate may increase in these patients . The distant organ or system dysfunction may resolve or may progress to organ failure.

It is mainly described in Caucasian subjects in their sixties. However， it also exists in black African subjects， but occurs at a younger age. It is easily diagnosed by the association of vitamin deficiency and macrocytosis. However， various circumstances may mask the macrocytosis and thus complicate the diagnosis. The authors report the case of a patient presenting with normocytic normochromic anemia because of its rarity.\n\n【2】Case Report： The patient was 48 years old and was referred to a hematology consultation for investigation and etiology of a normocytic anemia of chronic evolution (Hb=8.5 g/dl， VGM=92fl， TCMH=32Pg). The diagnosis of Biermer’s disease was made on the basis of the criteria of chronic anemia of insidious evolution， medullary megaloblastosis， serum vitamin B12 deficiency and the positivity of the anti-intrinsic factor antibody test.\n\n【3】Conclusion： This observation reminds us that a normocytic anemia does not exclude the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency.\n\n【4】Keywords： Biermer's disease； Normocytic anemia； Vitamin B12\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Biermer's disease is an autoimmune disease， characterized by malabsorption of vitamin B12， reversible in the presence of intrinsic factors， with the presence of autoimmune atrophic gastritis and various autoantibodies . In Western countries， its prevalence is 9 to 17 new cases/100，000inhabitants/year and the disease affects 0.13% to 0.20% of the population . In Europe， Biermer's disease is the leading cause of megaloblastic anemia， and mainly affects Caucasian subjects， with a predominance in the elderly female subject. Indeed， 15% to 40% of patients diagnosed with Biermer’s disease are over 65 years of age； 1% are under 50 years of age . In Africa， data on the disease are scarce， but it is thought to be common in the southern part of the continent ： In Zimbabwe， Mukiibi reported sixteen cases in 1990； Savage in 1992， identified eighty-five cases of pernicious anemia out of 144 patients with megaloblastic anemia .In West Africa， there are fewer reported cases： Akinyanju in Nigeria， reported ten， Diop in Senegal， Two cases in 1999， and Segbena in Togo， four cases in 2003 .\"For all these authors， Biermer’s disease is under diagnosed in black Africa because of the ancient notion of its rarity， the systematic treatment of chronic anemia without thorough investigations and the inadequacy of endoscopy technical platforms and laboratories. Its classic (historical) presentation associates neurological signs with macrocytic anemia (neuro anemic syndrome)，evolving in an insidious way， giving it the name \"pernicious anemia\". However， it can also occur in atypical forms， both clinically and biologically. These are forms that make the diagnosis err and ignore the disease . In addition to the demonstration of B12 deficiency and malabsorption，the diagnosis of Biermer’s disease is alsobased onthe demonstration ofautoantibodies against Intrinsic Factor (FI) which are of two types： type I antibodies， called \"blockers\"， and type II antibodies called \"precipitating\". Its evolution is marked by the occurrence of complications such as gastric polyps to be carefully monitored， more rarely one can discover gastric adenocarcinoma and finally more frequently the occurrence of multiple carcinoid tumors  developed at the expense of Enterochromaffin -Like Cells (ECL) . Published cases are increasing and the condition is likely under diagnosed. The aim is to draw the attention of practitioners to atypical forms of Biermer’s disease， the description of which is increasingly increasing in Black subjects.\n\n【7】Observation\n\n【8】The 48-year-old AK patient， a shopkeeper with an unexplored history of chronic epigastralgia， was referred to our department for exploration and etiological research of chronic normocytic normochrome anemia (Hb=8.5 g/dL， VGM=92fl， TCMH=32Pg). The anamnesis found a gradual beginning of the symptomatology that would go back about 1 year by cephalea， and dizziness she consults in a medical structure where a blood count was performed which highlighted anemia， she would have received an iron-based medication. The evolution was marked by the persistence associated with paresthesia of the extremities， skin hyperpigmentation and the persistence of anemia， which motivated a consultation in our department for better management. The clinical examination noted： a general condition preserved WHO 1， cutaneous-mucosal pallor without jaundice， a deparpillated tongue (Hunter’s glossitis)， epigastricSsensitivity2and skin hyperpigmentation (forearm， abdominal and dorsal).\n\n【9】The blood count noted chronic normocytic normochrome anemia (Hb=7.5 g/dL， GMV=88fl，MCDH=28Pg).\n\n【10】Paraclinical examinations noted：A reticulocyte level =25000/mm²\n\n【11】On the myelogram： Megaloblastosiswith nucleocytoplasmic asynchronism\n\n【12】Vitamin B12 assay 72 pmol/l\n\n【13】Intrinsic factor antibodies =52.0u/ml\n\n【14】Esogastroduodenal fibroscopy concluded an erythematous pangastric without Helicobacter pylori.\n\n【15】Our patient is currently receiving specific treatment with cyanocobalamin 1，000 micrograms and proton pump inhibitor.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】Biermer’s disease is rarely suspected in the face of normocytic nor-chrome anemia. This clinical case first made us look for different causes of hemolytic anemia. However， the regenerative character objectified by low reticulocytosis and the absence of splenomegaly did not plead for the classic causes of hemolytic anemia. The first cases of Biermer's disease in black subjects appeared anecdotal .However， more and more cases were subsequently reported . In the majority of these cases， it should be noted the insidious nature of the pathology that has been at the origin of diagnostic wanderings with fortuitous discoveries in patients admitted or initially consulting for other conditions . At this level， it should be emphasized that Biermer's disease is probably under diagnosed in sub-Saharan Africa， due to a lack of technical platforms. The other reason is the lack of knowledge of certain subtleties of presentation of this condition by uninformed practitioners . In the Black African subject， several striking characteristics of Biermers disease are to be remembered， first and foremost its occurrence at a young age， compared to the age usually around 65 years in Caucasians . Indeed， a first retrospective Senegalese work showed， between 2000and 2007， an average age at diagnosis of Biermer’s disease of 51years in 26 patients . On the other hand， a second prospective study revealed， between 2007 and 2013， an average age of 43 years in 28 cases of Biermer’s disease in the same country . The second characteristic is the constancy of mucocutaneous signs such as glossitis and especially palmoplantar acquired melanoderma. Regarding this last cutaneous manifestation，it directs more towards adrenal insufficiency. However， it is found without further explanation in several African series and also disappears at the same time as the other signs of Biermer's disease， under well-conducted treatment . However， melanoderma is not yet considered a pathognomonic sign of this autoimmune disease. Neurological and mucous signs (Hunter’s glossitis) were present in our patient. The diagnosis of Biermer’s disease was retained on the criteria of chronic anemia ofinsidious course， medullary megaloblastosis，serum vitamin B12 deficiency and the positivity of the search for anti-intrinsic factor antibodies whose importance in the diagnosis of pernicious anemia has been demonstrated . Biologically， special presentations were noted. They consist of normocytic anemia that can be explained bythe association of macrocytic and microcytic anemia by inflammation， or even microcytic related to iron deficiency or inflammatory origin. Anemia， when it occurs， is consistently profound， with an average hemoglobin level of 6 g/dL . Treatment of Biermer’s disease is based on vitamin B12 administered intramuscularly as cyanocobalamin Its effectiveness is demonstrated on all clinical signs and manifestations， with however a recovery of neuropsychiatric manifestations in less than half of cases.\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】This observation reminds us that normocytic anemia does not exclude the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency. The main causes of normal mean blood volume in this situation are the association of vitamin B12 deficiency with microcytic anemia (iron deficiency， hemoglobinopathy with a microcytic tendency) and the coexistence of macrocytes with fragments of erythrocytes.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:43:23", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:43:37", "cost": 14.237}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:44", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:43:37", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:43:23"}

Currently only fourteen cases have been documented. VESS may be correlated with endometriosis and chronic high-dose estrogen levels. It is usually diagnosed by a pathological examination. Specific clinical symptoms are often not present. In most cases， VESS is a low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma. The malignant transformation of endometrial stroma is marked by uniform stromal cells with minimal cellular pleomorphism， mild nuclear atypia and variable mitoses. We report the case of a 33-year-old woman who presented with increasingpelvicpainandwas diagnosed withalow-grade VESS. Onexamination， a smooth-bordered 2.0 cm x2.1 cm lesion between the right levator muscle and the right posterior vaginal wall was found. There are no guidelines based on large prospective-randomized studies for the treatment of Endometrial Stromal Sarcomas and existing recommendations are mostly derived from case reports due to the rarity of these tumors. Our patient received a local excision of the tumor and an adjuvant treatment with a GnRH analogue combined with an aromatase inhibitor.\n\n【2】In conclusion， this case report clearly shows that LG-ESS must also be considered in women with rectovaginal fistula， even though it is very rare. Due to the rarity of VESS， the creation of a register for one is also useful.\n\n【3】Keywords： Vaginal endometrial stromal sarcoma； Malignant transformation of endometriosis； Extrauterine sarcoma\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 33-year-old female patient complained of increasing， severe pelvic pain for around one year. Initially， the dull pain occurred only during movement， but with time it also manifested at rest. The patient reported no other complaints. Her past medical history was unremarkable and there was no relevant family history and no history of other clinically relevant diseases.\n\n【6】During physical examination a hard， palpable lesion was found on the right pararectal side on her posterior vaginal wall. The pelvic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) showed a smooth-bordered 2.0 cm ×2.1 cm lesion between the right levator muscle and the right posterior vaginal wall. No other abnormalities were found in the lower abdomen. The patient first presented at a regional hospital and received a fractional， transvaginal resection of the tumor due to the primary suspicion ofan endometriosis cyst. Histological work-up including a reference pathological evaluation diagnosed a Low-Grade Vaginal Endometrial Stromal Sarcoma (LG-VESS). Two months after the initial resection the patient noticed a discharge of bowel contents through her vagina and was admitted to our hospital.\n\n【7】Physical examination revealed a scarred vaginal density at 6 oclock without any sign of dehiscence or stool leakage. No sonographic abnormalities were found in the uterus and the adnexal region， as well as no free fluid in the Douglas space.\n\n【8】Rectoscopy showed a supra-sphincteric rectovaginal fistula in the scarred area of the vagina at 6oclock. The histopathological results detected a regular cervix without any infiltrates of the clinically known low-grade stromal sarcoma. The radiologic workup， including a CT scan of the chest/abdomen， did not find evidence of metastatic disease. Since the patients’desire to have children had not been fulfilled yet， a fertility-preserving surgery including an en-bloc resection of the scarred recto-vaginal part as part of shared decision-making therapy was planned.\n\n【9】In cooperation with the department of general- and visceral surgery， a whole resection of the vagino-rectal fistula with preservation of the sphincter muscle was performed. A Gracilis muscle flap from the right thigh was used to cover the anastomosis resulting from the resection. A protective ileostomy was placed laparoscopically to protect the anastomosis. The histopathological report described a low-grade endometrioid stromal sarcoma infiltrate which was locally resected in Sano. The microscopical analysis showed bland oval cells surrounding arterioles resembling endometrial spiral arterioles with no nudear atypia or pleomorphism. The immunohistochemical evaluation was as follows： Positive for CD10 and ER， isolated cells were Desmin positive， negative for CK， PR and S100. The Ki-67 labelling index was 1% . Due to positive hormone receptor status adjuvant treatment with a GnRH analogue (11.25mg Leuprorelin acetate q3m) and aromatase inhibitor (Letrozol 2.5 mg q1d) was started after surgery for at least two years. Five months after the operation， the ileostomy was moved back without complications.\n\n【10】Discussion and Conclusion\n\n【11】Uterine mesenchymal neoplasms also include Endometrial Stromal Sarcomas (ESS)， which account for less than 10 percent of uterine sarcomas and only about 1 percent of all malignant neoplasms of the uterus . There have been numerous reports of primary ESS cases in extrauterine locations such as the pelvic cavity， ovary， abdominal cavity， fallopian tube， retroperitoneum， vulva， and vagina. However， the vagina (VESS) is with fourteen documented cases an extremely rare site of these extrauterine locations .\n\n【12】The origin of extrauterine ESS tumor cells is not yet fully understood. In most cases of extrauterine ESS， foci of endometriosis have been detected in the vicinity of the neoplasm， and the presence of endometriosis may explain the estrogen-depending occurrence of these tumors in extrauterine sites such as the ovaries， fallopian tube， and pelvic peritoneum .\n\n【13】Typically， VESS presents with nonspecific symptoms such as irregular vaginal bleeding， particularly after sexual intercourse， increasing abdominal discomfort， as well as abdominal distension. Therefore， a definitive diagnosis of ESS can only be achieved through pathological examination. Immunohistochemistry is the preferred method for differentiating ESS from other extrauterine tumors， although none of the immunohistochemical markers are specific for the diagnosis of ESS. In our case， the tumorcells were immunoreactive for ER and CD10， but negative for CK， PR and S100. In most cases， VESS is a low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma with lower than10 mitosis/10 HPF and sparse necrosis. Dense， uniform stromal cells with minimal cellular pleomorphism， mild nuclear atypia and variable mitoses are typical characteristics of ESS .\n\n【14】There are currently no established guidelines available based on large prospective-randomized studies for the treatment of ESS and recommendations are mostly derived from case reports due to the rarity of these tumors. Surgery remains the primary treatment option for ESS， especially for early-stage cases confined to the uterus (stage I-II) . Complete resection may be a good choice for patients in early disease stages without any remote metastases. A total hysterectomy combined with Bilateral Salpingo-Oophorectomy (BSO) and careful abdominal exploration is commonly accepted as the treatment of choice in higher stages (stage 3) . Depending on hormone receptor status of the tumor， ovarian-sparing procedures should only be considered in young women， as reported in our case. Although local recurrences are common after fertility-sparing treatment， they can be treated by surgery without compromising survival. After surgery， treatment options may include local radiation therapy， adjuvant hormone therapy or a cytostatic chemotherapy. Although radiotherapy may reduce local recurrence， its effect on long-term survival is uncertain. Hormonal therapy， particularly progestin therapy， is an option because low-grade ESS are typically positive for progesterone receptor. Evidence regarding cytostatic chemotherapy{six coursesplatinum-containing combin chemotherapy (PAC regimen) as adjuvant therapies after surgery) for advanced or recurrent ESS is scarce due to the rarity of the disease and only a few clinical trials have been reported .\n\n【15】In general， treatment of primary VESS should be individualized based on stage and grade of the tumor as well as the patient's age and overall health. Further prospective trials are needed to identify the most effective treatments for vaginal ESS and to establish evidence-based guidelines. Close follow-up with imaging and pelvic exams is also important to timely detect any recurrence or metastasis. The current recommendation for high-grade sarcomas is a physical examination and CT imaging of the chest， abdomen and pelvis every three to four months for the first two to three vears， every six months for the next five years and annually thereafter. LGESS usuallypresents with a slow-growing， malignant course with a rather restrained development. Several studies suggest that up to 80% of recurrences can be detected by regular radiological surveillance .\n\n【16】Prognosis of uterine sarcomas is usually bad， with a median time to recurrence of 14 months. For stromal sarcomas the situation is different. The prognosis of LG-ESS generally tends to be favorable. The rate for disease-specific five-year survival is 80 to 90 percent and for ten-year survival about 70 percent.\n\n【17】In conclusion， this case report clearly shows that LG-ESS must also be considered in women with rectovaginal fistula， even though it is very rare. Due to the rarity of VESS， the creation of a register for one is also useful.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:46:58", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:06:32", "cost": 1173.49}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:44", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:06:31", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:46:57"}

Complications of adult-onset diseases such as hypertension and diabetes have， however， increased the number of patients who require dialysis for renal dysfunction. This may result in secondary hyperparathyroidism which requires surgical removal of the hyper parathyroid glands. Accordingly， while benign parathyroid disorders are increasing， malignant parathyroid cancer is rare. This is a case report of parathyroid cancer， which required a differential diagnosis from a (presumably benign) adenoma.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】Patient： 69-vear-old male.\n\n【7】Current medical history\n\n【8】The patient visited his local medical practitioner due to neck pain， which presented around February 2009.Non-enhanced MRI examination in the neck showed a mass in the left lobe of thyroid gland. The patient also presented with lower limb weakness， and was referred to our department.\n\n【9】The local findings showed no clearly palpable mass in the neck. Other physical findings indicated a dry mouth， frequent urination， and lower limb sensory paralysis.\n\n【10】Biochemical findings showed the following abnormalities： Serum calcium， 16.5 mg/dl； urea nitrogen， 2.42 mg/dl； intact Parathormone (PTH)， 2190 pg/ml.\n\n【11】The ultrasonographic findings in the neck showed a cysticlesion with irregularly calcified margins in the left lobe of the thyroid gland， as well as a highly vascularized internally heterogeneous mass with irregular margins located dorsally . Non-enhanced CT revealed a mass approximately18 mm in size in the lower pole of the left thyroid lobe， as well as a mass approximately 11 mm in size with partial calcification in its dorsal side.\n\n【12】The Tl-Tc subtraction scintigraphic findings indicated Tl uptake in the upper and lower dorsal side of the left lobe .\n\n【13】Surgical findings\n\n【14】We removed a spherical mass which was somewhat adherent to surrounding tissue from the the upper and lower dorsal side of the left lobe. inferior dorsum of the left thyroid gland lobe， as well as the left lobe itself. Intraoperative pathological diagnosis of the mass was an adenoma. The weight of the parathyroid gland was 1200 mg.\n\n【15】Histopathological findings\n\n【16】The parathyroid tissue contained a nodule covered by a fibrous capsule. Various cells were observed， which contained round bodies and acidophilic or clear vacuoles， in the background of an angiofibromatous intersititium， which formed the solid structure of the mass. Capsular invasion was also observed .\n\n【17】An invasive， proliferative tumor， comprised of round cells similar to those observed in the parathyroid tissue， was observed in the thyroid tissue . Immunostaining showed Parathormone(PTH) to be positive in both parathyroid and thyroid tissue.\n\n【18】After th1eeoperation，ttotalthyroidectomy y and cervical lymphadenectomy were performed based on a clinical diagnosis of parathyroid cancer. Postoperative follow-up continues with no reoccurrence or metastasis observed to date.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】Primary hyperparathyroidism is almost always caused by an adenoma， followed by hyperplasia， cancer， and parathyroid cancer， which is rare . Parathyroid cancer， however， is believed to present with characteristic clinical symptoms. According to reports by Okamoto et al. ， these signs are as follows： 1) Palpable cervical mass 2) Development of Osteitis Fibrosa Cystica (OFC).\n\n【21】3) Serum calcium levels above 12 mg/dl.\n\n【22】4)Presentation with life-threatening conditions， including hypercalcemic crisis and acute pancreatitis.\n\n【23】5) Extremely high serum parathyroid hormone levels.\n\n【24】6) Ultrasonography showing a spherical rather than flattened mass， or with thyroid invasion.\n\n【25】In addition， they report the following intraoperative findings： 1) Parathyroid cancer is commonly spherical and indurated， exhibits a gray color and tends to be surrounded by a thick capsule.\n\n【26】2) There is a high likelihood of fibrous adhesion to the surrounding tissue or infiltrative growth.\n\n【27】This case showed no mass on palpation and no generalized metabolic derangements， such as osteitis. The serum calcium level was， however， high and ultrasonography showed a spherical rather than flat shape. The case thus warranted taking into consideration disorders other than an adenoma. There is a risk of disseminating cancerous cells to the surrounding tissues， and accordingly fine needle aspiration is contraindicated. As a rule， the tumor must be excised en bloc with the surrounding tissues.\n\n【28】In the present case， we are a possibility of thyroid cancer； we were total thyroidectomy and neck lymph node dissection. Radiotherapy for parathyroid cancer was not done for effectively . Concerted follow up is required in this case for this reason， as the likelihood of reoccurrence or metastasis is higher.\n\n【29】Although this case presented with a lack of characteristic clinical symptoms， it has reemphasized the need for detailed preoperative imaging diagnosis and conscientious intraoperative observation. Rapid intraoperative pathology diagnosis and rapid serum iPTH measurements are thought to contribute positively to making a discretionary diagnosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:42:22", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:42:40", "cost": 17.852}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:44", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:42:39", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:42:21"}

We present a case of a 79 year old male with signs and symptoms of appendicitis that was found to have a cecal mass on computed tomography scanning. On exploration he was found to have a cecal mass obstructing the appendiceal lumen which caused his appendicitis. A right hemicolectomy was performed and final pathology revealed a T3N0M0 adenocarcinoma. He has recovered without complication.\n\n【2】Conclusion： Although rare， appendicitis resulting from a cecal mass does occur and requires a high index of suspicion especially in patients over 40 years of age. Colonoscopy should be considered in this patient group because the delay in diagnosis following appendectomy results in a lower five-year survival than other patients with colon cancer.\n\n【3】Keywords： Appendicitis； Cecal mass； Colon cancer\n\n【4】Introduction\n\n【5】Appendectomies are one of the most common operations a general surgeon performs because the estimated lifetime risk of acute appendicitis is near 8%. The most common cause of appendicitis in children and young adults is obstruction of the appendiceal lumen by fecaliths or lymphoid hyperplasia . In contrast， appendicitis in the elderly is more likely secondary to appendiceal atrophy， fibrosis， vascular ischemia， and neoplasms . Neoplasm induced appendicitis occurs by three mechanisms： physical obstruction of the appendiceal orifice， obstruction due to surrounding inflammatory changes in the cecum， or distal colonic obstruction causing back pressure in the cecum . While carcinoid is the most common malignancy of the appendix， neoplasms obstructing the appendiceal origin are most commonly adenocarcinoma. Cecal carcinoma as the cause of appendicitis was first described in 1906 by Dr. Shears. Several subsequent reports have been published suggesting cecal adenocarcinoma is responsible for less than 2% of all appendicitis .\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 79-year-old white male presented in March 2014 with a 12-hour history of right lower quadrant pain associated with nausea and emesis. His past medical history was remarkable for diastolic heart disease， obstructive lung disease， GERD， chronic renal insufficiency， prostate cancer s/p total prostatectomy， and bladder carcinoma in situ s/p cystectomy with neobladder creation. Upon presentation he was a febrile with a white blood cell count of 10.8 ×103/uL but demonstrated focal peritonitis with right lower quadrant guarding. Computed Tomography (CT) abdomen and pelvis was obtained by the Emergency Department for further workup given his complicated abdominal surgical history. CT demonstrated non-perforated appendicitis and an associated cecal mass that appeared to be obstructing the appendiceal orifice. The remainder of the CT scan was insignificant without radiographic evidence of metastatic disease. Of note， in 2010 he underwent routine screening colonoscopy with removal of a benign serrated polyp near the appendiceal orifice with a recommendation for repeat colonoscopy in 5-years. Given the concern for colon cancer and his previous abdominal surgeries， he was taken to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy through his previous midline incision. Upon entering the abdomen， a cecal mass was palpable near the base of an extremely dilated appendix. Given a palpable mass within the cecum， a formal right hemicolectomy was performed with special attention to appropriate margins and mesenteric resection to ensure adequate nodal sampling. Thepatient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged home on post-operative day five. Final pathology demonstrated a T3N0 moderately differentiated 3.6 cm adenocarcinoma of the colon with 0/15 lymph nodes positive. The tumor was noted adjacent a sessile serrated adenoma within the cecum with obstruction of the appendiceal orifice and secondary acute appendiceal inflammation. Microsatellite testing demonstrated no instability. He was subsequently referred to a medical oncologist but no chemotherapy was pursued due to his medical co-morbidities. He continues to undergo standard surveillance colonoscopy without evidence of colonic recurrence.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Eight to ten percent of all colorectal cancer occurs in the cecum. Some estimate the incidence of cecal cancer presenting as appendicitis to be as high as 25%， although the exact figures are unknown. Conversely， Lai et al.  found only 0.85% of patients with appendicitis were found to have colorectal cancer， when adjusted for age over forty， the rate more than doubled to 1.76%. A study from Sweden demonstrated that 2.9% of those over the age of 40 with acute appendicitis were diagnosed with colorectal carcinoma within 3 years of appendectomy， a 30-fold increase compared to an age matched cohort . Unfortunately， underlying colon cancer is often missed at appen dectomy with only 18% to 38% diagnosed and resected at the initial operation， resulting in a mean delay in diagnosis of nearly six months .\n\n【10】To prevent a delay in diagnosis， a high index of suspicion for carcinoma should exist for patients who do not follow the expected post-operative course. Complications following appendectomy or abscess drainage such as recurrent wound infections， draining sinus tract， fecal fistula， or a persistent right lower quadrant mass should raise concern for an underlying carcinoma. Lai et al.  demonstrated the odds of colon cancer increased 38.5-fold among patients over 40-years of age with acute appendicitis leading some to recommend screening colonoscopy 6-weeks after appendectomy . This recommendation seems justified as there is a decreased 5-year survival among those diagnosed with cecal cancer after appendectomy when compared to patients without a recent appendectomy .\n\n【11】CT'scanning evaluation ofabdominalpain and in the confirmation of appendicitis has become increasingly prevalent. Information obtained from the CT scan may raise or lowers the suspicion of underlying colon carcinoma in the setting of appendicitis. Such information offers significant benefits in patient management. First， the surgeon has the opportunity to select an appropriate operation prior to starting with the ability to consent the patient for a more involved procedure， such as a right hemicolectomy. Additionally， the surgeon is able to set appropriate pre-operative expectations with a patient and family. Although diagnosis is confirmed following pathology reports， setting that expectation prior to intervention and explanation that he or she will require intervention beyond a simple appendectomy is crucial. Many surgeons are comfortable with laparoscopic colonic resection； however， some surgeons may choose to perform resection via an open midline incision. The ability to discuss a realistic operative approach， potential for open midline approach， and setting patient expectations accordingly is important， especially given expectations of low conversion rate for laparoscopic appendectomy.\n\n【12】Despite the entire diagnostic tools available incidental ileocecal masses are sometimes discovered at the time of appendectomy. An ileocecal mass can pose a dilemma for a general surgeon as the mass may be secondary to benign conditions including appendicitis with perforation， cecal diverticulitis， typhlitis， Crohn’s disease， cecal ulcers， ileocecal tuberculosis， and parasites . However， due to concern for underlying carcinoma， traditional management of a cecal mass has been a formal right hemicolectomy with mesenteric dissection for nodal sampling. While the morbidity and mortality of the hemicolectomy has been justified due to the potential for cancer； recent studies have questioned the need for hemicolectomy in all patients. Tung-Ping Poon et al.  studied 52 patients who underwent ileocecal resection or right hemicolectomy for an ileocecal mass identified at an operation for appendicitis . Ninety-five percent of patients had a benign disease process with cecal diverticulitis or appendiceal phlegmon accounting for the majority of diagnoses. They noted 90% of patients had the correct diagnosis made intraoperatively following back table specimen evaluation. Performing ileocecal resection is associated with shorter operative times， hospital length of stay， and decreased morbidity than a right hemicolectomy . Based on this study， the initial management of an unexpected ileocecal mass at the time of appendectomy should be ileocecal resection； however， the specimen must be examined on the back table or by frozen section to evaluate for the possibility of neoplasm. Ifa tumor is identified， a formal right hemicolectomy with mesenteric node dissection should be performed.\n\n【13】While the majority of malignant tumors of the colon will be adenocarcinoma， carcinoid tumors can be seen in both the appendix and cecum. Colonic carcinoids tend to have a poorer prognosis andbe more advanced at the time of diagnosis， with upwards of two-thirds demonstrating nodal or metastatic disease， at time of presentation compared with rectal or appendiceal primary . Fortunately， surgical management of colonic carcinoid tumors is similar to that of any other colonic tumor as a formal right hemicolectomy with mesenteric nodal dissection is appropriate . Imaging should be reviewed if concern for carcinoid exists with particular attention to the liver and mesenteric lymph nodes. Fortunately， ileocecal resection with back table evaluation followed by completion right hemicolectomy at the time of the index operation provides ideal surgical intervention.\n\n【14】Appendiceal carcinoid is much different and often less advanced at diagnosis than colonic carcinoid due to associated symptoms， namely appendicitis. For patients in whom a tumor greater than 2cm is identified or if mesenteric lymph nodes appear to be involved， a formal right hemicolectomy is recommended . Additionally， appendiceal tumors less than 1cm without evidence of nodal disease can be treated by appendectomy alone . Unfortunately， no clear recommendations for tumors between 1cm to 2 cm exist as many advocate for formal right hemicolectomy in the setting of positive margins or mesoappendiceal invasion greater than 3 mm； however， some argue the morbidity of a right hemicolectomy over appendectomy outweigh the oncologic benefits . Ultimately， back table evaluation of an appendiceal tumor for size determination is crucial to proper surgical management.\n\n【15】Finally， a consideration in our patient is the potential to have avoided colectomy. While he was able to undergo definitive management at the time of initial operative intervention， his episode of melenic stools more than a year prior to presentation might have been an opportunity to intervene. Unfortunately， the appropriate workup was not completed. Melena is most frequently the result of Upper Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding； however， lower GI bleeding may manifest as melena， more often with ascending colon neoplasms. While the majority of lower GI bleeds are due to diverticulosis neoplasms account for 3% to 11% of lower GI bleeds . Thus a complete workup of melena， particularly in the setting of an elderly patient with a history of polyps， should include colonoscopic evaluation to evaluate for the possibility of malignancy. While impossible to say， the size of his tumor at time of appendectomy suggests a polyp would have been visible at the time of colonoscopy had it been performed. Management at that time could have included endoscopic resection and potentially prevented need for colonic resection his subsequent appendicitis.\n\n【16】Conclusion\n\n【17】Appendicitis may be the first manifestation of an underlying colon cancer. A high index of suspicion is needed in patients over 40years ofage and in those who do not follow the typical post-operative course. Due to the relationship of cancer and appendicitis， all patients over the age of 40 should undergo colonoscopy approximately6weeks after surgery. Ileocecal masses unexpectedly found intraoperatively are often benign and can be managed with ileocecal resection if the specimen is carefully examined. A formal right hemicolectomy is still indicated if a neoplasm is identified intraoperative.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:08:48", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:09:27", "cost": 39.006}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:44", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:09:27", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:08:47"}

There are six reported cases of gastrointestinal tract granular cell tumors in pediatrics. There are rare reported cases of esophageal granular cell tumors in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis： three of which were in pediatric patients. We report two asymptomatic pediatric patients undergoing surveillance endoscopy for eosinophilic esophagitis with discovery of esophageal granular cell tumors. Both had successful removal via saline-assisted endoscopic mucosal resection. The association between eosinophilic esophagitis and esophageal granular cell tumors is unclear at this time.\n\n【2】Keywords： Eosinophilic gastrointestinal disease； Esophageal tumor； Endoscopic mucosal resection\n\n【3】Abbre viations\n\n【4】EoE： Eosinophilic Esophagitis； GCT： Granular Cell Tumor；EGD： Esophagogastroduodenoscopy\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Granular Cell Tumors (GCT) are generally benign neoplasms derived from Schwann cells most commonly found in subcutaneous tissues . Eight percent of all GCT involve the gastrointestinal(GI) tract， two percent of which are esophageal . The rate of malignant transformation is 2%. There are eight reported gastrointestinal cases of GCT in children： esophageal (n=4)  appendiceal (n=2) ， and cecal (n=2) . There are eight reported cases of GCT in individuals with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)， age ranging from 14 to 41 years . Typically， esophageal GCTs are incidentally found on upper endoscopy.\n\n【7】Eosinophilic esophagitis is a clinicopathological disease with predominant esophageal symptoms， characteristic endoscopic findings， and histological criteria with esophagealeosinophilia. EoE presents with a variety of upper GI symptoms characterized by age of onset  with a mean age of 8 years. Seventy-five percent of cases are males . Previously reported esophageal GCTs have presented with dysphagia， as can EoE. We present two pediatric patients with esophageal GCT discovered while undergoing surveillance endoscopy for eosinophilic esophagitis.\n\n【8】Methods\n\n【9】A retrospective chart review was performed using the electronic medical record system on pediatric patients with the diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis and esophageal granular cell tumor. Case 1\n\n【10】A 9-year-old boy with autism spectrum disorder， asthma， allergic rhinitis， and EoE underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for EoE surveillance. He was diagnosed with EoE at age Wa2 years and was treated with 6-food elimination diet and lansoprazole. At 9 years of age， he was asymptomatic and undergoing follow-up surveillance EGD on a stable diet. A 2 mm by 4 mm firm nodule was found in the middle third of the esophagus . Biopsy showed squamous mucosa containing submucosal granular cell tumor， which was positive for S100， CD68 and inhibin-alpha immunostaining . Previous EGD one year earlier was without lesion. He subsequently underwent removal of GCT via EGD with endoscopic ultrasound and endoscopic mucosal resection. Endosonographic findings were a single oval intramural (subepithelial) hypoechoic lesion in the middle third of the esophagus within the submucosa (Layer 3) and measured up to 3 mm in thickness with well-defined borders. For removal， 2mL of saline were injected to raise the lesion. Band ligator was applied to capture the tumor. Hot snare mucosal resection with Roth Net retrieval was performed. A follow-up EGD 3 month later showed a grossly normal esophagus and biopsies without evidence ofGCT. All EoE surveillance esophageal biopsies obtained at discovery and at removal were negative for active eosinophilia or inflammation.\n\n【11】Case 2\n\n【12】A 16-year-old boy with asthma， allergic rhinitis， and EoE underwent follow-up EGD. He was initially diagnosed with EoE at age 14 years after a work-up for dysphagia， GERD-like symptoms， and vomiting refractory to acid suppression. His EoE failed 6-food elimination， swallowed fluticasone， and now relies on an elemental diet with isolated single food reintroductions. At age 16 years， surveillance EGD revealed a 2 mm by 4 mm hard， firm nodule in the middle third of the esophagus . Biopsies of the nodule revealed S-100 positivity， consistent with granular cell tumor. Prior endoscopy 3 months earlier was without lesion. He underwent removal of GCT via EGD with endoscopic ultrasound and endoscopic mucosal resection . Endosonographic findings revealed a single small nodule hypoechoic lesion within the submucosa (Layer3). The mass measured up to 4 mm in thickness with well-defined borders. Resection was performed after 2 mL saline injection to raise the lesion， followed by band ligator to capture the tumor， and hot snare mucosal resection with Roth net retrieval. Follow-up EGD 3months later showed a grossly normal appearing esophagus and biopsies without evidence of GCT. All EoE surveillance esophageal biopsies obtained at discovery and at removal were negative for active eosinophilia or inflammation.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】The first GCT in the esophagus was reported in 1931  and since then there have been hundreds of GCTs found throughout the GI tract， with most cases found in adults. The rate of malignant transformation is 2% . The first esophageal GCT in a pediatric patient was reported in 20034.\n\n【15】The typical endoscopic appearance of GCT is a polypoid， yellow， firm submucosal mass. The definitive diagnosis is made histopathologically. Histologically， GCTs are typically able to be diagnosed with hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections， however positivity of the S-100 protein is useful to support the diagnosis . Both of our cases were positive for the S-100 protein. Additionally， endoscopic ultrasound can provide important diagnostic data， suchas size andlayer of origin. In the previous literature， the majority of GCT arise from the inner layers of the esophagus and are hypoechoic with smooth margins . Based on these findings， a determination can be made for method of tumor resection. Saline-assisted endoscopic mucosal resection has been reported to be a safe procedure with rare complications . The first reported case of saline-assisted endoscopic mucosal resection in a child was performed by Buratti and colleagues . Both of our cases had GCTs resected by saline-assisted endoscopic mucosal method without any complications， further supporting the safety of this procedure.\n\n【16】Recently in 2015， Yanoma and colleagues reported an adult with an esophageal GCT who had an elevated preoperative serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9， raising concern for malignant potential. The final pathologic diagnosisSwas a benign GCT. The patient’s serum CA 19-9 level normalized post-operatively. The immunohistochemical staining was interestingly negative for CA. Alone from this report， there are no specific serum markers identified with esophageal GCT.\n\n【17】The children in our case series were undergoing surveillance EGD for eosinophilic esophagitis when esophageal GCT's were found. These cases are similar to other GCT cases in the literature characterized by incidental discovery. A recent retrospective report identified 18esophageal GCT， with two occurring in pediatric patients that were symptomatic from their EoE . This same report notes that perhaps esophageal GCTs are reactionary given their findings of active EoE inflammation. However， this is contrary to our cases， which were both asymptomatic and without active eosinophilia or inflammation at time of discovery and removal. What is unique in this report is the strengthened recognition of additional esophageal GCT cases in the setting of EoE and only three prior in pediatric patients In summary，GCTs are rare in children. The relationship between GCT and EoE is unclear， with two possibilities being a coincidental finding verses long-term complications of chronic inflammation in EoE. The prevalence of EoE is certainly increasing， and with a potential increasing incidence ， it is important for clinicians to be attentive of this possible association， which may shed insight into alterations in disease pathophysiology.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:16:17", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:16:49", "cost": 31.907}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:44", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:16:49", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:16:17"}

Its cardiovascular manifestations are being eliminated in developed countries but are still a concern in developing countries . Syphilis， by its natural evolution，can indeed lead in the long term to aortic valve damage such as stenosis， insufficiency or ostial coronary artery disease resulting in syphilitic aortitis . We report here a case of aortic insufficiency due to tertiary syphilis hospitalized in the cardiology department ofthe Ibn Rochd University Hospital of Casablanca.\n\n【9】Observation\n\n【10】A 63-year-old woman was admitted to our cardiology department at the Ibn Rochd University Hospital in Casablanca. She is a diabetic，hypertensive，postmenopausal patient， of low socioeconomic level，housewife and mother of five children. She presented about 12 years ago with untreated genital ulcers that healed spontaneously. The interrogation revealed a dyspnea stage II-III of the NYHA and a context of apyrexia. Edemas of the lower limbs were installed， hence his hospitalization in cardiology for global cardiac decompensation.\n\n【11】The general state was preserved with a tachycardia at 110 beats per minute and a polypnea at 27cycles per minute. Blood pressure was 140/60 mmHg.\n\n【12】Physical examination revealed hyper pulsatile neck arteries (Mussets sign) and a diastolic mesocardial quiver. Cardiac auscultation revealed a left latero-sternal diastolic murmur of aortic insufficiency of intensity 4/6 radiating to the left axilla and a significant second noise burst (B2) at the pulmonary focus. Pulmonary auscultation revealed crackling rales at the pulmonary bases.\n\n【13】Skin examination showed painless nodules， mobile to palpation， deeply embedded and variable in size， one to two centimeters in diameter， in multiplelocations (armpits， neck， scalp，xiphoid fossa and back)， suggesting a syphilitic gummata .\n\n【14】The paraclinical workup showed a positive syphilitic serology with RPR at 1/8 and TPHA at 1/640， a normal renal function with a creatinemia at 7.5 mg/l estimating a GFR at 84 mg/l and a normal blood glucose at 1.02 g/l. There was no hypercholesterolemia.\n\n【15】The baseline chest X-ray  showed global cardiomegaly(cardiothoracic index 0.65)， a large hilum appearance and chest distension.\n\n【16】The surface electrocardiogram  showed regular sinus rhythm，left ventricular hypertrophy (Sokolow at 49 mm)， and apical-lateral subepicardial ischemia-like repolarization disorder.\n\n【17】Doppler echocardiography showed a preserved ejection fraction of 53% by Simpson-Biplane， calcification of the aortic sigmoid with an intervalvular gap (18 mm)， without dilatation of the aortic root (33mm)， with dilatation of the sinus at 40 mm indexed at 2.37 cm/m， and of the ascending aorta at 45 mm indexed at 2.81 cm/m’， and an undiluted abdominal aorta at 21 mm. The aortic flow study showed a moderate to severe aortic insufficiency with R.Pisa =11 mm， SRO=70cm， RV=108 ml，PHT=183 ms . The mitral flow showed a relaxation disorder aspect and a grade I mitral insufficiency (Vmax at1.95 m/s， max gradient at 15.2 mmHg). The right ventricle was dilated(BDRV=54 mm) with good longitudinal systolic function (SVD=9cm/s， TAPSE=19 mm) and moderate tricuspid insufficiency (Vmax=2.m/s， tricuspid annulus =41 mm). The inferior vena cava was dilated to 24 mm with little complication. Pulmonary hypertension was noted with an estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure of83 mmHg.\n\n【18】The thoracic CT scan showed cardiomegaly with signs of pulmonary hypertension， an aneurysmal dilatation of the ascending aorta measuring： (Ring =13 mm， Sinus of Valsalva =34 mm， Sinotubular junction =47 mm， Ascending aorta =45 mm， Aortic arch=29mm).\n\n【19】Preoperative coronary angiography was normal.\n\n【20】A treatment based on diuretic with potassium supplementation， nitrates， ACE inhibitors， as well as Penicillin G in progressive dose(5 IU to 20 IU per day) was instituted and doxycycline 200 mg. A corticosteroid therapy with Prednisolone 40 mg per day under supervision and respect of the rules of corticosteroid therapy was administered for safety.\n\n【21】She underwent an aortic valve replacement associated with a Bentall and a tricuspid plasty .\n\n【22】The postoperative clinical evolution was favorable after two weeks.\n\n【23】Discussion\n\n【24】Since the introduction of penicillin therapy， tertiary syphilis through its cardiovascular manifestations especially aortic has become a very rare condition in developed countries . Although isolated cases are still reported in developing countries ， most of the reported cases are autopsy data . They place syphilis in third place after degenerative and ischemic causes .Non-atheromatous aortic insufficiency is a frequent valvular dysfunction. It is reported in most series with frequencies up to 47% of cases according to autopsy data . This aortic insufficiency may be accompanied by coronary insufficiency with angina  as was the case in our patient in whom the ECG showed subepicardial ischemia. The availability of coronary angiography in our context did not make it possible to check the coronary status. However， cases of asymptomatic syphilitic aortic insufficiency have been reported in the literature .\n\n【25】A history of sexually transmitted diseases is often found， as in our patient (distant venereal contact)，but their absence does not exclude the diagnosis . Hofmann-Wallenhof  reported that out of approximately one third of patients who do not receive antibiotic treatment， 10% will develop a cardiovascular complication of syphilis.\n\n【26】Dermatological lesions， when present， constitute an important clinical orientation element. However， positive syphilitic serology remains an argument of choice . According to some authors， aortic insufficiency in patients over 50 years of age with or without aortic aneurysm， whether symptomatic or not， recommends syphilitic serology.\n\n【27】Referring to the half-pressure time， the aortic insufficiency of our patient is significant. Despite the fact that conventional medical treatment of heart failure and penicillin therapy have brought clinical improvement， prosthetic valve replacement should be considered as recommended by Otani  and Guiney .\n\n【28】Conclusion\n\n【29】Cardiovascular syphilis is still a reality in our countries. Aortic insufficiency is a frequent manifestation. All AI in patients over 50years of age require a syphilitic serology test and a thorough skin examination in search oftertiary syphilis for appropriate treatment.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 15:28:15", "endTime": "2024/09/20 15:32:18", "cost": 243.607}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:43", "update_time": "2024-09-19 23:32:19", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 23:28:15"}

Varicella (chickenpox) is caused by primary infection， and Herpes zoster， also known as shingles， is caused byreactivation oflatent VZV that gained access to sensoryganglia during varicella. Reactivation is influenced by age-related immune-senescence， iatrogenic immunosuppression or disease-related immune-compromise state. As a vaccine can cause Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS)， it can also reactivate VZS.\n\n【2】Case Report： We discovered an elderly male (62 years old， Bangladeshi) with a painful blister around his right eyeball， as well as blurred vision in that eye. Examination found decreased visual acuity with hyperemia and edema in the eyelid and conjunctiva. He was found to have Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus (HZO). Herpes zoster is a reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus， most commonly seen in the elderly and immunosuppressed， with incidence estimates ranging from 1.25to 5.25 per 1，000 person-years showed in different studies. If patients are not treated promptly and aggressively， HZO with intraocular involvement can significantly impair visual vision. Our patient recovered entirely after getting proper treatment.\n\n【3】Conclusion： No vaccine is 100% safe， and intense surveillance to assess the vaccine safety for the detection of any event which could attenuate the expected benefits， and thus to take any necessary action to minimize risks to vaccinated individuals.\n\n【4】Keywords： Reactivation； Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus； Immunocompromised； Vaccine\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】COVID-19 causes 219 million infections and 4.55 million deaths up to 01-10-2021 in Bangladesh. Most commonly， infected persons present with respiratory tract-related problems， but very few also presented with atypical presentations like maculopapular eruptions， morbilliform rashes， urticaria， chickenpox-like lesions， and livedo reticularis. Usually， disease-related fatalities are found mostly where the respiratory tract has been involved. New variants of the COVID-19 have emerged， vaccines are needed to protect individuals at high risk and to potentially control disease outbreaks through the establishment of herd immunity . The theory of herd immunity in COVID-19 is controversial，though. But applying the vaccine has impacted the curve of the pandemic. COVID-19vaccine doses have been administered to a total of 48.2 million people， with 16.7 million completing both amounts (about 10.2 per cent of the total population). Although no vaccine is 100 percent safe， adverse events following immunization are reported to be less than 1% in Bangladesh， according to the countrys health ministry. Tenderness at the injection site， weariness， soreness at the injection site， and malaise are all common side effects of the mRNA 1273 vaccination. Rare side effects are thrombocytopenia with thrombosis syndrome， myocarditis and pericarditis. Anaphylaxis after the vaccine， which usually occurs within minutes to 5 h， has not been still reported in the country. Varicella-Zoster Virus (VZV) is a human neurotropic virus that causes varicella. This is followed by the establishment of latency in sensory ganglia， notably the dorsal root ganglia， trigeminal ganglia， and enteric ganglia. The latent phase usually lasts for several decades before reactivation occurs. VZV reactivation can present as HZO， which is characterized by pain，paresthesia， tenderness， rash in the forehead， swelling of the eyelid， and blurry vision . VZV reactivation in COVID-19 cases has been already reported.COVID-19-associated lymphopenia， especially CD3+CD8+lymphocyte and functional impairment of CD4+ T cells， can render a patient more susceptible to developing HZ by reactivating VZV. It is also reported that HZ could be a sign of undiagnosed COVID-19 infection in younger age groups . Here， writes a case with HZO reactivations after mRNA 1273 vaccination.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 62 years old male Bangladeshi citizen was taken mRNA 1273vaccine from Sheikh Hasina National Institute of Burn & Plastic Surgery Institute on 11/08/2021. He developed a high grade of fever that subsided after 48 h by itself. Seven days later， he found small lesions around his right eyeball. From eight-day， an itching and tingling sensation appeared on the right side of his forehead， which was followed by tenderness in the area of the lesions. He complained of blurred vision with extreme sensitivity to light in his right eye and developed a watery discharge. Gradually the lesions became more significant and reddish.\n\n【9】Diagnosis\n\n【10】Clinical findings correlate with herpes zoster ophthalmicus. Slit-lamp examination found\n\n【11】Eyelid： hyperemia，edema.\n\n【12】Conjunctiva： hyperemia， petechial hemorrhages， vesicles.\n\n【13】Scleraepisclera： limbal vasculitis\n\n【14】Cornea： Epithelium： Pseudo-dendrites\n\n【15】Stroma： Nummular stromal keratitis.\n\n【16】Irisuvea： Segmental iris edema.\n\n【17】Visual acuity： 6/12 in the right and 6/6 in the left.\n\n【18】Previously he had no history of visual disturbance. He got oral acyclovir 800 mg PO five times daily for 7 to 10 days for skin rash and prednisolone acetate 1% for ocular therapy. According to his statement，he had a history of chickenpox in his early childhood and no treatment was required for that. He had no history of insect bites or irritant contact in that area. Lesions are not found in other body areas like the trunk or extremities. No biopsy was done. Follow-up was done after two weeks， and he was found to have recovered well.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】Possible causes ofthis type oflesion are Herpes zoster opthalmicus， irritant contact dermatitis， insect bite， and bullous lesions. In irritant contact dermatitis， there must be a history of contact with chemicals or like that. The patterns of lesions are usually vesicular， and irritation is present in that area. Whereas bullous presents itchy， tense blisters over normal skin or erythematous and edematous background on the trunk and extremities. Our presented case shows the dermatomal distribution， confined in the right of the forehead with the eyeball area. No extension to the opposite location. Also， he had a history of varicella (chickenpox) in his childhood. Increasing age is one of the significant augmenting factors for reactivation of HZO， partly because of age-related decline in specific cell-mediated immune responses to HZO. On the other hand， other risk factors include disease-related immune compromises such as HIV infection， iatrogenic immune-compromised， physical trauma， or comorbid conditions such as malignancy or chronic kidney or liver disease . The most common complication of HZ is postherpetic neuralgia， while other complications include ocular ones (HZ opthalmicus， acute retinal necrosis， neurological ones (Ramsay Hunt syndrome， Bell’s palsy， aseptic meningitis， encephalitis， peripheral mmootor neuropathy， myelitis， Guillain-Barre syndrome， stroke syndromes)， and bacterial infection of the skin . Cell-mediated immunity is critical for the maintenance of latency and for limiting the potential for reactivation， while recurrences are more common among patients with immunosuppression . Post-vaccination HZ is rarely reported in the literature. Walter et al. Reported three different cases of herpes virus reactivation following inactivated influenza， hepatitis A， and rabies and Japanese encephalitis vaccines， while Bayas et al. reported a case of branchial plexus zoster after yellow fever vaccination. Regarding COVID-19 vaccination， we could only retrieve a publication by Bostan et al. ， who reported a case of VZV reactivation in 79-year-old patient five days following vaccination and a more recent one with six immune-compromised patients with autoimmune inflammatory diseases who developed the first episode of HZ closely after vaccination with the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. Reactivation of VZV is a failure of the T cell compartment to maintain control of the infection. This is supposed to occur more frequently with increasing age due to adaptive immunosenescence. On the other hand， a vaccine strongly stimulates the immune system and polarizes it to a vaccine-induced T cell response. The SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-1273 vaccine elicited a robust CD4 cytokine response involving type 1 helper T cells among participants older than 55 years old . Vaccine-induced reactivation of HZ may be similar to Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS)， which is a paradoxical worsening of preexisting infection masked by the host's regained capacity to mount an inflammatory response following the initiation of the host ART . HZO is a not very uncommon， but vaccine-related HZO is a rare condition.\n\n【21】Conclusion\n\n【22】Mass vaccination activities are going on throughout the world. Like many countries， Bangladesh still depends on another country for the vaccine. No vaccine is 100% safe， and strong surveillance to assess the vaccine safety for the detection of any event which could attenuate the expected benefits， and thus to take any necessary action to minimize risks to vaccinated individuals. Bangladesh government has targeted to vaccinate 80%population of the country， which needs more than 15 core vaccines. So， there may be a chance of vaccine-relatedsevereadverse events.HZO may be a rare AEFIand fortunately treatable disease. Moreover， mRNA the platform is a promising new technology，and demonstrating its safety is meaningful for developing further vaccines against viruses and tumors.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:15:33", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:15:44", "cost": 10.337}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:43", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:15:43", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:15:32"}

However metastatic disease is rare and complete resection is usually possible with excellent long term survival .\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 35 year-old Samoan woman was referred with a six-month history of a painless epigastric mass and weight loss. She had no significant previous medical or surgical history and physical examination was unremarkable except for a firm mass in the epigastrium. Full blood count， biochemistry and tumour markers (carcinoembryonic antigen， Ca 19-9， Ca 125， chromogranin A) were all within the normal limits. A CT scan of the abdomen showed a large well- encapsulated complex cystic mass with internal calcification， measuring 16 x 17 x11.6 cm arising in the tail of pancreas . There were no signs of distant spread or regional lymphadenopathy.\n\n【8】Following multidisciplinary review she proceeded to a distal pancreatectomy and a splenectomy with the operative findings of a firm mass arising in the pancreatic tail involving the splenic artery and vein. No metastatic disease was seen and her post-operative course was uncomplicated.\n\n【9】Histological and immunohistochemical examination showed features consistent with SPN， with areas of necrosis and haemorrhage with tumour cells arranged as discohesive nests accompanied by small blood vessels imparting a papillary configuration . There was a nuclear and cytoplasmic staining for vimentin and B-catenin . The patient remains alive and well 18months post-operation and under regular follow up.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Tumours of the exocrine pancreas include adenocarcinoma， acinar cell carcinoma， intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm and mucinous cystadenocarcinoma. They are generally biologically aggressive and associated with poor survival. Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm develops from the exocrine part of the pancreas  but is an indolent tumour. It was first described by Virginia Frantz  and historically it accounts for 1% of all the pancreatic neoplasms， 5%of the cystic neoplasms and presents most commonly in women in their 30s but can occur between the ages of 13 and 60 years . The tumours are usually large at presentation and presenting symptoms are related to the presence of a mass and early satiety . The diagnosis is confirmed with typical imaging features demonstrating large encapsulated tumours with solid and cystic spaces . Although pseudopapillary neoplasms are often large they are generally localised although between 9-15% may present with metastases or signs oflocal invasion . Routine preoperative biopsy is not recommended as it is of limited utility and may result in dissemination . SPN can occur throughout the pancreas but up to 60% develop in the tail or body. Treatment is surgical resection and the outcome following complete resection is excellent with overall 5 year survival of over95%\n\n【12】SPN are an increasingly important pancreatic lesion. A recent systematic review has shown that 90% of all cases have been reported in the 12 years and， of these 90% are now initially diagnosed as an incidental finding on cross-sectional imaging. Consistent with more early diagnosis is the observation that the mean size at presentation has decreased from 10 cm to 8 cm in the last decade . These findings suggest that SPN is more common than initially thought and will become a significant part of the caseload for the pancreatic surgeon.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:37:14", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:37:20", "cost": 6.294}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:43", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:37:20", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:37:13"}

The patient is neither diabetic nor hypertensive and does not receive any medication for any chronic illness. The patient denied any history of surgical operation or trauma. On local clinical examination of the scrotum， there was palpable， and visible varicocele on the left side and the surface of the left testicle was irregular with palpable notch. Right testicle was felt normal. Semen analysis revealed moderate asthenospermia with normal shape sperms. Testicular grey scale and Doppler ultrasound showed normal size and architecture of both testicles and dilated veins of the left spermatic cord with regurgitation of blood during Valsalva maneuver. There were a deep longitudinal cleft on the surface of the left testicle  which appeared complete and a similar cleft on the surface of the right testicle but appeared incomplete . However， 3-D ultrasound could show that the clefts were not complete on either side， and there was bilateral testicular lobulation . The primary diagnosis was settled as primary infertility due to poor sperm quality related to the presence of grade III left varicocele.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Testicular lobulation is a rare anomaly of the testicles and has been reported . This lobulation may be an idiopathic embryologic variant. The exact aetiology is unknown but is thought be a form of incomplete polyorchidism. It has been proposed that bilobed testis results from incomplete division of the urogenital ridge . However， it has been suggested that testicular lobulation could be a sequence of orchiopexy and fibrosis after orchiopexy could be the reason for testicular lobulation . In our case， the lobulation is bilateral， and the patient has no history of orchiopexy or inguinal surgery. Irregular testicular contour during physical examination can be differentiated from testicular malignancy by using ultrasound. However， careful ultrasound examination in different planes is essential for establishing correct diagnosis especially if the septum is incomplete. Moreover， 3-D ultrasound could be helpful in identification of the depth of the cleft. Testicular lobulation should be differentiated from polyorchidism and supernumerary testis. Polyorchidism is defined as the presence of more than two testes within the scrotum . In most cases of polyorchidism，the extra testis is located on left side， and there are two epididymides and a single vas deferens . In testicular lobulation there is a single epididymis with its vas as could be identified in our case and the lobulation is incomplete. While testicular lobulation is a benign condition the neoplasm of the supernumerary testis was found in 6.4% of cases .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:01:06", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:01:23", "cost": 16.575}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:43", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:01:23", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:01:06"}

Atrial Septal Defect (ASD) closure in cases of coexisting left ventricular dysfunction and/orleft valvular disease carries the risk ofpulmonary congestion，hence implantation of a fenestrated device is a therapeutic option in these cases. We present a symptomatic 74-year-old patient with a large secundum ASD and concomitant moderate to severe mitral regurgitation， pulmonary hypertension， as well as severe tricuspid regurgitation. After thorough analysis of possible treatment options by the Heart Team， atranscatheter ASD closure by using a self-fabricated fenestrated CeraFlex ASD occluder (LifeTech Scientific Co.，Shenzhen， China) was performed. This led to a significant reduction of the tricuspid regurgitation and amelioration of patient symptoms. This unique case underlines the feasibility， safety and efficacy of a hand-made fenestrated device for ASD closure in patients with moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.\n\n【2】Keywords： Atrial septal defect； Mitral regurgitation； Tricuspid regurgitation； Pulmonary hypertension； Fenestrated occluder device\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Atrial Septal Defect (ASD) constitutes a congenital heart lesion commonly found not only in the pediatric population but also in adults， mainly because they may remain asymptomatic until adulthood . When symptoms develop， they usually present as exertional dyspnea， fatigue or palpitations indicative of cardiac arrhythmia . If left untreated the ASD may lead to right heart failure. Recent guidelines recommend ASD closure in cases of enlargement of the Right Ventricle(RV)， provided there is no irreversible Pulmonary Hypertension (PHTN) or Left Ventricular (LV) disease . Elderly people with ASD frequently have concomitant LV disease and PHTN due to comorbidities such as left chamber valvular disease or arterial hypertension leading to LV diastolic dysfunction. This carries the risk of acutely developing congestive heart failure after ASD closure and renders the benefit of the procedure in this population uncertain . Most recent data suggest that ASD closure， even at an advanced age， can lead to favorable cardiac remodeling as well as to functional class improvement， mentioning however that partial occlusion with a fenestrated device could be better tolerated in selected patients with significant LV disease/PHTN .\n\n【5】We report the management ofan elderlypatient， inoperable by conventional surgical techniques， with a large secundum ASD and elevated LV filling pressures due to moderate to severe Mitral Regurgitation (MR).\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 75-year-old woman was admitted to our Center complaining of severe dyspnea on exertion and swelling of lower extremities. Her past medical history included permanent atrial fibrillation， a known large secundum ASD， chronic kidney disease and a recent hospitalization for dyspnea which responded to intravenous diuretics. On admission， physical examination revealed a 3/6 systolic murmur at the lower sternal border， bilaterally decreased breath sounds， a palpable liver and severe lower limb edema. An electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with right axis deviation and a narrow QRS. NT-proBNP levels were remarkably elevated (3.236 pg/ml- upper limits 125 pg ml). Transthoracic (TTE) and Transesophageal Echocardiogram (TEE) confirmed the presence of a secundum ASD with a significant left to right shunt and prolapse of the anterior mitral valve leaflet\n\n【8】LA： Left Atrium； RA： Right Atrium； LAA： Left Atrial Appendage；： Prolapsing A2 Scallop\n\n【9】： Atrial Septal Defect； LA： Left Atrium， RA： Right Atrium through the large interatrial defect. Transeptal puncture of the septum posteriorly to the ASD was considered unfeasible， based on the patient's anatomy after cardiac CT .\n\n【10】(A2 scallop) leading to a moderate to severe MR (EROA 0.34 cm， Regurgitant Volume 51 ml) . The RV was dilated with moderately reduced systolic function [RV systolic excursion velocity(RVS) 8 cm/sec]， while the Left Ventricle showed preserved Ejection Fraction (LVEF 55%) and D-shape morphology due to volume overload . Furthermore， severe TR was documented(EROA 0.4 cm)， caused by dilation of the tricuspid valve annulus and volume overload dueto the presence ofthe ASD .Right-heart catheterization showed mainly post-capillary PHTN (mean pulmonary artery pressure 38 mmHg， wedge pressure： 25 mmHg， pulmonary vascular resistance 3.17 and 2 WU pre and post oxygen administration respectively) and a hemodynamically significant ASD with a calculated Qp/Qs of 2.1. Coronary angiography revealed minimal non-obstructive CAD. Being a high surgical risk patient for combined intervention on mitral，tricuspid valve and ASD (Euroscore II 8.54)， the Heart Team suggested the transcatheter management. An initial intervention for tricuspid regurgitation was considered redundant due to its secondary nature. Transcatheter mitral Edge-to-Edge Repair (TEER) was also rejected as a first-line therapeutic option because of the expected instability of the clip delivery system Consequently， ASD closure was decided as a first-line of intervention， with possible transcatheter mitral/tricuspid repair later， if needed. Following latest guidelines， a balloon occlusion testing with simultaneous right atrial， pulmonary arterial， Pulmonary Capillary Wedge (PCWP) and left ventricular measurements was conducted before ASD closure revealing a 7 mmHg (from 23 to 30mmHg) increase in PCWP without signs or symptoms of pulmonary oedema . However， due to the elevated wedge pressure， it was decided to use a fenestrated device. The fenestration was self-fabricated by creating a 4 mm-diameter hole in the 22 mm CeraFlex occluder device that was chosen . The device was placed uneventfully.\n\n【11】Results\n\n【12】After the procedure， the patient remained in good clinical condition without signs or symptoms of LV decompensation. TTE performed on the first postoperative day revealed a whiff of left to right flow through the created hole. Two months later the patient reported remission of the peripheral oedema and significant clinical improvement (now being in functional NYHA I class). This was 10 mmHg from baseline or a PCWP above 20 mmHg， as in this case， portends an increased risk for pulmonary edema. They stress however that creating a fenestration in the occlusion device may prevent such abrupt hemodynamic changes .\n\n【13】Table 1： Balloon occlusion testing： simultaneous right atrial， pulmonary arterial， pulmonary capillary wedge and ascending aorta pressure measurement in different conditions.\n\n|  | Conditionl (baseline)  |  | conditionⅡ (ASD acclusion)  |  | ConditionⅢ (17 min after occlusion)  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| PVR  | 3.17  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Qp/Qs  | 2.1  |  | 1.0  |  | 1.0  |  |\n|  | Oximetry (%)  | Pressures (mmHg)  | Oximetry (%)  | Pressures (mmHg)  | Oximetry (%)  | Pressures (mmHg)  |\n| SVC  | 73  | 18  | 68  | 18  | 71  | 17  |\n| VC  | 64  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| Mid RA  | 85  | 18  | 68  | 18  | 71  | 17  |\n| RV  | 85  | 58/16  | 68  | 60/13  | 71  | 55/15  |\n| PA  | 85  | 58/22/34  | 68  | 60/21/34  | 71  | 55/23/33  |\n| PCW  | 98  | 23  | 97  | 29  | 98  | 30  |\n| Ao  | 98  | 124/75/91  | 97  | 131/76/94  | 98  | 129/73/92  |\n\n【15】PVR： Pulmonary Vascular Resistance； Qp/Qs： Pulmonary Flow/Systemic Flow； SVC： Superior Vena Cava； IVC： Inferior Vena Cava； mid RA： mid Right Atrium； RV：Right Ventricle； PA： Pulmonary Artery； PCW： Pulmonary Capillary Wedge； Ao： Aorta\n\n【16】LA： Left Atrium； RA： Right Atrium accompanied by markedly reduced daily diuretic requirements. TTE showed the still patent fenestration in the occluder  and a significant reduction of TR (now being mild to moderate) and of RV dimensions as well as a decrease of the RV systolic pulmonary pressure by 20 mmHg. The MR severity remained the same .NT-proBNP levels were also decreased (800 pg/ml).\n\n【17】Discussion\n\n【18】ASD with significant left to right shunt has been related to an increased risk of morbidity and mortality and current evidence suggests that all ASDs associated with RV dilatation should be considered for closure irrespective of age . The recent guidelines state that closure can improve patient's clinical and functional status at any age， particularly when it is performed by catheter intervention. Moreover， recent developments in closure devices have rendered the transcatheter approach as the treatment of choice in these cases.\n\n【19】Patients with ASD and PHTN must be carefully evaluated by right heart catheterization and Pulmonary Vascular Resistance (PVR) must be calculated . Generally， in patients with PVR <5 Wood Units(WU)， ASD closure is considered safe and associated with a favorable prognosis and a gradual decrease in PHTN. However， even when PVR is <5 WU， patients with PHTN undergoing ASD closure have worse outcome compared to patients without . Partial occlusion with fenestrated devices has also been suggested as an option in these patients with promising results . In a recent review the efficacy of fabricated devices was reported in more than 40 patients with LV dysfunction and/or PHTN . However， none of these published cases had concomitant severe MR and in none of them a CeraFlex occluder device was used， as in our case.\n\n【20】In patients with LV dysfunction， ASD closure can lead to acute hemodynamic changes， increased LV filling pressures and pulmonary congestion . In these cases， a balloon occlusion test before the actual closure for pressure reassessment is recommended， in order to decide among complete， fenestrated or no closure . There are no clear recommendations on how to interpret the balloon occlusion test results. Most authors agree that an increase in PCWP of more than TEERiiss aaprocedure of evident safety and efficacy for symptomatic patients with severe MR， who are judged inoperable or of high surgical risk . Although performed through a transeptal approach， the coexistence of a large ASD， as in our patient， creates special technical problems leading to instability of the clip delivery system. In a published case report of a patient with concomitant mitral regurgitation and ASD， the access to the left atrium for clip delivery was achieved not through the defect but via a separate transseptal puncture posteriorly . A similar approach was entertained in our patient but was considered as non-attainable due to the small dimensions of the posterior septal wall.\n\n【21】Overall，theoptimaltreatment for our， inoperablebyconventional means， elderly patient with large ASD， coexisting moderate to severe MR and severe TR as well as a dilated RV， was debatable. After rejecting transcatheter intervention for mitral regurgitation and based on the above-mentioned evidence， ASD closure was decided as the first-line of treatment， with the possibility of a later TEER through the occlusion device. Considering the results of the balloon occlusion test， we opted for a self-fabricated fenestrated device in order to unload the left chamber pressures. The best way of creating a fenestration in the occlusion device as well as its optimal size have not yet been clarified. In previous reported cases fenestrations were made with a fixed surgical opening in the device's nitinol mesh or with the placement of a stent to ensure long term patency . In our patient， following the example of other operators， we decided to manually fenestrate the CeraFlex device， accepting the possibility of gradual endothelization with eventual closure， which is not necessarily unfavorable.On the one hand its closure may lead to further decrease of PHTN， while on the other hand it may decrease the possibility of a paradoxical embolism . Judging by the significant clinical improvement， at least in the short term， our therapeutic approach is justified.\n\n【22】Conclusion\n\n【23】This case report suggests that transcatheter use of a self-fabricated fenestrated CeraFlex occluder in an inoperable elderly patient with combined secundum ASD， moderate to severe MR and severe TR seems to be feasible， safe and offers clinical improvement.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "【8】LA： Left Atrium； RA： Right Atrium； LAA： Left Atrial Appendage；： Prolapsing A2 Scallop\n\n【9】： Atrial Septal Defect；", "content": "【0】Abstract\n\n【1】In recent years an increasing number of elderly patients resort to transcatheter treatment of their congenital heart lesions.

There are many causes for pyometra， well described in literature： Malignancies ofthe uterus or the pelvis invading the cervix， benign tumor of the cervix such as polyps or fibromas， past surgery on the cervix and post radiation cervicitis . Multiple case reports suggest that rupture of the uterus consequent to pyometra， despite being a rare complication， is associated to peritonitis and abdominal abscesses .Nevertheless， there is no evidence in literature of abdominal abscess as the cause of pyometra. We present the first case， to our knowledge， of pyometra occurring as complication ofabdominal sepsis for gastric perforation.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】An 80-year-old female patient was transferred to our department after one month hospitalization in a smaller hospital for gastric ulcer perforation (Helicobacter pylori positive) treated by surgical debridement and omental patch. The post-operative evolution was complicated by multiple abdominal abscesses. An empiric antibiotic therapy with intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam， both for Helicobacter pylori and abdominal sepsis， was started with percutaneous attempt of drainage. The patient was then transferred to our hospital for family reunification， where a new abdominal CT scans was performed， confirming the persistence of a perisplenic abscess， a pelvic abscess and pyometra .\n\n【6】Weperformed a newpercutaneous CT-guided drainage of thepelvic abscess， whiletheperisplenic abscess， smaler and hardly reachable by percutaneous approach， and were treated conservatively. The gynecologists performed a hysteroscopy with emergent dilatation and curettage to manage the pyometra. The procedure was well tolerated and no other possible causes for pyometra were found. We observed a good clinical， biological and radiological evolution. A further CT imaging showed an improvement with reduction of abdominal collections and complete disappearance of the pyometra. The final histology ofthe ulcer biopsies showed a poorly differentiated gastric cancer ulcerated. She was then treated， after a period of rehabilitation， with partial gastrectomy with no further therapies needed .\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Pyometra is a collection of purulent material in the uterine cavity due to the impossibility of draining the cervix and this is a potentially lethal disease widely diffused within the veterinary community， especially between dogs . It is less widespread among humans， occurring more frequently in postmenopausal women with gynecological tumors， both malign and benign lesions. Pyometra should always be surgically evacuated by dilatation of the cervical canal and curettage in order to prevent uterine rupture.\n\n【9】It is widely described that pyometra， if not properly treated， can sometimes cause a rupture of the uterus with peritonitis and sepsis . To our knowledge， there are no cases described in literature with an abdominal sepsis as main cause of pyometra.\n\n【10】Conclusion\n\n【11】Pyometra is a rare condition， never described in literature as the consequence of abdominal sepsis. In this case report we present the very first case， to our knowledge， of a woman without any gynecologic disease who developed a pyometra from abdominal sepsis due to gastric perforation.

However， after a Table 1： Laboratory values.\n\n|  | Admission  | 1 month later  | Discharge  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ALP (IU/L)  | 292  | 181  | 232  |\n| GGT  | 268  | 53  | 298  |\n| Total billurubin(mg/dL)  | 6.14  | 17.1  | 2.2  |\n| Direct bilirubin (mg/dL)  | 5.86  | 12.1  | 1.8  |\n| AST (IU/L)  | 56  | 38  | 41  |\n| ALT(IU/L)  | 98  | 33  | 115  |\n| Hemoglobin (g/dL)  | 10.7  | 11.5  | 11.3  |\n| Albumin (mg/dL)  | 4.1  | 3.3  | 3.1  |\n| Prothrombine time  | 11  | 13.4  | 11.8  |\n\n【10】follow-up period of two years， renal mass increased in size and she developed a second renal 5 cm mass. She received interferon-alpha therapy until radiologic evidence of disease progression for three months. Sorafenib was administered as second line treatment which was discontinued by the patient because of severe skin reactions， while the disease regressed. She again denied treatment and lost from follow up.\n\n【11】Physical examination revealed jaundence， hepatomegaly and a large palpable， relatively mobile， nontender mass in the left side of the abdomen. Laboratory data revealed anemia leucocytosis， elevated alkaline phospatase (ALP)， gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT)， total billurubin， calcium， decreased serum albumin levels and prolonged prothrombine time . Protein electrophoresis revealed mild diffuse hyperglobulinaemia. She was negative for hepatitis A，B，C，D， cytomegalovirus， Epstein-Barr virus， herpes virus serological tests. Immunological assays for the various autoimmune diseases (ANA， ENA， antidsDNA， antiss DNA， antihistones antibodies， ASMA， AMA， p-ANCA， c-ANCA) were all negative. The urine analysis showed hematuria， blood and urine cultures were sterile.\n\n【12】Abdominal ultrasonography showed 94 and 75 mm masses on the left kidney. There was no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. Abdomen computed tomography showed two masses on left kidney and multipl paraaortic lymphadenopathies. MRCP revealed normal pancreas and no intra or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The patient's liver function test levels gradually increased reaching the highest values one month from admission .\n\n【13】The patient denied liver biopsy and only treated with cholestyramine supportively. On follow up billurubin， ALP and GGT levels gradually decreased and became in normal ranges 3 months later without any therapy . She is on follow up without any treatment for one year and her billurubin level is in normal ranges.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】Malignancy relatedcholestasis is usually associatedwith mechanichal obstruction of biliary tract or widespread hepatic metastasis. It can rarely be the paraneoplastic manifestation of some malignancies； especially renal cell carcinoma .\n\n【16】Few cases have been described with paraneoplastic cholestatic jaundance of RCC in the literature . Our patient had elevated ALP， GGT and billurubin levels， decreased albumin and prolonged prothrombin time. There was no liver abnormality on abdomen computed tomography. On the basis of these findings and absence ofobvious cause of liver dysfunction the patient diagnosed as having Stauffer’s syndrome.\n\n【17】Stauffer’s syndrome with cholestatic jaundence， appears as the initial clinical presentation of renal cell carcinoma. All described patients were diagnosed during an evulation of jaundence . They all underwent nephrectomy and had complete resolution of clinical and liver function abnormalities after surgery. Recently， Girotra et al reported a patient with prior nephrectomy who developed Stauffer’s syndrome as a presentation of RCC recurrence . The patient denied further workup and there is no information about clinical course thereafter. Authors concluded that this syndrome may be a surrogate marker of RCC recurrence. Our patient had prior nephrectomy for RCC and she had developed a mass on the other kidney on follow up. Stauffer’s syndrome diagnosis was not obtained neither prior the diagnosis of RCC nor before recurrence. Jaundence occurred after disease recurrence when she was not taking any medications for RCC. She was icteric on admission， billurubin levels tend to decrease and became normal levels 3 months after. Resolution of Stauffer’s syndrome was spontaneously as she did not accept operation and any other medication for RCC.\n\n【18】The underlying pathophysiology of this paraneoplastic manifestation is poorly understood. However possible role of IL-6 overexpression by the primary tumor are reported. Blay et al. investigated this issue in 119 metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients and found that patients with detectable IL-6had significantly higher serum ALP and GGT levels. They concluded that IL-6 is involved in the pathophysiology of paraneoplastic cholestasis. Think that our case adds to the growing pool of data of this rare variant of Stauffer’s syndrome. There is no data about non treated paraneoplastic cholestatic jaundence of RCC in the literature This is the first case of spontaneous resolution of this paraneoplastic syndrome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:11:41", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:11:53", "cost": 12.39}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:43", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:11:53", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:11:39"}

Under appropriate topical anesthesia and sedation， intubation was made in an awake patient with an Airtraq°videolaryngoscope.

Up to 39% have problems associated with the airway and up to 70%have associated obstructive lesions in the airway . They have often undergone radiotherapy， oropharyngeal surgeries， tracheostomies and some have difficulty in cervical flexion-extension or tumors that make oral opening complex， becoming a challenge for the anesthesiologist. In cases of anticipated (DA)， we have fibrobronchoscope or videolaryngoscopes. The fibrobronchoscope was first described to assist Orotracheal Intubation (OTI) in 1967， becoming the gold standard for awake intubation. However， with the development of new generations of videolaryngoscopes in the 2000s， high success rates have been achieved， reducing the number of failed attempts and the incidence of trauma in the airway . In addition， they allow a steep learning curve， ease of training for personnel in training， operator ergonomics  and easy change oftube number in cases of subglottic stenosis. Likewise， videolaryngoscopes are of great value in places where access to fibrobronchoscope is more limited， such as anesthesia outside the operating room or with poorly trained personnel. For all these reasons， videolaryngoscopes are currently frequently used devices and are even used by many anesthesiologists as a first-line device in cases of anticipated difficult airway . There is little consensus on the ideal sedation regimen during awake intubation. The DAS (Difficult Airway Society) guidelines describe the benefit of minimal sedation， although they also report that it can be performed safely and effectively without it， although it can become unpleasant， trigger coughing， nausea， vomiting and even oropharyngeal injuries . A case of planned difficult airway is presented in which the patient self-inserts an Airtraq' videolaryngoscope under local anesthesia and sedation without nausea， vomiting or cough， without any other complications， and adequate tolerance.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 40-year-old male patient， 54 kg and 170 cm tall (BMI 19.58 kg/m²) ASA IV， scheduled for embolization of an aneurysm ofthe intracavernous segment of the left Internal Carotid Artery(ICA). As background， he presented a diagnosis of metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma in the left nostril， initially treated with maxilloethmoidectomy with ocular exenteration and reconstruction with an anterolateral paratracheal flap that required tracheostomy with posterior closure， subjected to radiotherapy and chemotherapy， subsequently presenting a relapse with pulmonary， bone， cerebellopontine angle and subcutaneous tissue in the region of the previous tracheostomy metastases. Admission due to suspicion of acute meningoencephalitis due to contiguity in relation to infection of the flap/surgical area of the previously performed maxillectomy. An aneurysm in the cavernous segment of the left ICA was incidentally diagnosed in the extension study， confirmed by diagnostic angiography under sedation. It was then decided to perform scheduled embolization of the aneurysm with coils.\n\n【7】In the preoperative evaluation， he presented a history of radiation in the head and neck region with a physical examination that showed trismus with limited oral opening of 1.5 cm， thyromental distance of >6 cm， class II mandibular protrusion with adequate cervical flexion and extension， with flap in previous tracheostomy region in adequate conditions. Laboratory tests revealed chronic anemia and lymphopenia with correct coagulation and renal function. Upon his arrival in the angioradiology room， the patient was hemodynamically stable， eupneic with oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. After obtaining consent for the planned intubation technique， it was explained to him that he would control the insertion of the device (airtraq) and it could be terminated at any time if he was uncomfortable. Standard monitoring was performed and oxygen was administered at 2 L/min through nasal cannula. 5 ml of nebulized 2%lidocaine were used followed bytopical anesthesia with 10% lidocaine spray on the oropharynx. Sedation was started with Remifentanil at0.07 mcg/kg/min and midazolam 2 mg. Next， with the head of the stretcher at 30° and under spontaneous breathing， the patient was asked to self-introduce the Airtraq size 2 devices with a 7.5 mm diameterendotrachealtubeaccording to his tolerance. Once the self-introduction of the Airtraq'reached the maximum possible tolerance for the patient， the anesthesiologist proceeded to visualize it through the videolaryngoscope. At that time， the visualization of the glottis was partial， so its placement was optimized， after which， and under complete visualization of the glottis， the tube was introduced， which passed the vocal cords， followed by a stop due to subglottic stenosis， for which a second attempt was made with a 6 mm tube with no difficulties in advancing it. The tube change was done quickly due to the ease of assembly of the Airtraq . Once the tube was inserted， induction was carried out with propofol， fentanyl， and rocuronium. The procedure was well tolerated by the patient. Maintenance was performed with Propofol TIVA and remifentanil. The intervention was uneventful. At the end， the muscle relaxant was reversed with sugammadex and the patient was extubated in the angioradiology room without complications. He was transferred to the semi-critical unit for postoperative control.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Intubation in patients with expected difficult airway is a challenge for Anesthesiologists. The fibrobronchoscope is the device traditionaly used for intubation in the awake patient and is considered the reference device.\n\n【10】However， its learning curve is long， requiring intense training and enough experience for its proper use. In addition， it is a device that is not always easily available， especially in those cases in which intubation is required outside the operating room. In recent years， the Airtraq' has emerged as an alternative to the fibrobronchoscope for awake intubation in cases of difficult airway. Several studies have published that it is easier to manage the Airtraq compared to the fibrobronchoscope in intubation with the patient awake in cases of difficult airway. In addition， learning for its proper use is fast and is easily available in areas outside the operating room. On the other hand， the use of Airtraq requires a refined technique that allows the procedure to be the least uncomfortable for the patient. For this， different sedation techniques and local anesthetics are used to achieve optimal conditions for intubation with the patient awake. However， on many occasions'intubation can become uncomfortable . In a series of 50 morbidly obese patients who underwent awake intubation with videolaryngoscope after topical anesthesia and sedation， almost50% failed on the first attempt due to gag reflex and cough .Other studies report intubation failure rates of up to 10% due to inadequate suppression of airway reflexes or discomfort . In this regard， self-introduction of Airtraq by the patient can reduce discomfort，reducing the presence of nausea， vomiting or cough . This would be due to the fact that byhaving the patient control over the videolaryngoscope， they can also control the tolerance they have when inserting it. In our case， self-introduction of Airtraq by the patient occurred without complications and was very well tolerated. In addition， taking into account the characteristics of the patient with a locally advanced neoplastic process of the face and neck and limited mouth opening， self-introduction constituted a safety element and made it possible to reduce patient anxiety regarding intubation， improving comfort. One limitation of its use is that it can only be used in selected patients who want to collaborate in its performance. In addition， it is necessary to properly explain the technique so that the patient can help effectively. Although sedation during awake intubation using fibrobronchoscope or videolaryngoscope is associated with high levels of patient satisfaction ， the risk of over sedation could be particularly dangerous in patients with difficult airway， including respiratory depression， hypoxia， aspiration， and hemodynamic instability . In those cases where the use of sedation could be controversial， the self-introduction of Airtraq would be an advantage as an option to increase patient safety because it would require a lower level of sedation. On the other hand， it requires greater optimization of the sedation level to avoid overdosing that prevents this collaboration. Since the self-introduction of Airtraq is a novel technique， new studies are needed to establish the benefits of this technique with respect to traditional methods of intubation in awake patients with difficult airway. Another advantage of self-introduction would be related to the trauma associated with the airway due to its manipulation with videolaryngoscopes or fibrobronchoscope.Kramer et al.  published that minor nasopharyngeal bleeding occurred in 18% of cases with the use of a videolaryngoscope for intubation with the patient awake， while with a fiberoptic bronchoscope the bleeding rate was 24%. On the other hand， Rosenstock et al.  to the obtained values of 4.7% and 7% for the videolaryngoscope and the fibrobronchoscope， respectively. In this regard， the self-introduction of the videolaryngoscope could reduce bleeding by reducing the possibility of trauma due to the patient's control over the device.\n\n【11】However， new studies would be needed to test this hypothesis.\n\n【12】Conclusion\n\n【13】Patient self-introduction of the videolaryngoscope is a tool that could be useful in cooperative patients， to increase comfort and reduce episodes of nausea， vomiting or coughing， prevent minor bleeding associated with trauma during the procedure and even reduce the level of sedation in patients that is required， making the patient participate in the procedure. However，new studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:48:21", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:48:33", "cost": 12.199}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:43", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:48:33", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:48:20"}

At six-month follow-up， Eco-color-Doppler ultrasound control confirmed the correct positioning of the stents.\n\n【4】Conclusion： Carotid artery stenting via MIcroNet\"-covered stents might represent the more suitable endovascular option in symptomatic free-floating thrombus in the carotid artery.\n\n【5】Keywords： Free- loating thrombus； Internal carotid artery； Carotid artery S stentingi MicroNet\"， Mesh stent， Enlarged carotid bulbous； Transient ischemic attack\n\n【6】Introduction\n\n【7】The recognition of a Free-Floating Thrombus (FFT) in the Carotid Artery (CA) is relatively uncommon ， with an estimated frequency among stroke patients around 0.4%.\n\n【8】Complicated carotid plaques represent the most common causes of FFT development； other more rarely reported causes are vascular trauma， fibromuscular dysplasia， carotid dissection and vasculitis .\n\n【9】Endovascular treatment via self-expanding MicroNet， Mesh stent， has been shown to be effective in the management of this challenging pathological condition .\n\n【10】Here， we report and discuss a unique case of symptomatic Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA) with left hemiparesis， developed in the presence ofan FFT in the internal CA associated with an extensive parietal thrombosis developed in an enlarged carotid bulbous successfully treated in emergency via two overlapped MicroNet\"-covered stents (CGuard\"，InspireMD).\n\n【11】Case Presentation\n\n【12】A 65-year-old male patient with a background history of diabetes mellitus， arterial hypertension， ischemic cardiomyopathy， and previous PTCA presented with a TIA characterized by left hemiparesis. No coagulation abnormality was demonstrated.\n\n【13】Color-duplex sonography showed a FFT extending into the lumen of the proximal right internal CA associated with moderate arterial stenosis and an extensive parietal thrombosis in an enlarged carotid bulbous . Computer Tomography Angiography (CTA) confirmed this instrumental finding . No acute cerebral ischemic lesions were detected.\n\n【14】After careful positioning of a distal protection device， two MicronNet\"-covered stents (CGuard\"9x40mm and 10x40mm) were implanted from the distal common to the internal CA. CGuard\"stents were overlapped at the level of the enlarged thrombotic carotid bulbous . No pre-dilation and only a slight stent post-dilation were performed. No intra procedural complications were detected.\n\n【15】Considering the substantial rate of of recurrent cerebrovascular ischemic events， we decided to perform an emergency carotid stenting via MicroNet\"-covered stent.\n\n【16】After general anesthesia， using a US-guided right common femoral artery access and a standard 8Fr introducer， a catheter guide was positioned in the aortic arc (Type II) to engage common carotid artery.\n\n【17】Postoperative medical therapy consisted of dual antiplatelet therapy (dopidogrel 75 mg and aspirin 100 mg). Postoperative neck radiography  and CTA reconstruction  confirmed the exact placement of the overlapped MicroNet~-covered stentsSAt six-month follow-up， Eco-color-Doppler ultrasound control confirmed the correct positioning of the stents and a restored normal internal CA lumen without evidence of residual stenosis .\n\n【18】Discussion\n\n【19】Bhatti et al.  had traditionally defined a FFT in the CA as an elongated thrombus attached to the arterial wall， usually presenting a cyclical motion related to the cardiac cycle. The internal CA represents the most affected vessel . Atheromatous plaque complications，Ss1iichhas1intra-plaque hemorrhage orplaque ulceration， and hypercoagulable states seems to be the most frequent causes of FFT development .\n\n【20】Our patient had any coagulation abnormality and only a moderate internal CA stenosis. However， CA presented in this case a thrombotic enlarged carotid bulbous ； we cannot exclude that this specific anatomo-pathological condition may have favored the FFT development in the proximal internal CA. The ideal management of FFT is not well defined， and， similarly， comparative studies between medical and surgical or endovascular management are lacking .\n\n【21】Specifically， different kinds of treatment have been described， including medical management alone， medical management with emergency or delayed surgery or endovascular repair of the lesion via carotid endarterectomy， Carotid Artery Stenting (CAS)， suction thrombectomy followed by CAS or， in particular anatomical conditions， endovascular thrombus stabilization via fibered coils.\n\n【22】Anticoagulation via low molecular weightheparin，unfractionated heparin， Vitamin K Antagonist， and/or singular or dual antiplatelet therapy represent the most reported medical therapy. There is no consensLISCon how long anticoagulation treatment should be continued in these cases； furthermore， one cannot exclude the possibility of FFT reappearance after therapy discontinuation  Also， thrombolytic agents might play a role in FFTs management but present a risk of clot fragmentation and distal intra-cerebral thrombus dislodgement . The most frequent surgical management of FFT in the CA is based on traditional carotid endarterectomy or carotid stenting with first generation stent .\n\n【23】The main advantages of the CAS are in those cases of the absence of a “potentially embolic “vascular manipulation in addition to an effective and complete FFT covering.\n\n【24】Both WallStent and CGuard\" MicroNet~-covered stent appear suitable It is most likely that stents with micromesh (as MicroNet\") might offer a better safety profile and a better capacity to prevent clot fragmentation and distal migration . Still， the advantages of MicroNet\"-covered stent seem to not have been evaluated in the mentioned situations have sometimes not been profited in the mentioned situations.\n\n【25】Bhogan et al.  in a retrospective review published in 2021including ca. 2200 CAS performed from January 2008 to September2019， found only 7 patients with FFT in the CA.\n\n【26】In this recent review series， WallStent was used in 5 patients and CGuard\" in the remaining two； in one patient， two overlapping WallStentsSwere necessary while七tWOoverlapping CGuard\"MicroNet~-covered stents were emploved in no case.\n\n【27】Our case represents， therefore， to our knowledge， the first case of the use of two overlapped MicroNet\" covered-stents in the presence of symptomatic FFT in the internal CA associated with an extensive parietal thrombosis developed in an enlarged carotid bulbous.\n\n【28】Another key point in the endovascular treatment via MicroNet~covered-stents ofthe FFT is represented by the necessity of complete and definitive coverage of the overall CA parietal thrombosis. Considering the elastic nature of the thrombosis and the possible change in its length after stent deployment， the use of longer stents has been advised to ensure the complete coverage of the parietal thrombosis both proximally and distally .\n\n【29】Also， in this case， to obtain effective trapping of the thrombus between the stents and the arterial wall， we decided to cover a long tract of carotid axis intentionally from the distal common to the internal CA； the two MicroNet\"-covered stents， CGuard were deliberately overlapped at the level of the enlarged carotid bulbous.\n\n【30】At six-months follow-up， Eco-color-Doppler ultrasound control confirmed the correct positioning of the CGuard\" stents.\n\n【31】Conclusion\n\n【32】Carotid artery stenting via MicroNet\" covered-stent might represents the more suitable endovascular option in symptomatic FFT in the CA.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:45:40", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:46:09", "cost": 28.394}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:43", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:46:09", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:45:40"}

Type 3 CPAMs are characterized by small hyperechogenic cysts (<5 mm). Hydrops often develops secondarily， and the fetal survival rate is approximately 5% in this setting.\n\n【2】Case Report： We present a case of a large type 3 CPAM complicated by fetal hydrops. The lesion was detected at 19 Gestational Weeks (GW) and confirmed by fetal MRI at 29 GW. At 22 GW， a course of maternal steroids was given as a possible treatment of type 3 CPAM. Peritoneal-amniotic shunt was placed twice to reduce fetal ascites， with unsatisfactory results. Similarly，polyhydramnios was relieved by two amnioreductions， but redeveloped soon after. A baby girl was delivered spontaneously at 33 GW， and received a two-stage partial lobectomy in the first three months of life. She now approaches one year of age， with near-to-normal growth and developmental milestones.\n\n【3】Discussion： The survival of this in fant can be attributed toprenatal management， accurate diagnostic imaging， and early postnatal surgical intervention. Her outcome is unexpectedly positive and she may expect a good quality of life. Multidisciplinary vigilance and collaboration with frequent specialist follow ups was the key to success for both mother and child.\n\n【4】Keywords： CPAM；CVR； Peritoneal-amniotic shunt； Polyhydramnios； Fetal hydrops\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Congenital Pulmonary Airway Malformations (CPAMs) are the most common Congenital Lung Malformations (CLMs). With a prevalence of 1/11，000 to 1/33，000 live births， they are rare overall . Twenty-five to 30% of neonates with antenatally-diagnosed CPAMs will present with respiratory distress and infection， and perinatal mortality may reach 50%. Furthermore， the development of fetal hydrops is a devastating complication that is associated with <5% survival. With improvements in the quality of fetal Ultrasonography (US)， CPAMs are increasingly detected in the prenatal period ，leading to the evolution of management strategies that continue to improve peri- and postnatal prognosis .\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 23-year-old primigravida presented at the clinic in April 2020. Her routine US at 19Gestational Weeks (GW) revealed a fetus with ascites and a large hyperechogenic， homogenous lesion (5.25 cm x3.58 cm) that occupied the left lung. The contralateral lung was hypoplastic(1.0 cm x 1.5 cm) and extreme cardiac dextroposition was visualized. Fetal US revealed typical features of type 3 CPAM . Routine screening for cytomegalovirus， toxoplasmosis， rubella， and parvovirus B19 was negative. Intrauterine paracentesis was performed and 80 mL of fetal peritoneal fluid was aspirated. Amniocentesis revealed a normal karyotype (46， XX). At 22GW， due to the re-accumulation of peritoneal fluid， 80 mL was drained in a second fetal paracentesis. A course of steroids (Dexamethasone 4 mg x6 mg) was given as a possible treatment of type 3CPAM. The ultrasonographic presentation of CPAM did not change and there were no signs of fetal heart failure. The CPAM-Volume Ratio (CVR) was 3.02. At 25GW， due to increasing ascites， a peritoneal-amniotic shunt was placed twice but was displaced both times， and the effect was thus unsatisfactory. At the same time， polyhydramnios was detected (Amniotic Fluid Index [AFI]33cm) and amnioreduction (2000 mL) was performed. At 28 GW， the patient was readmitted.\n\n【9】Fetal hydrops was diagnosed at this time with the presence of ascites， mild hydrothorax and subcutaneous edema . There were no signs of fetal heart insufficiency. A second amnioreduction (2000mL) was also performed， but polyhydramnios redeveloped soon after(AFI 36 cm). Fetal MRI was performed at 29 GW to confirm the diagnosis of type 3 CPAM. At 33 GW， soon after premature rupture of membranes， the patient naturally delivered a baby girl (2，814 g， Apgar 2，6，6).\n\n【10】The baby presented with respiratory distress and was placed immediately on invasive oscillatory ventilation. Generalpoor condition with oxygen delivery 1.4 necessitated total parenteral nutrition. Later， poor sucking and swallowing - attributed to the displacement of the diaphragm and aberrant thoracic anatomy -justified PEG placement. Plain film radiography and Computed Tomography (CT) were obtained . CT confirmed the absence of arterial systemic feeding vessels and she was qualified for two-stage partial left lobectomy. The first surgery was performed on day 14， removing the lower 45% of the left upper lobe . The baby girl demonstrated significant desaturations， and it was necessary to balance the challenging ventilation of a cystic and noncompliant upper left lobe， an atelectatic lower left lobe， and a hypoplastic right lung. The second surgery was performed after two months to remove necrotic portions of the left upper lobe. Plain films from February 2021 revealed significant anatomic improvement . Histopathology of the excised tissue confirmed CPAM Stocker type 2 (cysts <2 cm). At the time of writing， the baby has achieved her first year of life. Her developmental milestones are delayed by approximately 3 months， attributed to poor abdominal tone， leading to difficulties with crawling and sitting. Tracheostomy and the use of a ventilator have also caused speech delay.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】Natural history of CPAMS\n\n【13】Typically， CPAMs peak in size at 28 GW to 30 GW . Spontaneous prenatal regression occurs in approximately 8% to49%  during the third trimester. The size of our lesion remained generally stable， measuring 5.25 cmx3.58 cm at 23 GW and 5.84cm x 4.44 cm at 31 GW. Approximately 15% of CPAMs regress after birth . Fetal clinical presentation varies according to lesion size， and affected fetuses may suffer from hydrops， polyhydramnios， and fetal death . Large symptomatic lesions are associated with high in utero mortality. Because of the potential for dynamic growth， serial US assessment throughout pregnancy is the standard of care . The CVR was developed as a predictive marker for life-threatening complications， and is determined by ultrasonographic assessment of lesion volume to head circumference. CVR ≥ 1.6 was shown to be highly predictive of fetal hydrops ； however， there is no international consensus of CVR thresholds for the prediction of fetal/neonatal outcomes， and its utility should be established in further studies . The CVR of 3.02 in our patient suggested a significant risk of respiratory distress within 24 h of birth， and is associated with the need for surgical intervention within 2 years .\n\n【14】Diagnosis and radiologic imaging\n\n【15】CPAMs occur sporadically， with no known genetic or maternal risk factors . CPAMs have been reported in the setting of other congenital malformationssuchas diaphragmaticherniaandcongenital heart disease ， and a recent case of CPAM was diagnosed in a fetus with mosaic Kleinfelter syndrome . Traditionally， CPAMs are classified using the Stocker criteria . Based on radiologic and pathologic data such as cyst size and wall thickness， CPAMs are differentiated into 5 subtypes， with type 1 (large cysts， 2 cm to 10 cm) and type 2 (small cysts， <2 cm) occurring with greater frequency. However it is clinically more useful in the antenatal period to apply ultrasonographic criteria， with Adzick et al.  differentiating CPAMs into macrocystic (>5 mm) and microcystic (solid， echogenic masses)lesions . As the number of successful in utero resections increases， alternate classifications have been proposed to address the apparent histologic variability . In fetal US， a CPAM appears as an obstructive lung mass， first suspected in routine imaging at 16 to20GW . US is usually sufficient to confirm prenatal diagnosis . Furthermore， US is the main modality for the assessment of hydrops， thus also has high prognostic value. However， CPAMs may be hard to distinguish from other CLMs， and many lung lesions on fetal US may cause mediastinal shift， diaphragmatic eversion， and fetal hydrops. The sensitive detection of systemic feeding vessels is also low . Prenatal MRI was shown by Pacharn et al.  to accurately reflect postnatal imaging and pathological findings in 98% of cases， and thus is increasingly implemented as part of the diagnostic work-up . Furthermore， the clarity of MR imaging is not limited by maternal body habitus， amniotic fluid volume， or fetal positioning. Due to the rarity oftype 3 CPAM， a prenatal MRI was obtained from our patient to rule out bronchial atresia. CT has the highest diagnostic specificity and is the gold standard for postnatal detection of CPAMs . The baby received a CT on day 3 as part of preoperative counseling ，and a control CT was also performed between the two stages of the partial lobectomy. In a single patient report， Chon et al.  successfully utilized fetal tracheobronchoscopy for both CPAM diagnosis and therapeutic disimpaction of bronchial debris. This invasive procedure is not without substantial risks to the fetus， and very few cases utilizing fetal tracheobronchoscopy have been published .\n\n【16】Treatment strategies\n\n【17】In CPAM types 1 and 2， treatment can be initiated in utero， and these include the placement of peritoneal-amniotic shunts and cyst aspirations . In contrast， type 3 CPAMs invariably requires surgical resection. Fetal surgery is a high-risk procedure that is attempted in only select institutions ； morbidity and mortality are high ， with studies documenting a 50% survival rate .Open fetal surgery is not performed at our specialist center. Type 3 CPAM in our patient led us to take conservative measures. A peritoneal-amniotic shunt was placed twice to reduce fetal ascites， though the results were unsatisfactory. A course of maternal steroids was given at 22 GW. Other than stimulating the growth of the hypoplastic right lung， steroids have been shown to significantly increase fetal survival by reducing the size of microcystic (but not macrocystic) CPAMs(CVR>1.6)， which may lead to the resolution of hydrops . The pharmacomechanism of steroids on CPAMs is unknown  and steroid-prescribing practices among obstetricians vary widely . In our patient， the therapeutic effect of steroids was only minimal .\n\n【18】Postnatal care\n\n【19】Surgical resection is the standard of care for symptomatic neonates in order to prevent lung infections， allow for compensatory lung growth and reduce future complications . The prognosis after surgery appears to be good . Ben-Ishay et al.  performed life-saving pneumonectomies for a series of giant CPAMs， but lobectomy via thoracoscope (including video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) or thoracotomy remains the most prevalent surgical method. In our baby girl， respiratory distress and desaturation prompted immediate surgical qualification for a partial lobectomy. The first surgery was performed on day 14. Despite the initial plan to remove the tumor in its entirety，during the procedure it became clear that the cystic lobe did contain viable lung tissue； the closure of the left upper lobe bronchi led to significant desaturation. Thus， only the lower 45%of the left upper lobe could be safely removed. The problem of the restricted thoracic volume (for the lungs and heart to grow and return to anatomic position) remained. Ventilation between the two stages was a significant challenge for neonatal intensivists. The only way to avoid severe barotrauma was to place our patient on oscillatory ventilation with deep sedation and use of paralytic agents. There are no neonatological guidelines dictating thelong-term use ofventilation and sedation in such a unique situation. This strategy appeared to be effective， and it was possible to reduce oxygen delivery from 100% to40% during this period. The baby completed her two-stage procedure in 2 months. Because of the large size of the CPAM， the anatomic improvement was immediately appreciable . As a result， her growth and developmental milestones are only slightly delayed. She is followed up frequently in specialist centers including otolaryngology， physiotherapy and speech therapy.\n\n【20】Conclusion\n\n【21】Type 3 CPAMs complicated by fetal hydrops are associated with high perinatal mortality. Antenatal interventions are typically ineffective. The CVR of 3.02 was a significant predictor of neonatal respiratory distress and prompted the consideration of early surgical intervention. Partial lobectomy allowed for the compensatory growth of healthy lung tissue. Baby's positive outcome can be attributed to prenatal management and early postnatal surgical intervention； furthermore， she may expect a good quality of life. Multidisciplinary vigilance and collaboration with frequent specialist follow ups was the key to success for both mother and child.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:23:19", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:23:56", "cost": 37.841}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:43", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:23:57", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:23:18"}

Early studies were uncontrolled and more recent authors have used unstandardized research instruments or inadequate epidemiological methods. In 1991， Winsa et al. has reported a strict controlled study. Compared with 372 selected matched controls， 208 newly diagnosed GD patients claimed to have had more negative life events in the 12 months preceding the diagnosis， and negative life-event scores were also significantly higher. After this report， many control studies were reported. However， the role of stress on the onset of GD is still controversial as there are some contradictory reports.\n\n【2】On the other hand，there are case reports in which emotional stress induced an exacerbation and relapse of hyperthyroidism. But， few systematic studies have been undertaken regarding the effect of stress on the prognosis of the disease. So we investigated the role of psychosocial factors including personality traits as well as stresses on the clinical course of GD by questionnaires . Firstly， we found that in antithyroid drug (ATD) treated GD patients， depressive personality during treatment when patients were euthyroid reflects the effect of emotional stresses rather than thyrotoxicosis and that it related with aggravation of hyperthyroidism . Secondly， we also found that ability of rational consideration and expressing feeling of ATD treated GD patients related with remission. These findings suggest that pychosomatic therapeutic an approach including antipsychiatric drugs and/or psychotherapy appears to be useful for improving the prognosis of hyperthyroidism.\n\n【3】There are very few reports on the relationship between stress and other thyroid diseases including Hashimoto's thyroiditis，Plummer' disease and benign thyroid nodule.

The etiology remains unknown but a variety of triggers are recognized， including an abnormal inflammatory process deriving from immune reactions to various antigenic stimuli like bacterial， viral， or parasitic agents， in a genetically prone individual. IgA vasculitis is more predominant in the pediatric population with male predominance， and higher incidence in Asian population. It is generally a self-limiting disease and characterized by a tetrad of clinical manifestations： palpable purpura without thrombocytopenia and coagulopathy， arthralgia， abdominal pain，and renal disease. Presentation may develop over days to weeks. Adults have increased risk for renal involvement and prompt diagnosis of IgA vasculitis may help prevent progression to advanced renal disease.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】Seventy year-old male with a past medical history significant for severe tophaceous gout recently restarted on allopurinol， prior ICU admission for lactic acidosis of unknown etiology who initially presented for complaints of multiple， ecchymotic， hemorrhagic maculopapular lesions of his extremities that developed acutely over a 2 week period. Patient denies fevers， chills， cough， and history of cardiac or renal disease， as well as illicit drug use.\n\n【9】On presentation， the vital signs were normal. Lab work included unremarkable CBC， normal ESR， elevated CRP， mildly elevated CPK， significant acute kidney injury with creatinine 3.98mmol/L with baseline of 0.9， and urine analysis remarkable for proteinuria with 300 mg/dl， significant red blood cells with>100 A， and 21-30 hyaline casts. Hospital course was complicated by an episode of significant coffee-ground emesis， lactic acidosis， and hypotension necessitating ICU transfer. Underwent endoscopy revealed esophagitis and severe portal hypertensive gastropathy. Physical exam was significant for diffuse hemorrhagic maculopapular lesions over all extremities with hemorrhagic plaques of distal fingers and tense vesicles of feet. Rheumatology was consulted and initial differential diagnosis was broad including various vasculitis such as cocaine induced， drug induced， Sweet's Syndrome， and systemic vasculitis like Wegener granulomatosis and MPO-ANCA-related vasculitis. Underwent rheumatologic workup including， elevated IgA， undetectable rheumatoid factor， cryoglobulinemia not present， HIV/hepatitis panel negative， urine drug screen negative for cocaine， C3 low at 66， C4 within normal limits， negative ENA panel， negative ANCA panel， and negative MPO and PR3 antibodies. A biopsy of a characteristic lesion of the skin revealed strong deposits of IgA in vessel wall leading to the diagnosis of IgA vasculitis. Given the deposition was IgA rather than IgG or IgM without eosinophils seen， his otherwise unexplained gastropathy， negative work-up for infection and alternative vasculitides， IgA vasculitis was considered the most likely diagnosis. The lack of eosinophils makes drug induced vasculitis less likely. Patient later underwent a kidney biopsy that revealed focal segmental necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis with deposits of IgA， which further supported a diagnosis of IgA vasculitis. He was stabilized from a bleeding and kidney function standpoint， and the patient was discharged on Prednisone with rheumatology follow-up.\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】The vast majority of IgA vasculitis is self-limited and can be managed in the ambulatory setting， unless there is inability to maintain oral intake， GI bleeding， changes in mental status， severe pain limiting ambulation， or renal insufficiency. Treatment is generally supportive with hydration， rest， and analgesics. The use of steroids is controversial withsome studies that suggest glucocorticoids prevent renal involvement and gastrointestinal complications  but other studies reveal no benefit . Renal biopsy is typically obtained to determine the degree of crescent formation and is the best indicator of prognosis . Recurrence of IgA vasculitis is reported in about one-third of pediatric cases and relatively worse prognosis with adults. Adults are at increased risk of progression to significant renal involvement and end-stage renal disease . Treatment of IgA vasculitis nephritis is only considered in patients with marked proteinuria (>1 g/day) and/or impaired renal function during an acute episode. Immunomodulating drugs like cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate mofetil may also be considered in conjunction with IV steroids if no there is benefit with steroids alone .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:46:36", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:46:43", "cost": 6.291}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:43", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:46:42", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:46:36"}

In the literature，parapharyngeal ICA is usually asymptomatic with an abnormal course of 10%to 40% . Aberrant ICA may cause difficulty in swallowing， extraneous object sensation， pulsatile sound perception or mouth pulsation when it is symptomatic. It occurs as a result of atherosclerotic changes due to acquired diseases such as Diabetes Mellitus (DM)， Hypertension (HT) and Coroner Artery Disease (CAD) especially in elderly patients and it is more symptomatic . Aberrant ICA poses a vital risk in surgical procedures and intubation since it will cause massive bleeding . In this article， we present a 72-year-old woman with aberrant nasopharyngeal ICA who presented with left-sided tinnitus. We aim is to remind the patient who comes with tinnitus， not only otoscopy but a complete ENT examination and especially the evaluation of the nasopharynx in terms of vascular masses before the surgical approach.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 72-year-old female patient presented with tinnitus in the left ear and hearing loss in both ears. In the patient's history， it was learned that the complaint oftinnitus has been in both ears for a long time and increased in the left ear for the last year. The patient’s medical history was unremarkable except for asthma. In the otorhinolaryngologic examination， bilateral otoscopy and oropharynx were normal； a submucosal， regular pulsatile mass was observed in the nasopharynx， moving from the right side by swallowing to the right .\n\n【9】Computed Tomography (CT) angiography with a preliminary diagnosis of aberrant ICA revealed bending in the aberrant right ICA， curvature in the left ICA， and atherosclerotic wall calcifications in both ICA’s .\n\n【10】The patient was told that aberrant ICA may cause complaints such as difficulty in swallowing， foreign body sensation， pulsatile sound perception or mouth pulsation. It was recommended that anesthesia physicians should be informed of this condition and cardiology control， especially if nasopharyngeal surgery is necessary and may cause any bleeding during intubation. Audiologic examination of the etiology of tinnitus， the main complaint of the patient， was found to be consistent with presbiacusia. Betahistine 2 ×1 was started and the patient was followed up.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】ICA is embryologically cranial of the third branchial artery and dorsal aorta. In the fifth week of fetal life， a loop occurs at the junction of these two vessels. When the heart vessels and large vessels descend from the mediastinum， the ICA becomes flattened. If it doesnt flatten， it can be aberrant . Although the etiology of aberrant ICA is not known， it is thought to be caused by embryological and acquired diseases. It may occur as a result of atherosclerotic changes due to acquired diseases such as DM， HT and CAD， especially in elderly patients . In the case we presented， CT both ICA’s showed atherosclerotic wall calcifications that did not cause stenosis. Firstly， the ICA variations were classified by Weibeland Fields in 1965 and are still valid. In this classification， the ICA variation is classified in4 ways； straight， curved， bend， curl. The most common variation was straight. In the case we presented， on right ICA bending and left ICA curving was observed. In the patient with bilateral subiective non-pulsatile tinnitus， the presence of bilateral ICA variation， although not objective， suggests its role in the etiology of tinnitus . Aberrant ICA， which is generally asymptomatic， is present in a wide range of symptoms such as difficulty in swallowing， extraneous object sensation， pulsatile sound perception， mouth pulsation， nonspecific dizziness， tinnitus， headache， cervical distress， glossopharyngeal neuralgia and sleep apnea . In our case， there was a left-sided increase in bilateral tinnitus. Nasal endoscopy showed right-sided ICA and imaging showed variation in left-sided ICA. In another case in the aberran ICA case series of Jafarov et al. Humeral increase in the right ear and flexion variation on the same side were observed.\n\n【13】Aberrant ICA isusually asymptomatic， but in clinically suspected cases， full ENT examination should be performed and pulsatile lesions should be sought imaging methods Doppler USG(Ultrasonography)， CT， angiography， MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) are helpful in detecting vascular anomaly . In our case， a right sided pulsed mass was observed in the nasopharynx and CT and CT angiography examinations were performed and bilateral ICA anomaly was detected. Caution should be exercised in surgical procedures for nasopharynx punch biopsy， tonsillectomy， adenoidectomy， uvulopalatopharyngoplasty， peritonsillar abscess drainage， nasopharynx and oropharynx， as this will cause massive bleeding and mortality in known aberrant ICA patients . In addition， anesthesia physicians should also be informed as it poses a risk of bleeding in intubation .\n\n【14】Conclusion\n\n【15】Aberrant ICA may cause massive bleeding and may cause mortality. Especially in the surgical approach to the nasopharyngeal masses of physicians who are at the beginning of their professional experience， aberrant ICA should be considered and the patient should inform the anesthesiologist before the other surgical procedures.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:45:31", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:45:49", "cost": 17.625}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:43", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:45:48", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:45:30"}

Even though the slight elevation in biochemical markers， 23I metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy confirmed the abnormal uptake in the right adrenal gland， the patient was submitted to laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Surgical pathology was diagnostic of pheochromocytoma. Postoperatively，plasma cathecolamines were all in normal range and paroxysmal hypertension disappeared.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Pheochromocytomas are rare but clinically important tumors， whose failure to diagnose can result in sudden and lethal complications . Pheochromocytomas are usually suggested by paroxysmal symptoms such as headache， sweating， palpitation and hypertension . Although sporadic pheochromocytomas are most common， there is a growing incidence of genetically driven cases possibly secondary to widespread availability of genetic testing in some parts of the world. Traditionally， sporadic forms of Pheochromocytomas occur in individuals aged 40-50 years and tumors size are large . Using improved biochemical tests and imaging modalities， they have become to be diagnosed at earlier stage， so that the size of diagnosed tumors is decreasing. Here we report a case of 17-mm in the largest dimension pheochromocytoma detected byI-metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy without significant excessive production of catecholamines. Postoperatively，her blood pressure was well controlled with half the number of antihypertensives and paroxysmal hypertension disappeared.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A. 77-year-old woman was referred to a local hospital for investigation of sudden and striking blood pressure elevations. She had 17-year history of hypertension well controlled with several antihypertensive agents， but she became to have recent symptom of paroxysmal hypertension. On first visit， a screening abdominal computed tomography (CT) with 1-mm thin slices revealed a 17 x 9 mm sized homogeneous mass with soft tissue density (approximately 30-40 Hounsfield units) in right adrenal gland . Biochemical tests revealed that plasma norepinephrine concentration was slightly elevated (824 pg/ml)， however， the levels were not within the threshold range suggested for the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma  . Plasma renin activity， plasma aldosterone concentration and adrenocorticotrophic hormone were all in normal range. Additionally， plasma cortisol was under 1.00 ug/dL after low dose (1 mg) dexamethasone overnight suppression test. Six months later， a follow-up anatomic test coupled with biochemical measurements (plasma catecholamines and urine fractionated metanephrines) were performed. An abdominal CT demonstrated that the tumor size was no change. Biochemical tests showed that plasma norepinephrine concentration (976 pg/ml) and urinary normetanephrine excretion(713 ug/gCre) were modestly high . Although the elevation of biochemical markers for pheochromocytoma was slight， the patient still had the symptom of paroxysmal hypertension， a functional imaging was performed. The 1\"I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (\"I-MIBG) planar image showed abnormal uptake in the right adrenal gland indicating that the tumor was a potential pheocormosytoma. Then， she was admitted to our hospital for further evaluation for possible pheocormosytoma. During testing at hospitalization， she had the paroxysmal hypertension. Plasma catecholamine levels were within normal limits， whereas 24-hour urinary excretion rates of norepinephrine， VMA and normetanephrine were higher than upper limits of normal rang， especially the urinary norepinephrine excretion elevated to more than three times the normal value . On the basis of the symptom， the positive 123I-MIBG scintigraphy and the significant elevation of biochemical markers， the patient was subjected to laparoscopic right adrenalectomy. Postoperative pathologic findings confirmed pheochromocytoma . Histologically， well demarcated area was detected within the adrenal medulla. The region was composed of adrenal medullar cells with clear/eosinophilic cytoplasm arranged in zellballen pattern . Immunohistochemically， the tumor cells stained positive for Chromogranin A . The tumor cells exhibited a low Ki-67 index . Postoperatively， her plasma cathecolamine levels were all in normal range. She remained free from symptom of paroxysmal hypertension even though she still11needed antihypertensive agents to control her hypertension.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Pheochromocytomas arecatecholamine-secreting tuimors arising from chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla. They are rare but clinically important tumors， whose failure to diagnose can result in sudden and lethal complications . Based on autopsy studies， however， many cases are probably missed than are diagnosed. At the Mayo clinic in the 50-year period ， 40，078 autopsies were performed and pheochromocytomas were present in 54 patients. Among these patients， 13 patients were diagnosed during life， and41 patients were unsuspected autopsy findings . On the other hand， even among patients suspected to have a pheochromocytoma， the diagnosis is rarely confirmed . Because pheochromocytomas can have a highly variable presentation and an overlooked clinical entity， the diagnosis of pheochromocytomas is difficult， especially when a tumor size is small. In the present case， there are several practical points related to the diagnosis and management of small pheochromocytomas. First， small pheochromocytomas did not always have excessive catecholamine production. Marlon et al showed a direct correlation between tumor size and hormone level that was independent of the clinical presentation . Run Yu et al. showed that most of the patient with small pheochromocytomas exhibits modestly elevated or normal biochemical marker levels， resulting in underdiagnosis. Other study showed that small tumors have slower turnover rates and release free catecholamines into the circulation that lead to hyperadrenergic symptoms . In our case， repeated biochemical measurements of plasma catecholamines and urinary catecholamines or fractionated metanephrines yield false-negative results. Plasma norepinephrine level (976 pg/ml) and urinary excretion of fractionated metanephrines (713 ug/gCre) were modestly high (plasma fractionated metanephrines are not available in Japan)，however，the levels were not within the diagnostic threshold for pheochromocytoma. Therefore， referred to the recommended testing algorithms， pheochromocytoma should have been excluded in the present case . Currently， there exist several guidelines based on which biochemical tests should be used to confirm or exclude a suspected pheochromocytoma， but no guideline address the importance of tumor size in the diagnosis of pheochromocytomas. Our case suggests that it is essential to pay sufficient attention to the influence of tumor size on biochemical measurments because small pheochromocytoma often exhibits modestly elevated or normal biochemical marker levels， resulting in underdiagnosis.\n\n【8】Secondly， small pheochromocytoma exhibits same suspicious (A，B) Hematoxylin and Easin staining. Well demarcated area was detected within the adrenal medulla The region was composed of adrenal medullar cells with clear/eosinophilic cytoplasm arranged in zellballen pattern.\n\n【9】Table 1： Biochemical testing.\n\n|  | First Testing  | Second Testing  | On Admission  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Blood tests  |  |  |  |\n| Catecholamines (HPLC)  |  |  |  |\n| Epinephrine (LT 100 pg/ml)  | 18 (pg/ml)  | 19 (pg/ml)  | 19(pg/ml)  |\n| Narepinephrine (100-500 pg/ml)  | 824 (pg/ml)  | 976(pg/ml)  | 360 (pg/ml)  |\n| Urine tests  |  |  |  |\n| Catecholamines (HPLC)  |  |  |  |\n| Epinephrine (3.0-41 pg /24h)  | unmeasured  | unmeasurec  | 33.5(pg/24h)  |\n| Norepinephrine (31-160 pg/24h)  | unmeasurec  | unmeasurec  | 576(pg/24h)  |\n| Fractionated metanephrines (HPLC)  |  |  |  |\n| Metanephrine (0.18mg/24h)  | unmeasured  | 0.13(mg/gCr.)  | 0.09 (mg/24h)  |\n| Narmetanephrine (0.28mg/24h)  | unmeasurec  | 0.71(mg/gCr.)  | 0.30 (mg/24h)  |\n| VMA(HPLC)  |  |  |  |\n| VMA(1.9mg/24h)  | unmeasured  | unmeasured  | 7.55 (mg/24h)  |\n\n【11】On the first visit (first testing). plasma norepinephrine concentratian (824 pg/ml) was elevated but did not reach a cutaff of inclusion criteria of pheachromocytoma. Six manths later (secand testing)， plasma norepinephrine concentration (976 pg/ml) and urinary narmetanephrine exretian (713 pg/gCr) were madestly high. On admission， the plasma catecholamine levels were within normal limits. 24-hour urinary excretion rates of narepinephrine (576 pg/24h)， VMA (7.55 pg/24h) and normetanephrine (300 pg/24h) were higher than upper limit of normal range.\n\n【12】(C) Immunahistochemical staining.

In the present case， abdominal CT identifies 17-mm mass ofwhich appearance ofhomogeneitywith soft-tissue density(approximately 40-50 HU) is suggestive of a pheochromocytoma. Moreover，123I-MIBG scintigraphy clearly showedaafocusSOI radioactivity in the mass. The current 2I-MIBG scintigraphy has a high sensitivity at 83%-100% for a specificity of 95%-100% . Owing to high sensitivity and specificity， Ioannis et al. ， say that the presence of pheochromocytomas should always be ruled out or confirmed with I-MIBG scintigraphy. Run Yu et al. ， also recommends to incorporate imaging characteristics of the tumor into the interpretation of biochemical test results. CT with contrast wash-out studies are alternative imaging modalities which may help characterize suspicious adrenal lesions or pheochromocytomas.\n\n【16】Finally， in our patient，smallpheochromocytoma didnotcontribute to hypertension. Her hypertension didn’t extremely improve after the operation. This may be come from her long duration ofhypertension and progression of arteriosclerosis. A prior study demonstrated that only a quarter of the patients with small pheochromocytomas can expect improvement of preoperative hypertension after tumor removal . Regardless of a poor improvement of hypertension， resection of small pheochromocytoma is necessary， because most of tumors， ifuntreated， cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are high.\n\n【17】Conclusions\n\n【18】A diagnosis of probable pheochromocytoma should still be pursued in patients with modestly elevated catecholamine profiles， especially if clinical history or imaging findings are suggestive. The presence oftypical adrenergic symptoms， oscillating blood pressures， known genetic predisposition or characteristic radiological findings would increase the pre-test probability of diagnosing a catecholamine producing tumor. Consideration should be given to functional imaging modalities in such cases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:41:09", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:41:21", "cost": 12.203}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:43", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:41:20", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:41:08"}

Ophthalmic complications due to cranial neuropathies are uncommon in AFRS. A case of AFRS with abducens nerve paralysis is reported.\n\n【2】Patient Description：A 66-year-old man presented with worsening diplopia and nasal obstruction. Ophthalmologists diagnosed left abducens nerve paralysis. Edematous and polypoid mucosa with viscous discharge was observed in the left middle and superior nasal meatuses. Blood examination showed hyperglycemia， eosinophilia， and antigen-specific IgE positive to Aspergillus. Opacification of a high-density area with sphenoid bony deficiency was seen on computed tomography and iso- and low intensities were observed on T1- and T2- weighted magnetic resonance imaging in the left maxillary， posterior ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses. Left Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (ESS) was performed urgently under general anesthesia. Polypoid mucosa with viscous contents was observed in the maxillary， posterior ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses during ESS. Histopathological examination of the sphenoid sinus showed Aspergillus in the contents and marked eosinophilic infiltration without fungal infiltration into the mucosa.

Currently 6months after surgery， there is no evidence of suspected recurrence or exacerbation.\n\n【3】Conclusion： AFRS should be suspected when nasal polyposis with viscous discharge and cranial nerve paralysis are seen， and it should be carefully treated surgically.\n\n【4】Keywords： Allergic Fungal Rhinosinusitis (AFRS)； Abducens nerve paralysis； Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (ESS)\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Allergic Fungal Rhinosinusitis (AFRS) is characterized by Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS) with nasal polyps (CRSwNP)， a type I (raised IgE) and possibly type III hypersensitivity reaction， production of allergic mucin with abundant eosinophils， and non-invading fungal hyphae . Approximately 7% to 10% of operations for CRS are due to AFRS in the USA . AFRS is thought to be refractory CRS. For a definite diagnosis， there are the classic criteria of Bent and Kuhn  and the clinical guidance of the American Academy of Allergy，Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) . Taken together， we diagnoseAFRS when all six essential items ofboth criteria are fulfilled：  Sustained CRS symptoms for more than 12 weeks (such as nasal discharge， nasal obstruction， olfactory disorder， or facial pain)；  Characteristic findings of rhinosinusitis on Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)；  Presence of allergic mucin on endoscopy (pathologically confirmed presence of fungi and mucosal infiltration of eosinophils)；  Edema/polyp formation of the middle nasal meatus or middle turbinate on endoscopy；  Type I hypersensitivity to fungi (elevated blood serum levels of specific IgE to fungi or positive intracutaneous test)； and  Pathologically ruled out infiltration of fungi into the surrounding mucosa. Previous studies reported that， in AFRS，ophthalmic complications due to cranial neuropathies are uncommon . A case of AFRS that presented with diplopia due to left abducens nerve palsy is reported.\n\n【7】Case Presentation\n\n【8】A 66-year-old man presented to Hyogo College of Medicine with diplopia and nasal obstruction. His nasal obstruction was treated by nearby ENT clinics for more than three months. Because double vision appeared in addition to the exacerbation of nasal symptoms one month prior to his visit， he was referred to our department for treatment. On consultation with the Department of Ophthalmology in our hospital， the double vision was diagnosed as left abducens nerve palsy. The patient also had diabetes mellitus.\n\n【9】Edematous and polypoid mucosa was observed in the left middle nasal meatus on endoscopy . Around the left superior nasal meatus and superior nasal turbinate， edematous and polypoid mucosa with viscous discharge was also observed. No fungi were detected in the viscous discharge on culture. No abnormality was observed in the right nasal cavity. Blood examination showed hyperglycemia (144mg/dl)， HbA1c-NGSP (7.0%)， Eosinophilia (24.4%)， and Antigen-specific IgE positive to Aspergillus (Class 2). The antigen-nonspecific IgE level (53.3 IU/ml) was within the normal range (<173 IU/ml). Beta-D-glucan was also within the normal range (<11.0 pg/ml). CT showed opacification with a High-Density Area (HDA) in the maxillary sinus， posterior ethmoid sinus， and sphenoid sinus on the left side . A thin bony deficiency was observed in part of the left sphenoid bone around the superior orbital fissure .T1-and T2-weighted MRI showed iso- and low intensities， respectively， in the left posterior ethmoid sinus， and sphenoid sinus . No intracranial lesions were observed.\n\n【10】In order to remove and decompress the mucinous lesions immediately， left Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (ESS) was performed urgently under general anesthesia for the abducens nerve palsy due to sphenoid sinusitis on the day of the initial visit to our department in the hospital. Blood loss was less than 10 mL. Surgical findings of the paranasal sinuses showed polypoid mucosal swelling and viscous contents in the posterior ethmoid sinus， sphenoid sinus， and maxillary sinus . Although the anterior ethmoid sinus showed edematous mucosal swelling， there was no retention of viscous contents.Inflammation was not observed in the frontal sinus. Histopathological examination ofthe specimens of the sphenoid sinus during ESS showed Aspergillus in the contents (Grocott stain， ) and marked eosinophilic infiltration without fungal infiltration into the sinus mucosa (Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) stain， (Figure mucous membrane swelling remaining in the left sphenaid sinus (b).\n\n【11】4b)). Since this case fulfilled all six essential items of the diagnostic criteria (mentioned above)， a definite diagnosis of AFRS was made. No antifungal medicine was administered before and after surgery. Corticosteroids (steroids) were not given systemically because of the history of diabetes mellitus. Since the patient's postoperative course was uneventful， he was discharged on postoperative day 5. Three months after ESS， the ophthalmologists declared the diplopia cured. On endoscopy and CT， partial mucous membrane swelling remained in the left sphenoid sinus， but no abnormality was found in other paranasal sinuses . Currently， 9 months after ESS， there have been no findings suggestive of recurrence or exacerbation.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】A case of abducens neuropathy due to AFRS was reported， since， to the best of our knowledge， there have been no case reports of abducens neuropathy due to AFRS in Japan according to a previous nationwide report . A total of 37 cases of AFRS fulfilling the diagnostic criteria of AAAAI have been reported in Japan， and8% of them had ophthalmic symptoms (3/37 cases： 2 cases with exophthalmos and one case with decreased vision) . Although there was a report that 3% (3/94) of AFRS cases in the USA had abducens paralysis， its occurrence is thought to be uncommon .\n\n【14】As mechanisms causing cranialneuropathies dueto rhinosinusitis， inflammation affecting adjacent nerves and mechanical compression， which can cause direct nerve compression and/or a circulatory disorder due to vascular compression， can be considered. The abducens nerve is the most common cranial nerve to be affected due to its medialanatomicallocation in the cavernous sinus and proximity to the sphenoid sinus， followed by the optic nerve . In AFRS， the volume of allergic eosinophilic inflammatory mucinous products of fungal colonies increases gradually and their expansion causes bony demineralized erosion and nerve compression . Approximately20% of patients with AFRS demonstrated bone erosion on CT scan， and male patients were reported to be at higher risk of bone erosion than female patients . Therefore， the pathogenesis of diplopia in the present case could be the result of inflammation of the sphenoid sinus spreading directly to the abducens nerve and expansive compression of the abducens nerve due to eosinophilic mucin produced by the fungi with sphenoid bone destruction.\n\n【15】With respect to the management of Fungal Rhinosinusitis (FRS)， accurate early diagnosis before treatment is very important， because the medical treatment strategies for infectious and non-infectious(AFRS) diseases differ. For infectious FRS， immune suppressors， such as steroids， can never be used， because they can stimulate and exacerbate fungal infiltration. In cases of invasive type， antifungal therapy is required until serum beta-Dglu can levels decrease to within normal limits . On the other hand， for AFRS， steroids are indicated and useful， with careful attention to Cushingoid side effects， where as the benefits of antifungal therapy are still unclear. A combination of steroids and ESS is required，and oral steroids can subsequently lead to short-term postoperative improvement. Although oral steroids could not be administered to the present case with diabetes mellitus， steroids might be required for future recurrence ofAFRS.\n\n【16】In the differential diagnosis， Eosinophilic CRS (ECRS)is one of the most important diseases. Based on the Japanese Epidemiological Survey of Refractory Eosinophilic Chronic Rhinosinusitis (JESREC) study， ECRS is definitely diagnosed by the following four items：bilateral lesions； nasal polyps； ethmoid sinus-dominant； and blood eosinophilia . The majority of ECRS cases have bilateral involvement， whereas less than 30% of AFRS cases show bilateral involvement in Japan . Unilateral AFRS might become bilateral in the future. Some patients with unilateral AFRS certainly fulfll the JESREC criteria because of CRSwNP with severe eosinophilia(>10%)， as shown in the present case. Patients with ECRS who fulfill the diagnostic criteria for AFRS might also exist. It is important when making the diagnosis to consider the possibility of AFRS by being sufficiently aware of the disease， though the pathogenesis of AFRS still remains controversial， with some uncertain issues .\n\n【17】In the present case， ESS was performed one month after the onset of ophthalmic symptoms， and fortunately the abducens paralysis improved. ESS is necessary in the earlier stage for rhinogenic ocular symptoms . The ocular manifestations of AFRS can be reversible if promptly and appropriately addressed and decompression is performed . Fortunately， no recurrence and good progress have been seen in the present patient. However， since AFRS is thought to be refractory and have a high possibility of recurrence， continuous careful long-term follow-up observation is required .\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】We encountered an uncommon case of AFRS that presented with abducens neuropathy， which has not been previously reported in Japan. Lessons learned from the present case are that what we should take into consideration the possibility of AFRS when we observe nasal polyposis with viscous nasal discharge and cranial nerve paralysis， and what ophthalmic symptoms should be treated surgically in the early stage.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 15:20:38", "endTime": "2024/09/20 15:28:06", "cost": 447.307}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:43", "update_time": "2024-09-19 23:28:06", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 23:20:38"}

The precise prevalence of epidermolysis bullosa is unknown . EB classified into four major groups， looking at the level of skin involvement： EB Simplex (EBS) involving the intra-epidermal layer， Junctional EB (JEB) involving the lamina lucida， Dystrophic EB (DEB) involving the sublamina densa； and Kindler syndrome involving multiple layers of the epidermis. Junctional EB is divided into three subgroups： Herlitz， Non-Herlitz，and JEB with Pyloric Atresia (JEB-PA). JEB- PA is an autosomal recessive blistering disease， which can be fatal in early infancy even after the correction of PA. It is usually diagnosed in the neonatal age . JEB-PA has a high mortality rate of up to 75% because of infection and nephritic impairment . Besides the skin lesions，other common extra-cutaneous manifestations are corneal erosions， dental， nail， and hair abnormalities， along with tracheal and urinary tract involvement. JEB has a higher incidence of airway obstruction compared to other types of epidermolysis bullosa. The incidence rate oflaryngeal stenosis， stricture， or obstruction around 40% for Herlitz-JEB by the age of 6% and13% for non-Herlitz -JEB by the age of 9 .\n\n【5】In this case report， we tend to present a toddler's history with Carmi syndrome complicated with subglottic stenosis.

She was managed as croup in the other facility with nebulizer epinephrine， dexamethasone orally， in addition to topically applied medications for skin lesions. Despite all management， stridor did not resolve. She was born as preterm 33 weeks and admitted to the NICU because of respiratory distress and pyloric atresia， which needed a surgical operation at the age of two days. Moreover， she was observed to have skin lesions； given the EB's positive family history， she was diagnosed with the disease (EB). Her family history was significant. Her sister had Epidermolysis Bullosa and pyloric atresia， but she died in the early neonatal period. Also， her cousin has been died before reaching her first birthday， suffering from Epidermolysis Bullosa. Unfortunately for both patients， there is no genetic study done.\n\n【8】On admission， physical examination revealed well appearance； no dysmorphic features， with blisters on her face， and nails junctions. There are audible stridor and mild respiratory distress with symmetric air entry. The rest of the examinations is unremarkable.

An interferon gamma release assay for tuberculosis (Elispot) was negative. Chest and abdominal CT-can showed no malignancy or lymphadenopathy. No abnormalities were found at gastroduodenoscopy with biopsy.\n\n【6】We considered an auto-immune disease with liver involvement as one of the differential diagnoses， and found a positive anti-ds DNA test (147 iU/mL)， which pointed towards Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). Additional laboratory tests were performed . On patient's request， further management was done as an outpatient. One month later， four months after the start of his illness， he presented with an acute state of confusion， hallucinations and muscle weakness. Physical examination revealed apathy， hypertonia and a tremor in the face and right arm. The anti-dsDNA titre was higher than before (169 iU/mL). A brain CT and MRI showed a specific white matter hyperintensities. The Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) contained an elevated protein concentration (1.26 g/L， normal value <0.80 g/L) without leucocytosis (4/uL). Infectious encephalitis was ruled out by negative PCR testing on CSF for several neurotropic viruses， and negative cultures. Borrelia serology was negative. An Electro-Encephalogram (EEG) showed signs of diffuse encephalopathy. Serum paraneoplastic antibodies were absent. A chest CT scan， performed because of persistent tachypnea， showed hilar node enlargement and a consolidation in the left lower lobe with pleural effusion. The pleural fluid was an exudate with negative cultures. SLE was diagnosed based on the clinical symptoms  and exclusion of other diagnoses He was treated with methylprednisolone 1000 mg/day intravenously for 3 days， followed by oral prednisone 60 mg/day and cyclophosphamide as induction treatment. His mental and physical state improved substantially over the first 3 days. Currently， he is treated with low dose prednisone and hydroxychloroquine and his illness is in remission.\n\n|  | Clinical criteria  | This case  | Reference values  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | Acute cutaneous lupus  |  |  |\n|  | Lupus malarrash  |  |  |\n|  | Bullous lupus rash  |  |  |\n|  | Toxicoepidermal necrolysis  |  |  |\n|  | Maculopapular lupus rash  |  |  |\n|  | Fotosensitive lupus rash  |  |  |\n| 2  | Chronic cutaneous lupus  |  |  |\n|  | Classic discoid rash  |  |  |\n|  | Hypertrophic lupus  |  |  |\n|  | Lupus panniculitis  |  |  |\n|  | Mucosal lupus  |  |  |\n|  | Lupus erythematasus tumidus  |  |  |\n|  | Chillblains lupus  |  |  |\n| 3  | Oral or nasalulcers  |  |  |\n| 4  | Alopecia  |  |  |\n| 5  | Synovitis of ≥ 2 jaints， or pain in ≥ 2 joints with ≥ 30 min morning stiffness  |  |  |\n| 6  | Serositis  |  |  |\n|  | Pleuritis  |  |  |\n|  | Pericarditis  |  |  |\n| 7  | Renal disorder  |  |  |\n|  | ≥ 500 mg urine protein/24 h  |  |  |\n|  | Red bloodcell casts  |  |  |\n| 8  | Neurologic  |  |  |\n|  | Seizures  |  |  |\n|  | Psychosis  |  |  |\n|  | Mononeuritis multiplex  |  |  |\n|  | Myelitis  |  |  |\n|  | Peripheral or cranial neuropathy  |  |  |\n|  | Acute confusional state  |  |  |\n| 9  | Hem olytic anemia  |  |  |\n| 10  | Leukopenia <4.0 10%L  | 1.1x10L  | 3.0x10/  |\n|  | Lymphopenia <1.0 10L  | 0.1x10%L  | 0.7x109L  |\n| 11  | Thrombocytopenia <100 10/L  |  |  |\n|  | Immunologic criteria  |  |  |\n| 1  | Anti-nuclear antibodies  | Positive  | Negative  |\n| 2  | Anti-ds DNA antibodies  | 169  | ≤15iU/mL  |\n| 3  | Anti-Sm antibodies  |  |  |\n| 4  | Antiphospholipid antibodies  |  |  |\n|  | Positive lupus anticoagulant  | Negative  | Negative  |\n|  | False positive test for syphilis  | Negative  | Negative  |\n|  | Anticardialipin antibadies (IgA， IgM of lgG)  | IgG：24  | <10 GPL-U/mL  |\n|  | Anticardialipin antibadies (IgA， IgM of lgG)  | IgM： 28  | <10 MPL-U/mL  |\n|  | Anti-beta 2 glycopratein1 (IgA， IgM of lgG)  | lgG：6，7  | <71/ml  |\n|  | Anti-beta 2 glycopratein1 (IgA， IgM of lgG)  | IgM： 13  | <7U/mL  |\n| 5.  | Low complement  |  |  |\n|  | Low C3  | 0.77  | 0.05 g/L  |\n|  | Low C4  | 0.06  | 0.45 g/L  |\n|  | Low CH50  |  |  |\n| 6.  | Direct Coombs test without hemolysis  |  |  |\n\n【8】Table 2： Neurapsychiatric SLE symptoms according ta the American Callege of Rheumatology .\n\n【9】Central nervous system\n\n| Aseptic meningitis  |\n| --- |\n| Cerebrovascular disease  |\n| Demyelinisation syndrome  |\n| Headache (including migraine en benigne intracranial hypertension)  |\n| Movement disorder (chorea)  |\n| Myelopathy  |\n| Epileptic insults  |\n| Acute consfusional state  |\n| Anxiety disorder  |\n| Cagnitive dysfunction  |\n| Mood disorder  |\n| Psychosis  |\n| Peripheral nervous system  |\n| Acute inflammatory demyelinating ppolyradiculoneurapathy (Guillain-Barre syndrome)  |\n| Autonomic dysfunction  |\n| Mononeuropathy/multiple mononeuropathy  |\n| Myasthenia gravis  |\n| Cranial nerve dysfunction  |\n| Plexopathy  |\n\n【11】Polyneuropathy\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】ThetypicalSLEpatientis a 15 to 50 year's old female withcutaneous manifestations. Atypical neurologic symptoms like a headache and mood disorder are prevalent among SLE patients， but severe neurologic symptoms are rare with an incidence of 8 per 100 person years . Table 2 presents all possible cerebral SLE manifestations. Cerebral involvement early in the disease process is uncommon， especially for a male patient aged 59 years. In the work-up of a clinical presentation with cerebral symptoms， one should therefore exclude an electrolyte/metabolic disturbance， acidosis， uremia， and infection； including a lumbare puncture to exclude punctureto exclude encephalitis or meningitis. An intoxication or psychiatric illness should also be considered. If these examinations do not lead to a diagnosis， an EEG and cerebral MRI are indicated to exclude demyelination， thromboembolic process。or ischemicevent. Neuropsychiatric SLE should be considered at this stage. The SystemicLupusInternational Collaborating ClinicCsS(SLICC) classification criteria are not diagnostic， but may guide further examinations. There is not a single test， or combination of tests， which proves or rejects the diagnosis neuropsychiatric SLE with sufficient certainty. For example， a recent Chinese study found that34% of patients with neuropsychiatric SLE did not have any abnormalities on an MRI of the brain . The presence of specific antibodies in the liquor makes the diagnosis neuropsychiatric SLE more likely. Besides antiphospholipid antibodies， previous studies found anti-ribosomal1P， anti-neuronaland1：anti-N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor antibodies to be present in patients with neuropsychiatric SLE . However， the cornerstone in the diagnostic process remains anamnesis and physical examination. Excluding differential diagnoses is crucial In our patient， anticardiolipin antibodies were present. Antiphospholipid antibodies are detected in 20% to 30% of patients with SLE， especially those with neuropsychiatric involvement. Their presence gives an absolute yearly risk of thrombosis of about 5%. The Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS) is defined as repeatedly detected antiphospholipid antibodies， and thrombotic manifestations. In the absence of thrombosis， the diagnosis APS was not made in our patient. SLE patients have a 3 times higher risk of premature death compared to the general population . Most important causes of death are end-stage renal failure and infections， potentially partly due to nephrotoxic medication and immunosuppressants. Lupus cerebritis， which was present in our patient， is a rare cause of death . Major neuropsychiatric SLE manifestations， like cerebral ischemia， seizures and psychosis， are associated with an even worse prognosis than generalized SLE activity without neuropsychiatric manifestations . Combining glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive therapy results in 60-80% of these patients in quick improvement with disappearance of symptoms within 2 to 4 weeks. However， relapses occur in up to 50% of patients.\n\n【14】Conclusion\n\n【15】This case shows that neuropsychiatric SLE should be considered if a patient presents with inexplicable neurologic symptoms， even if the patient does not fit the typical SLE profile (i.e. young female with cutaneous manifestations).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:48:51", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:49:02", "cost": 10.226}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:43", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:49:01", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:48:51"}

We have described an interesting case of pelvic organ prolapse repair with urethral reconstruction for a traumatic rupture of the urethra after improper Foley catheterization and related literature to the case.\n\n【2】Patient and Methods： Our index case was a 67-year-old lady who presented with something coming out through per vaginal for the past 2 years， along with urinary incontinence following Foleycatheter insertion. On examination， she had grade uterine 4 (Baden-Walker halfway system) prolapses with grade 2 cystocele and a grade 1 enterocele， along with a bivalved urethra at 12“O’clock and 6O'clock position starting close to the bladder neck and going up till the urethral meatus.

Nowadays iatrogenic trauma is the most common cause of urethral injury that presents after improper instrumentation ； the estimated risk being 3.2 per 1000 during a hospital stay . According to Chapple ， partial urethral tears are usually associated with iatrogenic causes and the other forms ofiatrogenic trauma include urethral injury because ofendoscopy， synthetic sling placement， diverticulectomy surgery and vaginal surgeries. However， iatrogenic injury to the urethra， bladder neck and trigone causing urinary incontinence is rare .\n\n【12】Pelvic organ prolapse presents with bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms which can be extremely incapacitating at times that a patient might want a definitive resolution of her symptoms and removal of the uterus along with needed specific compartment repair. A case of vaginal hysterectomy for a grade 4 pelvic organ prolapses along with compartment repair for grade 3 cystocele and grade 1enterocele with urethral reconstruction for an uncommon， iatrogenic traumatic rupture of the urethra during Foley insertion is described here， with good outcomes.\n\n【13】Methods and Methodology\n\n【14】Sixty three years old lady presented to us with something coming out per vaginum for the past 2 years. It was minimal to start with and she would reposit it back before passing urine or stools. However， for the past 6 months， she found it difficult to put it back as the prolapse had become swollen. She developed dribbling of urine for the past4 months when she was admitted to a hospital and a urethral Foley catheterization was done. She developed dribbling of urine in spite of being on the Foley catheter and reported that the procedure of Foley catheter insertion had been quite painful with a little bleeding related to the procedure. She denied any form of urinary incontinence prior to the Foley catheter insertion. She had previous three vaginal deliveries with no obstetric or neonatal complications and she had been hypertensive for 10 years， maintaining normal blood pressure on tablet Telmisartan 40 mg once a day with a BMI of 28kgmand no other co-morbidities.\n\n【15】Urogynecological examination showed a bivalved urethra at12O'clock and 6OClock position starting close to the bladder neck and going up to the urethral meatus. The urethral meatus had widened and she had a peri Foley catheter leaking of urine with grade uterine 4 ( Baden-Walker halfway system) prolapse with grade2 cystocele and a grade 1 enterocele . The prolapsed part had become quite edematous because oflong-standing prolapse so she was on vaginal packing (roller gauze with betadine solution and liquid paraffin) twice a day for about 10 days to decrease the congestion. Ultrasound of the kidney urinary bladder showed normal bilateral kidneys with irregular bladder walls and settled echogenic debris suggestive of cystitis. Urine routine and microscopy showed15 pus cells/ HPF and urine culture suggestive of Enterococcus species sensitiveto nitrofurantoin，so she was started on Tablet Nitrofurantoin200 mg BD for 7 days. Cystoscopyshowed urethra as patulous，bladder neck wide open， anterior bladder wall normal， posterior bladder wall laid open with prolapsed bladder neck； the trigone seemed inflamed with bilateral ureteric orifice normal . The remaining urethral length was about 2 cm. Pre-anesthetic fitness was obtained and an option of vaginal hysterectomy with anterior and posterior compartment repair along with urethral reconstruction was given which the patient consented to as she wanted a definitive option for her symptoms.\n\n【16】Surgical steps\n\n【17】The patient was taken in a low lithotomy position under spinal combined epidural anesthesia\n\n【18】Hydrodissection with Injection of normal saline was done in the paracervical region .\n\n【19】A circumferential cervical incision was taken anteriorly just below the bladder reflection .\n\n【20】The vagina was mobilized anteriorly with the help of a bladder retractor and the anterior cul-de-sac was opened with the help of blunt and sharp dissection .\n\n【21】The posterior cul-de-sac was opened sharply by making a bold cut in the posterior vaginal wall held by the Allis forceps between the uterosacral ligaments .\n\n【22】Bilateral uterosacral ligaments were clamped， cut and ligated by vicryl No 1， followed by transfixation of the cut pedicles. Both pedicles were tagged individually by a curved artery .\n\n【23】Bladder retractor was inserted in the vesicouterine space to keep the bladder away .\n\n【24】Bilateral uterine vessels were clamped， cut and ligated by vicryl No 1， followed by transfixation of the cut pedicles .\n\n【25】Right side fallopian tube， round ligament and ovarian vessels were clamped， cut and transfixed by vicryl No 1， with the pedicle tagged by a straight artery .\n\n【26】The uterus was held by an Allis forceps and kept away on the other side .\n\n【27】Left side fallopian tube， round ligament and ovarian vessels were clamped， cut and transfixed by vicryl No 1， with the pedicle tagged by a straight artery .\n\n【28】The uterus was delivered out and sent for histopathology.\n\n【29】All the pedicles were inspected for any bleeding .\n\n【30】The cul-de-sac was obliterated by getting both the uterosacral pedicles in the midline by going through both the uterosacral pedicles and tying them in the midline.\n\n【31】The redundant posterior peritoneum was sutured in 2 to 3continuous layers by vicryl no 2 to obliterate it .\n\n【32】Allis forceps were used to hold the anterior vaginal wall at the vaginal apex and hydrodissection was done by injecting normal saline .\n\n【33】Bilateral vaginal flaps were created by incising the anterior vaginal wall in the midline  and inserting scissors just below the vaginal epithelium and dissecting the entire cystocele from the vaginal wall. The assistant held the created vaginal flap by multiple Allis forceps to give gentle traction for dissection and the dissection was carried out until the inferior pubic rami were reached bilaterally.\n\n【34】Both the bivalved urethral edges were held by Babcock forceps and stay sutures were taken by vicryl no 4.\n\n【35】Periurethral dissection was done to mobilize the urethra circumferentially .\n\n【36】The bivalved urethral edges were approximated primarily by vicryl no 4 in a continuous manner anteriorly (12O’clock) and posteriorly (6O’Clock)  to restore the urethral lumen.\n\n【37】Dorsal reconstructed urethra was buttressed by the periurethral tissue by interrupted sutures with vicryl no 4 .\n\n【38】Plication sutures were taken at the urethrovesical junction by vicryl no 2 in an interrupted manner to support the posterior urethra.\n\n【39】Ventral reconstructed urethra was buttressed by the pubocervical fascia by interrupted sutures with vicryl no 4.\n\n【40】A purse-string plication suture was taken by vicryl no 2 to reposit the prolapsed bladder.\n\n【41】Ventral reconstructed urethra was buttressed by the left vaginal flap which is insinuated right up to the right inferior pubic rami so that the sutures to close the anterior vaginal wall do not overlap the reconstructed posterior urethra .\n\n【42】The redundant vaginal flaps were trimmed bilaterally.\n\n【43】The anterior vaginal wall was closed by vicryl no 2 in an interrupted manner .\n\n【44】The uterosacral ligaments were anchored to the posterior vaginal wall bilaterally.\n\n【45】Vaginal vault was closed by vicryl no 1 in an interrupted manner and picture after vault closure .\n\n【46】Hydrodissection with Injection of normal saline was done just below the posterior vaginal wall.\n\n【47】Three Allis forceps were used to hold the vaginal wall posteriorly and form a triangle on gentle traction .\n\n【48】A wedge-shaped perineum was cut to reconstruct the perineum .\n\n【49】Bilateral vaginal flaps were created by incising the posterior vaginal wall in the midline and dissecting the entire rectocele from the anterior wall of the rectum .\n\n【50】A purse-string plication suture by vicryl no 2 was taken to reposit the prolapsed rectum.\n\n【51】The posterior vaginal was closed by vicryl no 2 in an interrupted manner and the perineum was reconstructed .\n\n【52】Vaginal packing was done with roller gauze dipped in betadine solution.\n\n【53】The Foley catheter was fixed to the anterior abdominal wall with adhesive sticking in a form of a gentle loop to minimize tension on the neourethra.\n\n【54】The operative time was about 3 h with a blood loss of approximately 250 ml to 300 ml. Vaginal packing was removed on day 1 post-operatively. She was kept on intravenous antibiotics for3 days and then shifted to oral antibiotics for a total of 7 days. The patient was kept on PUC for 4 weeks and she did not report any pericatheter leaking of urine post-operatively  shows day21 post-operative status. Post-operative urine culture sent on day2 post-surgery was sterile. After 4 weeks a VCUG was performed which showed no extravasation of urine and successful voiding with insignificant urinary post-void residual volume. Hence， PUC was removed， on day 28  post-operative images shows a near normal looking neomeatus. She was followed up after 1 month， 3months，6 months and 12 months maintaining urinary continence. Ethical committee approval has been taken to publish this case.\n\n【55】Discussion\n\n【56】Etiology of iatrogenic urethral injury\n\n【57】Post-traumatic urethral injury is rare in females because ofits short course， mobility and the urethra is protected under the bony pelvis with no significant attachments to the pubis . In the developing countries， urethral injuries were seen as part of complicated labor whereas in the developed countries urethral injuries are mostly caused by trauma or iatrogenic causes . Erosion of the urethra by the synthetic pubovaginal slings is the emerging new cause ofurethral injuries encountered lately  and requires more extensive urethral repair because it is complicated by removal of the graft material.\n\n【58】Routine Foley insertion can sometimes go wrong， and there have been cases of bladder rupture  and incomplete ureteral rupture in a neurologically impaired person ； warranting extreme caution when inserting Foley catheter in every patient. A 14 Fr-16 Fr Foley catheter with a 5 ml to 10 ml balloon is recommended for women to reduce the pressure effects on the urethra and the bladder neck by Igawa et al. as long term Foley catheterization can cause pressure necrosis of the urethra needing urethral reconstruction later .\n\n【59】Diagnosis of iatrogenic urethral injury\n\n【60】A thorough history to know the exact cause of injury would help to plan the management and a thorough urogynecological examination to look for the extent and the site of urethral injury. Cystourethroscopy tells us about the condition of the remaining urethra， particularly the proximal urethra and the internal urethral sphincter . In a case of urethral injury it is important to rule out a concomitant bladder injury before we plan a surgical repair.\n\n【61】Management of iatrogenic urethral injury\n\n【62】The goal of urethral reconstruction after a urethral injury is to achieve a continent and an unobstructed urethra. However， considering the lack of standardization in urethral reconstruction restoring the anatomy and the urethral function is a challenge. The second hurdle is accomplishing the surgical repair of the anatomy and the function in a single-stage procedure； correcting the anatomy is restoring the torn urethra and correcting the function means preserving the urinary continence. Urinary incontinence is most commonly encountered because of the sphincteric loss  similarly seen in our patient.\n\n【63】The literature related to urethral reconstruction is quite diverse and there is no standardization regarding the best technique. The surgical technique of urethral repair largely depends on the extent of damage to the urethra and the surgeon's expertise. If there is minimal disruption， a single layer of interrupted sutures can suffice， a bigger defect would need a vaginal flap and if lateral tissue is insufficient then a U-shaped vaginal wall can be rotated to create the posterior urethral wall. However， in cases of extensive scarring， a labia minora flap can be raised to cover the defect . Sufficient mobilization of the periurethral tissue is important for a tension-free reconstruction followed by a multi-layered closure of the defect， along with adequate blood supply and a continuous urinary drainage form essential features of surgical repair .\n\n【64】Timing of the urethral reconstruction： In the earlier days， the timing of urethral reconstruction was after 3 to 6 months after the injury has occurred； however， with the advent of flaps and grafts， it has become feasible to perform when the tissue is out of any infection or inflammation However， a well-vascularized flap is essential in cases of severe injury and compromised blood supply. So a urethral repair can be performed immediately， or there can be a delayed primary repair (10 to 14 days) and at times a late repair which is after3 months .\n\n【65】Single stage urethral reconstruction with concomitant anti-incontinence procedure： Summond et al.  had 40/50 patients with iatrogenic urethral injury and total incontinence (AC±V H in27， UD in 11 and transurethral bladder neck dissection in 2). All the patients had 75% or more loss of the urethral floor. Primary closure was performed in 25 cases， lateral relaxing incisions were taken in3， labial skin flap was taken in 12 cases and Martius flap was taken in 10 patients. A second stage retropubic urethrovesical suspension was performed in 20 patients with a cure rate of 74% (37/50) and improved in 8%(4/50).\n\n【66】Blaivas et al.  in their series of 10 incontinent women with extensive urethral injury because of operative complications (UD in 6，AC in 2 and AI-procedures in 2 patients) performed a concomitant anti-incontinence procedure (pubovaginal sling in 6， modified Pereyra operation in 3， and modified Kelly plication in 1). 6/10 were continent after a single-stage procedure and the remaining 3/10had SUI with VVF in 1/10. An anti-incontinence procedure was performed as a second stage procedure in the 3 patients with SUI with suiccess.\n\n【67】Flisser et al.  performed urethral reconstruction in 67/74women for iatrogenic reasons (UD 28， urethral injury after Pereyra procedure 18， AC 10， gynecological surgery resulting in fistula in3， synthetic material erosion 5， urethral obstruction from previous surgery 3). Vaginal Flap Repair (VFR) alone 10/74， VFR with autologous pubovaginal sling 56/74， VFR with modified Pereyra repair 5/74， VFR with Kelly plication 1， Urethrolysis with primary urethral repair in 1 and Tanagho anterior bladder flap in 1 was done. Preoperative incontinence was in 62/74 and postoperatively 54/74(87%) women had improved or cured incontinence. Four had SUI cured by 2 stage procedure and 2 had de novo urge incontinence. Flisser et al.  deemed staged procedures and the use ofbladder flaps as“unnecessary” in their experience and advocated VFR along with pubovaginal sling as an anti-incontinence procedure.\n\n【68】In a review by Blaivas et al. in 2008， less than 500 patients with severely injured urethra were described in English literature and successful reconstruction was achieved in 67% to 100% with continence in 55% to 92% of them， after a single-stage procedure. Incontinence was about 50% to 84% in women where an anti-incontinence procedure was not performed concomitantly；however， secondary procedures performed subsequently were successful in most of the patients. It was advocated that proximal urethral injuries have as high as a 50% chance of urinary incontinence unless a concomitant sling has been used. Hence， Blaivas et al.  preferred an autologous pubovaginal sling concomitantly at the time of urethral reconstruction in cases of sphincteric incontinence.\n\n【69】A case of urethral injury along with the sphincter has been cited by Wadie et al. ， while enlarging the vaginal introitus and was treated successfully with a PAS and posterior vaginoplasty， a similar case of urethral injury extending up to the bladder neck at 6Ocock position following a longitudinal complete urethral incision for a mistaken vaginal septum was described by Albayrak et al.leading to total incontinence and corrected by a rectus fascial sling.\n\n【70】Rosenblum et al.  in their review described urethral erosion by synthetic sling as the entry of the sling substance into the urethral lumen which is treated by complete surgical removal of the foreign body， debridement and reconstruction primarily with or without the use of Martius flap along with an autologous fascial sling for SUI. Similarly Amundsen et al. in their series of 9 patients with urethral erosion following pubovaginal (1 autologous and 8 synthetic) sling insertion described locating the urethral erosion cystoscopically and then incising the sling near the erosion with debridement of the urethra and then primary reconstruction along with augmentation with Martius graft. In a case of a synthetic sling， the whole sling was removed and in non-synthetic slings， it was “peeled out”of the urethra. However， in this series 30 months after surgery all the patients had some form of voiding dysfunction (urinary retention in4， urge incontinence in 3 and mixed incontinence in 2)； one of the patients with SUI required a pubovaginal sling later.\n\n【71】Reconstructive vascular flaps for post-traumatic urethral reconstruction： Approaches for urethral reconstruction described by Blaivas et al.  include using anterior or posterior bladder flaps and vaginal wall flaps.\n\n【72】Flisser et al. used flaps in 60/74 patients， Martius in 58，omental in 3， gracilis myocutaneous in 1； Martius flap was found to improve the outcome of the surgery as it would prevent the breakdown of the repair and thereby a recurrent fistula. Tubularized pedicle flaps of the buccal mucosa， neurovascular pudendal thigh flap and rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap have come up recently .\n\n【73】A modified neurovascular pudendal thigh flap (Singapore flap) was described by Zorn et al.  for complete urethral reconstruction following previous urogynecological surgeries in 2 patients. In 1patient a tubularized flap was anastomosed to the bladder neck，but she developed bladder neck stricture after 2 months and required urethral dilation. For the 2 patient， a flap was used to cover up an inlay urethroplasty.\n\n【74】Post-operative urethral catheterizatiom after urethral reconstruction： Chapple et al.  recommended bladder drainage for about 4 weeks for complete urethral healing； we had kept our patient on per urethral catheterization for 4 weeks with good outcomes.\n\n【75】Complications related to urethral reconstruction： One of the early complications of urethral injury is an infection which can lead to an abscess formation， warranting early urinary diversion and antibiotics to prevent complications .\n\n【76】Incases of urethral injury， the bladder can develop low compliance， over activity and impaired contractility which in most cases improves after successful urethral reconstruction .\n\n【77】Sling concomitant with POP repair in pre-operative SUI cases： Post POP repair there is a 25% to 40% chance of developing SUI (de novo or worsening) because of the unkinking of the urethra in previously continent women  concomitant sling surgery reduces the chances of postoperative SUI at the cost of increased risk of complications related to the AI procedure. However， in cases of preoperative SUI， a concomitant sling surgery along with POP repair had a significantly decreased rate of SUI at 1 year follow up . Autologous fascial pubovaginal slings in comparison to synthetic mesh MUS have a higher risk of voiding dysfunction post-operatively along with greater morbidity associated with fascia harvesting. Autologous fascial pubovaginal slings may be preferred in cases of urethral reconstruction where the autologous fascia offers concomitant urethral reinforcement and there is a risk of erosion and foreign body action associated with the synthetic material of MUS . In our case， the patient reported acute onset of urinary incontinence following painful Foley insertion so primarily urethral reconstruction was sought along with VH and a second stage AI procedure was planned if she had persisted urinary incontinence.\n\n【78】Urethral reconstruction concomitant with POP repair： To our current knowledge， this is one of the first cases of urethral rupture during improper Foley catheterization treated successfully with urethral reconstruction， which was concomitantly performed with a vaginal hysterectomy and compartment repair in a single-stage procedure.\n\n【79】Conclusion\n\n【80】Even though Foley catheterization is a simple procedure but needs to be done with caution as improper insertion can lead to major urethral injuries. Hence， in the present era of increasing medical litigation， knowing the management of iatrogenic urethral trauma is important， even though it is quite uncommon.\n\n【81】Pelvic organ prolapse repair and urethral reconstruction can be accomplished in the same setting； however， the need for an anti-incontinence procedure needs to be individualized.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:47:24", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:48:07", "cost": 42.899}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:43", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:48:06", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:47:23"}

Management and operative technique are still a matter of debate and the role of the robotic surgical platform in these patients has not been reported on. We present a robot-assisted repair of a rare TAWH through a fracture of the left iliac wing. Our operative technique and review of the literature is described.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 46-year-old male with a history of a high energetic trauma presented at our department with a symptomatic swelling in the left lumbar region. He was involved in a traffic accident four years ago， suffering from multiple organ injuries and a fracture of the left iliac wing that were all treated conservatively. At time of presentation， he had an abdominal wall protrusion in the left lumbar region. He complained of decreased abdominal muscle strength with chronic discomfort during Valsalva maneuvers. A previous CT scan showed an important defect of the abdominal wall caused by a disruption of the iliac and gluteus muscles and non-union of the left iliac wing fracture. This caused a herniation of the descending colon through this bony defect of the left iliac wing . There were no signs of strangulation or incarceration. An elective operative management was scheduled.\n\n【6】A robot-assisted Transabdominal Preperitoneal hernia repair (TAPP) using the da Vinci Xi(Intuitive Surgical， Sunnyville， CA， USA) robotic system was planned. The patient was positioned in right lateral decubitus. Pneumoperitoneum was established through an open 10 mm trocar introduction in the left paraumbilical position. Two additional 8 mm trocars were placed on the left pararectal side， with all 3 trocars on the same vertical line. Exploration confirmed a herniation of the descending colon through the bony defect (3 cm in transverse length and 5 cm in longitudinal length) of the left iliac wing . The content of the hernia was reduced after mobilization of the sigmoid. Subsequently a vertical incision was made in the peritoneum lateral to the left semilunar line to enter the preperitoneal space. The dissection was extended from preperitoneal to retroperitoneal with the medial edge of the psoas muscle as safety landmark that allowed us to avoid injuries to retroperitoneal structures， such as ureters， blood vessels， and nerves. We carefully preserved the entire hernia sac to ensure adequate tissue coverage of the mesh. Since the hernia was entirely bounded by bony structures， primary fascial hernia defect closure was unattainable. Therefore， we inserted a synthetic (20 by 20 cm) small pore polypropylene mesh (Bard mesh\"， C.R. Bard， Inc.， Covington，GA) in the created pocket. The mesh was positioned as such that the central part of the mesh covered the hernia defect . The mesh was fixed with absorbable Vicryl 2-0(Ethicon， Inc.，Somerville， NJ) sutures and fibrin glue (Tisseel Baxter Corp.，Deerfield， IL) onto the bone and the border of the psoas . We avoided mesh fixation with sutures， tackers or bone anchors in the iliac and psoas region to reduce the risk of chronic postoperative pain. The peritoneal sac was plicated at its base using a running absorbable suture (V-Loc， Covidien， Mansfield，\n\n【7】MA， USA). The postoperative course was uneventful， and the patient was discharged one day after surgery. At follow-up the patient showed no chronic pain or signs of recurrence. Clinical bulging was minimal. The follow-up period up to now is 6 months. infection between early and late hernia repair . In the absence of hemodynamic instability or peritonitis， patients may safely be observed and referred for delayed hernia surgery .\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】TAWH is a rare and often difficult diagnosis in the trauma setting. Due to its low incidence and high risk for associated injuries there is no consensus on the management. The mechanism of injury following blunt trauma consists of a disruption or weakness of the underlying abdominal wall musculature or fascia with secondary herniation . TAWH at the level of an associated pelvic fracture has been scarcely described in the literature. We report a case of a delayed presentation of a symptomatic large bowel herniation through a traumatic hernia defect of the left iliac wing， treated by mesh repair with the robotic platform.\n\n【10】Various methods for the repair of hernia defects in TAWH have been described. These include primary closure with non-absorbable monofilament sutiires， fasciocutaneous flap reconstruction， bioprosthetic or prosthetic mesh repair . The decision depends on clinical situation at the time of diagnosis， patient comorbidities， size， and location of the hernia defect. Without signs of gross contamination or bowel perforation， hernia repair with synthetic mesh is feasible in the acute setting. In the presence of peritonitis biologic meshes can be used or， alternatively， the patient can be referred for a delayed mesh repair. As we describe in our patient report， we performed a delayed elective mesh repair after a delay in diagnosis. The decision to perform surgery was based on the patients’symptoms of discomfort and the risk for incarceration/strangulation because of the presence of bowel herniation.\n\n【11】Traditional management methods of TAWH focus on early exploration and hernia repair due to the high risk for concomitant intra-abdominal injuries . With a reported incidence ranging from 18% to 60% of intra-abdominal and bowel injury， patients diagnosed with a TAWH are often referred for early exploration and hernia repair . Considering the risk for contaminated field in the trauma setting， these patients are more likely to have a primary tissue repair instead of mesh repair. Data available from small case series show higher recurrence rates in TAWH after primary suture compared to a delayed mesh repair， respectively 26% to 50% and 8%. Honaker et al. and Netto et al. note a decreased recurrence and complication rate in delayed mesh repairs . However， in a large-scale multicenter retrospective study from Harrell et al. in 2021， there is no significant difference in hernia recurrence or surgical site Location of the hernia defect matters in the decision-making process of the ideal method for repair. The atypical location through a non-union of the left iliac wing made fascial closure of this hernia defect impossible. To provide sufficient strength we used a small pore heavyweight polypropylene mesh (Marlex， C.R. Bard， Inc.， Covington，GA) and provided extensive mesh overlap through a large preperitoneal dissection. In the literature， there is lack of evidence about the best surgical method to close this bony defect. Only two case reports by Delaune et al. and Moon et al. provide their surgical technique for the repair of an interfragmentary hernia through the iliac wing . Moon et al. describes a repair with closure of the bony defect using two fibular strut allografts . Delaune et al. uses a prosthetic monofilament polypropylene mesh， fixed from the iliac crest to the subinguinal hiatus and to the anterior space of the left kidney . However， no conclusive information about follow-up and outcomes are available.\n\n【12】Considering the surgical approach， there is no formal comparison between open， laparoscopic， and robotic approach in traumatic abdominal wall surgery. The open approach is most frequently used in both early and delayed repairs. Harrell et al. states that more than90% of early repairs are performed open， compared with 68% of late repairs. The minority of reported TAWH are managed laparoscopic or robotic， respectively 7% and 0% for early repairs and 21% and15% of late repairs . In the last ten years， there is a tendency to perform abdominal wall surgery with minimal-invasive techniques to achieve less morbidity. Subsequent， there is also growing interest to manage TAWH in a delayed state with minimal-invasive techniques. Novitsky et al. describes the largest series of 14 patients who underwent laparoscopic mesh repair of traumatic flank hernias in an elective setting. No complications or recurrences occurred after an acceptable mean follow-up period of 35 months . The literature concerning robotic repair in traumatic lateral hernia is still scarce. Only 2 retrospective case series report on 4 patients who had a delayed repair of lumbar traumatic hernia . However， in both studies surgical procedural details are limited and no comparison has been made between the outcomes of robotic vs. open or laparoscopic technique. Wijerathne et al. reports a robotic TAPP procedure in a lumbar traumatic hernia. The authors recommend to perform a robotic repair if the hernia defect is larger than 4 to 5 cm to facilitate an extensive dissection and adequate mesh coverage in the lumbar region ， especially when there is lack of adequate tissue to close the fascial defect and in the proximity of important neurovascular structures， as presented in our patient case. We believe that， in an elective setting， the robotic platform facilitates dissection and adequate mesh placement in the lumbar region. Furthermore， compared to the laparoscopic approach， it provides better ergonomics and less technical difficulties， particularly in lateral abdominal wall hernia surgery .\n\n【13】The available literature has several limitations， most importantly the small population and short-term follow-up duration. There is no conclusive evidence to support one operative method of repair over the other in TAWH surgery. Robotic repair has proven some evidence for feasibility in small case studies and is of growing interest. We found our robot-assisted approach to be safe and feasible for the management of this rare and chalenging TAWH\n\n【14】Conclusion\n\n【15】TAWH is rare and the management is still a matter of debate. There is a tendency towards mesh repair in a delayed setting with minimal invasive techniques. In difficult to reach areas of the abdomen， a robot-assisted repair of TAWH might be a valid approach.

Aneurysm of the arch and the descending aorta along with vertebral destruction is a very rare combination with no observations in the global clinical practice. Only one scientific review has mentioned a similar pathology .\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 43-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with complaints of foreign body sensation， periodic pressing chest pain， shortness of breath on slight exertion， and paroxysmal dry cough. According to anamnesis， at the age of 20， the patient had a fall from approximately 6-m height. His six-month-old radiograph showed an aneurysm of the thoracic aorta . Multi-Spiral Computed Tomography (MSCT) angiography identified signs of aneurysm of the thoracic aorta that infiltrated its wall， neoplasm of the upper floor of the posterior mediastinum， and destruction of vertebral bodies (Th3， Th4， And Th5) and fourth rib on the left . Considering failure of the aortic arch with the spread of the descending thoracic aorta， it was clear that stenting of this segment should be performed after the preparatory stage of the brachiocephalic arterial switch operation. In addition， given the probability of finding a tumor mass in the projection of the aneurysm， an open heart surgery was decided to be performed.\n\n【7】Operative technique\n\n【8】The operation was planned as follows： after the median sternotomy， cardiopulmonary bypass connection was provided； arterial cannula was inserted into the right subclavian artery， and venous cannula into the right atrium； cardiopulmonary bypass was initiated； and the patient's body was cooled to 24℃.\n\n【9】On visualization of the aorta， its diameter at the sinotubular junction was about 30-35 mm and that at the level of the ascending portion and the aortic arch was 60 mm. Majorinflammation was noted in the projection of the upper and middle third of the descending aorta， distal to the arch； the aorta soldered to the upper lobe of left lung and vertebral bodies， th3 and th. When the temperature reached 24C， cardiopulmonary bypass was abandoned； this was followed by antegrade perfusion to the brain at a flow rate of 15 ml/kg/minute，andaortotomy was performed. Thelumen of the aorta had thrombotic masses with varying degrees of organization. Vertebral bodies with erosive changes were visualized on these masses after they were removed . According to express histological analysis， a modified aneurysmal aortic wall tissue was involved in the destruction of the vertebral bodies. Sinuses of valsalva were not expanded， when viewed from the tricuspid aortic valve without pathology. Prosthesis in the ascending portion of the arch and the descending thoracic aorta at the level of the 5-6， and brachiocephalic arteries were manipulated using vascular prosthesis (vascutek siena plexus 26). On the fourth day after surgery， the patient was transferred from the intensive care unit to the profile department. During post-operative period， the patient showed symptoms of respiratory failure， severe asthenic syndrome， signs of exudative pleurisy that required pleural puncture， and prolonged antibiotic therapy (sulperazon) due to the long sub-febrile fever. On the forty-sixth day after operation， the patient left the hospital in good condition. Post-operative most showed defects on the left surface of the vertebrae th3-th4-th5 and the head of the fourth rib at the level of diligence modified para-aortic tissue. This is a type of atrophy caused by chronic aneurysmal pressure .\n\n【10】Discussion\n\n【11】Chronic-Contained Rupture of the aorta is relatively rare in the abdomen (2.7% of cases have reported pathology of the abdominal aorta) and very rare in the thoracic aorta . In the literature， only few similar clinical cases have been described . Patients with this condition are usually haemodynamically stable and do not perform acute symptoms， although they always have a high risk of rupture of the aortic wall. Persistent pressure on the surrounding tissue due to pulsation of the aorta over a period is probably the cause of destruction of solid structures such as vertebral bodies. In such cases， a differential diagnosis must be made using msct between primary tumours or metastatic vertebral tumours， vertebral fractures， osteoporosis， and other possible diseases .\n\n【12】ConcerningSurgical Treatment， aggressive Iremoval of aneurysmal wall near the spinal cord is not recommended because of possible damage to the spinal cord. Sometimes， it is sufficient to eliminate the pressure pulsating aneurysmal wall to prevent compression of the surrounding tissues. In such cases， it is possible to insert a stent-graft in the absence of inflammation. However， there are reports that indicate the progress of symptoms of compression in the surrounding tissues after the stent-graft， thus requiring another open intervention in the long term.\n\n【13】In the clinical case presented here， the strategy of performing an open heart surgery was chosen as a tumour process was suspected in the projection of the aneurysm， and the spinal cord was located at a sufficient distance from the site of destruction of the vertebrae (as seen in the most findings).", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:07:00", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:07:40", "cost": 40.559}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:43", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:07:40", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:06:59"}

Serous Ovarian Carcinoma (SOC) is the commonest type of EOC. There is a high incidence of ovarian cancer in infertility. However， there are only a few case reports outlining how SOC was discovered in infertile women. Here， we detail three infertility cases， who were found with persistent ovarian cysts by using continuous ultrasound monitoring， and they were diagnosed as SOC in stage I by examination of surgical and pathology specimens. No recurrence of the cancers occurred. However， one of the women became pregnant after conservative surgery， resulting in the live birth of a healthy baby girl. These cases are rare and unusual and suggest that continuous transvaginal ultrasound monitoring is helpful in detecting SOC at an early stage.\n\n【2】Keywords： Continuous transvaginal ultrasound； Infertility； Serous ovarian carcinoma stage I； Fertility preservation Epithelial Ovarian Carcinoma (EOC) is the most common type of OC and the most lethal gynecologic malignancy， with a mortality rate of 70%. Among all types of OC， serous carcinoma is the most common. The most fatal serous carcinoma， which is characterized by a poor prognosis， accounts for more than 80% of all EOC. SOC is the most common epithelial ovarian malignancy. Several alternative treatments for SOC have been developed in recent years. Nevertheless， overall survival rates for patients with SOC have not improved， as well as the existence ofunsolved problems in connection with the disease such as therapy resistance， disease recurrence and so on.\n\n【3】The pathogenesis of OC has yet to be clearly elucidated. The mechanisms which have been proposed include the incessant ovulation hypothesis ， stimulation by hormonal exposures and inflammation mechanisms  and this partly explains why there is a high incidence of OC in infertility. The study by Rasmussen et al found a significantly increased risk of OC in women with infertility and the use of Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) . As the disease has no characteristic symptoms in its early stages， most of the cases are diagnosed during more advanced stages leading to a low 5-year survival rate and the inability to preserve the fertility of individual patients.\n\n【4】Cai J. The Role of Continuous Transvaginal Ultrasound Monitoring for Detection of Early Stage Ovarian Serous Carcinoma in infertile Women. Three Cases with 5-Year Follow Up. Ann Clin Case Rep.\n\n【5】Here we present three case reports after oophorectomy. The three cases， which were all diagnosed with OC stage I， were studied retrospectively to evaluate the efficiency of transvaginal ultrasonography in detecting the disease in its early stages. The three cases were all followed up for 5 years. None of the three women with OC in stage I experienced recurrence of the disease and one of them successfully became pregnant after conservative surgery， resulting in the live birth of a healthy baby girl. For reproductive specialists， detecting an abnormal ovarian cyst by continuous ultrasound monitoring in infertility is beneficial for the 5-year survival rate and the preservation of tertility in patients.\n\n【6】Informed consent was obtained from patients for these reports. The institutional review board of Maternal and Child Health Hospital in Guangxi， China indicated that a report ofthree cases did not require specific institutional review board review and allowed the study to take place.\n\n【7】Case 1\n\n【8】A 35-year-old woman presented with menstrual disorder for more than nine years and with infertility for five years after marriage. This was diagnosed primary as infertility. The menstrual cycle varied from 37 days to 180 days， which was linked to a natural cycle ovulation on only rare occasions. Ovulation was stimulated in the patient by treatment with CC/HMG/HCG， but she failed to get pregnant. Polycystic changes were seen on the right ovary. Basic hormone measurements indicated that the levels of serum luteinizing hormone and testosterone were raised. After treatment with dyne-35 for 4 monthly cycles， the level of serum testosterone did not decrease， and this was accompanied with normal levels of 17-OH， 17-KS and cortisol. The results of repeated monitoring by transvaginal ultrasonography showed that the size of right ovary increased month by month， with a persistent corpus luteum cyst and normal levels of serum AFP and Ca. In January 2009， the size of right ovary increased markedly. The cyst size grew from 26 mm x18 mm to 53mm x 32 mm， with abnormal hyperechoic areas being observed within it .\n\n【9】Afterwards， the patient was treated by laparoscopic surgery. Intra-operative findings showed that the appearance of the uterus and left ovary was normal； the right ovary was augmented (the size was 80 mm x 70 mm x 50 mm)； some endometrium-like decaying tissue without a clear boundary was observed after the ovary was cut open after removal. When frozen sections were examined， a diagnosis of serous adenocarcinoma (III grade) was ascertained. After communication with the family members， an operation including total abdominal hysterectomy， greater omentum double attachment and appendectomy was performed. Post-operative diagnosis for the right ovary was serous adenocarcinoma (stage I). After surgery， 6courses of chemotherapy with cis-platinum and cyclophosphamide were implemented. There was no post-operative recurrence during a follow-up of 5 years. Histological examination showed that it was endometrioid ovarian cancer during stage 1A.\n\n【10】Case 2\n\n【11】A 32-year-old woman who was presented with infertility for3 years after marriage and a pelvic mass two months ago and was intended to be treated with assisted IVF-ET reproduction for primary infertility. The level of serum CA125 was 207.1 U/mL and AFP was negative. Because of the high level of serum CA125， down-regulation treatment was carried out 5 times from March to July in 2009， but failed. In January 2009， an ovarian cyst of 12 mm x12 mm was found on the left side by ultrasound. It persisted and increased gradually and did not change during the menstrual cycle. In March 2009， the size of the ovarian cyst was measured at 37 mm x 18 mmx18 mm， and it was observed to have two strong echoes and several dotted blood flow signals in it as well as an annular flow signal around it. This abnormal ovarian cyst was subjected to puncture treatment twice in January and March 2009. A bright yellow liquid was found during the first puncture and a dark brown liquid was found during the second procedure. Tumor cells were not found in either of these liquids. In addition， it was harder to puncture during the second procedure because the cyst had solidified. The patient had a regular menstrual cycle with occasional dysmenorrhea and no abnormal medical history .\n\n【12】During thelaparoscopic surgery， the appearance of the right ovary was found to be normal and there was a cauliflower-like mass on the surface of the left ovary. The size of the mass was approximately 80mm x 70 mmx 50 mm and it was solid， edematous， pale and very brittle， with an irregular shape and without a capsule. No tumor cell was found in the ascites fluid associated with the mass. A pathological examination revealed it to be an ovarian serous papillary carcinoma. Thus， an operation incorporating a total abdominal hysterectomy， including double attachment and appendectomy was performed. Routine post-operative pathological examination indicated that it was ovarian serous papillary adenocarcinoma with part ovarian cortex fibrosis and no tumor cell was found in the left fallopian tube. The result of post-operative diagnosis was left serous papillary adenocarcinoma (stage Ic). After surgery， 8 courses of chemotherapy with cis-platinum and cyclophosphamide were implemented. The level of serum CA125 was normal after the fourth week of surgery. The patient was followed-up for 5 years and did not experience any recurrence of the disease.\n\n【13】Case 3\n\n【14】A 27-year-old woman was presented with infertility for one year after which a mass of tissue was observed on the ovary. The planned treatment for the patient was to implement IVF-ET for assisting reproduction. The base levels of sex hormones， serum CA125 and AFP were normal. Two ovarian cysts with sizes of 19 mm x 14 mm and 12mm x 7 mm respectively， were found on the left side by ultrasound. There was 6 mL of yellow viscous liquid in one of the two cysts and 1.5 mL of brown liquid in the other which was observed after puncturing the two ovarian cysts， respectively. After puncturing， the two ovarian cysts did not shrink with strong echoes being seen within them. Cytological examination of the suction liquid indicated that they were infused with a conglobation of epithelial cells.\n\n【15】During the laparoscopic surgery， the appearance of uterus and the right ovary appeared normal； the left ovarian was in a crescent and the size was 50 mm x40mmx 40 mm with an irregular surface， and there was a 30 mm x 30 mm x20 mm purple red tumor on the surface. There was no tumor cell in the ascites fluid. A pathological examination indicated that it was serous papillary adenocarcinoma， without obvious infiltration into the capsule. After communication with the families， we were urged to preserve reproductive ability of the patient. Thus， a laparoscopic operation was performed on the left ovarian tube and a right ovarian wedge resection was performed. A routine post-operative pathological examination indicated that there was ovarian serous papillary adenocarcinoma， without tumor cells being present in the right ovary. Post-operative diagnosis was established to be serous papillary adenocarcinoma (stage Ic)， with extensive fibrosis in parts of the ovarian cortex. After surgery， 6courses of chemotherapy were implemented. Three months after chemotherapy， this patient had a successful pregnancy resulting in the live birth of a healthy baby girl weighing 3.20 kg. She did not experience any recurrence post-operatively with a follow-up of 5years. The data presented here would indicate that fertility-sparing surgery is an option for young， childless women who would like to preserve their fertility In these case reports， conservative surgery was chosen in case 3for a young childless patient. We showed that a pregnancy following stage I ovarian cancer with conservative surgery was possible. Current data and our experience revealed that it is not possible to make a definite recommendation for the treatment of all young childless patients with stage I ovarian cancer. However， the use of continuous vaginal ultrasound monitoring in infertile patients with a stage I ovarian cancer appears to warrant recommendation in some cases.\n\n【16】Discussion\n\n【17】Ovarian cancer is usually a fatal disease because it is difficult to detect during its early stage. Ovarian serous carcinomas are the most common EOC. Recent research described the role of sex steroid hormones in the etiology of EOC arising in the ovaries ， and the incidence of ovarian serous carcinomas becomes more frequent in women during their reproductive years. The International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) group is a multicenter collaboration whose aim is to design tools for the preoperative diagnosis of ovarian cancer that can be used by non-expert ultrasound operators. By using standardized terms and definitions to describe morphological features of ovarian tumors， the ‘simple-rules’ model of observed ultrasound features was designed. There no features are seen in the three case reports， which were unclassified or indeterminate. So for high-risk groups， continuous transvaginal ultrasound monitoring for detection ofearly stage ovarian serous carcinoma is significant. The data suggest that the incidence in women who were younger than 50 vears of age was about 45% . Thus， early detection of ovarian cancer may not only reduce the mortality of the disease， but also may have positive significance on fertility preservation. However， reports regarding the detection of early ovarian cancer by transvaginal ultrasonography are limited .\n\n【18】In these three case reports outlined here， we found three individuals with stage I ovarian serous carcinomas linked to infertility and these patients were followed-up for 5 years. None of the three patients experienced recurrence of the disease， and one of them conceived naturally which led to a live birth. The association between the long-term usage of infertility drugs and development of ovarian serous adenocarcinoma has previously been noticed. It was noticed that patients with ovarian serous adenocarcinoma may be prone to clinical problems after induction of ovulation or IVF procedures. Infertility alone and nulliparous women with refractory infertility mayparticularlyharbor a high risk ofovarian cancer . It is normal that childless women would like to preserve their fertility. These cases showed the benefits of transvaginal Doppler in detecting ovarian cancer during its early stages in asymptomatic women. These results could highlight the importance of diagnosing ovarian carcinoma as early as stage I in order to improve the patients’ chances of survival and wellbeing.\n\n【19】To date， similar cases have been reported rarely. David et al. reported an abnormal ovarian lesion which was subjected to ultrasound-guided needle aspiration during IVF. The patient underwent laparotomy after the IVF cycle. Two years later， the patient underwent a successful pregnancy with a donor oocyte. To the best of our knowledge， there is no report in which a clinical reproductive doctor detected an ovarian cancer by continuous ultrasound monitoring. During the process of IVF for assisted reproduction， continuous ultrasound monitoring， which provide the necessary condition to discover an abnormal cyst， is necessary， especially in the case of young women who wish to protect their fertility with conservative surgery. In one report ， the authors concluded that conservative surgery could be considered for young patients with EOC at stage IA and grade 1 in order to preserve their fertility potential， and in another report it was concluded that refreezing of transplanted ovarian tissue is beneficial to the patients with low risk of malignant cell recurrence . Conservative management of EOC at the very early stages and low grade is an option for those young childless women who would like to preserve their fertility. However， induction of ovulation remains classically contraindicated in EOC and the treatment must be undertaken very cautiously and requires rigorous surveillance.\n\n【20】As is well known， the ability to detect early ovarian cancer is difficult. In these three cases， it would seem that continuous ultrasound monitoring is an ideal screening procedure which could detect early stage ovarian cancer in asymptomatic women.\n\n【21】Ethics\n\n【22】Verbal consent was obtained from the patients when they were followed up. The patients'identification has been protected and any information which could potentially be used to reveal the identity of any of the patient has been removed.\n\n【23】Conclusion\n\n【24】We report here on three cases of infertilities who were found with persistent ovarian cysts， which were diagnosed as stage I SOC by obtaining surgical and pathology specimens. Because of the early detection， the three patients were all treated in time. As a result， no recurrence of the cancers occurred and one of the women became pregnant after conservative surgery， resulting in the live birth of a healthy baby girl. The report shows that such cases is rare and unusual and warrant further investigation. The report also shows that continuous transvaginal ultrasound monitoring is helpful in detecting SOC at an early stage. This report suggests that continuous transvaginal ultrasound monitoring can be a viable option for patients in order to detect early stage SOC.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:28:10", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:28:40", "cost": 29.285}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:43", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:28:40", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:28:10"}

Herein， we report a rare case of fulminant bicuspid aortic valve infective endocarditis caused by S. caprae in the absence of apparent risk factors.\n\n【2】Keywords： Staphylococcus caprae； Infective endocarditis； Coagulase-negative staphylococcus\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Infective Endocarditis (IE) is a serious condition associated with a high risk of morbidity and mortality. Between 2000 and 2011， the incidence of IE in the United States increased from 11 per100，000 populations to 15 per 100，000 populations . IE due to coagulase negative staphylococci is considered rare in the absence of implantable foreign bodies or recent invasive procedure . Staphylococcus caprae is a coagulase negative staphylococcus that is found in goats milk， but rarely causes human infection . Herein， we report a rare case of fulminant bicuspid aortic valve infective endocarditis caused by S. caprae in the absence of apparent risk factors.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 28 year old white male with past medical history only significant for infertility presented to the Emergency Department with fever to 101.4°F and malaise for two days. He also reported mild， constant， achy left upper extremity pain extending from the elbow to the tips of the fingers. On the day of admission， he developed a mild nonproductive cough without any chest pain or shortness of breath. He did not report palpitations， chills， night sweats， weight loss， sick contacts， recent illness， dental procedures， or travel. The patient is an office clerk who lives with his wife， and has no history of tobacco， alcohol or intravenous drug use. He was started on clomiphene orally four months earlier for infertility.\n\n【7】On physical examination the patient appeared comfortable. BP 104/42 mmHg， heart rate114 beats per minute， RR 14 unlabored and temperature 100.4°F. An III/VI systolic murmur was appreciated at the lower left sternal border. There were no conjunctival or palatine petechiae， splinter hemorrhages， Osler’s nodes or Janeway lesions. The spleen was not enlarged.Neurologic and musculoskeletal examination was normal.\n\n【8】Laboratory data showed a WBC of 15.1 k/ul， hemoglobin 11.6 gm/dl， MCV 78.4 fL， CRP of 6.57mg/L (normal value <3.0 mg/L)， ESR of 81 mm/hour (Normal value <15 mm/hour)， BNP of 395pg/mL (normal value <100 pg/mL)， and troponemia with a flat curve that peaked at 0.71 ng/ml. A12-lead EKG revealed a sinus tachycardia at 134 beats per minute with very subtle ST depressions in leads V5 through V6.\n\n【9】The patient was admitted to a telemetry unit and started on vancomycin and Ceftriaxone. Transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated a mildly reduced left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of 51% to 55%； a mobile mass of moderate size on the aortic valve； mild aortic valve regurgitation， trace mitral valve regurgitation， and an edematous aortic root. By the following morning two sets of blood cultures were positive for gram-positive cocci in clusters； two additional sets of cultures were sent.\n\n【10】On afternoon rounds the patient complained of fatigue and shortness of breath. Examination revealed a BP of 118/55 mmHg， heart rate of 140 beats per minute and a respiratory rate of 18 per minute. The JVP was elevated， there were new rales bilaterally and there was a Corrigan's pulse. Urgent cardiac surgery evaluation was requested and the patient underwent an emergent aortic valve replacement with 25 mm St. Jude mechanical aortic valve.\n\n【11】Table 1： Staphylococcus caprae antibiatic sensitivity profile.\n\n| Antibiotics  | Sensitive  | Resistant  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Clindamycin  |  |  |\n| Erythromycin  |  |  |\n| Gentamicin  |  |  |\n| Oxacillin  |  |  |\n| Penicillin G  |  |  |\n| Rifampin  |  |  |\n| Tetracycline  |  |  |\n| TMP-SMX  |  |  |\n| Vancomycin  |  |  |\n\n【13】Intraoperatively， the patient was noted to have a true bicuspid and bicommissural aortic valve. A“rather generous” left coronary leaflet was completely destroyed by infection with several vegetations protruding from it. Ultimately all four sets of blood cultures (8bottles) and all intraoperative specimens from the valve and vegetations grew. S. caprae resistant only to penicillin Antibiotics were deescalated to Nafcillin 2 gm intravenously every 4 hr.  summarize Staphylococcus Caprae antibiotic sensitivity profile.\n\n【14】Postoperatively， the patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on post-op day 5 to take standard heart failure medications， warfarin， and nafcillin for a total of 6 weeks. During the following week， pancytopenia and elevated liver function tests developed； nafcillin was discontinued and cefazolin was initiated. One week later the patient developed a diffuse maculopapular rash and severe pruritus unresponsive to antihistamines. Cefazolin was discontinued and vancomycin was begun but despite high doses， adequate levels were not achieved and treatment was completed with daptomycin.By week 4 of treatment inflammatory markers had returned to normal. At follow up two weeks after discontinuing antibiotics， the patient was back at work and repeat cultures were negative.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Several studies have demonstrated the growing importance of CoNS (Coagulase-Negative Staphylococci) as pathogens in patients with IE. In one study of 2781 patients with IE， coagulase-negative staphylococci were identified as the causative agent in 11%. However， Infective endocarditis caused by coagulase negative staphylococci is considered rare in patients with no history of artificial heart valves， implantable cardiac devices， catheter or intravenous drug abuse .\n\n【17】Although consideredalessvirulent P pathogen， infective endocarditis due to coagulase negative staphylococci is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Rasmussen found no significant difference in in-hospital mortality (21%) or need for early surgery(41%vs.47%) between S. aureus and coagulase negative staphylococci though 1-year mortality was better with CoNS (24%) than SA(37%). Fulminant endocarditis is extremely rare with CoNS IE and has only been reported with S. lugdenensis and S. epidermidis . S. caprae is a coagulase-negative staphylococcus first identified in goats in 1983. Since then the organism has been sporadically isolated in humans .Kanda et al.  found that 6% of 1，500 clinical isolates of coagulase negative staphylococci from human subjects were S. caprae in a Japanese hospital . Seng reviewed the literature in 2014 and identified 106 cases of S. caprae human infection. Bone and joint infection (usually associated with an implantable foreign body) and otitis externa accounted for 63 of 106 cases and endocarditis was found in only one patient . Almost all reported cases of invasive disease have been associated with hospitalization， prior antibiotic use， multiple co-morbidities and/or foreign bodies .\n\n【18】Although consistently isolated from goats， few of the patients colonized or infected with S. Caprae， have had contact with goats or goat’s milk . To analyze the difference between human and goat isolates of S. caprae， Vandenesch and his colleagues subjected isolates to ribotype analysis. Both human and goat isolates appeared phylogenetically to derive from the same lineage but the human isolates’ ribotypes were clearly distinguishable by the presence of a core of four specific bands possibly reflecting evolutionary changes within the species between human and goat isolates .\n\n【19】Our patient had no history of implantable cardiac foreign materials， intravenous drug abuse， antibiotic exposure or recent invasive procedures including dental procedures. Indeed other than evaluation for infertility some months earlier， he had no contact with the healthcare system. He had no contact with goats， goat milk or any goat-milk-containing products. His only risk factor for IE was a bicuspid valve.\n\n【20】Conclusion\n\n【21】We present the second case of IE and the first case of fulminant endocarditis due to S. caprae. S. caprae is a coagulase-negative staphylococcus that is predominantly Methicillin Sensitive. Although it is generally considered a low virulence pathogen that sporadically infects or colonizes hospitalized patients， it is capable of causing acute endocarditis of native valves in non-hospitalized patients and may lead to aggressive destruction of those valves.

Chemotherapy-induced pancreatitis should remain as a differential diagnosis in patients receiving chemotherapy regimens and presenting with acute pancreatitis. We present a case of cyclophosphamide induced acute pancreatitis in a 53 year old female with no other risk factor for pancreatitis， symptoms resolved in a few days after discontinuation of the drugs.\n\n【2】Keywords： Acute pancreatitis； Chemotherapy side effects； Cyclophosphamide； Drug-induced pancreatitis\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory condition of the pancreas characterized by abdominal pain and elevated levels of pancreatic enzymes in the blood. Acute pancreatitis is a leading gastrointestinal cause of hospitalization in the United States . Several conditions have been associated with acute pancreatitis. Of these， gallstones and chronic alcohol abuse accounting for approximately two-thirds of cases . The estimated overall incidence of drug-induced pancreatitis ranges from between 0.1% and 2% based on individual case reports and case control studies . This report describes a 53 year old female patient with recent diagnosis of stage 2 breast cancer who developed acute pancreatitis on day 4 after combination chemotherapy of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】This is a 53 year old female patient recently diagnosis of right sided breast cancer which was found to be triple positive，PR，ER and HER2/neu positive. She underwent multiple lumpectomies with inadequate clearing of margins. Patient received her first dose of adjuvant chemotherapy with IV cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin 4 days prior to admission along with pegfilgrastim. The patient reports later that evening， she started to experience severe mid epigastric pain，radiating to her back that was partially relieved by leaning forward but not much with Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAID). Her symptoms were associated with nausea，loss of appetite， and one episode of vomiting. She denied any fevers， change in bowel movements， dysuria， vaginal bleeding or recent trauma. Her past medical history includes ovarian cysts. She has no previous history of pancreatitis. She is a nonsmoker and drinks alcohol occasionally and denies any history of illicit drug use. Family history was noncontributory. Patient was not on any medications except for lorazepam， reglan and zofran that were prescribed to her on the day of chemotherapy.\n\n【7】On physical examination， stable vital signs， anicteric sclera and moist mucous membranes. Heart andlung examination were unremarkable. Abdomen examination was positive for significant epigastric tenderness， normoactive bowel sound， no palpable organomegalyand negative Murphy's sign.\n\n【8】Initial laboratory investigation showed white blood count of 30.8 with 80% neutrophils. Basic metabolic panel was within normal range except for mild hyponatremia 131 mmol/L (normal 136to 145 mmol/L). Serum amylase and lipase were markedly elevated 914 U/L (Normal 23 to 85 U/L) and 710 U/L (0 to 160 U/L) respectively. Liver function tests and coagulation profile were within normal range. Lipid profle was also within normal range. Imaging of the abdomen including an abdominal ultrasound showed no evidence of biliary ductal dilation and no cholelithiasis， wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid. CT scan with IV and oral contrast showed no peripancreatic inflammatory changes or focal lesions. Patient was admitted to medical floors with the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis presumed to be secondary to cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin as other causes were excluded and based on clinical presentation and elevated enzymes. Upon admission patient was managed conservatively with intravenous fluid，pain medication and NPO initially. During her stay， routine labs including and serum amylase and lipase were monitored closely. Her symptoms resolved completely with improvement of biochemical parameters. Discussed with patient regarding possible drug induced pancreatitis and communicated with her oncologist. Patient was counseled not to have any more Cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin chemo regimen. White blood counts along with amylase and lipase were trending down. Her abdominal pain， and nausea improved and her diet was advanced gradually as tolerated.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent that acts by preventing cel l l ldivision by cross-linkingDNAstrandss anddecreasing DNAAsynthesis . Cyclophosphamide also possesses potent immunosuppressive activity and it’s considered as a pro-drug that must be metabolized to active metabolites in the liver. Some of the adverse reaction well described in literature includes endocrine side effects such as altered hormone level (increased gonadotropin secretion)， amenorrhea and gastrointestinal side effects such as abdominal pain， anorexia， diarrhea， mucositis， nausea， vomiting(dose-related)，and stomatitis .\n\n【11】Drug induced acute pancreatitis account for 1.4% to 2% and chemotherapy-induced pancreatitis is rarer . The physiologic mechanism of chemotherapy-induced pancreatitis may be by direct damage by antibody formation and interaction with pancreatic cells. This response can activate T cells in vitro and results in tissue damage that is probably T lymphocyte Mediated . Another potential mechanism includes direct tissue injury by the medication.\n\n【12】Cyclophosphamide aand doxorubicineeitherr alonLee in combination， is quite rare that even the drug labels registered with the FDA， do not indicate acute pancreatitis as one of the possible complications and there are very few cases reported this side effect. In our patient， acute pancreatitis developed on the 4h day of the administration of chemotherapy， and resolved within a few days after discontinuation of the drugs. She didn’t have any other risk factors for pancreatitis as she doesn’t drink alcohol and laboratory finding including serum triglyceride， calcium levels， bilirubin， sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were all within normal levels. Liver ultrasound was negative for gallstones or biliary sludge， Also the patient didn't receive dexamethasone during her first chemotherapy cycle.\n\n【13】Review of other case reports such as Ben Kridis et al. presented a 20 year old patient that developed acute pancreatitis the second day after administration of doxorubicin and ifosfamide. She developed two episodes one was with metoclopramide and methylprednisolone and the second chemotherapy course was received without and both were complicated by pancreatitis. Ben Kridis et al.  mentioned 4 pediatric cases ofacute pancreatitis after administration of ifosfamide. He also described Doxorubicin as a rarely blamed medication for acute pancreatitis as per available data.\n\n【14】Another case report by Vincent et al.  described the development of acute pancreatitis in a patient with breast cancer three days after receiving the chemotherapy regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin. Another episode after re-challenging the patient with cyclophosphamide， and again a few weeks later with a derivative of doxorubicin， epirubicin， acute pancreatitis recurred on each occasion. Reflecting that cyclophosphamide was probably the inflecting agent in both episodes.\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】Due to the increasing number of case reports， chemotherapy-induced pancreatitis should remain as a differential diagnosis in patients receiving chemotherapy regimens and presenting with symptoms and signs typical of acute pancreatitis. Physicians can report new suspected adverse drug reactions directly to the FDA via its Med Watch program，by contacting the manufacturer of the drug， and by publishing case reports. Also post-marketing surveillance and adverse drug reporting should be done get a wide angle vision on the true incidence of chemotherapy induced pancreatitis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:09:44", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:09:58", "cost": 13.092}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:43", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:09:57", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:09:44"}

Spine is very rare site for their occurrence. In the spinal canal， the most common location is thoracic， intramedullary site. Our case is significant because it was located in the thoracic spine extending extradurally into the thoracic cavity， first reported in the literature.\n\n【2】Case Presentation： We report a 13-year old female admitted with paraplegia and urinary retention. Sensations were lost below D8 level. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an irregular enhancing lesion in extradural location from D4-D9 vertebra with intrathoracic extension on right side. Laminectomy (D5-D9)and right rib resection (rib7 and8) was done. Subtotal excision ofthethoracic mass was achieved.D5，6-D9，10 right transpedicular fixation was done. Adjuvant radiotherapy was advised. After 8 months of follow up， the patient power in both lower limbs was grade 2.\n\n【3】Conclusion： Ganglioneuroblastoma in children and young adults should be included in the differential diagnosis of thoracic cord tumors.

She started developing weakness in both the lower limbs and20 days prior to admission to our hospital； she was paraplegic with grade 0 power in both the lower limbs. Simultaneously， she was catheterized for urinary retention. Muscles were grossly hypertonic with exaggerated jerks and clonus.

On T2-weighted images the lesion was intense relative to normal cord. After contrast administration， there was strong enhancement .\n\n【10】Operative： Laminectomy (D5-D9) and right rib resection (rib 7 and 8) was done. On extracavitary approach tumor was extradural， firm， moderately vascular， compressing the spinal cord and extending through the neural foramina into the thoracic cavity. Also collected hematoma inside the mass was aspirated. Subtotal excision of the thoracic mass was achieved. D5，6-D9，10 right transpedicular fixation was done .\n\n【11】Hematoxylin-eosin stained sections showed dural tissue with adherent tumor with areas of hemorrhage and necrosis and a small round morphology and focal neurofibrillary rosette’s. Foci of calcification were identified . Other areas show sheets of ganglion cells on a fibrillary background . Immunochemistry revealed a negative staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein， whereas NSE immunoreactivity was positive in most of the cells and Ki-67 positive in 60%.\n\n| No.  | Study  | Age/sex  | Diagnosis  | Treatment  | Outcome  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  | Patnaik et al.   | 25 years/male  | T2 Extraduralmass  | Excision.

Adjuvant radiotherapy was advised. After 8 months of follow up， the patient'power in both lower limbs was grade 2.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Cerebral ganglioneuroblastoma is a term used for tumors which histological consist of undifferentiated small round cells in all stages of neuronal differentiation . These are grouped as Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumors (PNETs) al Peripheral or pPNET-those that arise from the sympathetic nervous system b) Central or cPNETs- those that arise within the CNS .\n\n【17】Three types of embryonal tumors of the CNS have been distinguishedby theWorld Health Organizationn(WHO)-medulloblastomas， the PNETs， and the atypical rhabdoid/teratoidtumors. All threee types histological correspond1to malignant grade 4 tumors. The PNETs include the (ICD-O code9490/3)， medulloepithelioma and ependymoblastoma . CNS neuroblastoma andgganglioneuroblastoma， whichwere earlier， classified as both neuronal and embryonal tumors by WHO， are now classified only as embryonal tumors . These tumors are usually found in the cerebrum， cerebellum， and suprasellar region. The other common location is posterior mediastinum and retroperitoneum. Spine is very rare site for their occurrence. In the spinal canal， the most common location is thoracic，intramedullary site .\n\n【18】Our case is significant because it was located in the thoracic spine extending extradurally into the thoracic cavity， first reported such case in the literature. Other reported cases were localized to the spinal compartment only .\n\n【19】Probably the mass eroded the neural foramina and entered the thoracic cavity as was seen intra-operatively.\n\n【20】Ganglioneuroblastoma present from 4 weeks to 20 years. Clinical symptoms are related to the site of origin. In our case， we present a patient with compressive myelopathy at D4-D9level.\n\n【21】All patients with confirmed diagnosis of ganglioneuroblastoma should receive radio chemotherapy. Radiotherapy should be given as adjuvant treatment even if there is complete excision in patients over 12 years of age. Prognosis remains unfavorable due to aggressive， malignant nature of the tumor with frequent recurrences as well as distant metastases . There was only one reported case of primary ganglioneuroblastoma in an extradural location in the literature. Our patient had a history of very short duration indicating the aggressive and malignant nature of the tumor. There was no primary lesion either in the brain or retroperitoneum. Ganglioneuroblastoma should therefore be considered in the differential diagnosis of extradural thoracic tumors in a young adult.\n\n【22】Conclusion\n\n【23】Ganglioneuroblastoma in children and young adults should be included in the differential diagnosis of thoracic cord tumors. Definitivediagnosis depends o1 post-operative histological examination. Curative treatment should be a complete resection of the tumor. Also， in partially resected cases； adjuvant radiotherapy may become necessary， along with close follow up.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:32:13", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:32:20", "cost": 7.432}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:43", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:32:21", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:32:12"}

It has now spread all over the world and causes presentations of life-threatening diseases. The widespread use of steroids and antibiotics， especially in those with immunocompromised and diabetic states， has led to an increase in new or existing fungal diseases . Rhino-Orbital-Cerebral Mucormycosis(ROCM) caused by angio-invasive saprophytic organisms， a class of phycomycetes， is additional threat as opportunistic fungi and the COVID-19 disease spectrum . Early detection and intervention are necessary to prevent disease transmission and death. There are several reports on the role of magnetic resonance imaging in Coronavirus-2019 Associated Rhino-Orbital-Cerebral Mucormycosis (CA-ROCM) with different clinical backgrounds . For successful treatment， early diagnosis and elucidation of key structures should be diligently investigated by combined Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) gadolinium contrast， which plays an important role in detecting nasal， orbital， and intracranial extension. In this study， we report the imaging findings of 17 patients with post-COVID-19 condition， who were treated with steroids， Remdesivir or oxygen， have been confirmed as ROCM with KOH mount or other histopathological investigations. Final observations are based on the total amount recovered after amphotericin B administration followed by FESS.\n\n【9】Materials and Methods\n\n【10】Patient population\n\n【11】In a prospective case study， a series of 17 patients with past history of COVID-19 and suspected to have ROCM underwent combined CT and contrast enhanced MRI and confirmed with KOH mount or histopathological investigations during March-May 2021. Patients with reduced Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)， raised creatinine values (more than 2 mg/dL) and raised BUN (Blood urea nitrogen) levels (more than 30 mg/dL)and MRI incompatible metallic implants were not included in this study.\n\n【12】Data acquisition\n\n【13】All patients underwent CT imaging using a Siemens Emoticon 16slice multi-detector scanner with image reconstruction in soft-tissue and bone windows. All patients underwent gadolinium contrast enhanced MR imaging using a Philips 1.5 T machine. Unenhanced axial and coronal T1， T2， Short Tau Inversion Recovery (STIR) as well as sagittal T2 images and Diffusion-Weighted Images (DWI) were obtained. Contrast enhanced sequences such as T1 multiplanar DIXON was obtained. Ethical and informed consents were not required as the images were anonymous.\n\n【14】Results\n\n【15】In this retrospective survey of 17 patients aged 35 to 65 years，76.47% with men (n=13) were more affected than women (n=4) with 23.529%. Patients with diabetes (n=14) were 82.23% and those without diabetes (n=1) were 5.88%. Symptoms of ROCM after COVID19 illness ranged from 1 to 3 months. Steroids were given in76.47%(n=13) of cases， and (n=4) 23.529% were given Remdesivir.64.705% of patients (n=11) required oxygen for their COVID-19disease. CT and MRI of 17 patients observed bilateral paranasal sinus involvement (100%). The predominant involvement of the ethmoid sinuses was in 76.47% (n=13) and the maxillary sinuses 94.11%(n=16). CT Plain study shows hypodense diffuse mucosal thickening involving the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavities along the turbinates with combined bony erosions involving the medial wall of the orbit， the ethmoid trabeculae and the bony nasal septum .\n\n【16】Disease extension into orbit was observed (n=10) with 58.82% of the right side (n=1) 5.88% and the left side (n=9) 52.94%. Bilateral orbital and optic nerve involvement were found in (n=1) 5.88% of patients and (n=4) 23.52% of patients， respectively.\n\n【17】Cavernous sinus disease (n=2) was observed in 11.764%，(n=10) meningeal involvement was observed in 58.823%，and (n=1) cerebral extension was observed in 5.882% of patients. No significant perineural disease was transmitted through the trigeminal nerve and other nerves.\n\n【18】CT showed bone erosions in (n=13)， 76.47% and adjacent soft tissue thickening with features of cellulitis as cardinal findings in most of the cases.\n\n【19】MRI showed T1 hypointense and T2 hyperintense signals with contiguous foci of non-enhancing necrotic mucosa giving the appearance of Black Turbinate sign in nasal cavity in many of the cases (n=6) 35.23%. MRI is the imaging of choice to assess intraorbital and parenchymal expansion of the brain. Mucosal involvement of the paranasal sinuses shows T1 hyperintense and T2 hyperintense signal intensity. This indicates the fungal elements as shown in Figure 2. The black turbinate sign refers to the non-enhanced pattern of nasal turbinate’s due to the combination of necrosis and fungal factors as shown in Figure 3.\n\n【20】The orbital involvement shows heterogeneously enhancing soft tissue within the medial wall， the floor， apex or roof based on the sinus area involved  shows fungal elements and bulging lateral rectus muscle， while enhancement of the optic nerve sheath was also observed . Meningeal enhancement in the basi-frontal and frontotemporal regions is an indicator of the parenchymal expansion of the brain as illustrated in Figure 6. The asymmetric bulge may extend to the cavernous sinus， as shown in Figure 7. Extension to the pterygopalatine or sphenopalatine fossa occurs from the nasal cavity or orbits， as seen in Figure 8 as variable enhancing signals. As the disease progresses intracranially， it can lead to cerebritis and cerebral abscess formation，which appears as a ring enhancing lesion as shown in Figure 9.\n\n【21】Discussion\n\n【22】FungibelongtomycologysubgroupCof microbiology. Morphologically fungi canbe yeasts， moulds and dimorphic fungithat exist in both mould and yeast form. Candida and Aspergillus species are most commonly encountered fungal species in medical practice. Fungi， which were rarely encountered with invasive potential， belong to Zygomycota order (Mucor， Rhizopus， Apophysomyces， Rhizomucor species . Immunocompromised individuals are the most susceptible group for these fungi， for example Mucormycosis which belong to the group of moulds called Mucormycetes affecting mostly the sinuses or thelungs after inhaling fungal spores in air. Types include Rhinocerebral (sinus and brain) mucormycosis， Pulmonary(lung) mucormycosis， gastrointestinal mucormycosis， Cutaneous(skin) mucormycosis， and disseminated mucormycosis. There is a wide variety of spectrum of fungal Paranasal sinuses infections. Hora et al. described two broad categories. These were invasive or non-invasive， based on potential of fungal hypha to invade the tissues through the epithelium (invasive) in comparison to the infection being limited to the superficial epithelium (non-invasive) . Invasive fungal sinusitis is further divided into acute and chronic invasive Fungal Rhinosinusitis (FRS) and chronic granulomatous invasive fungal rhinosinusitis. Non-invasive fungal sinusitis was further divided into saprophytic fungal infestation， fungal ball and allergic fungal rhinosinusitis. Acute Invasive Fungal Rhinosinusitis(AIFR) is important as it shows aggressive course with high mortality rates (around 50% but can be as much as 80%).AIFRprimarily invades neural and vascular structures (rather than mere mucosal colonization) in comparison to other non-invasive forms. Fungal spores after inhalation (due to poor immunological response) grows on the mucosal lining and invades adjacent neurovascular structures. Further， it causes thrombosis with local or distant ischemia and necrosis. Commonly， it spreads outside the infected sinus cavity into surrounding tissues and bone. Causative organisms of AIFR include： Aspergillus species and Zygomycetes order. AIFR was most commonly observed in immunocompromised patients， patients with hematological malignancies， those who have undergone bone marrow or solid organ transplantation，people with Diabetes Mellitus(DM) and in chemotherapy induced neutropenia .\n\n【23】India has highest prevalence rates of type 2 DM (8.9% of adults). Poorly controlled diabetic patients were frequently associated with diabetic ketoacidosis. Zygomyecetes order was isolated in this subgroup of patients due to their affinity for acidotic environments with high glucose concentrations . Although neutropenia， hematological malignancies， HIV/AIDS show strong association with AIFR，and most ofthem are associated with hematological malignancy. Aspergillus species has been isolated in this subgroup and also having high iron levels， after receiving deferoxamine for iron chelation or in renal failure. The mechanism behind this was that some fungi (Rhizopus) can utilize deferoxamine for their growth . AIFR in post COVID-19 patients appear to be multifactorial which includes uncontrolled DM (especially with diabetic ketoacidosis)， immunosuppressive therapy and immune alterations by COVID-19infection . Patients with COVID-19 infection have increased production of cytokines and cell mediated immunity with reduced cluster of differentiation (CD4+T) and CD8+ T cell counts resulting in increased susceptibility to fungal infections . Opportunistic fungal infections also occur with steroid overuse in treatment of COVID-19 which lowers overall immunity and increases blood sugar levels . Patients with AIFR can present with paranasal sinusitis， facial edema and erythema， proptosis， headaches， double/loss of vision and other neurological deficit (brain parenchymal or meningeal involvement). Nerve deficits (CN III， IV and VI) can indicate the involvement of cavernous sinus . Mehta and Pande et al.  reported a case study of a patient with COVID-19 infection， during the course of the treatment， developed rhino-orbital mucormycosis. Further， these authors 23 confirmed soft tissue swelling in the right preseptal， malar， and premaxillary and retrobulbar regions with paranasal sinusitis by MRI of brain， orbits and paranasal sinusitis. They confirmed mucormycosis by the presence of fungal hypha which lines with the present study. Blood stream Candida infections were reported amongst the COVID-19 patients in New Delhi， India. White et al.  have reported invasive fungal infection that had the highest mortality rate amongst COVID-19 patients. Steroid therapy and chronic respiratory infections could be the reasons found for high risk of invasive fungal diseases . Similar reports were also observed in Pakistan and Italy . It was reported that an MRI of the brain was shown to contain multiple areas of infarction and ischemia in a case of invasive fungal disease in a female having diabetic ketosis with COVID-19 infection . Mucor was identified from nasal biopsy. Early identification of fungal infections may reduce severity of the disease. Confirmative diagnosis carried by histopathological evidence of fungal elements. KOH of the soft tissue also aids in diagnosis.\n\n【24】Conclusion\n\n【25】The combined use of CT and MRI imaging illustrates unique findings， with bone erosions and mucosal thickening of the paranasal sinuses with invasion into the orbits， cavernous sinus and meningeal structures. Early diagnosis and identification of the disease can help in early interventions and a good prognosis plays an important role in the outcome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:37:23", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:37:41", "cost": 18.35}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:43", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:37:41", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:37:22"}

While most of the ruptures occur in cardiac cavities and predominantly the right ventricle； however， extracardiac ruptures are rarely reported . Transthoracic (TTE) and Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE) are the primary diagnostic modalities in RSVA . While delayed management of RSVA could be lethal， performing cardiac surgery is considered as the primary treatment as soon as the diagnosis is madeHere， we present a case of RSVA with a classic windsock appearance in a Bicuspid aortic valve undergoing successful surgical repair.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 17-year-old female patient was admitted to the cardiac emergency unit because of palpitations， lower-extremity edema， and sudden-onset dyspnea. At admission， the patient complained of shortness of breath (NYHA class III) and fatigue. Physical examination revealed a systolic/diastolic blood pressure of 90/40 mmHg， heart rate of 110 beats/min， an axillary temperature of36.5℃， jugular vein distension， and bilateral leg edema. A continuous murmur (intensity IV/VI) was heard on the left sternal border and an ejection-type systolic murmur (III/VI) over the right second inters costal space. A 12-lead electrocardiogram demonstrated a Left Ventricular (LV) strain pattern， possibly due to left ventricular hypertrophy. The chest roentgenogram revealed moderate cardiomegaly and bilateral pulmonary congestion.\n\n【10】A TTE was ordered for the patient. The TTE revealed normal LV size and systolic function with mild hypertrophy. D-Shape configuration of LV was noted. The aortic valve was Bicuspid with a small raphe between the Right Coronary Sinus (RCC) and None Coronary Cusp (NCC)， with thickened leaflets， moderate aortic regurgitation， and stenosis.\n\n【11】The medial sinus was aneurysmal with rupture into the right atrium， appearing as a prolonged hypermobile classic windsock deformity， with continuous turbulent flow directed into the Right Atrium (RA) encircling the cavity (systolic peak gradient：100 mmHg). The rupture point was observed over the anterior and septal leaflets of the Tricuspid Valve (TV). Windsock shape aneurysmal medial sinus was hypermobile with encountering TV leaflets in most beats， but the TV annulus was normal in size， and only trace TR was observed. The Trans Esophageal Echocardiogram (TEE) confirmed the TTE findings， and the size of the ostium at the ruptured site was7 mm to 8 mm. There were no other associated anomalies，including defects in the ventricular septum.\n\n【12】While the patient's parents did not agree to catheterization， the patient candidate for cardiac surgery and the cardiac surgeon was advised to examine the TV leaflets during surgery. The cardiopulmonary bypass was set after a median sternotomy and coronaryostialcardioplegia infusion used with moderate hypothermia(32C). After aortotomy and right atriotomy， a large aneurysm of the right coronary sinus with windsock projection observed. The ostium of the rupture was at the point of the commissures，between anterior and septal TV leaflets， which destroyed the base of leaflets by the high-velocity jet .\n\n【13】The damaged tissue of the involved cusp was excised， and a pericardial patch was inserted in the hole entering the right atrium. A bioprosthetic aortic valve replaced the aortic valve. The patient had an uneventful in-hospital course， without residual shunt in follow-up TTE， and complete recovery.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】The present report demonstrated a case of RSVA's into RA in a young patient successfully managed by surgical approach. RSVA is an uncommon cardiac anomaly occurring due to congenital or acquired defects accounting for about 3.5% of all congenital cardiac anomalies. The Valsalva sinus aneurism could be associated with genetic syndromes involving connective tissue， Ehlers Danlos syndrome， and Marfan syndrome . To the best of our knowledge， neither our patient nor his family had a previous history of any genetic syndrome or connective tissue disorder. Moreover， there was no history of events related to acquired forms of aneurism， including trauma， infective endocarditis， or other causes， including atherosclerosis . While most of the congenital cases of aneurysms are associated with other cardiac anomalies  and our patient had a bicuspid aortic valve， we may conclude that she has a congenital form of the disorder， although the possible confirmatory genetic tests not ordered due to the financial concerns. The association of the bicuspid aortic valve and Valsalva sinus aneurysm is previously reported in the literature. The Carita et al.  study reported a case of a congenital bicuspid aortic valve and a ruptured aneurysm of Valsalva sinus in a 61 old male patient. They hypothesized that the abnormal blood flow against the arterial wall resulting from the abnormal aortic valve might be the reason for the aneurysm development.\n\n【16】Moreover， many other studies， including Arcos et al.  reported27 years old male with a bicuspid aortic valve and RSVA . The coexistence of these two cardiac anomalies strengthens the hypothesis that the abnormal flow against the arterial wall may be responsible for aneurysm development. However， in contrast to other reports indicating these two anomalies in adult patients， our patient was younger than 20， and therefore the effect of bicuspid aortic valve on the development of aneurysm may not be favorable . Therefore， a congenital sequence rather than a genetic syndrome could be the leading cause of cardiac abnormalities. The aneurysm usually occurs following the aortic roots dilatation due to separating the aortic media from the annulus fibrous. The common complications of RSV may present as a compressive effect on near structures， including coronary arteries and adjacent conduction systems resulting in the development of ischemia or arrhythmia . However， the patients mostly remain asymptomatic or rarely become symptomatic when a rupture occurs . Although RSVA can be diagnosed at any age； however， the rupture usually happens in the third decade of life . The RSVA could be from a congenital defect of the aortic media or resultant bacterial endocarditis or trauma . The gradual development of symptoms after a rupture could be tolerated and primarily seen in patients with a small and progressive perforation.\n\n【17】The rapidity of the symptoms development depends on the defect size and the chamber that the rupture opens into . Although a wide range of clinical manifestations has been reported， similar to our patient， the symptomatic patients usually develop dyspnea and palpitation . The rupture usually occurs in RV following RA， LA， and LV but rarely extracardiac ruptures reported into the pericardium or other extracardiac spaces . In our patient， the ruptured Valsalva sinus aneurysm opening to RA was diagnosed by TTE at first. Both TTE and TEE have considerable diagnostic accuracy for the detection of RSVA and allow discrimination of the involved sinus and the size of the rupture and other associated abnormalities， including orientation of the surgical procedure . Classical windsock deformity is an uncommon echocardiographic finding developed in our patient. The windsock deformity is mainly seen during a TEE study .\n\n【18】Cardiac surgery is the treatment of choice for RSVA . The surgical repair should be considered as soon as it was diagnosed， but some articles report percutaneous intravascular repair as a therapeutic strategy . While other cardiac anomalies usually accompany the congenital forms of the RSVA， the management could be complex in some patients， and the outcomes mainly depend on the type of repair and underlying cardiac abnormalities . The most common surgical approach for RSVA is the dual exposure technique'in which both the aorta and involved chamber are explored. During the repair procedure， the aneurysmal sac excised， and the defects repaired by direct suturing or patch closure. Simultaneously coexisting lesions will be repaired. The survival rate after successful surgery is about90% in 10 years， and aortic regurgitation is the most common side effect after this surgery .\n\n【19】Conclusion\n\n【20】RSVA is a rare cardiac anomaly that surgical interventions could manage. The present report demonstrated a case of RSVA opening to the RA presenting with classical windsock deformity on TTE.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:45:20", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:45:38", "cost": 18.386}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:43", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:45:38", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:45:20"}

Wehereby report a case of a 66-year-old man who has been diagnosed with CTD-ILD according to his High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) and symptoms. In the meantime， we find axonemal dynein heavy chain gene 5 (DNAH5) variants in his Whole-Exome Sequence (WES). We wonder if DNAH5 is a biomarker of CTD-ILD.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) manifests as diffuse parenchymal lung disorders with various degrees of inflammation and fibrosis . Noticeably， approximately 20% ILD are CTD-ILD. Connective Tissue Diseases (CTDs)， such as Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)， Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)， Systemic Sclerosis (SSC) and polymyositis/Dermatomyositis (PM/DM) and so on， are the main triggers of ILD； in the meanwhile， ILD is the largest killer in patients with CTD. In addition， a significantly better prognosis of CTD-ILD is presented comparing to other kind of ILD like Idiopathic Interstitial Pneumonia (IPF) . Nevertheless， in clinical practice， ILD usually can be the first manifestation of a CTD-ILD， with extrapulmonary symptoms appearing years later， which are likely delaying treatment . Therefore， early diagnosis and better classification of CTD-ILD are crucial.\n\n【4】We consider that find a biomarker may help. DNAH5 variants frequently contribute to Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD)， which characterized by recurrent inflection in the upper and lower airway and bronchiectasis with the clinical presentations of respiratory distress in term neonates， recurrent oto-sinopulmonary infections， bronchiectasis， situs inversus and/or heterotaxy， and male infertility. DNAH5 can also cause small airway obstruction and develop hyperinflation resulting in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) . We report a case of a CTD-ILD patient with DNAH5 mutation，wondering if DNAH5 mutation involves in CTD-ILD.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】In October 2019， a 66-year-old male with a smoking history of 360 pack-years was admitted for rapid progression of dyspnea and dry cough for last two months. He has been diagnosed to be a case of ILD on basis of HRCT with no obvious symptoms for five years. On physical examination， erythema keratodes were observed on his upper limbs and light Velcro rales atbilaterallowlobes. But no Clubbed- finger， no Raynaud， and no morning stiffness. Immunological and serological results showed anti-KU-antibody， anti-Signal Recognition Particle (anti-SRP) Antibody and Antinuclear Antibody (ANA) were positive. Laboratory investigations suggested serum Immunoglobulin G(IgG) was 17.3 g/L (normal level7 g/L to 16 g/L)， Immunoglobulin E (IgE) was 230 IU/mL (normal level 20-200 IU/mL)，relatively at high level. Thoracic HRCT showed distributions of the pulmonary fibrosis were diffuse bilaterally and symmetrical . Additionally， the level of Krebs von den Lungen (KL)-6 in his blood significantly increased 1180 U/mL， normal range 0 U/m L-500 U/m L). His SpO， maintained at 95% to 97% range either at the rest or at exertion. Pulmonary function test revealed dispersion function decreased slightly. The result of 6 Minutes Walking Test (6-MWT) was 661 m. The patient was diagnosed with CTD-ILD. Of note， a WES analysis followed by Sanger sequence identified a heterozygous missense mutation (c.2047C>T) of DNAH5. After a week oforal prednisone 20 mg/day and quetiapine 200 mg/day for treatment， he’d relieved from dyspnea and dry cough.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】ILD is a group ofheterogeneous diseases distinguished by fibrosis or inflammation of the pulmonary parenchyma . Existing major categories ofILD include environmental exposures related ILD，CTD-ILD， sarcoidosis， and IPF .Meanwhile， CTD-ILD frequently occurs in identified CTD patients (SSc， RA， PM/DM，SLE and so on) or Interstitial Pneumonia with Autoimmune Features (IPAF) patients. According to Angelo et al.  there are different histological patterns in CTD-ILD， consisting ofNon-Specific Interstitial Pneumonia (NSIP)， Organizing Pneumonia (OP)， usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP)， Lymphocytic Interstitial Pneumonia (LIP) and Diffuse Alveolar Damage (DAD). Furthermore， the prevalence， diagnostic criterion， clinical presentations and treatment of CTD-ILD are varied by CTD types. Since the heterogeneity of diseases， there is no specific management guideline of CTD-ILD until now. For some acute and subacute CTD-ILD patients， rapidly progressive ILD may be the first or only manifestation of an underlying CTD with poor prognosis， so treatment is always earlier than definite diagnose of CTD . All CTD patients are at risk of ILD， however， the necessity of targeting underlying ILD in CTD-ILD patients with immunosuppressive therapy lacks unified expert consensus . Whether occult or probable forms of CTD-ILD are associated with a better outcome is uncertain. Therefore， prior ascertainment will help a lot. In daily clinical work， we are used to combining auto-antibodies， laboratory abnormalities， histopathology and HRCT image with symptoms or clinical features to diagnose CTD-ILD. But this method is short of specificity to guide treatment scheme， just like our above case. Collectively， find a stable biomarker， which suggests that common and rare genetic variants may play a significant role， may contribute to overcome the limitations .\n\n【9】DNAH5， which encodes Outer Dynein Arm (ODA) components， has been proven clearly to be the PCD disease-causing gene and leads to a total deficiency of ODA and its function when it mutates.ODA functions as a force-generating protein of respiratory cilia with ATPase activity . In PCD patients， respiratory cilia do not move normally，which brings out that mucus and debris in airway can’t be incompletely cleaned， leading to repeated sinopulmonary infection and small airway obstruction . Hence， DNAH5-mutation patients may suffer from manifestations of PCD， for instance， bronchiectasis， chronic sinusitis， chronic oto-sino-pulmonary diverse and even respiratory failure caused by irreversible lung damage .According to Lee et al.  DNAH5 variants may contribute to develop hyperinflation in patients with COPD， with Residual Volume(RV) and RV/Total Lung Capacity (TLC)ratio. Besides， it was confirmed that TRA2B-DNAH5 fusion becomes a novel oncogenic driver in human lung squamous cell carcinoma.\n\n【10】These results suggest DNAH5 variants significantly influence the structure and function of pulmonary. Herein， although further investigation is warranted to confirm the connection of DNAH5 and CTD-ILD， our case provides a new vision and idea to predict the occurrence of ILD in CTD patients as to improve prognosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:07:36", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:07:53", "cost": 16.83}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:43", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:07:54", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:07:36"}

The combination of clinical， neurophysiological and neuropathological features prompted toward a possible diagnosis of Measles Inclusion Body Encephalitis (MIBE). The presence of atypical clinical signs， such as super refectory status epilepticus， and histopathological features overlapping with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis hinder an already difficult diagnosis. Furthermore， in Literature， MIBE is associated with cellular immune defects， no cases are described in patients with humoral defects， since do not usually modify the course of measles infection. At the time when decrease in measles vaccine coverage are experienced in several countries， our findings suggest that even in the absence of a clear clinical history or lab results， measles infection must be suspected in every case of super refectory status epilepticus ofunknown origin.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Due to a decrease in measles vaccine coverage， several countries have been experiencing new outbreaks， with 7.5 million cases reported by the WHO in 2020 . Measles-induced encephalitis， though uncommon， often results in severe disability or death ， and include： Primary Measles Encephalitis， Acute Post-infectious Measles Encephalomyelitis，Measles Inclusion Body Encephalitis(MIBE) and Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis (SSPE) . The last two forms occur after the acute phase： MIBE is mainly reported in immunosuppressed patient， generally six months after Measles Virus (MV) infection ； SSPE occurs after 1 to 10 years in previously healthy patients. Even though the two forms may present some overlap， each form has distinct clinical and pathological features . We report a case of a 15-year-old girl with clinical signs， onset and evolution suggestive of MIBE in whom the diagnostic process was complicated by the presence of associated atypical clinical signs and histopathological features.\n\n【4】The patient was born in Romania and moved to Italy at the age of 6 years. There was no family or physiological history of note； she had completed the vaccination schedule， including two doses of measles vaccine at the age of one and eight years. At the age of 12， she had the diagnosis of asymptomatic thrombocytopenia， treated with corticosteroids， Immunoglobulin (Ig) and rituximab， completely recovered after about one year. In December 2017， presented to our attention for headache and rapid decrease of visual acuity suggestive of cortical blindness. A few months before the admission， she had shown acute diffuse macular rash without fever and， after that， persisting cough and asthenia， associated with lymphocyte B depletion and hypogammaglobulinemia (CD190.5%； IgA 9 mg/dL； IgM <10 mg/dL； IgG <30 mg/dL)， requiring monthly infusions of Ig. No exposure to measles could be traced. At the admission physical examination revealed intraocular pressure increase and cranial CT was normal. On day 4， she presented with daily myoclonic seizures of left hemiface and anticonvulsant therapy with levetiracetam (2000 mg/die) and clonazepam(15 mg/die) was started. Brain MRI on day 7 showed subcortical and deep white matter changes in the occipital and right frontal lobes. A slight increase in protein (47 mg/dL) was found on a Lumbar Puncture (LP) performed on day 8. EEG showed intercritical slow-waves localized on the right hemisphere and continuous rhythmic sharp-waves on the right regions， with contralateral diffusion， associated with focal motor seizures. Treatment with corticosteroids and mannitol was started. On day 12， the seizures evolved in Super Refectory Status Epilepticus (SRSE)， resistant to bolus doses of midazolam at 0.2 mg/kg. Treatment with acyclovir and deep sedation with midazolam(12 gamma/Kg/min) and propofol (5 mg/Kg) were started. LP on day 14 confirmed protein increase (60 mg/dL). CSF culture test for neurotropic virus， fungus and bacteria were negative， as well as， Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) for neurotropic agents and serum antibodies. Metabolic and immunological screening， abdomen e thoracic CT was also normal. Clinical seizure persisted despite the association of several pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies： Methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg/die)， phenytoin (20 mg/Kg)，ketamine (100 gamma/Kg/min)， bolus doses of lacosamide (400mg/die)， hypothermia， plasmapheresis and Ig infusion. Continuous EEG monitoring showed delta brushes pattern predominant on the right side， followed after 10 days by periodic burst of diffuse sharp-waves. After one month， periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges or bilateral independent periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges appeared on EEG，associated to nystagmus. On day 21 a second brain MRI showed wide areas of altered intensity in the cortex， subcortical， and deep white matter of the occipital， parietal， temporal and frontal lobe with signs of corticallaminar necrosis. Mild parenchymal contrast enhancement was present. On day 27 brain biopsy was performed， revealing small fragments of brain tissue with edematous changes. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed microglia activation and presence of numerous intraparenchymal CD68+ macrophages and few perivascular CD3+/CD8+ lymphocytes. The tissue showed also reactive gliosis . Scattered glial and neuronal cell presented with intranuclear， sometimes eosinophilic inclusions， compatible with measles viral inclusions . Typical eosinophilic inclusions as found in MIBE were not detectable. Nor granulomatous or vasculitic changes， neither areas of necrosis were found. RT-PCR on brain tissue revealed wild type measles virus， genotype D8， and Parvovirus B19 RNA. After one month， SRSE progressively relapsed. The girl presented vegetative status with hypertension， tachycardia and some myoclonic seizures of the left hemiface， treated with doxazosine， transdermic clonidine， lacosamide (400 mg/die)， and monthly IgG infusion (0.4 mg/kg). There was a constant increase of pancreatic enzymes up to 285 UI/L. Brain MRI on day 44， 80， 122，178， 232， 264 showed progressive involvement of cortex and white matter bilaterally， of the cerebellar grey and white matter， and of the brainstem associated with ventricular enlargement . After ten months， the patient presented acute worsening with hypotension， bradycardia， associated to ST segment elevation， significant increase of troponin and left ventricular regional wall motion abnormalities. She died after 24 h. Post mortem investigation was not permitted.\n\n【5】Discussion\n\n【6】We report a case in which the presumed diagnosis of MIBE was complicated by several atypical findings. The presentation with headache and cortical blindness was typical of MIBE， with no behavioral or cognitive difficulties， more often observed in SSPE. Motor deficits (hemiparesis， hemiplegia， ataxia)， dysarthria and dysphagia， often reported in MIBE， were not present . Focal motors seizures and early EEG findings， with intercritical slow-waves and continuous ipsilateral rhythmic sharp-waves， were also consistent with MIBE . In contrast the rapid worsening of focal motor seizures， refractory to AEDs， and the onset of SRSE were not typical of MIBE. Severe seizures occur more often in patients with SSEP， but we did not observe the Radermecker's complexes，recurring at regular intervals of 5 sec to 10 sec and having clear relationship with myoclonic jerks， often reported in SSEP . Brain MRI， showing widespread changes， affecting the grey， subcortical and deep white matter， with posterior-anterior progression， subsequent atrophy and involvement of brain stem， was also consistent with the multifocal areas of increased T2 signal intensity in the cortex， subcortical，and deep white matter， followed by progressive atrophy reported in MIBE. Widespread lesions with posterior-anterior progression are also reported in SRSE but with a different pattern， as the early changes are characterized by early demyelination， particularly in the temporal and parietal lobes . CSF analysis revealed only increased protein， also previously reported in MIBE patients . Brain biopsy showed the presence of macrophage infiltrates， perivascular lymphocytes， edema， microglia activation and gliosis and， in scattered neurons， of intranuclear inclusions， sometimes eosinophilic， compatible with MV inclusions. The typical eosinophilic inclusions， often found in MIBE， were not detectable. The neuropathological findings were overall not completely typical of MIBE and in some way overlapping with SSPE， which is however also associated with a more evident inflammatory infiltration and demyelination， that was not found in our patient . The mismatch between clinical and histopathological features has already been described in another case . The absence of antibodies against MV in our case was consistent with the immunocompromised status typical of MIBE. However， cellular immune defects were not present in our patient， who had hypogammaglobulinemia， which should not modify the course of measles infection . A high Incidence of Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP)， also found in our patient， has in contrast been previously reported in 315 SSPE cases， assuming a non-casual relationship between the two pathologies. The possible mechanisms considered were immune dysregulation， alteration of the immune response due to ITP pharmacological treatments or antigenic stimulation from persistent MV . The atypical features did not allow to fully ascribe our case to the well characterized forms but the combination of clinical， neurophysiological and neuropathological features prompted toward a possible diagnosis of atypical MIBE. The diagnostic process was also complicated by other elements that contributed not only to hinder a specific diagnosis of MIBE but also to suspect a subacute measles related encephalitis. Our case had no clear exposure to MV， had complete vaccination schedule， reduced exanthema， undetectable serum antibodies， negative CSF culture. It was only the brain biopsy， detecting the presence of MVRNA by RT-PCR that allowed to confirm our hypothesis of a subacute measles related encephalitis .\n\n【7】Conclusion\n\n【8】Our findings suggest that even in the absence of clear clinical history or lab results， measles infection must be suspected in the diagnostic flow ofevery case of SRSE of unknown origin， especially at the time when decrease in measles vaccine coverage are experienced in several countries. In Italy the measles vaccine coverage did not reach the target of 95%， coverage needed to get herd immunity， leading to a further increase in the pool of susceptible adolescents and children. Ongoing efforts to raise confidence in vaccines should be intensified.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 15:12:02", "endTime": "2024/09/20 15:15:36", "cost": 214.016}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:43", "update_time": "2024-09-19 23:15:37", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 23:12:02"}

In this case report， we presented clinically significant edema that resulted in the dramatic and abrupt improvement in glycemic control after intensive improvement in lifestyle in a 13-year-old girl， with DM type 1who had positive anti-Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase (anti-GAD) antibodies. She had poor glycemic control during 2 years of insulin therapy， and lifestyle improvements with no changes to her medications types or doses， she developed generalized body edema， and face puffiness that resolved spontaneously， without any intervention， and only observation of the patient.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Generalized edema is a rare complication of insulin therapy， which usually occurs in newly diagnosed type 1 diabetic patients and after the initiation of insulin therapy， also it can be presented in patients with type 2 diabetes after the intensification of insulin therapy generalized edema must be differentiated from other causes of edema such as cardiac or renal disease which are the most common causes of body edema， and must initially be ruled out . Here we report a 13-year-old， girl， who was diagnosed with DM type I in 2016. Her DM was uncontrolled for 2 years， and she had a history of multiple admissions to the pediatric intensive care unit， due to Diabetes Ketoacidosis(DKA). She recently presented with generalized body edema including the face， of no apparent cause， after sudden glycemic control with only lifestyle modifications， and became compliant with her medications， without any change in insulin types or doses.\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 13-year-old Saudi girl diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in 2016， had positive anti-GAD antibodies， and in the last 2 years， had uncontrolled blood glucose with a high Hemoglobin Alc(HA1c) level of more than 15%. Her lifestyle was unsatisfactory， including the consumption of many junk foods and a lack of any physical exercise. Despite her insulin dose of 1.5 units/kg/day， she still had uncontrolled blood glucose and was frequently admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) with Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) with a total of 5 admissions since her diagnosis，and HAlc level reached 16.9% on one occasion. We decided to provide her with intensive psychological support and give her frequent clinical appointments with the Pediatrics Endocrinology Clinic and a diabetic educator. She decided to change her lifestyle to prevent any diabetic complications and to improve her quality of life， therefore， she changed the types of food she consumed， eliminated most carbs， become physically active， walking around for an hour per day. In September 2020she was admitted to the PICU due to frequent hypoglycemic attacks， with no history of fatigue or decreased energy， no symptoms of cough， shortness of breath， and chest pain， and no history of new medication use. A physical examination determined she had pitting edema on her lower limbs， lower back， and a puffy face. She had warm skin with no tingling or burning sensations at the site of edema and no pain， aching， or numbness. Another systemic exam showed she was within normal， a bodyweight of 58 kg， and had a BMI of 23 kg/m’， with no abnormalities in her chest or heart. A normal thyroid exam and showed no lipohypertrophy at the injection site. Investigations were conducted to rule out any organic cause of the edema， included renal function test， liver function test， and cardiac exams with ECG. All were normal apart from her albumin being on the lower side with a level of 35 g/L. Other labs tests showed a high HA1c level of 15.8%. ACTH and cortisol tests were performed to rule out Addison disease and the results were within normal ranges. The celiac profile showed negative antibodies. Thyroid function tests revealed a low FT4 level of 8.2 pmol/L and positive thyroid antibodies. Insulin doses were adjusted with the total daily dose decreasing from 1.5 to1.3 and then 0.7 units/kg/day to control her blood glucose level， and her long-acting insulin dose was changed to another type of long-acting insulin (Tresiba) to minimize her hypoglycemic attacks. On clinical follow-up， she showed much improvement in her glycemic status， and her edema resolved without any medical interventions. Her last measured HA1c level was 7.8%，levothyroxine was initiated with a dose of 50 mic daily， and her last FT4 level was 10.3 pmol/L. Her hemoglobin Alc level decreased from 15.8% to 9.1% and then decreased again in December 2020 to 7.9%.\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】Insulin edema is a known complication of the initiation or intensification of insulin therapy. It was first described in 1928 and occurs in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus， especially in newly diagnosed cases of type 1 diabetes mellitus . It is a benign transient condition that is usually self-limiting and resolves spontaneously with a rare or no need to use any intervention，treatment， or diuretic therapy . Although the manifestations can vary widely from mild peripheral edema to cardiac failure and massive serosal effusions and may occur in local areas， such as the periorbital，pretibial， and sacral regions， or as generalized edema， there was a young patient who is diagnosed as a newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes， when generalized edema and pericardial effusion developed after initiation of insulin therapy， the treatment was only supportive and all symptoms resolved within 20 days . As well， it can be presented at any age with the youngest age was reported was a 9 years old male who developed insulin edema few days after diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and was treated as a case of DKA . There are no criteria or a risk stratification system for the diagnosis of insulin edema， and it is diagnosed by the exclusion of other common causes of body edema. However， aged being from 20 to 40 years，poor control diabetes either by having frequent hypoglycemia or following DKA treatment， newly diagnosed diabetes with higher doses of insulin therapy， poor glucose control， and low body mass index have been suggested as risk factors for insulin edema . The true incidence of insulin edema remains unknown but some reports have estimated the incidence to be in the range of 3% to 3.5% . There have been several presentations of insulin edema， William et al. reported a 15-year-old girl with a history of poorly controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus who presented with generalized anasarca which was started gradually over her limbs till extend to all of her body including her face and genitalia associated with a significant increase in her weight， her labs were within normal level apart of albumin which was in the lower normal， these symptoms were noticed after 1-week of compliance with insulin therapy . Furthermore， another adult patient with latent autoimmune diabetes was reported to have insulin edema associated with neuropathy. She was a 35-year-old， diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and subsequently developed latent autoimmune diabetes， she was on an oral hypoglycemic agent and her glucose level was high with an HbA1c of 13%. She was admitted to the hospital under plastic surgery service when she presented with a painful discoloration of her right finger. During that admission developed DKA， after treatment of the DKA insulin was initiated and after 3 days she developed significant pitting edema up to her umbilicus associated with neuropathy that was diagnosed by nerve conduction studies. Other causes of edema were excluded， and because her edema was severe so， she was treated with furosemide diuretics and fluid restriction . Another adult case was reported by Wong and Balakrishnan. The patient was a40-year-old woman， newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus who developed generalized edema just after diagnosis and treatment initiation . Sugiyama et al.  reported that a 50-year-old female patient， who is known to have Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) post bone marrow transplantation and type 2 diabetes mellitus， was on multiple medications as prophylaxis and treatment from transplant rejection. Her blood glucose become poorly controlled so； intensive insulin therapy was given to her， after by around 4weeks found to have insulin edema over her lower limbs. The same presentation was found in a 57-year-old male patient with a 5-year history of type 2 diabetes， he was poorly controlled and his urinalysis showed positive ketones and protein. He developed bilateral lower limbedema which was induced by the rapid improvement of glycemic control with insulin therapy . Despite that， insulin edema is a rare finding and usually， it is self resolved， although it can be serious with significant complications as in this patient who was a 35-year-old woman diagnosed recently with type 1 diabetes who presented with polydipsia andpolyuria for over 1 year， and at the last 2 months before presentation， she lost approximately 2 kg of weight. She presented with signs of severe DKA indicated by Kussmaul's breathing and low pH levels and was treated with insulin. On the 2nd day， her renal function started to deteriorate， she had high creatinine levels and then presented with generalized edema， serous effusions， and acute renal failure. This case was different due to the presence of more serious complications . Pediatric patients also can have insulin edema； a case report of a 12-year-old boy newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes， presented with edema of the lower extremities approximately one week after the initiation of insulin therapy. This case was considered a typical presentation of insulin edema that appeared soon after the initiation of insulin therapy in a patient newly diagnosed with DM type 1 . Furthermore， Hirshberg et al.  reported a 49-year-old female， who was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and developed severe generalized edema following the initiation of insulin therapy. The edema was severe enough to be treated with diuretics but unfortunately， it was impossible to continue the treatment because of the severe side effects of this medication the patient experienced. Even the patients who are on an insulin pump can develop insulin edema； Greco et al. described the case of a 39-year-old woman with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes mellitus who developed generalized edema with severe weight gain a few days after the start of an insulin pump therapy .\n\n【8】Conclusion\n\n【9】Several cases have been reported about generalized edema in patients with diabetes. However， most of the cases reported on patients with either newly diagnosed type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus that developed edema after the initiation or intensification of insulin treatment or even after sudden compliance with insulin therapy. There were no case reports about the development of insulin edema after only improvements in the patient s lifestyle and without any change in insulin dose.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:52:21", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:52:26", "cost": 5.129}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:43", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:52:27", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:52:21"}

In this study we describe six confirmed cases of COVID-19 subjects which developed lung cavitations， out of 45 studied patients (13.3%). CT scan was performed on average 27 days after admissions， and all the patients have been previously intubated. Our findings are remarkable because lung cavitations in COVID-19 patients have been described very rarely so far.\n\n【2】Keywords： Lung cavitation； COVID-19； CT；SARS-CoV-2\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)， a highly infectious disease caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2)，was firstlyreported in Wuhan，HubeiProvince， China， and rapidly spreads to other domestic cities and countries beyond China . On January30h，2020， the World Health Organization (WHO) declared this ongoing outbreak as a global public health emergency and raised the risk of COVID-19 to very high at the global level on February 28h，2020 . The standard for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 virus is Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test， but chest CT may play a complimentary role in the diagnostic algorithm for the early detection (early suspicion) of COVID-19 pneumonia (in conjunction with clinical presentation， blood gas analysis and 6-minute walking time test) . CT examination is of great significance not only in diagnosing COVID-19 but also in monitoring disease progression and evaluating therapeutic efficacy . The most frequently reported CT lesions in the literature are crazy paving pattern， reticular pattern， air bronchogram， airway changes， pleural changes， vascular enlargement and reversed halo sign. Bilateral distribution with or without consolidation in posterior and peripheral lungs segments was the cardinal hallmark of COVID-19 . A diversity of interesting CT imaging features was found but lung cavitation or abscess was considered as rare pattern. In this study we describe six confirmed cases of COVID-19which developed lung cavitation and represent the first case series reported in literature.\n\n【5】Patients and Methods\n\n【6】From March 22nd until April 264，2020， 116 adult patients admitted to Sub-intensive care unit named COVID Emergency unit in Fatebenefratelli Hospital Milan. Forty-five patients underwent lung CT scan (38.7%). All scans were performed without intravenous contrast with the patient in the supine position during end-inspiration. In six patients we found lung cavitation areas which represented 13.3% of our study sample； in these patients CT scan was done 27 days on average after admissions.\n\n【7】Case Series\n\n【8】Case 1\n\n【9】A 65-year-old male went to the emergency room for persistent hyperpyrexia (>38C) associated with cough and dyspnea. Laboratory results showed normal counts of white blood cells count (6.19×10/L， normal range 4.19 to 9.35)， and increased C-Reactive Protein (CRP)，lactate dehydrogenase， D-dimer and fibrinogen values(160 mg/L， normal range 0 to 5； 447 U/L， normal range 135 to 225；5144 ng/ml； >700 mg/dl normal range 270 to 470； respectively). Patient was initially treated with non-invasive ventilation with CPAP helmet. Considering worsening of respiratory exchanges and clinical conditions was intubated 9 days after hospital admission and rapidly extubated after 4 days. Chest CT scan performed 24 days after his hospital admission  showed centrilobular and panlobular emphysema， bilateral patchy ground glass opacities and lower left lobe cavitated area with mucoid component in the context. Homolateral pleural was also reported. QuantiFERON-TB Gold test and routine tests were performed in order to exclude fungal and bacterial superinfection were negative.\n\n【10】Case 2\n\n【11】A 59-year-old male presented with cough and fever. Laboratory results showed normal white blood cells count (5.65×10/L)， decreased albumin (24 g/L)， increased CRP， lactate dehydrogenase，\n\n【12】D-dimer and fibrinogen values (296 mg/L， 302 U/L， 11222 ng/ml，507 mg/dl； respectively). The patient was treated with non-invasive ventilation with helmet continuous positive air pressure. However， for the progressive worsening of respiratory exchanges and clinical conditions the patient was intubated 3 days after hospital admission. Chest CT scan performed one month after his hospital admission showed bilateral inter and intra lobular interstitial thickening， diffuse inflammatory involvement， bronchiectasis and concomitant lower left lobe excavated area up to 4 cm in maximum diameter. Homolateral pleural effusion with dysventilation of the adjacent lung parenchyma was also evident. QuantiFERON-TB Gold test and routine tests were performed in order to exclude fungal superinfection were negative. Bacterial culture of sputum was positive for Enterobacter aerogenes.\n\n【13】Case 3\n\n【14】A 52-year-old male presented to the emergency room for fever， cough， and chest pain. Laboratory results showed normal white blood cells count (7.65 ×10/L)， decreased albumin (29 g/L)， increased CRP， lactate dehydrogenase， D-dimer and fibrinogen values (104mg/L， 501 U/L， 3154 ng/ml， 681 mg/dl； respectively). The patient was intubated one day after hospital admission and was admitted in COVID emergency unit after 21 days in the intensive care unit. Chest CT scan performed one month after his hospital admission  showed patchy ground glass opacities， prevalent in upper lobes. In lower lobes multiple inflammatory areas， some of which with an excavated component， especially in right lower lobe. QuantiFERON-TB Gold test and routine tests were performed in order to exclude fungal superinfection were negative. Bacterial culture of sputum was positive for Enterobacter aerogenes， Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\n\n【15】Case 4\n\n【16】A 53-year-old male went to the emergency room for fever and dyspnea. Laboratory results showed increased white blood cells count(17.13×10/L)，CRP， lactate dehydrogenase， D-dimer and fibrinogen values (226 mg/L， 825 U/L， 12043 ng/ml， >700 mg/dl； respectively) and decreased albumin (23 g/L). The patient was intubated one day after hospital admission and was admitted in COVID Emergency Unit after 23 days in the intensive care unit. Chest CT scan performed40 days after his hospital admission  revealed in left upper lobe a parenchymal alteration central excavation of 22 mm ×24mm and craniocaudal extension of about 28 mm. Peripheral and peri-bronchial consolidation with diffuse ground glass opacities， thickening of bronchial segmentations and sub-segmentations and concomitant traction bronchiectasis. Stable negativity of blood cultures， QuantiFERON-TB Gold test and specific tests excluded fungal or bacterial superinfection.\n\n【17】Case 5\n\n【18】A 68-year-old male went to the emergency room for fever and dyspnea. Laboratory results showed normal white blood count cells(9.24×10/L) and albumin (41 g/L)， and increased CRP， lactate dehydrogenase， D-dimer and fibrinogen values (173 mg/L， 733 U/L，3487 ng/ml；>700 mg/dl； respectively). The patient was intubated one day after hospital admission and rapidly extubated after 4 days. CT performed 18 days after his hospital admission  showed reticular thickening with symmetrical distribution and craniocaudal gradient. These findings were more represented in lower lobes and in right lower lobe we described two concomitant centimetric excavated alterations. QuantiFERON-TB Gold test and routine tests were performed in order to exclude fungal and bacterial superinfection and were negative.\n\n【19】Case 6\n\n【20】A 70-year-old male went to the emergency room for fever， cough and dyspnea. Laboratory results showed normal white blood cells count and D-dimer (5.97×10/L and 428 ng/ml； respectively) and increased CRP， lactate dehydrogenase and fibrinogen values (259mg/L， 448 U/L and 663 mg/dl； respectively) and decreased albumin(22 g/L). The patient was intubated 4 days after hospital admission and was admitted in COVID Emergency Unit after 15 days in the intensive care unit. CTperformed 22 days after his hospital admission showed extensive peripheral predominant ground-glass opacities. Bilateral consolidation areas and cavitation in left lower lobe. Pericardial and bilateral pleural effusion was also described. QuantiFERON-TB Gold test， microbiological tests were negative except a sputum sample positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\n\n【21】Conclusion\n\n【22】The variety of the findings in COVID-19 has been categorized in the consensus documents from American College of Radiology/Society of Thoracic Radiology/Radiological Society of North America. The typical features are peripheral bilateral and rounded ground glass opacities， and reverse halo sign of organizing pneumonia. Atypical features include isolatedconsolidations，tree-in-budopacities and smooth interlobular septal thickening with pleural effusion， and cavitations， that have been reported very rarely . A larger number of reports on imaging findings in COVID-19 diseases are present in literatureandprobably newimagingpatterns mayemerge inthe future. The size and type of CT abnormalities may be related to a more severe pulmonary involvement and longer hospitalization and can vary in different patients and stages. In this paper， we reported a case series of patients with pulmonary cavitations which represented the 13.3%of our cohort. This result can be interpreted as a late CT manifestation of COVID-19 disease， not rare in patients that have been intubated. This conclusion is supported by the timing of CT examinations in our patients， performed later than previous cases reported in literature(27days on average after admission).Bacterial superinfections cannot be excluded as a possible cause of the cavitations we observed， but the germs we isolated were all opportunistic hospital-acquired pathogens， very common in ventilated intensive-care unit patients and rarely causing lung excavations . This case series， with its representative pictures， is remarkable because lung cavitation in COVID-19 patients has been described very rarely so far .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:47:16", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:52:59", "cost": 342.511}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:43", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:52:59", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:47:16"}

This condition is common in critically ill patients and the most frequent causes are sepsis， trauma and malignancy. Lamotrigine is an anticonvulsant medication that has the effect of inhibiting the release of excitatory Neurotransmitters such as glutamate， by blocking sodium channels. The association between DIC and the use oflamotrigine has already been described in the literature， including pediatric patients， as a rare adverse event， which can be enhanced by the concomitant use of valproic acid， as it prolongs the half-life of lamotrigine by decreasing its hepatic clearance. The estimated incidence of lamotrigine hypersensitivity reactions ranges from 1 in every1，000 to 10，000 exposed. The mechanism by which lamotrigine promotes this reaction in the host is not completely understood， but considering its potential for severity， it becomes a relevant topic for discussion. This study aims to describe a case of a child admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) with DIC associated with lamotrigine.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】18 months old female child， with a previous diagnosis of West Syndrome and microcephaly without a definite cause， admitted to the PICU with hemodynamic instability. Patient with a past history of difficult to control epilepsy in use of multiple anticonvulsants (valproic acid， topiramate， clobazam) besides ketogenic diet. She was hospitalized for more than 30 days due to vomiting， hydro-electrolytic disturbances and drowsiness. She was on anticonvulsant medications with lamotrigine onset 15 days before admission to the PICU， to replace topiramate. In the 24 h prior to admission， she evolved feverish peaks， respiratory distress needing supplemental oxygen therapy and hemodynamic instability been transferred to the PICU for monitorization. She required antibiotics， vasoactive drugs and orotracheal intubation to shock control. Initial tests showed severe metabolic acidosis， orotracheal， thrombocytopenia and several alterations in coagulation tests； without active bleeding. Despite little suggestive infectious screening (including negative viral screening tests - SRV and SARS-CoV-2)， she was initially treated for septic shock secondary to pneumonia. At admission， valproic acid and the ketogenic diet were also suspended. The infant evolved with a rapid improvement in hemodynamic status. The vasoactive drugs were suspended after 24 h of use， and antibiotics after 72 h. However， she persisted with changes in coagulations tests， hypofibrinogenemia and thrombocytopenia， characterizing the Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation Syndrome (DIC)； maintaining without active bleeding.\n\n【4】As the patient did not have classic causes of DIC and did not improve after the suspension of valproic acid， a literature review was carried out and a similar case was found with the use of lamotrigine in an adolescent. Lamotrigine was suspended on the third day of admission to the PICU. Associated with this measure， to prevent escape from seizures， Phenobarbital was started and the dose of clobazam was adjusted. After lamotrigine suspension， the patient evolved with progressive improvement of laboratory changes， until the normalization of coagulation tests and platelets on the eighth day of hospitalization. She did not need platelets， plasma or cryoprecipitate transfusions. Received only red blood cell concentrate for significant anemia. During hospitalization， she also presented deep venous thrombosis in the right femoral and popliteal veins. The patient had a central venous line in this femoral vein during 11 days. Full anticoagulation started， without complications. She needed invasive mechanical ventilation with low parameters for 3 days， followed by intermittent non-invasive ventilation related to oscillations of breathing pattern associated with neurological condition and tongue fall for more 3 days. She presented with progressive neurologicalimprovement after medication adjustment and adequate control of seizures； normalization of hydro-electrolytic disorders being discharge to PICU after 12 days of staying.\n\n|  | Admission Day  | Day 1  | Day 2  | Day 4  | Day 5  | Day 8  | Day 10  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Hb (g/dL)|Htc (%)  | 9.229  | 7.725.1  | 7.222.8  | 7.022.5  | 7.122，8  | 5.116.2  | 11.5 35.1  |\n| Global Leucocyte (/mm | 17960  | 7530  | 5290  | 6770  | 8300  | 23330  |  |\n| B/S/L/M(%)  | 443511  | 1157256  |  | 050409  | 752328  | 0344816  |  |\n| Platelets (/mm)  | 37000  | 18000  | 16000  | 87000  | 137000  | 429000  |  |\n| CRP (mg/L)  | 21.2  | 27，5  | 31  |  |  |  |  |\n| Fibrinogen (mg/dL)  | 30  |  | <35  | <35  | 39  | 61  |  |\n| Protrombin Activity (%)INR  | <10%>10  | <10%>10  | <10%>10  | <10%>10  | 51%1.64  | 79%1.18  |  |\n| aTTP (Seconds)  | >120  | >120  | >120  | 35，1  | 29.4  | 20，9  |  |\n| AST(U/L)|ALT (U/L)  |  | 4632  | 4832  |  | 19683  |  |  |\n| BUN (mg/dL)| Creatinine (mg/dL  | 440.32  | 440.36  | 490.5  | 400.15  | 380.35  | 33<0.15  |  |\n| Sodium (mmol/L)  | 157  | 154  | 153  | 153  | 151  | 128  | 136  |\n| Potassium (mmol/L)  | 3.5  | 3.1  | 2.7  | 3.8  | 4.0  | 4.0  | 4.6  |\n| Chloride (mmol/L)  | 144  | 132  | 131  | 121  | 121  | 94  | 96  |\n| Calcium (mg/dL)  | 5.6  | 5.52  | 5.37  | 4.92  | 5.23  | 3.94  | 4.44  |\n| Phosphorus (mg/dL)  | 3.7  | 3.1  | 2.7  | 2.7  | 1.9  | 4.3  | 4.6  |\n| Magnesium (mg/dL)  | 1.7  | 1.7  | 1.6  | 2.0  | 2.0  | 1.6  | 2.1  |\n| Lactate (mmol/dL)  | 3.5  | 3.5  | 2.4  | 1.8  | 5.4  | 5.1  |  |\n| pH/pCO2/pO2 /BIC/BE/SatO2  | 7.02/42/36/10/-18.5/ 59  | 7.21/31/179/13/-14.5/99  | 7.30/26/167/14/-13/98  | 7.28/50.4/57.3/21.7/ -2.7/84.4  | 7.22/57.3/29.5/20.8/-3.2/47%  | 7.48/31.7/163/25.1/0.8/99.2  |  |\n\n【6】Discussion\n\n【7】DICis asyndrome cchharacterizedby hemorrhageand microvascular thrombosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by changes in coagulation tests as platelet count， Prothrombin Time (PT)， INR， Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) and fibrinogen. It is a common diagnosis in the PICU and its main cause is sepsis. Usually， the resolution of this condition is associated with the treatment of the underlying cause. However， some patients may not respond to these measures and may need clotting factors， which is reserved for those with major bleeding. Anticoagulation with heparin is also a possibility， with few studies and evidence in pediatric population. Seems that it can be beneficial to patients with predominantly thrombotic， symptomatic or life-threatening manifestation and it’s contraindicated in the presence of traumatic brain injury or liver failure. The cases previously reported in the literature about the association between DIC andlamotrigine describe an initial condition of flu-like syndrome， with subsequent evolution to DIC and multiple organ dysfunctions， similar to that observed in our case report. In addition， the onset begins about 1 to 12 weeks after the onset of lamotrigine， which is also compatible with the patient's condition. It is also important to remember that the changes cannot be attributed to a state of epileptic illness， since the patient had good crisis control during hospitalization， as was observed in other case reports .\n\n【8】Conclusion\n\n【9】The association between DIC and lamotrigine is rare， and was described for the first time in 1992， being the first report in pediatric patients published in 1997. Despite a mechanism not yet well established， previous studies have identified immune serological changes associated with this condition， corroborating the hypothesis that a DIC may result from a hypersensitivity reaction tolamotrigine， even considering that studies of the drug's efficacy and safety do not show such an adverse reaction. In addition， it is already known that DIC could betriggered due tohypersensitivity to various drugs. So far， the identification of the detailed condition is essentially done through the association of clinical and laboratory data and it is important as a differential diagnosis， since it is a serious condition， in which the suspension of medication can reverse the DIC.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:33:59", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:34:10", "cost": 11.709}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:43", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:34:10", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:33:58"}

Urgent diagnosis and treatment is required. In cases without history of trauma， rare causes like coagulation defects， dural vascular malformations， craniofacial tumors and intracranial infections should be investigated. With this case our aim was to report a rare case of pediatric intracranial epidural hematoma as a result of sinusitis.\n\n【2】Keywords： Epidural； Hematoma； Pansinusitis\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】The first sinusitis related Intracranial Epidural Hematoma (IEH) was reported by Kelly in 1968and the most recent was a review article in 2014 by Aviner et al. As IEH generally occurs due to trauma， rarely coagulation defects， dural vascular malformations， craniofacial tumors and intracranial infections may be the cause . Intracranial complications as a result of sinusitis are known； however，IEH is a very rare condition . In this case report we described a pediatric patient presenting with fever and headache due to IEH.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A fifteen year old male patient presented with rhinorrhea， fever， headache and swelling of the forehead. No history of trauma or bleeding disorders was present. There was no other neurological finding other than neck rigidity. The laboratory findings were as follows： C-Reactive Protein (CRP)51.4 mg/L (reference range 0 to 6)， WBC： 11.88 K/mm’(reference range 4.5 to 11)， Mon： 13.27%(reference range 3% to 8%)， Baso： 0.79% (reference range 0% to 3%). Coagulation panel， liver and kidney function tests， and electrolytes were all normal. On Computerized Axial Tomography Scan of the Brain (CT)； on the left frontal area a highly attenuated epidural collection with 27 mm thickness， and millimetric air densities compatible with hemorrhage were detected.Maxillary， ethmoidal and frontal sinusitis were also present . On the Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain(MRI)； a hyperdense left frontal epidural hemorrhagic collection with milimetrica air densities， accompanied by infection， thickenning of the neighbouring dura and contrast enhancement， maxillary， ethmoidal and frontal sinusitis (Pansinusitis) was detected . The patients were operated， and the hematoma discharged with a burr-hole. The specimens obtained from the hematoma were evaluated on direct microscopy； showing 95% of polymorphonuclear leucocytes，4% oflymphocytes. No microorganisms were grown on culture.\n\n【7】In the postoperative period the patient was admitted to the pediatric department for antibiotic treatment without any neurological deficits. After a 14 days course of empirical Ceftriaxone， Metronidazole and Vancomycin treatment CRP was <3 mg/L，WBC9.15K/mm'and the patient was discharged in a good general condition. In one month follow-up the patient’s cranial CT findings were compatible with postoperative findings .\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】In the neurosurgical practice IEH is a condition that needs fast diagnosis and emergency surgery. On contrary the possibility of morbidity and mortality is very high. It is known to occur often due to trauma. Otherwise， rarely the causes are bleeding disorders， dural vascular malformation， neighbouring infections and tumors .\n\n【10】Sinusitis， maylead to intracranial complications such as meningitis， subdural abscess/empyema， epidural abscess/empyema， cerebral abscess， deep and superficial vein thromboses . However IEH is a rare condition caused by sinusitis.\n\n【11】In previous cases of sinusitis and intracranial epidural hematomas various microorganisms(Hemophylus influenzae， Staphylococcus aureus， Streptococcus anginosus ve milleri， Pseudomonas cepacia) have been grown in the cultures from the specimens obtained from the hematoma during surgery . This could also be one of the theories proving that IEH is caused by sinusitis through neighbouring.\n\n【12】The mechanism of sinusitis that leads to IEH has not yet been clearly described. It was tried to be explained with the process of retrograde advancement of inflammation through the diploic vascular canals reaching the intracranial space and rupturing the vessel via inflammation .\n\n【13】It can be envisioned that sinusitis erodes the posterior wall of the frontal sinus， and chronic polymorphonuclear infiltration and irritation causes the vessels in the epidural space to rupture. In our case it is in our opinion that the inflammation reached the epidural area eroding the vessels and causing IEH. The free air densities in the intracranial space supports the theory that sinusitis may have eroded the posterior wall of the frontal sinus. As a matter of fact， in Aviner et al.  review， 13 patients were included of which 9 were children； thus the thin bone structure at this age group makes us believe that inflammation leads to sinus wall erosion more easily . This also supports our theory.\n\n【14】The patient history should be integrated with radiological findings. Headache， fever and neurological findings； hemorrhage and air densities on CT and MRI， contrast enhancement of the paranasal sinuses and the dura， bone destruction or osteomyelitis are all findings that would help make the diagnosis .\n\n【15】Conclusion\n\n【16】High fever， headache and change in mental state particularly in childhood should suggest of sinusitis and IEH as a complication. Emergency surgery after a fast diagnosis is of ominous significance. On contrary besides the morbidity and mortality； more difficult to treat and fatal complications such as epidural/subdural empyema， cerebral abscess may develop.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:21:41", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:22:06", "cost": 24.773}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:43", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:22:06", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:21:41"}

It has a worldwide distribution as a result of more global travel. The liver is the most common site ofhydatid disease . We managed a pediatric case that combined two complications at one time. This case reported includes first spontaneous cutaneous fistulization of liver hydatid cysts and secondly in the pleural cavity the diagnosis has been established by the ultrasound imaging of the abdomen and the CT scan. Surgery is required to achieve complete evacuation of the cyst contents and resolution of the residual cavity. This presentation seems rare. To the best of our knowledge，this is the fourth case published.\n\n【2】Keywords： Echinococeus granulosus； Liver hydatid；Spontaneous cutaneous fistulization； Pleural cavity\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Hydatid liver disease is the most frequently infestation caused by genus Echinococcus granulosus. Complications like cyst rupture and infection may occur， sites of rupture including： bile ducts， gastrointestinal tract， bronchic， peritoneal and pleural cavity . Rupture into the subcutaneous tissue followed by external fistula and the involvement in pleural cavity is an extremely rare presentation . We reported a pediatric case who presented this combination. The aim of this study is to consider the parietal complications of the hydatid cyst of the liver associated to pleural one.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】A 14 years old girl presented a painful lumbar masse with a discharge of fluid pus. Clinical checkup found a high fever 39.5， cutaneous mucosa pallor and lumbar masse redness； swelling in or around .\n\n【7】Ultrasound examination showed hydatid cyst in segment IIV； IV of liver forming a fistula opening at the pleural cavity and following into a cyst in the lumbar side. CT scan has gift a cartography illustration of the fistula and of the hydatid cyst confirming the diagnosis of infected of the liver hydatid associated with its fistulization in lumbar side also in pleural cavity .\n\n【8】An under costallaparotomy was done under general anesthesia. After opening the abdomen one large cyst was founded in the right liver lobe. This one was forming a cutaneous fistula at the lumbar side and in the pleural cavity. After sterilization of the entire cavity with hypertonic saline. Liver hydatid was aspirated. The cyst was opened with a small incision and a suction tip was introduced to evacuate the remaining fluid. Proligerous membrane was easily removed after widening the incision and visible biliary opening were sutured . Resection of rounded roof projection and excision of the fistula tract a drain was inserted in the peritoneum near the residual cavity in the liver. Postoperatively， the patient was given antibiotics for 10 days the laparotomy and the lumbar fistula site healed well after surgery. Follow up checkup control did not reveal recurrence of the disease.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Hydatidosis， a zoonotic infection is due to the larval stage of tapeworm Echinococcus this infection is acquired through infestation of parasite egg released in feces of the definite host bearing the adult worm in it gut . The disease can be developed anywhere in the human body it also has a worldwide distribution due to increasing migration and growing global travel . In Morocco it’s an endemic disease.\n\n【11】The most frequently involved organ is the liver (52% to 77%). Its can because complication in about 40% cases the common complications are infection or rupture into the biliary tree. Whereas rupture in pleural cavity and the spontaneous cutaneous fistulization are exceptionally rare one by one ， the association of both is more rare. Thoracic complications of hepatic hydatid cyst result from the proximity of hydatid cyst in the liver and the diaphragm. Spontaneous cutaneous fistulization of hydatid liver is one of the exceptional presentations . It’s different than the direct rupture in the abdominal tissue which results without creation of a fibrosis tract . This complication interest almost of hydatid liver. Usually right hepatic lobes invade the right lateral abdominal wall  same as . They are especially with exoliver development. Although the cyst from left lobe invade the anterior abdominal wall . This cyst are commonly old， the pericyst has been inflammatory reshuffle and calcifications. Such as our reported cases， many characters explain the factors of fistulization： Mechanic and inflammatory ones. Mechanic reasons are the continued expansion of the cyst causing pressure erosion and adhesion to the adjacent structure In the same time inflammatory factors exist with increasing intracystic pressure， the cyst rupture and inflammation lead to necrosis consequently causing fistulization.Occult trauma could be one of the causes for rupture of hydatid cyst leading to fistula formation . Some subcutaneous hydatid cysts are more likely to be a primary invasion of hepatic Echinococcus is or contamination during previous surgery rather than hematogenous metastasis.\n\n【12】There is a classification of rupture hepatic hydatid cyst posted by Lewall and MCorKELL . They have separated rupture hydatid liver cyst into 3 categories： Contained， communicating and direct. Contained rupture occurs when only the endocyst ruptures and the cyst contents remain confined to the intact pericyst. Communicating rupture consists of a rupture of the endocyst with the escape of cyst contents into bronchioles or biliary radicals that are incorporated into the pericyst. Direct rupture is when both the endocyst and pericyst tear， causing a leakage of contents into the pleural or peritoneal cavities or other adjacent tissues.\n\n【13】The operating procedure seems extremely necessary associated to medical treatment in the way to remove the cyst . Surgical gesture includes resection of the primary cyst with excision of the fistula tract and disease skin. Benzimidazolecarbamates (mebendazole and albendazole) are antihelmintic drugsthat kill the parasite byimpairing its glucose uptake. Albendazole is the drug of choice because of its better absorption and better clinical results in comparison with mebendazole. Continuous daily treatment for a 3 months period has better results.\n\n【14】Concluding， association of cutaneous involvement and pleural one in liver hydatid cyst is a rare presentation， which has not been reported just in 3 cases before ours， in our knowledge. The surgical treatment is the most successful procedure of the definitive treatment of this disease.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:11:58", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:12:08", "cost": 9.361}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:43", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:12:08", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:11:57"}

We reported a case of severe tetanus diagnosed assistant by next-generation sequencing analysis of etiology and finally successful treatment of his autonomic instability with dexmedetomidine. This case suggested that early diagnosis and reasonable intervention of severe tetanus could reduce mortality.\n\n【4】Keywords： Tetanus； Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)； Autonomic instability； Dexmedetomidine； Prognosis\n\n【5】Background\n\n【6】Tetanusisa rare fatalinfectious disease caused by Clostridium tetani. Tetanus is characterized by muscle spasm of masticatory muscles first. With the progress of the disease， mild stimulation can trigger generalized tonic epileptic activity， which can lead to fatal clinical manifestations， such as autonomic instability . Tetanus is still an endemic epidemic in developing countries， and its incidence rate often rises after natural disasters such as earthquake and tsunami . Most physicians in developed countries lack experience in treating such cases. The treatment of tetanus is not standardized either. By consulting journals and scientific literature， we found that there are few literatures related to the diagnosis or treatment of autonomic instability . Therefore， this case report is of great significance for treating doctors in Emergency Department or Intensive Care Units to learn features of tetanus for early recognition and treatment.\n\n【7】A 50-year-old male building worker presented in our hospital with recent onset of difficulty in opening mouth. The man's right arm was injured at work 10 days before. The local hospital surgeons had already given him surgical debridement and tetanus antitoxin immunotherapy. A 10cm longitudinal incision was seen on the palmar side of his right forearm. The wound seemedhealed well apparently and the stitches had been removed. He represented to our hospital and complained about the difficulty of opening his mouth. He had not received any tetanus vaccinations before. After admission， he was diagnosed tetanus and transferred to a Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) single ward immediately to reduce sound and light stimulation. To neutralize the toxin， 1000 U of human anti-tetanus immunoglobulin was administrated， along with the tetanus toxoid injection. For muscle spasm， diazepam infusion of 1 mg/kg/day was given. Penicillin and metronidazole were given as antibiotic coverage. He developed respiratory failure the following day， these verity of his illness required mechanical ventilation and subsequent tracheostomy. Further surgical debridement was performed the third day after admission and 1000 IU of tetanus immunoglobulin was injected intramuscularly around the wound. It was confirmed that the first debridement was not complete， and residual building cement sands were found in the wound . Clostridium tetanus was identified in wound secretions by Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis of etiology . The wound was kept open and then washed with hydrogen peroxide every day for almost 10 days. The wound was sutured 18 dayslater. One week after admission， the man developed autonomic instability symptoms， characterized by high fever， sweating， extreme fluctuations in heart rate and blood pressure. Large doses of neuro-blockers， analgesics and sedatives were administrated. His antibiotic regimen altered to intravenous metronidazole and ceftriaxone soon. His gastrointestinal function was weakened and his stomach was seriously reserved. He changed to pyloric feeding later to strengthen nutritional support. We assessed the severity of his tetanus using the Ablett classification； all symptoms were in the very severe category. Recognition of the tetanus pathophysiology， comprehensive treatment in ICU and choice of sedative medications， including dexmedetomidine for 14days with its anti-sympathetic effect， led to successful discharge. The patient was discharged after 28 days in SICU and 15 days more in respiratory ward. Except for a little stiffness in the joints， the man had clear mind， fluent speech and free movement of joints at the time of discharge. After discharge， the family members complained that the man had an involuntary shaking ofleft leg when sleeping at night and then head MRI showed multiple ischemic lesions in his right frontal lobe and bilateral parietal lobes. Within 3 months after discharge，this kind ofleft leg involuntary shaking had always existed.\n\n【8】Discussion and Conclusion\n\n【9】In recent years， no relevant literature has reported the incidence of tetanus in China， but it often happens . Diagnosis of tetanus is mainly based on clinical signs and symptoms. The rarity of tetanus and the difficulty of cultivation of Clostridium tetani， which lead to early clinical diagnosis mainly relying on the experience of doctors. However， it is important to realize that tetanus can occur despite previous immunization and protective anti-tetanus antibody levels. Recently， NGS has shown an advantage in etiological diagnosis. The NGS technology allows for the detection and identification of(difficult-to culture) microorganisms using a culture-independent strategy ，especially in the diagnosis of unexplained encephalitis. We report a case of tetanus confirmed by NGS sequencing. suggesting that there are still many possibilities in the etiological diagnosis of tetanus. After consulting the literature， we used NGS method to diagnose tetanus for the first time. Autonomic instability is one of the most challenging factors in the treatment of severe tetanus and a circulatory disturbance is one of the common causes of death in severe tetanus . This period is extremely labile and is characterized by malignant hypertension and tachycardia， followed by profound hypotension and bradycardia . The optimal treatment for autonomic instability is still unclear . Sedatives used range from benzodiazepines such as midazolam and diazepam to anesthetics such as propofol and ketamine. Magnesium sulfate， intrathecal baclofen， morphine， bupivacaine， fentanyl and labetalol can also reduce autonomic instability. However， the evidence is limited to case reports and a few case series . To date， there have been no large-scale studies aimed at identifying specific preferences for the treatment of tetanus related autonomic symptoms. Dexmedetomidine is a more selective a2-adrenoreceptor agonist than clonidine. It has combined analgesic and anti-sympathetic effect， make it sensible to consider in this setting . Here we present a case of generalized tetanus complicated by autonomic crises managed with dexmedetomidine infusion about for 14 days. The administration of dexmedetomidine reduced the use of sedative drugs to control muscle spasms and cardiovascular instability. There is no upper limit in dose or frequency of sedative agents. This case illustrates that very high doses of all sedatives were required for almost 3 weeks. We still don't know whether the limb shaking in sleep， the denaturation in the head MRI and tetanus toxin were related. Finally， we should not detract from the importance of general ICU management in treating severe tetanus. Appropriate wound care and debridement， antibiotics and the administration of antitoxin are all essential . Also， as tetanus infection does not lead to development of protective antibodies， immunization with tetanus toxoid is mandatory， as it will reduce the chances of developing tetanus from subsequent wounds . In summary， this case suggested that early diagnosis and reasonable intervention of severe tetanus could reduce mortality. This case also shows that the comprehensive treatment in ICU is very important for the treatment of severe tetanus.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:15:46", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:15:54", "cost": 7.962}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:43", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:15:53", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:15:45"}

The purpose of this study was to report a case of MacTel type 2 with concomitant Down syndrome， and discuss the possibility of an association between these two conditions， backed up by previous studies on the diseases metabolic abnormalities.\n\n【2】Observations： A 33-year-old Caucasian male with Down syndrome， who presented with increasing visual difficulty in both near and distance， underwent a complete ophthalmic examination， color fundus photography， Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and near-infrared fundus reflectance imaging. Prominent clinical findings suggesting IJFT included bull's eye-appearing hypopigmentary lesions in maculae， bilateral parafoveal pigment depositions， and bilateral right angle venules. Near-infrared reflectance imaging showed intraretinal telangiectasia， and OCT imaging showed bilateral disruption of the ellipsoid within the foveal region.\n\n【3】Conclusion and Importance： A possible explanation for an association between MacTel type 2 and Down syndrome could be underlying peripheral neuropathy and degeneration due to genetic and metabolic abnormalities， defects in the serine/glycine metabolic pathways， as well as angiogenesis regulation system. A detailed and comprehensive retinal examination of Down syndrome patients could help further investigation on a possible association between these two diseases.\n\n【4】Keywords： Macular telangiectasia type 2； Down syndrome； Juxtafoveal telangiectasis\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Macular telangiectasia (MacTel) type 2 is an idiopathic bilateral condition with alterations of the macular capillary network as well as neurosensory atrophy . Characteristic findings include juxtafoveolar telangiectatic vessels， retinal crystalline deposits，right-angle venules， and intraretinal pigment plaques. Visualloss can often occur， and treatment is controversial.\n\n【7】The first description of the disease was presented by Gass et al. ， and subsequently Gass and Boldi  classified this condition under idiopathic juxtafoveolar telangiectasia type 2A. During the past decade， there has been notable progress in characterizing the disease and understanding its pathophysiology. It is now assumed that MacTel type 2 is a neurodegenerative disease with vascular alterations . Recent genetic studies demonstrated that MacTel type 2 is a complex disease with specific involved pathways. Significant associations were identified at three independent loci at5q14.3，2q34，and 1p12 . The 5q14.3 locus is associated with retinal vascular diameter variations， and the 2q34 and 1p12 loci are involved in the glycine/serine metabolic pathway . Further investigation of this pathway demonstrated that a mutation affecting serine metabolism could lead to a MacTel type-2 phenotype .\n\n【8】In this case report， we describe a patient with MacTel type 2 and concomitant Down syndrome.\n\n【9】Case Presentation\n\n【10】A 33-year-old Caucasian male with Down syndrome presented with increasing difficulty in his distance visual acuity for one year. He could no longer recognize faces at a distance， but had no difficulty with peripheral， color or night vision. Medical and family history was noncontributory.\n\n【11】Best corrected visual acuity was 20/200 OD and 20/100 OS. In the clinical examination， pupils were reactive and ocular motility was full. There was an intermittent alternating esotropia. Ocular pressures where 14 OD and 15 OS. The right cornea showed inferior stain near the limbus which was not evident in the left. The anterior chambers were clear. Other findings included bilateral Brushfield spots on the iris， punctate cortical opacities both anterior and posteriorly in the lens of each eye， a mildly fibrillary vitreous， with no evidence of macular hemorrhage or exudate. A bilateral increase in vascular branches crossing the optic disc was present . Bull's eye-appearing hypopigmentary lesions were evident in both maculae， with bilateral temporal parafoveal pigment depositions . Right angle venules were noted both temporally and superiorly in each eye. Near-infrared reflectance imaging showed intraretinal telangiectasia， and OCT imaging showed disruption of the ellipsoid within the foveal region bilaterally， in addition to thickening of the macula . The patient’s overall findings were consistent with MacTel type 2.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】Although the concurrence of MacTel type 2 and Down syndrome in this patient may be coincidental， it could suggest a previously unrecognized association between the two conditions in some patients. The presented patient interestingly has a severe phenotype despite his young age. Investigators have studied macular abnormalities in Down syndrome patients during the past decade. O'Brien et al.  demonstrated that the central subfield thickness for the full retina and inner and outer retinal layers were all significantly greater in the Down syndrome children compared to a control group， suggesting an abnormal macular development in children with Down syndrome. In line with this study， Mangalesh et al.  found abnormal foveal morphology and persistence of inner retinal layers using OCT in Down syndrome children.\n\n【14】Recent studiess also tie Down n syndrome withperipheral neuropathy andddegeneration dueetogenetic andmetabolic abnormalities . For instance， Patel et al1. found that abnormal increase in a regulator of calcineurin 1 -an endogenous inhibitor of the calcineurin phosphatase that is triplicated in Down syndrome- impairs neurotrophic support of neurons by inhibiting endocytosis of the nerve growth factor receptor TrkA. Furthermore， investigators have shown metabolic abnormalities involving the serine/glycine pathway in Down syndrome patients . Given the neurodegenerative nature of MacTel type 2 and recent discoveries regarding serine/glycine pathway abnormalities in MacTel patients， it would be ofpotential value to further investigate the possibility of an association between the two diseases.\n\n【15】A common finding in Down syndrome is a high number of vessels crossing the margin of the optic nerve ， as seen in this case. This has been attributed to the mild systemic angiogenesis deficiency associated with Down syndrome . As a result of high endostatin levels in trisomy 21，bulbous expansion of the hyaloid vessels is down regulated， causing the retinal vessels to branch closer to the optic disc center and create an abnormallycrowded vascular pattern on the disc.Furthermore， atrioventricular septal defects in Down syndrome has been associated with abnormalities in the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-A (VEGF-A) pathway . This pathway is crucial in endothelial cell functions involved with angiogenesis， including proliferation， migration， survival， and new vessel formation . The abnormalities in the vascular system in Down syndrome patients could partially contribute to the vascular alterations seen in MacTel type 2.\n\n【16】Conclusion\n\n【17】This manuscript highlights certain similarities between the pathophysiology in MacTeltype2 and Down syndrome. We recognize that there could be other， yet unknown pathways contributing to the pathophysiology of MacTel as well. It is notable that in early stages， the clinical findings of MacTel type 2 can are very subtle， and mild changes in the macula might not always be appreciated as possible primary changes of MacTel. A detailed and comprehensive retinal examination of Down syndrome patients could help define an association between these two diseases.\n\n【18】Patient Consent\n\n【19】Informed consent was obtained from the patient and legal guardian to publish this report.

Anti-PTIgG and IgA concentrations were measured by ELISA. The anti-PT IgG and IgA levels were categorized as positive when values obtained were ≥ 100 IU/ml and ≥ 20IU/ml， respectively. Anti-PT IgA was determined when the anti-PT IgG was detectable (≥5IU/ml).\n\n【3】Results： In non-pertussis patients， up to 73.9% of them had undetectable level. However， 34.5%of pertussis patients had anti-PT IgG level ≥ 100 IU/ml and only 32.1% were undetectable. A total of 23 patients had anti-PT IgA level≥ 20 IU/ml， and 22 of them were found in pertussis patients.

However， due to lack of laboratory tests ， pertussis was still underestimated in China . The laboratory-confirmed tests included culture， PCR and serodiagnosis . The sensitivity of culture and PCR decreases over time， and culture and PCR for pertussis was not available in most community hospitals in China. Therefore， the use of serodiagnosis of pertussis is attractive in China.\n\n【8】The World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for a laboratory confirmed case include seroconversion observed in paired serology samples， but collection of serial samples is infrequent in practice . For interpreting single samples， anti-PT IgG has repeatedly been shown to be the most robust serological marker for acute pertussis infection . However， many of the problems associated with anti-PT IgG serodiagnosis still persist. It is difficult to interpret anti-PT IgG results in the following situation：  Positive anti-PT IgG results in recently vaccinated children (<1 year)； positive anti-PT IgG results in children with unknown vaccination history (at the age of pertussis vaccination)；  equivocal or even lower anti-PT IgG results.\n\n【9】Anti-PT IgA assay was inferior to anti-PT IgG assay as the test of choice for pertussis diagnosis from a single sample . The major interest in measuring anti-PT IgA， comes from the observation that anti-PT IgA responses are only weakly induced by pertussis vaccination . The recently published study by Subissi et al.  suggested that reflex testing of anti-PT IgA improves pertussis serodiagnosis in recently vaccinated symptomatic subjects with elevated anti-PT IgG levels. Therefore， anti-PT IgA may be an additional marker in pertussis serodiagnosis for uncertain anti-PT IgG results， when a second sample cannot be obtained.\n\n【10】In this present study we evaluated anti-PT IgG to assess the seroprevalence of pertussis in different groups of patients， and anti-PT IgA will be tested in patients with detectable anti-PT IgG levels. This study will help us better understand the value of anti-PT IgA for a single anti-PT IgG sample to diagnose pertussis.\n\n【11】Materials and Methods\n\n【12】Ethics approval and consent to participate\n\n【13】This study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of Qilu Children’s Hospital affiliated to Shandong University. Written informed consent was obtained from all the parents or guardians， for these children's blood samples to be used for research on infectious diseases.\n\n【14】Samples collection\n\n【15】This i a cross-sectional and hospital-based study. From January 2018 through December 2018， 302 children diagnosed with respiratory tract infection (without pertussis history) or pertussis hospitalized in Qilu Children’s Hospital， Shandong University was included in this study. It was discharge diagnosis. The clinical case criteria for pertussis diagnosis were referred to the WHO definition of pertussis . A suspected case is a person of any age with a cough lasting ≥2 weeks， or of any duration in an infant or any person in an outbreak setting， without a more likely diagnosis and with at least one of the following symptoms， based on observation or parental report：Paroxysms (fits) of coughing； inspiratory whooping； post-tussive vomiting， or vomiting without other apparent cause； apnea (only in <1year of age)； OR clinician suspicion of pertussis. The confirmed cases of pertussis were determined by laboratory confirmation (culture， PCR or anti-PT IgG test)， and all of them had at least one positive laboratory test. For recently vaccinated children (<1 year) or children who may have been recently vaccinated (unknown vaccination history)， they were confirmed by culture or PCR. Those cases diagnosed with immune system related diseases were not enrolled. For all children， basic data about age， gender， date of sampling and medical histories were collected from hospital information systems and electronic medical records. The samples were not collected for this study if the informed consent could not get from the parents or guardians. All serum samples were frozen at -20°C until analysis.\n\n【16】Serological testing\n\n【17】Both anti-PT IgG (Euroimmun， Liibeck， Germany) and IgA(Institut Virion/Serion GmbH， Germany) were detected using the commercially available ELISA kit， according to the manufacturer's instructions. An absorbance of reaction was read using Infinite 200Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (TECAN). The antibody results were expressed in international units per milliliter (IU/ml). The lower limit of detection for anti-PT IgG was 5 IU/ml and referred to the“First International Standard for Pertussis Antiserum\"， NIBSC code：06/140， World Health Organization (WHO). The anti-PT IgG levels were categorized as negative， equivocal and positive when values obtained were <40， 40- <100 and ≥ 100 IU/ml. Anti-PT IgG ≥ 100IU/ml (≥1 years post pertussis vaccination) was considered to be indicative of a recent pertussis infection， as recommended by the previous studies . The lower limit of detection for anti-PT IgA was 10 IU/ml and referred to WHO Reference Reagent (06/142).\n\n【18】The anti-PT IgA levels were categorized as negative， equivocal and positive when values obtained were <15，15-<20 and ≥ 20 IU/ml.\n\n【19】Data analysis\n\n【20】Data were analyzed using the JMP . For statistical analysis， antibody concentrations below the lower limit for quantification were assigned as half the lower limit of quantification(2.5 IU/ml for anti-PT IgG， and 5 IU/ml for anti-PT IgA). xtest was used to compare proportions of subiects with protective anti-PT IgG or IgA among different subgroup. P≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant.\n\n【21】Results\n\n【22】Characteristics of study population\n\n【23】A total of 302 subjects were enrolled in the study with the age range of 1 month 4 days to 11 years 9 month (median： 4 years). The ratio of male to female was 1.6：1(187：115).Among them， 218 subjects diagnosed with respiratory tract infection were considered ‘non-pertussis， and the other 84 subjects meeting clinical case definition of pertussis were laboratory confirmed pertussis. Among non-pertussis group， the rate of at least 3 dose of DTP vaccination was75.2%(164/218). Among pertussis group， 38.1%(32/84) of patients were not vaccinated against DTP， 41.7%(30/84) of patients had a confirmed history of DTP vaccination. A total of 17 pertussis patients were unknown for the history of DTP vaccination.\n\n【24】Distributions of anti-PTlgG and anti-PT IgA\n\n【25】The distributions of anti-PT level in the sera of 302 subiects are presented in Table 1. In non-pertussis patients， more than 70% of them had undetectable anti-PT IgG. In patients with pertussis， about70% of them had detectable anti-PT IgG， and half of them have anti-PTIgGlevels ≥100IU/ml. There was nosignificant differences in rates of anti-PT IgG ≥ 100 IU/ml between unvaccinated and vaccinated children (P=0.7885). Among pertussis patients who had anti-PT IgG levels of ≥ 100 IU/ml， 63.2% of who have coughed more than 3 weeks.\n\n【26】The anti-PT IgA levels were tested in 114 patients who had detectable anti-PT IgG levels. The anti-PT IgA level distribution was summarized in Table 2. Anti-PTIgA concentration exceeded 20U/ml in 23 subjects， and 22 of them were found in patients with pertussis. There was no significant differences in rates of anti-PT IgA ≥ 20 IU/ml between unvaccinated and vaccinated children (P=1.0). Among pertussis patients who had anti-PTIgA levels of≥20 IU/ml， 76.5% of who have coughed more than 3 weeks.\n\n【27】The value of sequential testing of anti-PT IgA in single samples for pertussis diagnosis\n\n【28】Among 29 pertussis patients who had anti-PT IgG levels of100 IU/ml， only 8 unvaccinated and 7 vaccinated (>1 year) patients cloud be confirmed by only anti-PT IgG test in single samples.

Among 18 pertussis patients who had equivocal or even lower anti-PT IgG results， eight of them cloud also be confirmed by sequential testing of anti-PT IgA.\n\n【33】For anti-PT IgG (100 IU/ml) or IgA alone (20 IU/ml) assay， the sensitivity was only 26.3%. However， when anti-PT IgG is used as the first indicator to confirm cases， and secondary confirmation is performed with anti-PT IgA， the sensitivity improved to 52.6%.\n\n【34】Discussion\n\n【35】The dilemma of anti-PT IgG measurement has been interpreting indeterminate anti-PT IgG levels， when a second sample cannot be obtained. Our results suggest that sequential testing of anti-PT IgA in the patients which had uncertain anti-PT IgG result would improve the pertussis diagnosis.\n\n【36】The major interest of measurement of IgAAin pertussis serodiagnosis comes from the observations that， primary vaccinations with WCVs or ACVs in the first year of life induce IgM and IgG antibodies but do not induce IgA antibodies. Among 114 patients who had detectable anti-PT IgG levels， 23 of them had anti-PT IgA level ≥ 20 IU/ml， and 22 of them were found in patients with pertussis. Our result also suggested that anti-PT IgA would be highly specific for acute infection.\n\n【37】Prior vaccination historymay theoreticallyycconfound interpretation of anti-PT IgG. Among 29 pertussis patients who had anti-PT IgG levels of≥ 100 IU/ml， for 7 recently vaccinated (<1year) patients and 7 children who may have been recently vaccinated(unknown vaccination history)； the diagnosis could not be confirmed. For 8 of them， the diagnosis cloud is confirmed by sequential testing of anti-PT IgA.\n\n【38】Robson et al.  suggested that reflex testing of anti-PT IgA in the context of equivocal anti-PT IgG results may be worthwhile. For 13 pertussis patients with equivocal anti-PT IgG (40- <100 IU/ml)， three of them cloud also be confirmed by sequential testing of anti-PT IgA. However， considering the relative low levels of anti-PT IgG in vaccinated children， we could not eliminate that those subjects who had detectable but negative anti-Ptx IgG (5-<40IU/ml) did have a real pertussis infection. The sequential testing of anti-PT IgA in 4patients had exactly increased the sensitivity of serological diagnosis of pertussis. The two studies by Guiso et al.  and May et al.  suggested that the likely cutoff is between 10 and 20 IU/ml， close to the minimum level of quantification. If the cutoff of 10 IU/ml was adopted， the diagnostic performance in another 3 patients which had anti-PT IgG levels of 5-<40 IU/ml was also changed. Our results suggest that anti-PT IgA should be tested for not only equivocal (40-<100 IU/ml)， but also lower detectable anti-PT IgG level (5-<40 IU/ml).\n\n【39】In our study， nearly 90.0% (75/84) of the pertussis patients in our study are children aged <4 years. In patients with detectable anti-PT IgG， about half (30/57) of them have detectable anti-PT IgA. It was similar with previous study， which revealed the less frequent and less strong IgA levels for pertussis infection in children aged <4years . Even though there is some potential in IgA to improve the diagnosis， it is not applicable for routine diagnostics for infants and young children. However， it is reassuring to study this further in adolescents and adults， as already confirmed by other research . In fact， serology overall is not recommended to children <2 years. The positive anti-PT IgA was also worthwhile for infants and young children with uncertain anti-PT IgG， when only serodiagnosis was available and a second sample cannot be obtained.\n\n【40】There were certain limitations in this study. Firstly， when clinical case definition of pertussis was used in the selection of subjects， the majority of (84.5%， 71/84) of the pertussis patients in our study are children aged <2 years.

However， because of the rare presentation， little is known about the pre-operative management. This case report describes a 72-year-old patient presenting with a swelling in the neck. The relevant literature is also reviewed.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】Carotid Body Tumors (CBT) are rare neoplasms originating from neural crest cells， referred to as paragangliomas (extra-adrenal). They are not to be confused with pheochromocytomas， which are intra-adrenal neoplasms， due to the different implications for associated neoplasms， malignancy risk and genetic testing. They can be divided in sympathetic and parasympathetic paragangliomas . Most CBTs are parasympathetic and non-functional. Only four to five percent of them are sympathetic and have catecholamine production . These extra-adrenal parasympathetic paragangliomas are found near arteries and cranial nerves of the branchial arches， with a cervicocephalic distribution. Paragangliomas are named after their site of origin.\n\n【4】They most commonly occur at the carotid bifurcation where they are known as carotid body tumors. The tumor is typically mobile in the lateral plane with restricted mobility in the cephalocaudal direction (Fontaine sign) . Additional sites of origin include the jugular bulb(jugular paraganglioma)， around the vagus nerve (vagal paraganglioma) and within the middle ear mucosa (tympanic paraganglioma).\n\n【5】If the tumors produce catecholamines， patients may complain of symptoms such as episodic headache， fluctuating hypertension and palpitations .\n\n【6】Because of its close proximity to the carotid vessels and cranial nerves (X-XII)， enlargement of the tumor may cause progressive neurologic symptoms such as odynophagia， dysphagia or hoarseness of voice. Compression or erosion of surrounding tissue alone is not an acceptable proof of malignancy. Evidence of malignancy is only accepted when there is metastasis to non-neuroendocrine tissue， such as cervical lymph nodes， lung， liver and skin . Local recurrence or lymph node metastasis after total resection of the primary mass， or by the detection of distant metastasis is also seen in malignant CBTs .\n\n【7】For long time whether malignancy in CBTs can be seen on histologic characteristics. One study stated that the following histologic characteristics are suspicious for malignancy： central necrosis of the clusters， invasion of the vascular spaces，and mitoses However， others have considered that histology alone is unreliable to differentiate between benign and malignant CBTs. Only the presence of metastasis in lymph nodes or distant organs is acceptable proof of malignancy . If CBT metastasize， there is a very high rate of regional confinement (94%). Bone and lung metastasis are the most frequently reported distant metastases.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 72-year-old female presented to the otolaryngology clinic with disturbing pain in the right side of the neck for about six months. She also complained of a sore throat and general fatigue. Physical examination showed a 2 cm to cm swelling situated just below the mandibular angle， lateral to anterior border of sternocleidomastoid muscle. Fontaine sign， in which the swelling is more mobile in the horizontal plan compared to the vertical plane， was positive. The mass was non-tender， non-pulsatile with no increase in size with act of coughing or straining. No murmur was noticed on auscultation. Examination of all cranial nerves was normal.\n\n【10】Due to the swelling and her general malaise an ultrasound was preformed demonstrating a solid mass at the region of carotid bifurcation. Further imaging evaluation with computed tomography angiography  and magnetic resonance imaging angiography showed a homogenously enhancing mass in the crotch of the left carotid artery bifurcation. The mass causes splaying of the internal carotid and external carotid arteries， in keeping with the diagnosis of a carotid body tumor. On imaging the tumor was classified as Shamblin type II. Referral to the vascular surgeon for removal of the carotid body tumor was made.\n\n【11】Hormonal check-up showed no abnormalities in catecholamines.\n\n【12】Computed Tomography Angiography  and Magnetic Resonance Imaging angiography showed a homogenously enhancing mass in the crotch of the left carotid artery bifurcation. There is splaying of internal carotid and external carotid arteries， in keeping with the diagnosis of a carotid body tumor. On imaging the tumor was classified as a Shamblin type II .\n\n【13】After all this pre-operative investigations， the patient underwent surgery under general anesthesia. An incision was made along the anterior border of Sternocleidomastoid Muscle (SCM) and after careful incision of the platysma and the carotid sheath； the tumor was found .\n\n【14】The tumor was highly vascularized and therefore removed with the use of bipolar coagulation. Repeated nerve stimulator tests were essential and performed to ensure nerve preservation. Complete removal was obtained and no vascular reconstruction was needed. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of a glomangioma， the histological equivalent of a Carotid Body Tumor(CBT). The postoperative period was uneventful， and the patient was discharged with no neurological deficits except some mild complaints of hypoesthesia on the right side ofher neck.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】Therapy strategies\n\n【17】It is important to distinguish between secreting and non- secreting tumors. A hormonal check-up for catecholamine should be under taken to avoid precipitating a catecholamine crisis. All patients should have negative biochemical results for catecholamine hypersecretion or undergo alpha blockade before older ionic contrast agents are administered for a CT scan. Current nonionic low-osmolality contrast agents are safe in patients with catecholamine secreting tumors， even without adrenergic blockade.\n\n【18】The majorities of CBT appear to be sporadic or can be hereditary(one-third to one-half of the cases) . They have been linked to mutations in the genes encoding subunits of the Succinate Dehydrogenase (SDH) enzyme and are also seen in syndromes such as MEN2， Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) and neurofibromatosis type I.\n\n【19】Genetics will not be further discussed in this article， but germline mutation testing is advised for all patients with paragangliomas in the currentliterature .\n\n【20】Surgical removal\n\n【21】Surgical excision has been the standard approach for removal of CBTs， especially when the CBTs are symptomatic. The standard surgical principles for carotid body tumor excision include wide surgical exposure，proximal and distal vascular control， identification and preservation of the neurovascular structures， careful tumor dissection from the external and internal carotid arteries， ligation of the external carotid arteries when necessary， and vascular shunting and grafting wherever necessary .\n\n【22】However， a high incidence of postoperative cranial nerve deficits has remained over the years. This raises the question whether the high rate of postoperative cranial nerve dysfunction favors observation rather than resection for asymptomatic tumors .\n\n【23】Therefore， a conservative approach in an asymptomatic CBT is justifiable， although they eventually cause symptoms in nearly 75% of patients due to local growth， which makes removal more challenging.\n\n【24】Radiation therapy\n\n【25】Another option is radiation therapy. It is commonly performed in patients whoarepoor candidates for surgical excision or embolization， secondary to their age or co-morbid conditions. Complications of radiotherapy include inflammation of the external auditory canal and middle ear， osteoradionecrosis， cranial nerve neuropathies， carotid stenosis and direct injury to the brain tissue. Radiotherapy also makes subsequent head and neck surgeries highly challenging.\n\n【26】Despite limited experience， radiotherapy for paragangliomas appears to be helpful in cases with unresectable lesions， in high-risk patients，and as an adjunct to surgery for incompletely excised tumors or metastases. Earlier reports even have opted for the use of radiation therapy as the first choice of treatment .\n\n【27】Pre-operative techniques\n\n【28】Fine needle aspiration or an incisional biopsy is of little value an： for paragangliomas. Aspirates can easily be mistaken for many other neoplasms， and the procedure itselfbrings a high risk for hemorrhage at the operative site .\n\n【29】Imaging\n\n【30】Historically Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) has been the golden diagnostic standard. With the advent of high resolution angiographic ComputedTomography (CTA) aniddMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) DSA has been replaced as the imaging modalities of choice for detection of the carotid body tumors. However， preoperative angiography provides useful information about the vascular anatomy and its collateral circulation. This allows for careful planning if sacrifice of a major blood vessel is deemed necessary during surgery .\n\n【31】Furthermore pre-operative tumor embolization has been used to shrink the tumor size and disconnect the tumor from its feeding vessels， decreasing complications .\n\n【32】When patients are referred for atypical neck swelling， ultrasound is often the first acquired imaging modality. Carotid body tumors appear as a hypoechoic mass at carotid artery bifurcation and display prominent vascularization when examined with color Doppler. Displacement of the Internal (ICA) and External Carotid Arteries(ECA) is an important clue and should prompt further image evaluation .\n\n【33】Both CTA and MRA appearances are diagnostic. On CT， after intravenous contrast administration， carotid body tumors present as a solid homogenous intensely enhancing mass， located within the carotid bifurcation  . Seldomly heterogeneous pattern of enhancement can be seen due thrombi or hemorrhage in larger tumors. As a result of their hyper-vascularity， contrast enhancement is rapid and contrary to the gradual enhancement of nerve sheath tumors . Larger CBT will displace the internal and external carotid arteries with splaying of the vessels， the so-called lyre sign . While CT has a better special resolution， MRI better depicts the soft tissue components.\n\n【34】On T1-weighted images (T1WI) CBT are hypo- to isointense compared to muscle  and hyperintense on T2-weighted sequences . A characteristic finding is the so called “salt and pepperappearance in larger lesions (>2 cm) on T1-weighted images. The “salt”phenomenon， although uncommon， is due to multiple punctuating hemorrhages inside the lesion. These subacute hemorrhages present as high signal intensity spots. The low signal intensity “pepper”component  is a result of multiple flow voids from intratumoral blood vessels. Similar to CT， there is vivid enhancement after contrast administration  .\n\n【35】Classification sy stem s\n\n【36】The first classification system based on invasion of the carotid vessels was proposed in 1971 by Shamblin .\n\n【37】Because this classification does not predict neurological damage but only prognosticate surgical time and perioperative bleeding the modified Shamlin’s classification proposed by Luna-Ortiz is a more detailed classification system . According this classification， group I tumors are relatively small tumors minimally attached to carotid vessels. The group II tumors are more adherent to the adventitia but still removable without reconstruction of the vessels. The group III tumors encase the carotid vessels and often require arterial resection and grafting. Frequently type III tumors are larger， but this does not mean there is a direct relation between these two specifications. A smaller tumor can be classified as type II or III according to vessel involvement . Luna et al. suggest that aCBT of any size， if intimately adherent to the vessels， should be classified as modified Shamblin class IIIb， whereas IIIa represents the original III as described by Shamblin. In many studies a cut-off size of four centimeters to classify between type I and type II or III tumors， because a correlation is known to exist between larger tumors， and neurologic damage .\n\n【38】Arya et al.  proposed pre-operative criteria to predict the Shamblin classification of CBTs on imaging by measuring the angle of contact from the center of the ICA to tumoral-edge as an assessment of vascular encasement. They defined type I：less than or equal to 180°； type II： greater than 180° and less than 270； and type III： greater than or equal to 270°. The degree of circumference of contact of the tumor with the external carotid artery or common carotid artery was not incorporated in this classification .\n\n【39】Recently in 2017， a new article stated that distance to the base of the skull is more predictive for cranial nerve lesion and the amount of perioperative blood loss than tumor volume， whereas tumor volume is significant correlated with blood loss alone .\n\n【40】Conclusion\n\n【41】A carotid body tumor is a rare neuroendocrine tumor located at the carotid bifurcation. They are mostly benign but are often linked with a genetic syndrome. Therefore， genetic testing is advised in every patient presenting with a CBT. Malignancy cannot be confirmed by histopathological investigation， but can only be proven by metastasis into other tissue organs.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:57:53", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:58:19", "cost": 26.357}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:43", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:58:20", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:57:53"}

This study aims to report a Kinsbourne syndrome in a 3 year-old-child and a literature review focused on the diagnosis and therapy alternatives. This report emphasizes the need for neurologists and pediatricians to suspect the hypothesis of an indolent neuroblastoma in patients presenting OMAS with no neuroimaging study changes. The high association with neuroblastoma is reported and should not be excluded even if a first investigation is negative. The patients high percentage with neurocognitive sequelae and permanent deficits is a challenge in the search for new and more aggressive treatment options.\n\n【2】Keywords： Kinsbourne syndrome； Neuroblastoma； Opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】The opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome (OMAS) also known as Kinsbourne syndrome can occur as a single neurological event in children with paraneoplastic syndrome in a low degree neuroblastoma. The syndrome occurs most frequently in young children-3to 6 years old-and accounts for 2 to 3% of children with neuroblastoma，with an estimated incidence of 1：5 million. It is presented with rapid，irregular， involuntary，horizontal and vertical eye movements and there is no intersaccadic interval (opsoclonus)， myoclonus， irritability and cerebellar ataxia .\n\n【5】Fifty percent of patients have an indolent neuroblastoma . This syndrome manifests itself in small tumors (stage I or II) with favorable histology and without N-myc gene amplification. These tumors rarely recur after resection and the survival is higher than children who do not have neurologic manifestations. Other causes would be idiopathic， associated with viral infections， metabolic and autoimmune diseases .\n\n【6】It is accepted that the neurological paraneoplastic syndrome occurs when there are similar antigens between tumor cells and neurons . Despite treatment with corticosteroids， corticotropin(ACTH) and intravenous immunoglobulin， many children with ataxia maintain a residual deficit even after the tumor resection and in some cases there may be severe cognitive deficits as OMAS sequel .\n\n【7】This report aims to describe the case of a 3-year-old child who presented OMAS as the unique manifestation of an indolent neuroblastoma， focusing in the diagnostic and therapeutic update.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 3 years old， female， was presented to the pediatric neurologist with these symptoms for 3months： dysarthria when irritated， opsoclonus， gait ataxia， trunk and head pole， dysmetria and diadochokinesia and no previous diagnosis in her origin city. The patient was born at term， weighted 3450 grams. The family history without change. A neurodevelopment was held on her head when she was 4 months old， sat with 6 months， walked with 1 year and 20 days， she spoke her first words with 9 months.A MRI brain and cerebrospinal fluid was performed with no alteration. An electroencephalogram showed a background activity revealing slow-wave outbreaks in the widespread projection with unspecific aetiological nature. The laboratory tests to Vitamin D， B12， B6， E， LDH and ferritin were normal. The vanillylmandelic acid in urine was 2.5 mg / 24 hours(normal value from 2.0 to 14 mg/24 hours).\n\n【10】The abdominal ultrasound was normal but a CT scan was also performed and it revealed expansive adrenal disease on the right measuring 29x 14x21 mm W with hyperdense image suggesting calcification . The chest CT was without lesions.\n\n【11】With the presumptive neuroblastoma diagnosis， the patient S1S， underwent a right adrenalectomy. The procedure was uneventful. The histopathologic analysis was consistent with adrenal neuroblastoma with low mitotic index -less than 4%-(Stage I). The myelogram and bone marrow biopsy were without alteration. The N-myc gene was negative. In the postoperative period an intravenous immunoglobulin use was started with a good response， discreet permanent ataxia and periods of aggression.\n\n【12】After ten months of clinical follow up with no medication use， a new febrile episode with opsoclonus and ataxia without tumor recurrence was presented . Immunoglobulin was restarted at a dose of 0.4 mg / kg / day for 5 days and dexamethasone 0.33 mg/kg/ day. She was discharged in use of oral steroid (prednisone 1 mg/kg / day). She remains in follow up with the pediatric oncology and has presented no symptoms so far， without new acute crisis episodes tor one year.\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】In order to diagnose OMAS thepresence ofat least three out of four criteria is needed： opsoclonus， ataxia and / or myoclonus，behavioral disorders and neuroblastoma . Neuroblastomas associated with OMAS are generally small， well differentiated， localized and less than 10% are metastatic. It is usually associated with high survival rate when compared to similar tumors in children without symptoms associated with OMAS .\n\n【15】Aguilera et al. ， reported that Kinsbourne syndrome may precede in months to years the appearance of tumors of the neural crest， so there must be suspicion in order to perform radiological investigation. First line exams are chest X-ray and abdominal ultrasound. Ifnormal，the investigation must proceed with abdominal CT scan or MRI as in the present case . OMAS syndrome may occur several months before any biochemical evidence or tumor Nuclear medicine studies， preferably 123I-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy examination， are essential during the initial phase to establish diagnosis and to search for distant metastasis， particularly bone metastasis. Alternatively， I3I-MIBG or technetium 99m (TC) methyldiphosphonate scintigraphy may be used for the same purpose. Nuclear medicine studies are also used to follow response to therapy. Follow-up imaging is required to assess for residual tumor after surgery， response to chemotherapy， to decide possible operability， to assess tumor recurrence， and to search for distant metastasis .\n\n【16】Olbere et al.  reported the delay to diagnose neuroblastoma with a median of three months， as in this case， due to the unique neurological manifestation prior to chest or abdominal radiological symptoms and investigation.\n\n【17】The presence of autoantibodies to neurons and Purkinje cells can be detected. Some of these autoantibodies can be recognized and establish specifically the neuronal surface antigens and intracellular neuroblastoma cell lines， inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis. Thus， it is speculated that the neuroblastoma may spontaneously regress before the detection of opsomioclonus .\n\n【18】Due to the suspicion of the immune pathogenesis， the treatment is based in corticosteroids and in immunomodulatory therapy such as cyclophosphamide， azathioprine and plasmapheresis. Some recent studies cite rituximab in patients refractory to previous treatments. Tumor resection can improve the acute symptoms for a short period but most require immunosuppressive treatment. Reccurency is frequent due to discontinuation of treatment or environmental triggers， as shown in the case . Therapies with corticosteroids or adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) are beneficial to control the neurological symptoms in recurrent forms of the disease and are usually the first treatment option. In some cases maintenance therapy is needed for several months as happened to our patient that after the second exacerbation crisis was discharged using oral corticosteroids therapy . Table 1 shows options in therapeutic management OMAS.\n\n【19】In 70-80% of cases patients remain with neuropsychological sequelae，regardless ofwhether associated or not with neuroblastomas. The motor and cognitive consequences are the main difficulty in these patients management . Only a minority of children have a monophasic course and better prognosis . Manifestation as behavioral disorders， cognitive， language and learning， sleep disorders and psychiatric problems of order are commom.\n\n| Table 1： Options in therapeutic management OMAS.  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Drug  | Dose  | Duration  |\n| Prednisone  | 2 mg/kg/day  | 2-3 months and reduces the dose and keeps 9-12 months  |\n| Dexamethasone  | Pulsetherapy 20 mg/m²  | 3 consecutive days， minimum 6 pulsetherapy with interval 28 days  |\n| ACTH gel (IM)  | 75 UI/m2 2x/ day75 UI/m² 1x/ day40 UI/m2/ day  | First week Second weekTwo months Monthly  |\n| ACTH gel (IM)  | 40 UI/m2/ day Reduce monthly in 5 Ul/m² Final dose 5 Ul/m²  | First week Second weekTwo months Monthly  |\n| Immunoglobulin (gG IV)  | 2 g/kg induction 1 g/kg maintenance  | Monthly  |\n| Cyclophosphamide  | 1-5 mg/kg  |  |\n| Rituximab  | 375 mg/m2  | 1x/week for 4 consecutive weeks  |\n| Others options： plasmapheresis and azathioprine  |  |  |\n\n【21】Earlytreatment with imunosupresormightlead to betterprognosis decreasing the percentage of neuropsychological sequelae. With or without treatment， opsoclonus is usually reverted but minimum eye movement abnormalities， jerky movements during the search may persist even years after treatment. After treatment motor function generaly improves and patients are able to walk individually. This improvement in motor function is slow， however， cognitive disorders in the area are usually permanent. If untreated the motor deficit remains unchanged. Some of them present difficulties in learning and language. Neurological symptoms may fluctuate during treatment with frequent relapses decreases when immunosuppressive treatment or concurrent viral diseases .\n\n【22】Conclusion\n\n【23】This report emphasizes the need for neurologists and pediatricians to suspect the hypothesis of an indolent neuroblastoma in patients presenting OMAS with no changes in brain CT. The high association with neuroblastoma is reported and should not be excluded even if a first investigation is negative.

At that time patient had a small laceration over the left parotid region. A small piece of wood was removed from the wound site by a physician at a primary care Centre and started on oral antibiotics. Two weeks later patient started having purulent discharge from the wound . Patient developed delayed onset weakness over the lower part of face after three weeks of trauma for which a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was ordered by the physician and subsequently referred to our Centre. Clinical examination revealed purulent discharge from the sinus with diffuse induration over left parotid region， which was extending into left side neck as well. Patient had House-Brackmann Grade III lower motor neuron facial palsy involving the buccal and marginal mandibular division of facial nerve on the left side . Oral cavity， neck and otological examination were unremarkable. MRI revealed a linear fluid distended sinus tract in left intra parotid region involving the deep and superficial lobe of parotid reaching up to skin surface. A contrast enhanced computed tomography scan (CT) was done after discussing MRI with the radiologist. CT scan revealed the possibility of a foreign body within the sinus tract .\n\n【8】Patient was then taken up for surgical exploration under general anesthesia. Modified Blair’s incision was made including the sinus tract.Intra-operatively， a piece of wood was found embedded in the parotid parenchyma and was removed into . Cavity was thoroughly irrigated with diluted antibiotic solution and wound was closed over a corrgated rubber drain. Patient made an uneventful recovery and was discharged on oral antibiotics after five days . At four week follow up facial palsy had recovered completely (House Brackmann Grade I) .\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Injuries to salivary glands remain uncommon， with the number one cause being penetrating trauma. Other causes of acute injuries include blunt trauma and blast injuries. Salivary gland injuries are relatively uncommon， only a few large series exist. A great deal of experience comes from injuries sustained during World War II .\n\n【11】Optimal outcome requires early recognition with an adequate evaluation， directing proper management. Athorough history must be obtained whenever possible. Important questions include timing and nature of injury as well as other injuries. Valuable information can be gathered by determining if the patient has been able to eat after sustaining the injury and the effect this has on the salivary tissue. Additionally， if there has been drainage from the wound， the character of this drainage can be suggestive. Examination requires inspection of the gland and surrounding structures while comparing it with the contralateral side for symmetry. Surrounding structures include overlying skin， oral mucosa， and dental structures and complete otological examination is indicated. Electroneurography and electromyography represent a more sophisticated means of evaluation of facial nerve trauma. If degeneration of the facial nerve exceeds 90% on electroneurography and it is within a period of three weeks after the injury，surgical exploration may be indicated. After the three-week period， electromyography may be indicated to determine it a nerve is recovering  . imaging study of choice for trauma to the parotid gland. Both CT coronal and axial provide the best evaluation of the bony structure. Additionally， CT can give excellent soft tissue delineation.\n\n【12】Penetrating injury to the parotid gland， in addition to involving the parenchyma of the gland， also can involve Stensen's duct or the facial nerve. The anterior border of the master muscle is an important land- mark because lacerations posterior to this can injure the duct. Although a superficial or total parotidectomy would eliminate the salivary source， the morbidity in such a compromised bed may outweigh its benefits. When identified， injuries to Stensen's duct should be primarily repaired. Missing a duct injury may lead to the development of a posttraumatic fistula or sialocele.\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】Post traumatic chronic discharging sinus along with facial palsy should be evaluated with a high index of suspicion for retained foreign body. Evaluation with appropriate imaging may guide towards proper surgical planning.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:11:56", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:12:06", "cost": 10.93}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:43", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:12:06", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:11:55"}

On admission， the patient was in moderate-to-severe condition， conscious， verbally responsive， with marked respiratory effort and saturation of about 75% without oxygen therapy， whereas after passive oxygen therapy through a mask with an oxygen reservoir and oxygen flow of 15 l/min， the saturation level maintained at 92% to 94%. A CT pulmonary angiogram showed an approximate involvement of70% of the pulmonary parenchyma， with ground-glass opacities typical of COVID-19， pulmonary embolism was excluded. In laboratory tests： Acute phase protein CRP-228 mg/1 [N<5 mg/l]， procalcitonin PCT 0.27 ng/ml [N<0.5 ng/ml]，leukocytosis 8.12×1000/ul [N 4-10×1000/ul]. As a result of the applied treatment， on the 3 day of hospitalization stabilization was achieved， followed by a gradual improvement of the general condition. A follow-up pulmonary computed tomography was performed， which showed an involvement of about 40% of the pulmonary parenchyma. The patient continued to require passive oxygen therapy， with a lower oxygen demand. However， due to persistent fever episodes， mainly in the evening， and elevated inflammatory parameters， the treatment was empirically supplemented with ceftriaxone administered intravenously at a dosage of 2 g every 24 h. A decrease in inflammatory parameters and improvement of arterial blood gas parameters were observed. On hospitalization day 14， the general condition deteriorated again， dyspnea at rest worsened and the patient required intensified passive oxygen therapy. Pulmonary computed tomography was performed again， which revealed involvement of approx. 60% of the pulmonary parenchyma. After analysis of the CT scans， the different nature of the radiological changes was noted. Apart from visible areas of consolidation of the pulmonary parenchyma， which could indicate either the evolution of previously described ground-glass lesions or bacterial super infection (ceftriaxone antibiotic therapy in progress)-interstitial inflammatory lesions were described， mainly within the lower lobe of the right lung. The radiological picture indicated a suspicion of pneumonia caused by atypical bacteria. Importantly， this type of lesion could be seen in lesser intensity already on the first computed tomography scan， but due to the extent of the lesions typical of COVID-19， it was largely masked and not so obvious. Only after the treatment and resolution of some of the radiological changes caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection， changes that could represent atypical pneumonia were better visible . Material for serological tests was collected blood for determination ofantibodies against Mycoplasma preumoniae，Chlamydophila preumoniae and CMV， and urine for determination of Legionella spp. antigen. The treatment was empirically supplemented with clarithromycin administered intravenously at a dosage of 500 mg every 12 h. A clear correlation was observed between the inclusion of macrolide and a visible improvement in the patient's general condition. The results ofantibodies determination for C. pneumoniae IgG and IgM negative， against CMV-IgM negative， IgG positive， no Legionella spp. antigen was present in urine. Antibodies to M. pneumoniae IgM negative， IgG positive. Another M. pneumoniae antibody test was scheduled in about 14 days， but the patient was discharged from the hospital at his own request in good general condition.\n\n【1】Despite a negative titer of IgM antibodies directed against M. preumoniae， in this case we should consider the possibility of co-infection by this microorganism . The first serological test for atypical infection was performed on day 19 after the first test for SARS-CoV-2 infection and on day 26 after the first symptoms of respiratory tract infection. In this interval， IgM antibody titre may already be negative and the analysis of the dynamics of IgG antibody accumulation is of diagnostic valie.\n\n【2】The diagnosis ofatypical pneumonia in a patient with viral pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection can be challenging for the treating physician. In the era of COVID-19 pandemic and positive results of molecular tests， the physician's attention may focus on the diagnostically confirmed etiological agent ofpneumonia-SARS-CoV-2. A careful analysis of the patient's condition in the course of the disease and consideration of another etiological agent on the basis of comparative diagnostic tests (CT) is very important. The ground-glass radiological changes on computed tomography， which are the characteristic image of COVID-19， often mask a parallel infection caused by atypical bacteria. The localization of lung lesions in atypical pneumonia may be considered as lesions corresponding to a viral infection. In addition， the clinical picture of both diseases partly overlaps， which only makes the correct diagnosis more difficult .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:40:04", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:40:52", "cost": 48.472}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:42", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:40:52", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:40:04"}

PRES is a neuroimaging-based syndrome and is associated with multifocal vasogenic cerebral edema. Patients with PRES are frequently manifested by headache， seizure， encephalopathy， altered mental function， visual loss， etc. We here report a patient who showed persistent neurologic deficits after PRES and was ultimately diagnosed with Autoimmune Encephalitis (AE).\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 37-year-old man visited the Department of NCU in First Affiliated Hospital of Kunming Medical University complaining of a general fatigue for 1 week， aggravated with disturbance of consciousness for 1 day. He had no medical history. When admitted to the hospital， his GCS score was 9 (E4/V1/ M4)，he showed a normal blood pressure， no cervical resistance， increased muscular tension， hyperactivity of tendon reflexes and ankle clonus. At presentation， brain MRI showed bilateral multifocal vasogenic edema especially in his bilateral occipital lobes， which is compatible with PRES . Meanwhile， spot-like microbleeds can be found on SWI mapping . During admission， follow-up MRI at 1 week showed reversed vasogenic edema in both cerebral hemispheres， with decreased microbleeds on SWI . Serum and CSF autoantibody tests using a cell-based immunocytochemistry kit (Shaanxi MYBiotech Co.， Ltd.) showed the presence of anti-Casper 2 antibody with tilter of 1：3.2 in CSF and 1：100 in blood serum. The patient’s CSF profile was otherwise normal (red blood cell 20/pL； white blood cell 1/pL； protein 0.25 g/L； and glucose 4.5 mmol/L) with no evidence of infection. The patient was diagnosed with anti-Casper 2AE. After immunotherapy， his symptoms partly resolved. However， due to economic problem，he didn't perform EEG and EMG. After 3 weeks， he was transferred to local hospital.\n\n【4】Discussion\n\n【5】This case exhibits a rare imaging manifestation of anti-Casper 2 encephalitis which was initially well-matched with PRES and associated vasospasm.Generally，PRES is predicted to be both clinically and radiologically reversible and especially has a good prognosis. One of the major causes of PRES is acute hypertension. Nevertheless， patients with normal BP who accompanied with systemic autoimmune disorders can also perform classic PRES radiologically. Jaeho Kim et al. proposed a case of PRES patient with anti-LGI1 antibody who's MRI showed apparent vasospasm edema. It is presumed that factors such as Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-a) and Interleukin-1 (IL-1)， that lead to PRES can activate the immune system and release other cytokines. These cytokines produce expression of adhesion molecules (vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1)， which cooperate with leukocytes and lead them to produce Reactive Oxygen Species(ROS) and proteases that result in endothelial damage and consequent fluidleakage. TNF-a and IL-1can furthermore stimulate astrocytes to secret Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)， which deteriorates the form of junctions of the brain vasculature. Thus， these cascades result in vasogenic edema. In conclusion， endothelial hypotheses maybe considered the most relevant in PRES patients with autoimmune disorders . Meanwhile， PRES might cause the breakdown of Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) and the disorganization of brain tissue . In this case， it can be either presumed that BBB breakdown could uncover neuronal membrane antigen epitopes， such as Casper 2，and further induce a process of autoimmune inflammatory encephalitis. More experiments should be taken in vitro and in vivo to further test the pathogenesis associated PRES-AE. Clinical observations should also be emphasized when a patient original with PRES neuroradiological features. PRES has been reported in patients with Acute Demyelinating Encephalomyelitis(ADEM)， Multiple Sclerosis (MS)， other systemic autoimmune encephalitis (e.g. Hashimoto's disease， systemic lupus erythematosus， Behcet's disease)， and paraneoplastic encephalitis . In the present case， patient was diagnosed with Casper 2 AE rather than PRES due to the effectiveness of immunotherapy.\n\n【6】In conclusion， AE can mimic PRES radiologically. AE should be further considered when the etiology， clinical manifestations， and course of PRES are atypical. Persistent encephalopathic symptoms， imaging abnormalities in the multiple cortical and subcortical areas， and specifically， autoantibody analysis can be the evidences of AE. Last but not the least， immunotherapy and relevant systemic supportive treatment such as antiepileptic treatment， can lead to a better prognosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:41:09", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:43:00", "cost": 110.255}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:42", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:43:00", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:41:09"}

William’s Syndrome (WS) is a neurodevelopmental， multisystem genetic disorder characterized by distinctive personality traits， facial dysmorphisom(elfin facell) and congenital cardiac defects， of which supravalvular aortic stenosis is the most common lesion found. It is characterized by Congenital Heart Defects (CHD)， Skeletal and renal anomalies， cognitive disorder， social personality disorder and dysmorphic facies. WS is a rare familial multisystem disorder occurring in 1 per 20，000 live births.\n\n【2】Introduction\n\n【3】William’s Syndrome (WS) is a rare but well recognized neurodevelopmental disease affecting the connective tissue and the central nervous system. It also affects cardiovascular system and eye. The syndrome was first described in 1961 by Newzealander JCP Williams . It is caused by deletion of about 26 genes from the long arm of chromosome 7 and it occurs 1 in 7，500 to 1 in20，000 live birth . The underlying molecular mechanism is a submicroscopic chromosomal deletion involving the elastin gene (ELN) at 7q11.23 . It is present at birth and affects boys and girls equally . WS having infantile hypercalcamia， hoarseness of voice， hyperacusis， endocrine abnormalities， growth retardation， orthopedic problems and renal abnormalities may also be associated . Due to variability in the clinical findings， diagnosis is usually made during mid-childhood when the characteristics facial features， cognitive profile and cardiac findings become more apparent . Beuren in 1964 independently described the syndrome noting also typical dental anomalies .\n\n【4】Case Presentation\n\n【5】A 7-years old boy diagnosed Williams Syndromeby clinically with the help ofsome investigations. This boy actually referred from eye hospital for preoperative (Dacrocystorhinostomy/DCR operation) cardiac consultation. The child was having large forehead， small chin， puffiness around the both eyes， nose upturned， long philtrum looks like-elfin faciesll associated with malocclusion of multiple teeth with Dental carries. He was of low IQ as he was in the same class for 3 years with stunted growth， height 125 cm， weight 22 Kg. Precordial examination revealed systolic thrill and systolic murmur (Grade-4/6) in the base of the heart.\n\n【6】His past history was not contributory except for few episodes of respiratorytract infections since childhood. In the other family members， evidence of congenital anomaly or mental retardation was not found. According to primary symptoms， clinical finding such as dysmorphic facies， cognitive disorder and congenital supravalvular aortic stenosis， dental mal-occlusion and eye problem(Lacrimal duct not patent)， WS was the first diagnosis.\n\n【7】Chest X-ray revealed cardiomegaly，  leads ECG shows normal findings. Echocardiogram showed normal chamber size， normal aortic valve leaflet but supravalvular aortic stenosis due to narrowing of ascending aorta (PPG128mmHg) & prolapse of anterior mitral leaflet ， other valvular structure and pulmonary artery were normal. Other laboratory parameter， like Hb%， ESR， Serum Calcium level was normal. We suggest a more attention for evaluating heart murmur in childhood period， especially when the patient has abnormal facial features or mental problem .\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Williams’s syndrome is a rare familial multisystem disorder occurring in 1 per 20，000 live births. It is characterized by congenital heart defects (CHD)， Skeletal and renal anomalies， cognitive disorder， socialpersonality disorder and dysmorphic facies. WS is characterized by the triad， supravalvular aortic stenosis (AS)， mentalretardation and elfin facies. In addition， mild microcephaly， neurologic dysfunction， auditory hyperacusis， narrowing of the peripheral systemic and pulmonary arteries， inguinal hernia， strabismus， epicanthic folds， abnormalities of dental development， high prominent forehead may be present . In addition to typical facial features， patients with WS have a characteristic ebullient personality profile that is classically referred to as the cocktail personality. Patients with WS are hypersocial and garrulous and have a relative verbal strength that belies a mean IQ of 50 to 60 . Patients 50% to 90% meet diagnostic criteria for anxiety disorder， attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder， or phobic disorder . Children with WS are overly social and outgoing， inappropriately friendly to adults and unwary of strangers. Hypercalcemia， which was a prominent features in the report of Bongiovanni et al.，  has been reported to occur in up to 50% of patients with WS but this usually resolves without intervention in the first two years . WS babies typically have a low birth weight and are often diagnosed as failing to thrive. Cardiovascular defects are the most common cause of death in patients with WS . Structural cardiovascular abnormalities occur in about 80% of all WS patients and are present in up to 93% of WS patients presenting in the first year of life . Although a number of cardiovascular abnormalities are common to WS， the majority consist of some form arterial stenosis. Three anatomical types of supravalvular AS are recognized. The most common is the hourglass type， in which marked thickening and disorganization ofthe aortic media produce a constricting annular ridge at the superior margin of the sinuses of Valsalva. Uniform hypoplasia of the ascending aorta characterizes the hypoplastic type. Genetic studies suggest that the familial anomaly is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait with variable expression. The typical appearance is similar to the elfin facies observed in the severe form of idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia .\n\n【10】Williams Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder-so rare， in fact， that few people have ever heard of it. Special care needs to be taken when children with WS are given anesthesia. Little babies will come up to you， they will stare into your face and it will be hard to actually disengage from that stare explained Helen Tager-Flusberg whose lab at Boston University studies the social behavior of children with WS. Genetic diagnosis is confirmed by micro-array analysis& also by the Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization (FISH) test. Multi-specialty approach is needed. WS cannot be cured， but the ensuing symptoms， developmental delays，learning problems & behaviors can be treated. Correction of cardiac defects， cognitive behavior therapy， avoidance of extra Calcium & Vitamin D these are the treatment options.\n\n【11】Conclusion\n\n【12】We present a particular case of Williams Syndrome with low IQ， congenital supravalvular aortic stenosis， stunted growth， eye problems， defective dental enamel and mal-occlusion of multiple teeth. More than 99% ofindividuals with the clinical diagnosis of WS have this contigous gene delation， detected by FISH.\n\n【13】We should keep in mind and give more attention for evaluating heart murmur in childhood，especiallywhen the patient has abnormal facial dysmorphisom or mental retardation.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:54:09", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:54:15", "cost": 6.102}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:42", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:54:16", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:54:09"}

A rupture of the quadriceps tendon will directly impact biomechanics， necessitating a surgical repair to restore function. Although uncommon， we present a case of chronic quadriceps tendon rupture in a 19 year old patient secondary to a Parkour injury. Various augmentative surgical methods have been proposed to fix chronic and retracted quadriceps tendon but have shown variable results in literature. We propose a surgical technique involving allograft augmentative weaving with application of suture anchors and Krakow sutures for fixation to aid in biomechanical superiority. Our surgical technique is easily reproducible and has shown excellent mid-term outcomes in a young patient with high physical demand.\n\n【2】Keywords： Chronic quadriceps tear； Tendon augmentation； Allograft reinforcement； Extensor mechanism repair； Basket weave technique； Allograft weave repain\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】The ‘four headed quadriceps femoris is a critical component in the lower limb extensor mechanism and any disruption in its structure will have direct impact on knee joint biomechanics and function. In comparison to patella tendon injuries， quadriceps injuries are less frequent and occur in a relatively older， middle-aged cohort . Acute traumatic quadriceps ruptures are usually the result of strong eccentric quadriceps contractions  generating forces above the tendon's inherent ultimate tensile stress. A traumatic or low energy ruptures occur in tendons with underlying microarchitecture degeneration， fatty infiltration， or cystic changes， rendering the tendon susceptible to failures at muchlower stress levels . Often these patients have concomitant endocrinopathies， renal disease， inflammatory pathologies or on long-term steroid use .\n\n【5】In an acute rupture， the presence of fresh tendon ends makes direct surgical repair less challenging， with standard practice performing direct apposition using non-absorbable sutures and patellar drill holes . In chronic rupture where more than three weeks have passed from injury to intervention， chronic inflammatory response alters both the macro and micro architecture of the tendon with infiltration of monocytes， fibroblast， and adipose cells， resulting in tendon ends which are shortened and contracted with gaps up to 5 cm . A durable surgical repair in this situation requires employment of additional techniques such as tendon lengthening， V-shaped tendon flap reinforcement or graft augmentation . As chronic quadriceps repairs are rare， data on these techniques is limited to case reports and small series. In this case report we describe our modified technique utilizing a suture anchor repair augmented with allograft reconstruction in a young patient with neglected chronic quadriceps rupture.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A 19-yrs-old male presented to our clinic with a neglected chronic 4-year history of left anterior knee pain. Prior to symptom onset， he regularly played Parkour， a sport involving frequent high impact landings in precarious positions. He subsequently was forced to stop playing the sport due to increasing knee pain and weakness but did not seek treatment. He only sought medical treatmen1during his mandatory national service enlistment in the army， where his knee symptoms were limiting his physical training.\n\n【8】Upon our examination， wasting ofthe left quadriceps muscles was noted. Pain was maximal on palpation at the quadriceps insertion at the superior pole of the patella. Although the passive range of motion was intact， knee extension power was reduced at 4/5 (MRC grade) with an extensor lag of 20 degrees.\n\n【9】Radiographs showed chronic intra-tendinous calcifications at the superior patella pole. MRI scan of the knee showed edema and swelling of the quadriceps insertion at the superior patella pole， with no acute tear. Overall impression was of left knee quadriceps chronic tendinopathy and the patient was started on physiotherapy.\n\n【10】The patient presented late with worsening pain and new onset inability to extend his knee of 6 weeks duration. The patient denied new traumatic events to the knee. Knee examination revealeda mild effusion with a palpable gap in the extensor mechanism at the quadriceps insertion to the patella. There was a “knee drop” with complete loss of extensor mechanism and the patient was unable to perform or maintain a straight leg raise. Radiographs revealed a patella baja and an urgent MRI showed high grade tear of the distal quadriceps tendon .\n\n| A B C Allograft Krakow 5mm(Fibertape) Reamer D E F Suture Anchor Allograft inBasketWeave FiberwireTechnique Figure 3： (A) Retracted patella tendon with removal of unhealthy tendon tillhealthy bleeding tissues.

The rest of the knee was unremarkable with intact cruciate ligaments， cartilage and menisci.\n\n【13】A diagnosis of chronic (>3 weeks) quadriceps rupture was made and the patient underwent surgical reconstruction. Given the chronic nature of the injury with long standing history of background tendinopathy， an allograft reconstruction using a modified basket weave technique was performed to augment the surgical repair with suture anchors.\n\n【14】Next， we turned our attention to open reconstruction of the quadriceps tendon. A midline incision was utilized with exposure down to the ruptured tendon. The patella tendon was checked to be intact. Unhealthy quadriceps tendon was removed till healthy bleeding tissue ； the superior patella bone surface was freshened with a rongeur till healthy bleeding bone surfaces.\n\n【15】Surgical Technique\n\n【16】Following a combination of general and regional anesthesia， an arthroscopic assessment of the knee joint was first undertaken. The quadriceps tendon insertion visualized intra-articularly was thinned out and unhealthy looking with evidence of fatty infiltration (Figure Next， fiber tape sutures (4 cores) were passed across the proximal quadriceps muscular tendon junction in Krackow  locking configuration . Then， a guide wire was drilled horizontally in the superior half of the patella and over-reamed with a 5 mm reamer . A 5 mm × 280 mm peroneal tendon allograft was then threaded through the bone tunnel . Care was taken to place this tunnel distally enough to avoid the suture anchors pre-morbid status of 0°C to 140°C.\n\n【17】Discussion required later. The tendon was then pulled down to its attachment on the patella and anchored down to bone using two PEEK Swivelock suture anchors 4.75 mmx19.1 mm (Arthrex， Inc.，Naples，FL，USA)， taking care to avoid the horizontal bone tunnel and in an oblique trajectory to increase pull out strength.\n\n【18】We describe a rare presentation of a chronic quadriceps tendon rupture on background of a long history of tendinopathy in a previously young patient involved in Parkour. The patient presented with progressive knee weakness and extensor lag before subsequent loss of extensor mechanism over a protracted period of time. Such delayed presentations are rare in developed countries.\n\n【19】Using a “basket weave technique\"， each end of the allograft was weaved in and out of the quadriceps with as many passes as possible with a trocar needle before the ends were tied together . Further augmentation was performed unitizing the weave and quadriceps with fiberwire . Post repair and reconstruction， the quadriceps tendon tension was noted to be re-established and patella height was restored. On-table passive flexion up to 80 degrees was achieved without gaping of the construct .\n\n【20】Outcomes\n\n【21】Post-operatively， the knee was immobilized in extension for one month with non-weight bearing restriction in a back slab. After which， a knee brace was utilized for controlled range of motion. The range was increased at 30-degree increments at every 2 weeks. Brace was removed at 3-months post-surgery.\n\n【22】Chronic quadriceps tendon rupture is an uncommon pathology with inferior outcomes in comparison to its acute injury counterpart. There is limited data on the outcomes of surgical management of chronic repairs. Carlos Scuderi in 1958  reported a reinforcement technique for contracted tendon ends using a partial 1/3V-shaped tendon flap inverted on the proximal end to approximate the torn ends of the quadriceps tendon. In his series of 18 patients he reported excellent result in 11 cases with complete return to function and minimal extension lag . This procedure has been traditionally supplemented  with Codivilla tendon lengthening technique  which provides further length to the repair procedure. However more recent data on these repair procedures appears less promising with Rao et al. reporting satisfactory results in less than half of his repair cohort. Failures and inferior outcomes were also noted in cohorts studied by Rougraff et al.  and Rehman et al.\n\n【23】At 6-months post-operatively， the patient had recovered to full power in all aspects of movement and knee ROM was 0°C to 90°C. At 16-months post-op the patient was asymptomatic and was participating in highly activity sports with knee ROM back to Main drawbacks with these traditional repair approaches is the disruption of the native tendon architecture when creating flaps， which further undermines collagen integrity and impacts healing potential . Modified Pulvertafttechnique  is a more recent repair technique which involves graft augmentation using intraosseous semitendinosus autograft passage across the patella and then weaving the graft across the quadriceps tendon. Promising outcomes were reported 3-months post op， where patient had full active knee extension. This technique retains the original fiber orientation of the quadriceps tendon as compared to traditional methods， and presence of graft directly increases the total concentration of collagen at the site of recovery， potentially increasing speed and quality of recovery of the quadriceps tendon .\n\n【24】In our technique， a modified Pulvertaft weave with allograft was utilized to augment our suture anchor repair. The use of suture anchors confers several advantages in this technique. Firstly， approximating the quadriceps tendon to the bone with good tension was efficiently and accurately done with suture anchors . Secondly， the use of suture anchors obviates the need to drill full length transosseous tunnels which may increase risk of bone fracture for the repair . Furthermore， short suture anchors crucially allow the separate drilling of ahorizontal bone tunnel for graft passage and augmentation. This would not be feasible with full length tunnels in the usual transosseous repair of quadriceps tears .\n\n【25】The subsequent use of allograft augmentation with a bone tunnel and weave technique allows bioaugmentation and integration . It substantially increases the tensile strength of the entire construct post repair and was further supplemented with fiber wire sutures. This allows the surgeon to confidently accelerate rehabilitation post-surgery.\n\n【26】This patient had excellent outcome post-surgery with this modified pulvertaft weave reconstruction technique with suture anchor repair. He was able to regain full range of motion， full muscle power at 6 months post op and resume high impact/velocity activities at 16 months post-op. ideally a larger series with a longer follow up will provide a more information and validate the efficacy of this surgical technique. However as mentioned， it is increasingly rare now to see neglected cases in developed countries for us to have a large case series.\n\n【27】Conclusion\n\n【28】Allograftaaugmentedrepair tforchronicCquadrupture， supplemented with the use of suture anchor and FiberTape has delivered excellent mid-term outcome in a young high demand patient.

Absence of dystrophin protein in skeletal and cardiac tissue results in contractile protein degradation， fibrosis， and apoptosis . It affects 1 in 5，000 live male births， with approximately 20，000 new cases worldwide yearly .\n\n【7】Children usually present with progressive neurological deficit characterized by gait disturbances， speech problems， and proximal muscle weakness. Weakness starts in proximal lower limbs and trunk， later involving upper limbs and distal muscles . The majority are wheelchair-dependant before their teens \n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A 12-year-old boy presented to our ED complaining of crushing central chest pain which started12 h prior， radiating to his back and jaw. A 12-lead ECG showed inferolateral ST-segment elevation with reciprocal changes . He was loaded with Aspirin and administered intravenous morphine.\n\n【10】The patient had a medical background of DMD and was receiving oral prednisolone every other day. He had no known cardiac anomalies and an echocardiogram in 2018 showed a structurally normal heart. There was no history of smoking or recreational drug use. Due to progressive neuromuscular weakness， he became wheelchair-dependant by the age of 10 years.\n\n【11】Clinical examination revealed an overweight male (BMI 24.8kg/m， 95h percentile). His vital signs were normal except a resting tachycardia of 103 beats per minute. The case was discussed with the interventional cardiologist as well as the pediatric cardiologist， the latter based in a network hospital in the same city. Initial cardiac biomarkers were significantly elevated， with Troponin-T result recorded at 7，065 ng/L (reference range 0 ng/L to 14 ng/L) using the Elecsys Troponin T-highly sensitive assay (Roche Diagnostics). The patient was admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit with a differential diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction or acute myocardial injury related to cardiomyopathy. Inflammatory markers and an infection screen were also performed and were negative for any extrinsic infectious etiology for this presentation.\n\n【12】Based on the presentation to ED with crushing chest pain， the ECG changes noted， and the elevated cardiac biomarkers， an initial working diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction was made .\n\n【13】Another differential diagnosis was cardiomyopathy related acute myocardial injury. Cardiomyopathy is more commonly described in DMD. In this case， the cardiomyopathy may have been largely asymptomatic prior to presentation.On attendance in ER， the clinical features were not consistent with heart failure and a structurally normal heart was seen on echocardiography， however it should be noted the absence of typical symptoms of heart failure like dyspnea on exertion and limited exercise tolerance are common in DMD. Furthermore， in early stages， due to restricted LV enlargement， the echocardiogram may appear normal .\n\n【14】A 12-lead ECG in ED showed a sinus rhythm and ST-segment elevation in the inferior and lateral leads of more than 2 mm with corresponding reciprocal changes. Signs of Right Ventricular Hypertrophy (RVH)， i.e.， right axis deviation， dominant R wave lead V1 and dominant S waves in leads V5 and V6  were demonstrated. A 12-lead ECG on day 5 showed the ST-segment elevation had resolved but signs of RVH persisted . We did not have access to a baseline ECG to compare the current attendance's ECG changes with.\n\n【15】The patient was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit for monitoring and medical management for 5 days. He was commenced on Captoprilandhis usualtreatment plan with steroids was continued.\n\n【16】Aechocardiogramm was F performedon admission， which showed depressed LV systolic function with an EF of 45%， mild insufficiency of the aortic valve and no structural anomalies. Cardiac CT angiography of the coronaries was performed the next day and demonstrated normal cardiac anatomy and normal coronary arteries. Unfortunately， our patient did not have Cardiac Magnetic Resonance imaging (CMR) on admission.\n\n【17】Serial troponins were collected on a daily basis which showed a decreasing trend with a troponin level of 1，271 ng/L recorded on the day of discharge. A repeat echocardiogram was done before discharge which showed an improved EF of 58% and normal ventricular systolic function.\n\n【18】At 8 weeks follow up， a repeat echocardiogram was reported showing mildly depressed LV systolic function with an EF of 49%and mild insufficiency of the aortic valve. Troponin-T assay was now recorded at a level of 74.8 ng/L. The patient was commenced on Bisoprolol and continues to follow up in clinic.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】Cardiac disease in DMD has been described preclinically as young as in toddlers. By the age of 18， the vast majority of DMD patients have cardiac disease， the commonest being cardiomyopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy is more common followed by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Symptoms are often absent due to restricted physical activity .\n\n【21】Arrhythmias like atrial tachycardias， ventricular tachycardia， andventricular fibrillation have been reported in advanced cardiomyopathy. Sinus tachycardia is the most common arrhythmia observed . Heart blocks are also reported although these are less common. Severe LV dysfunction is a risk factor for arrhythmias and Late Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE)， a marker for myocardial fibrosis， seen on Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging (CMR)， is also associated with a higher risk of arrhythmias .\n\n【22】Abnormal ECG findings are found in 70% of cases including sinus tachycardia， short PR interval， dominant R wave in lead V1， deep Q waves in the inferolateral leads， right ventricular hypertrophy， aberrant conduction， and a prolonged QT interval .\n\n【23】Cardiac biomarkers can be chronically elevated due to their skeletal muscle origin with cardiac Troponin I (cTnI) being more specific than cardiac Troponin T (cTnT) possibly because it is not expressed in human skeletal muscle and is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease . Furthermore， cut-off levels of troponin for the diagnosis of Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) are not validated in children， and children with DMD. In a case series by Hor et al.  cTnI levels ranged from 31 ng/ml to 62 ng/ml(reference range <0.03 ng/ml). Similarly， ECG criteria for diagnosing acute myocardial infarction are not well-defined or validated in children. Towbin et al.  suggested criteria based on ST-segment and Q wave changes.\n\n【24】Echocardiography has been used for assessment of cardiac wall motion and EF due to it is availability and low cost. It has limitations in being operator-dependent. CT coronary angiography might be a useful tool for assessment if CMR is not readily available. CMR is recommended for screening of disease progression showing hallmark changes in the posterobasal and basal inferiolateral area of the left ventricle . LGE in the subendocardium suggests ischemic injury， whereas subepicardial localization favors myocarditis or an infiltrative disorder . In DMD it is recommended CMR is conducted annually after the age of 10 years.\n\n【25】Hor et al. reported 8 DMD pediatric cases who presented with chest complaints， ST-segment elevation， with elevated troponin levels. In all 8 patients， normal coronary perfusion was confirmed by CT angiography or cardiac catheterization， whereas on CMR， abnormal systolic function was demonstrated . They attributed this to cardiomyopathy disease progression which leads to episodic myocardial injury. Cinteza et al.  described the use of pulsed steroid therapy as a treatment of acute myocardial injury in a symptomatic child with DMD with favourable results. Another paper described an asymptomatic 12-vear-old child with DMD who was diagnosed with acute myocardial injury by ST-segment elevation and elevated cardiac biomarkers. They compared apoptosis and necrosis as mechanisms of cardiac cell death . There are multiple case reports describing myocardial infarction in DMD children aged 10 to13 . One paper described myocardial infarction in a 10-year-old DMD child following physical exertion and another in 13-year- old DMD patients who experienced acute chest pain and had ST-segment elevation on their ECG and high troponin levels .\n\n【26】The principle of pharmacological treatment in DMD is to delay onset of heart failure. Early steroid therapy has a beneficial impact onlung function， LV function， and skeletal muscle. Similarly， uses of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been proven to delay the onset and progression of LV dysfunction .\n\n【27】Once LV dysfunction is established， corticosteroids remain beneficial and are shown to delay establishment of myocardial fibrosis on CMR . ACE inhibitors are recommended first line therapy proven to reduce mortality and hospital admission in DMD patients with heart failure .\n\n【28】Beta blockers have also been shown to be beneficial in DMD as an anti-arrhythmic， improve EF， and reduce detrimental ventricular remodeling . Aldosterone antagonists like Eplerenone have also had a positive impact when started at a younger age， and in addition to ACE inhibitors and beta blockers .\n\n【29】Some anti-arrhythmic drugs can increase skeletal muscle weakness； otherwise their use in DMD patients is similar to non-DMD patients . In patients with end stage heart failure， use of mechanical cardiac support devices is also a feasible option. Similarly non-invasive ventilation is a treatment option for restrictive ventilatory defects resulting from progressive respiratory muscle weakness .\n\n【30】DMD patients can attend ED with many acute problems， respiratory complaints perhaps the commonest. Dyspnea is often mild compared to the severity of disease. Undifferentiated chest pain from cardiac and non-cardiac causes are both likely. Esophagitis and musculoskeletal chest pain， the latter from coughing have been reported. Constipation is also common but thinks of other high-risk conditions first like steroid related ulcer disease. Renal colic is another differential diagnosis when presenting with abdominal pain. They are also prone to back pain from osteoporotic vertebral fractures. Fatigue is also reported possibly attributed to nocturnal hypoventilation， mood disturbances， and advanced cardiomyopathy. Have a low threshold to discuss the care of DMD patients with their parent team， often the neurologists .\n\n【31】It is worth noting that 5% of all myocardial infarctions do not have obstructed coronary arteries， a condition termed ‘Myocardial Infarction with Normal Coronary Arteries (MINOCA). In these cases， sepsis， pulmonary embolism， substance misuse， myocarditis， or oxygen supply-demand mismatch resulting in a type 2 myocardial infarction (e.g. from anemia or thyrotoxicosis) should be excluded. In children， MINOCA from myocarditis has been reported to be associated with Sudden Cardiac Death (SCD) in 5% of cases . Pediatric Kounis syndrome， a hypersensitivity coronary disorder involving mast cells and other inflammatory mediators， has also been reported as an etiology of MINOCA .\n\n【32】In conclusion， our patient with chest pain and ECG changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia was objectively evaluated for CAD. It is plausible our patient had episodic myocardial injury due to myocardial disease progression， the latter being a common cause of morbidity and mortality in DMD patients.\n\n【33】IDMD patients can present to ED with a variety of complaints often chest or cardiac in nature.\n\n【34】Frontline healthcare practitioners should be aware of the high prevalence of cardiomyopathy in these patients which increases with age.\n\n【35】As a rule， be vigilant and discuss these cases early on with their parent team.\n\n【36】Cardiac biomarkers can be chronically elevated in DMD. However， a high level of suspicion coupled with an echocardiogram can assist in the diagnosis of acute myocardial injury in these cases.\n\n【37】Where available， CMR assists in the evaluation of patients with cardiomyopathy related myocardial injury， with characteristic LGE seen.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:09:36", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:10:06", "cost": 30.833}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:42", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:10:06", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:09:35"}

AAM is a slow-growing， locally infiltrating tumor that tends to recur locally but is unlikely to metastasize. To date， surgery is the standard treatment for AAM， although it carries limited success rates. The literature around AAM is also limited.\n\n【2】Case Presentation： We report an unusual case of a 67-year-old woman with an extensive soft-tissue mass in the pelvic and abdominal cavities. We performed complete tumor excision， and a diagnosis of AAM was confirmed via pathology. The mass recurred within 5 months of surgery and grew in size rapidly. A wider tumor excision was performed 8 months after the initial surgery； however， a recurrent mass was again detected during the subsequent follow-up period. Four months after the second resection， the patient underwent 1 cycle of chemotherapy (cisplatin， ifosfamide， and epirubicin) at another hospital； however， the diameter of the mass continued to increase. At our last follow-up visit (15 months after the initial surgery)， the patient was in poor health and had abandoned further treatment.\n\n【3】Conclusion： AAM should be considered in the differential diagnosis of asymptomatic， slow-growing masses in the abdominopelvic cavity. Wide local excision and long-term follow-up are essential for treating AAM.\n\n【4】Keywords： Aggressive angiomyxoma； Mesenchymal tumor； Wide local excision\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Aggressive angiomyxoma (AAM) was first described by Steeper and Rosai in 1983 as a distinct mesenchymal tumor of the pelvis and perineum in women ； it was described as “aggressive”to emphasize the neoplastic nature of the blood vessels and its locallyinfiltrative and recurrent nature.\n\n【7】Fewer than 250 cases of AAM have been reported in the literature， most of which occurred in women . A recent literature review that assessed over 100 cases of AAM calculated a female-to-male incidence ratio of 6.6：1 . Women who develop AAM arepredominantly of childbearing age； the peak incidence is in the fourth decade of life， although the age distribution (ranging from 6 to77 years) is wide . AAM occurs predominantly in the vulvovaginal， perineal， and groin regions； those that occur in men involve analogous sites， including the inguinoscrotal region and perineum Surgical excision is generally recommended for the management of AAM. In 1992， Simo et al.  proposed that curative treatment for AAM should involve wide surgical excision based on precise histopathological diagnoses. Here， we report a rare case of a 67-year-old woman with AAM in the pelvic and abdominal cavities.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】A married 67-year-old woman (gravida 2； para 1) complained of progressive abdominal distension and anorexia. Upon physical examination， her abdomen was soft and distended. Gynecological examination revealed a 200×100×100 mm mass with low mobility and without clear margins. Ultrasonography revealed an irregularly shaped soft-tissue tumor with mixed echogenicity， approximately 195×129×108 mm in size . Computed Tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a huge， hypodense mass in the pelvic and lower abdominal regions with a longitudinal diameter of 190 mm . The patient had a normal menstrual history， no history oftaking drugs， and had not undergone any prior surgical procedures. Surgical exploration revealed a soft， poorly circumscribed mass，approximately 200×150×100mm in size， within the pelvis and abdomen. A spontaneous rupturing of the mass， which produced bloody ascites approximately 200 mL in volume， was also noted. The tumor had adhered to the intestines and the maior omentum， and covered the uterus as well as the adnexa bilaterally. After careful dissection， the uterus and the adnexa appeared to be normal. The surfaces of the liver， spleen， stomach， and appendix were smooth. Owing to the high possibility of a mesenchymal tumor， we performed tumor resection， total abdominal hysterectomy， bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy， and omentectomy. On gross examination， there were large， poorly circumscribed lesions with irregular extensions into the surrounding tissues. Microscopic examination showed the proliferation of small fusiform or star-shaped cells without cytonuclear atypia that were interspersed in a myxoid background enclosing several capillary structures with thin walls. Immunohistochemistry showed that the tumor strongly expressed desmin and moderately expressed vimentin， CD99， CD34， and smooth muscle actin； the tumor was negative for CD117， cytokeratin，estrogen receptor， progesterone receptor， and S100. The diagnosis of AAM was confirmed on pathologic examination. After radical surgery， no further treatment was conducted except for close follow-up.\n\n【10】Five months after surgery， a recurrence of the mass was detected. Ultrasonography revealed a hypoechoic， solid tumor (71x56×42mm) located on the vaginal stump. At the next monthly follow-up， magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed an irregularly shaped tumor in the pelvic cavity， measuring 84 mm in diameter . Eight months after the surgery， the recurrent mass was approximately 204×113×97 mm in size； the mass grew gradually to the point where it severely affected gastrointestinal peristalsis and caused abdominal distention. Hence， the patient underwent a second， wide excision. Surgical exploration found that the tumor in the pelvis and abdomen，200×185×160 mm in size， was gelatinous， poorly circumscribed， and had no capsule. The recurrent tumor had occupied the inter-intestinal space and the vaginal stump. After the second operation， we continued close follow-up. Four months after the second tumor resection， a third recurrent mass developed. Ultrasonography revealed a solid， cyst-like mass in the pelvis and abdomen 294×272×100 mm in size. Following the third recurrence， the patient sought treatment at another hospital， where she was administered a chemotherapy regimen of cisplatin， ifosfamide， and epirubicin for1 cycle. Five months after the second operation， ultrasonography indicated an irregularly shaped mass measuring 409×335×128mm. When she was last seen 15 months after the initial surgery， the patient could barely eat or sleep， and had abandoned treatment.\n\n【11】Discussion\n\n【12】AAM is one of the rarest and perhaps most misdiagnosed types of genital stromal tumors. It is often detected incidentally during physical examinations， owing to its slow growth pattern and lack of symptoms. If they manifest， symptoms may include pelvic fullness and pressure， dysmenorrhea， and changes in bowel and bladder function . No characteristic symptoms of AAM have been identified， making it difficult to diagnose this disease.\n\n【13】The appearance of AAM on CT is variable. It may be a well-defined， homogeneous mass that is hypodense relative to muscle， or may be predominantly cystic with solid components . Characteristic appearances on MRI include hypointensity on T1-weighted images and hyperintensity on T2-weighted images. The“swirl sign\"is characteristic on T2-weighted MRI . With its better soft tissue resolution， MRI is more reliable for the diagnosis of AAM. MRI was performed following the first recurrence of the tumor in our patient to evaluate her condition； however， CT was used during follow-up visits owing to the patient’s financial situation. Given its characteristic features， MRI should be used for delineating the extent of disease， determining eligibility for surgery and clinical follow-up examinations for recurrent tumors if a patient's financial situation allows. On gross examination， AAMs are typically soft， bulky masses. Microscopic examination shows a sparsely cellular tumor composed of pale-to-eosinophilic stroma with numerous haphazardly arranged blood vessels that stand out against a myxoid background. There is no specific immunohistochemistry marker for AAM； however， these tumors are generally positive for vimentin and desmin.\n\n【14】The preferred treatment for AAM is surgery， although achieving negative resection margins is challenging owing to the infiltrative nature of the tumor . It is especially difficult to remove large and deep-seated tumors in the pelvis compared to the small and superficial tumors of the vulva or vagina. To assess the necessity of radical resections， researchers analyzed data from 111 patients with AAM and found no statistical differences in survival according to the time to relapse or resection margin status . Although complete surgical resection should be the preferred aim， incomplete or partial resection is acceptable when significant operative morbidity is anticipated or SPT when the preservation of fertility is required. Our patient experienced recurrence despite wide excision with negative surgical margins； she chose not to undergo a third excision after recurrence and sought chemotherapy at another hospital. Generally， adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy is not a preferred route because of the low mitotic activity of AAM ； however， several cases of tumor recurrence have been treated with radiation therapy resulting in patients achieving relapse-free intervals of 2-3 years . To our knowledge， ours is the first report of chemotherapy used for a patient with AAM； however， it did not provide any curative benefit.\n\n【15】The treatment of recurrences， however， may be challenging and require various therapeutic options to be explored. This is especially true given that no single modality has been proven to be effective . AAM tends to recur after surgical excision despite being a benign and non-invasive tumor； such recurrence can occur at the original site after the initial resection . Recurrence rates range from 25% to47%， and 85% of all recurrences appear within 5 years ofinitial surgery. It is highly recommended that patients with AAM be closely followed by using clinical and imaging tests， particularly MRI. To our knowledge， only 2 cases of metastasis from AAM have been reported in the literature ， suggesting that metastasis is an exceedingly rare event. Because recurrences have been observed 14 vears after the initial diagnosis ， proper management， combined with long-term follow-up， is necessary to identify recurrences of AAM.\n\n【16】Conclusion\n\n【17】AAM should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a painless， soft， slow-growing mass in women. Wide local excision remains the first-line treatment to date. Long-term follow-up and careful monitoring with imaging techniques are required for timely identification of the recurrent tumors and prompt resection. In our patient， chemotherapy did not provide any curative benefit.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:42:16", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:42:28", "cost": 12.442}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:42", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:42:28", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:42:15"}

It complicates approximately 1 in 2226 pregnancies. However， it is becoming increasingly more frequent with the increasing number of cesarean sections performed each year. The recommended approach to treatment is therapeutic termination of pregnancy at the time of recognition. Couples occasionally make the choice to continue with expectant management. There are as few as ten documented cases of CSP and were expectantly managed that resulted in the delivery of a viable neonate. In this article， we present a case of CSP managed expectantly ending in emergency cesarean delivery at 27 weeks gestation. Delivery was complicated by severe postpartum hemorrhage with the need for cesarean hysterectomy. This report suggests the ability to expectantly manage appropriate cesarean scar ectopic pregnancies. However， it also raises several ethical questions. Whether or not we should manage these patients expectantly merely because we can.\n\n【2】Keywords： Cesarean scar pregnancy； Ectopic pregnancy； Expectant management\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Ectopic pregnancy itself complicates approximately 2% of all pregnancies . Risk factors for ectopic pregnancy include a history of ectopic pregnancy， tubal surgery， tubal pathology， previous tuballigation，history of sexually transmitted infections and women with intrauterine contraceptive devices in place . The most common place for an ectopic pregnancy is within the ampulla of the fallopian tube . However，ectopic pregnancies can occur in several other anatomic locations including the adnexa， cervix， myometrium， cesarean scar and abdomen. In this case report， we will examine a case of cesarean scar pregnancy. Little is currentlyknown about the risk factors for cesarean scar pregnancies. Proposed risk factors include number of previous cesarean deliveries， type of hysterotomy closure and indication for cesarean delivery， among many others. The current standard of care for cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy currently is therapeutic termination. Termination can be performed via several different routes. Each with their own set of potential complications. But，are these risks of termination absolutely necessary? Is there a possibility to expectantly manage these pregnancies? This case report will review a cesarean scar pregnancy managed expectantly.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】The patient is a 32-year-old Gravida 5 Para 2022 female whopresentedtoherprimary obstetrician due to positive home pregnancy test and vaginal bleeding. Her medical history is complicated by a history of red cell alloimmunization with anti-E antibodies and Factor V Leiden Heterozygote. Neither child has needed a transfusion for anti-E antibodies， nor has she never had a blood clot as a result of Factor V Leiden Deficiency. The patient’s reported last menstrual period was April. Ultrasound dating at that visit was consistent with her last menstrual period and placed her at 7 weeks and 4 days gestation. Ultrasound identified fetal cardiac activity at 143 beats per minute， a bleed superior to the gestational sac that measures 23 mm x 12 mm x 23 mm in a diameter and implantation near the lower uterine segment near the cesarean scar.\n\n【7】Management and Outcome\n\n【8】Referral to Maternal Fetal Medicine for subsequent evaluation two days later was arranged due to suspicion for cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy. At this time， vaginal bleeding had resolved and the patient had begun prophylactic Aspirin for Factor V Leiden deficiency in anticipation of normal intrauterine pregnancy. Ultrasound evaluation of the fetus was again performed with findings in One week later， the patient returned to the Maternal Fetal Medicine specialist for repeat ultrasonographic evaluation. Images from this appointment are shown in Figure 2. It was now apparent that the patient likely had a Grade I cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy based on the myometrial invasion of the gestational sac. Fetal growth remained appropriate for gestational age. The patient was noted to have at minimum placenta accreted and was counseled ad nauseam about the potential for placenta increta/percreta if she elected to continue her pregnancy. She was again warned of the possibility of uterine rupture and the need for a hysterectomy for significant bleeding. The need for peri-viable or preterm delivery was discussed with the patient if severe hemorrhage were to develop. All thromboprophylaxis was discontinued at this visit due to potential risk of life-threatening hemorrhage. Appropriate follow-up was initiated， and all return precautions were discussed in detail.\n\n【9】At the next ultrasonic evaluation，the fetus continued to have fetal heart tones and appropriate fetal growth. Imaging is shown in Figure. Corticosteroids were discussed and recommended at the cusp of viability. Continued expectant management was requested. At 12weeks' gestation， the patient had a second opinion consultation visit with another Maternal Fetal Medicine provider who reiterated the standard of care and possible outcomes with expectant management of cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy. Images at 13 weeks' gestation are shown in Figure 4. There is concern that the placental tissue has invaded to the level of the uterine serosa without penetration through the serosa and some placental tissue within the cervix. Counseling about the guarded prognosis of this pregnancy was again provided and expectant management was continued.MRI was performed and was consistent with cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy and complete placenta previa. A normal anatomy scan was performed at 16 weeks gestation and is shown in . The patient then transferred care to a provider with access to a 24-h accerta team. Scans were readjusted to four-week intervals with strict precautions to present to the obstetrical triage unit if any bleeding persists. Placenta increta was diagnosed at an ultrasonographic evaluation at 22 weeks' gestation. Steroids were administered at 24 weeks to help accelerate fetal lung maturity. The patient presented to the obstetrical triage unit at 25weeks and 6 days gestation for vaginal bleeding and was admitted for observation. No active bleeding was noted， fetal heart tones were category I and she was discharged after overnight monitoring.\n\n【10】She represented to the obstetrical triage unit at 27 weeks and 4days gestation， again for vaginal bleeding. Bleeding was heavier， yet still minimal. However， fetal heart tones were noted to be category II and unresolved with maternal resuscitative measures； therefore， a decision was made to move forward with cesarean hysterectomy. The Maternal Fetal Medicine team performed the cesarean section. Skin incision was vertical and midline. Classical cesarean section was performed with a transverse fundal incision. Neonate was delivered without difficulty with APGARs of 2/6/8 at 1， 5 and 10 min respectively. The fetus weight was 780 g at time of delivery. Complete placenta previa with invasion into the lower uterine segment was identified. The placenta was left in situ and the hysterotomy was whip stitched closed. Blood loss at completion of the cesarean section was 4000 ml. After closure of the hysterotomy， the Gynecologic Oncology team began the hysterectomy portion of the procedure. The hysterectomy was performed in the standard fashion. Blood loss during the hysterectomy was noted to be an additional 1500ml for a total blood loss of 5500 ml. The patient received five units of packed red blood cells， five units of fresh frozen plasma and one unit of platelets. The fascia was reapproximated with PDS suture. The subcutaneous tissue was reapproximated with 3-0 vicryl suture. The skin was reapproximated with 4-0 monocryl suture. Derma bond was placed over the incision. The patient was unable to be extubated and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring.\n\n【11】She was extubated on the day of surgery. On post-operative day number one， she was transferred back to labor and delivery. Hemoglobin was stable at 110.3 and shee was noted to be hemodynamically stable. She was meeting all post-operative goals by post-operative day number four. Pathologic examination of the uterus reveals a relatively normal appearing cervix that is completely covered by the placenta. The myometrium averages 3.0 cm in thickness. The endometrium is approximately 0.2 cm in thickness. The placenta comprises the entire lower uterine segment without serosal penetration. The placenta contains a subamniotic hemorrhage near the umbilical cord insertion site. The fallopian tubes were grossly normal in appearance.\n\n【12】Discussion\n\n【13】The actual incidence of cesarean scar pregnancies is unknown as there are few documented cases. One study report that cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy complicates 1 in 2226 pregnancies. Several studies have been conducted to potentially identify potential risk factors for cesarean scare pregnancy . Studies have shown that the risk for cesarean scar pregnancy does not correlate to the number of previous cesarean deliveries. Some had proposed that the method of closure may impact the likelihood of cesarean scare pregnancy； however， there is no evidence that supports double vs. single layer closure of the uterus helps prevent cesarean scar pregnancy . It does appear that cesarean section performed on an unlabored lower uterine segment may interrupt proper healing， thus， leading to slightly increased risk of cesarean scar pregnancy. With the increasing number of cesarean sections being performed around the world， the incidence is likely to increase over the next several generations .\n\n【14】Cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy is classified into one of three sub-groups based on ultrasongraphic features at the time of diagnosis， each with its own prognosis. The classification system is shown in Figure 6. Classification is based on the location of the gestational sac and the amount of myometrium remaining . Grade I is defined as the gestational sac penetrating less than half of the myometrium. In grade II cesarean scar ectopic pregnancies， the gestational sac penetrates greater than half the myometrium. In grade III cesarean scar ectopic pregnancies， the gestational sac extends outside the myometrium. Finally， in grade IV cesarean scar ectopic pregnancies， the gestational sac is highly vascular， and the pregnancy is difficult to identify.\n\n【15】The standard of care for cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy currently is therapeutic termination. There are several routes of termination that have been discussed； no one method proves to be superior to the others. As with many diagnoses there are medical， surgical and expectant management options. Medical management is performedwith systemic methotrexate， intragestational methotrexate or intragestational potassium chloride. The dosage for both systemic and intragestational methotrexate is 50 mg/m.A study performed by Kim et al.  showed significantly better results with intragestational methotrexate when compared to systemic methotrexate. Approximately 93% of cesarean scar pregnancies treated with intragestational methotrexate had complete resolution vs. 73% with systemic methotrexate . Medical management alone has been associated with the need for further surgical intervention with b-HCG greater than 6，000 mIU/mL via dilation and curettage or uterine artery embolization . Several surgical interventions have been reported for the treatment of cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy . Surgical intervention leads to a more rapid decline in b-HCG levels than medical management. Surgical procedures for management of cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy include dilation and curettage， hysteroscopic resection， and laparoscopic vs. open wedge resection. Dilation and curettage alone is often complicated by hemorrhage with up to 76% requiring a second intervention and 14%requiring hysterectomy.Hysteroscopic resection is completed with a30 degree hysteroscope using cold resection techniques . Resection of products of conception is completed intact or piecemeal until the myometrium is able to be visualized. Any residual bleeding is then cauterized with electrocautery or balloon tamponade with a foley catheter ballon . Laparoscopic removal of cesarean scar pregnancy involves identification of the cesarean scar. Once identified the scar is incised with monopolar cautery and the gestational sac is removed through one of the trochar sites. The remaining cesarean scar is then removed with monopolar cautery and the defect is repaired in a two layer closure. Hysteroscopic and laparoscopic resection is not recommended for patients with less than three millimeters of myometrium remaining dueto risk ofbladder injury.Laparoscopic and open wedge resection provides the opportunity to repair the lower uterine segment and theoretically reduce the risk for recurrence. Laparotomy is specifically indicated for patients with suspected uterine rupture and hemodynamic instability . Hysterectomy is often indicated if bleeding is unable to be controlled via laparotomy. Very few women have elected for expectant management. In one study， 10 patients elected for expectant management . Of those， four patients delivered viable neonates (40%) and three of those women required hysterectomy at time of delivery (75%).\n\n【16】Conclusion ais case report summarizes expectant management of a rare， cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy. A pregnancy outcome that complicates roughly 1 in 2226 pregnancies. The patients choose this treatment plan and successfully delivered a viable， although very preterm， infant. She overcame the odds as it is documented that approximately only 40% of expectantly managed cesarean scar ectopic pregnancies will go on to deliver viable neonates. Like many of her cohort， she also underwent cesarean hysterectomy as part of her treatment. It can be concluded， based on the grade of cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy， some patients may be a candidate for expectant management with appropriate counseling. Appropriate counseling wouldinclude that of mass hemorrhage， possible invasive placentation， cystectomy，possible need for cystostomy tube placement and need for cesareanhysterectomy. Counseling regarding when to present to the obstetrical triage unit for evaluation is of utmost importance； however， in the end， delivering a viable neonate is a possibility for women with cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy. The real questions comes in the form of medical ethics， specifically， non-maleficence. Just because we have the capability and the means to successful deliver a pregnancy such as the one presented in the case should we“recommend\"it? Should we tell women to carry these pregnancies knowing the potential risks discussed above?", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:42:43", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:42:56", "cost": 13.348}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:42", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:42:56", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:42:42"}

He consulted his general practitioner however both he and the GPthought this mightbe a result of increased workload hours increased workload hours. Subsequently he attended a walk-in centre with the blood pressure at 210/150. He was immediately biopsied and diagnosed with IgA nephropathy. (It was considered the vast majority of his kidney function was destroyed by uncontrolled high blood pressure caused by IgA Nephropathy as opposed to the IgA scarring of the kidneys). IgA nephropathy could have been undiagnosed for many years， as only until very late in its progression and once real function has been serenely impaired are symptoms generally manifest. When his BP was controlled there was stable kidney function (around 30%： Creatinine 250 umol/l， eGFR29 ml/min/1.73 m²) for 5 years. On 5h year of his annual check-up the kidney function was so poor (creatinine： 676 umol/， eGFr <15ml/min/1.73 m). He was placed on the transplant list requiring peritoneal dialysis for 10 weeks before receiving a kidney from his stepfather 2 years ago.\n\n【47】The effect on his body\n\n【48】He had felt perfectly normal until diagnosed with chronic kidney disease which necessitated taking blood pressure medication：Irbesartan 300mg morning， Doxazosin 16mg evening and Simvastatin 40 mg evening\n\n【49】He reported that：\n\n【50】“The medication completely wiped me out fitness wise overnight. I don’t think my body ever quite recovered from having my blood pressure forced low.\n\n【51】The result was that when he tried to exert himself to the same level before he started medication， he felt the blood pressure would not raise enough to sustain the activity. The peritoneal dialysis which he had during the night resulted in pain (drain pain) in the peritoneal space. There were also dietary considerations required to protect the kidneys which would reduce the need for a transplant as long as possible. His work was mainly unaffected but because of the physicality and long hours demanded by the occupation it was hard to differentiate between fatigue caused by the condition and the demands of the job .\n\n【52】Sporting activity prior to transplant\n\n【53】He had played football to a semi-professional standard， training twice a week also playing competitively twice a week. He had played squash， badminton and went skiing both socially and competitively playing Rugby Fives  for England in his teens.\n\n【54】Sporting activity post-transplant\n\n【55】He reports he now plays less football and much more racket sports as did not feel he could reach the level he played at before the transplant which made him feel a bit deflated’by this. Racket sports to him were fresher and he felt he was improving， whereas in football he was declining.\n\n【56】Table 1： Post-transplant medication.\n\n| Mar-19  | Cholecalciferol  | 20000 units monthly oral  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Jan-19  | Irbesartan  | 75 mg nocte oral  |\n| Apr-18  | Adoport (Tacrolimus)  | 1.5 mg nocte oral  |\n| Apr-18  | Adoport (Tacrolimus)  | 2 mg mane oral  |\n| Mar-18  | Irbesartan  | 150 mg od oral  |\n| Aug-17  | Precnisolone  | 5 mg od oral  |\n| Aug-17  | Mycophenolate mofetil  | 750 mg bd oral  |\n| Jul-17  | Aspirin  | 75 mg od oral  |\n| Jul-17  | Omeprazole  | 20 mg od oral  |\n\n【58】Discussion and Reflection\n\n【59】The diagnosis of piriformis syndrome was plausible as this is frequently concluded through exclusion of other causes in those presenting with low back buttock and leg pain . Many other physical tests have been described； however， the sensitivity and specificity of these tests are not conclusive from studies to date . Low back pain is not essential for this diagnosis with the client not presenting with a history or any current low back symptoms. There was external tenderness on palpation which is reported as being present in 92% of reported cases . Aetiology of the syndrome is reported to be through gluteal trauma which the athlete would have no doubt experienced at some point through his football career . Physiotherapy， which he had already received， is considered key for treatment， with a 51.2% cure rate， however there is reported a lack of high-quality studies for these non-invasive approaches .\n\n【60】The present assessment of the athlete utilized the SFMA approach to assess the wider picture and to investigate the cause of the problem rather than treat the symptoms alone as these were reported to settle spontaneously . The SFMA is based on the theory of regional interdependence whereby body regions are considered“musculoskeletally linked”. The SFMA top tier， consists of ten functional movements assessing fundamental movement patterns from which algorithms of impairment-based movement assessment or breakouts are used to determine to causal movement dysfunctions in regions of the system that may be contributing to or causing abnormal patterns. The top tier assessment exposed asymmetry of pelvic rotation with the breakout revealing thoracic SMCD and tibial rotation dysfunction. The tibial rotation could possibly relate to the previous severe ankle injury which the athlete remembered when the area was being assessed. Ankle injuries are common， frequently reoccur and maybe long-term problematic. Although this athlete reported no problems with the ankle and the level at which he was playing football suggests he had good rehabilitation， the acute treatment at that time was unlikely to be based wider objectively identified mechanical and sensor motor impairments  therefore an associated stiffness of this area may have resulted which would also impact upon the deep squat.\n\n【61】The effect of IgA nephropathy， high blood pressure and the subsequent drugs to slow the decline of kidney function would have resulted in deconditioning of the athlete  alongside suggested dietary modifications of low sodium diet before dialysiss and subsequently low potassium low phosphate whilst on dialysis which has effects on diet quality . Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a high-risk factor for sarcopenia which can result in reduced activities of daily living and low quality of life  and with the kidney failure in this situation， resulted in peritoneal dialysis. This is not without compilations， being an invasive procedure through the abdominal cavity . The ultimate kidney failure threatened his life and necessitated a kidney transplant which is another more invasive procedure resulting in inflammation which challenges the already compromised autoimmune system . A kidney transplant is generally accepted as the optimal treatment for kidney failure with improved quality of life， independent from dialysis and increased life expectancy. It should also be considered that the domino effects of IgA and the associated traumatic events would undoubtedly also have a psychological effect for which various coping strategies have been suggested by those undergoing similar experiences . On returning to a normal life’the post-transplant realization of a second opportunity at life may also put pressure on athletes to achieve， not only for themselves but their donor as well . This athlete had a living donor which has better results in terms of graft function and patient survival， however feelings of guilt towards the donor， perceived responsibility to do well and anxiety may have occurred.\n\n【62】The minor biomechanical changes from the tibial rotation may not have impacted significantly on the athletic performance however the peritoneal dialysis， abdominal surgery on that side and general deconditioning may have predisposed to an asymmetry. The working static posture of this client similarly adds asymmetry with the addition of the one-sided loaded of the racquet sports. The asymmetry may be functional adaptation； however， this will have also contributed to the piriformis overload through sporting activity. Overall the information gleaned from the initial assessment would not have changed the treatment approach although the additional information would have enhanced cultural competence of the therapist to maximize the management of this transplant athlete . Understanding the emotional trauma and physical deconditioning from his life-changing experience， his castration of his sporting activities and efforts to return to previous levels  may enable a deeper understanding of their motivation and rationale for competing .\n\n【63】Athletes in competition situations seek therapy that provides instant relief enabling them to continue to compete which is the primary source of this competition therapy service  however at present in the transplant population it is unknown how many athletes return with the same or similar problems and become a new contact in the therapy statistics. Long term， athletes must be supported out of competition to continue and support their return to sport and/injury management. Although following surgery exercises are frequently given to restore muscle control there were none given to this athlete however this would have been a minor consideration alongside the other life-changing experience?\n\n【64】Limitations\n\n【65】This is only a single case study with limited time for assessment in this sporting arena however this is the reality of working at competitive events both at national and international games is. As with all case studies this cannot be applied to all transplant athletes however may provide some insights as to management of this vulnerable population .\n\n【66】Recommendations and future work： followingCorgan transplantation pilates and yoga could be early suggestions for post-op exercise to improve baseline core control. Additionally， before returning to sport a screening for fundamental movement(for example the Fundamental Movement Screen) would identify vulnerable areas for injury . Possibly preventing the onset of chronic overload conditions. Future developments to improve therapy services provided to transplant athletes should consider tracking the injury/problem to provide a clearer indication to the effectiveness of long-term therapy injury management.\n\n【67】Statement ofEthics\n\n【68】In accordance with institutional ethics procedures and guide-lines， ethical approval was granted for this original piece of research.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [{"text": "Statement ofEthics\n\n【68】In accordance with institutional ethics procedures and guide-lines， ethical approval was granted for this original piece of research.", "content": "【0】Abstract\n\n【1】Participant： Male athlete early 30's presenting post-competition at World Transplant Games with reoccurring piriformis syndrome.

Racket sports to him were fresher and he felt he was improving， whereas in football he was declining.\n\n【56】Table 1： Post-transplant medication.\n\n| Mar-19  | Cholecalciferol  | 20000 units monthly oral  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Jan-19  | Irbesartan  | 75 mg nocte oral  |\n| Apr-18  | Adoport (Tacrolimus)  | 1.5 mg nocte oral  |\n| Apr-18  | Adoport (Tacrolimus)  | 2 mg mane oral  |\n| Mar-18  | Irbesartan  | 150 mg od oral  |\n| Aug-17  | Precnisolone  | 5 mg od oral  |\n| Aug-17  | Mycophenolate mofetil  | 750 mg bd oral  |\n| Jul-17  | Aspirin  | 75 mg od oral  |\n| Jul-17  | Omeprazole  | 20 mg od oral  |\n\n【58】Discussion and Reflection\n\n【59】The diagnosis of piriformis syndrome was plausible as this is frequently concluded through exclusion of other causes in those presenting with low back buttock and leg pain . Many other physical tests have been described； however， the sensitivity and specificity of these tests are not conclusive from studies to date . Low back pain is not essential for this diagnosis with the client not presenting with a history or any current low back symptoms. There was external tenderness on palpation which is reported as being present in 92% of reported cases . Aetiology of the syndrome is reported to be through gluteal trauma which the athlete would have no doubt experienced at some point through his football career . Physiotherapy， which he had already received， is considered key for treatment， with a 51.2% cure rate， however there is reported a lack of high-quality studies for these non-invasive approaches .\n\n【60】The present assessment of the athlete utilized the SFMA approach to assess the wider picture and to investigate the cause of the problem rather than treat the symptoms alone as these were reported to settle spontaneously . The SFMA is based on the theory of regional interdependence whereby body regions are considered“musculoskeletally linked”. The SFMA top tier， consists of ten functional movements assessing fundamental movement patterns from which algorithms of impairment-based movement assessment or breakouts are used to determine to causal movement dysfunctions in regions of the system that may be contributing to or causing abnormal patterns. The top tier assessment exposed asymmetry of pelvic rotation with the breakout revealing thoracic SMCD and tibial rotation dysfunction. The tibial rotation could possibly relate to the previous severe ankle injury which the athlete remembered when the area was being assessed. Ankle injuries are common， frequently reoccur and maybe long-term problematic. Although this athlete reported no problems with the ankle and the level at which he was playing football suggests he had good rehabilitation， the acute treatment at that time was unlikely to be based wider objectively identified mechanical and sensor motor impairments  therefore an associated stiffness of this area may have resulted which would also impact upon the deep squat.\n\n【61】The effect of IgA nephropathy， high blood pressure and the subsequent drugs to slow the decline of kidney function would have resulted in deconditioning of the athlete  alongside suggested dietary modifications of low sodium diet before dialysiss and subsequently low potassium low phosphate whilst on dialysis which has effects on diet quality . Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a high-risk factor for sarcopenia which can result in reduced activities of daily living and low quality of life  and with the kidney failure in this situation， resulted in peritoneal dialysis. This is not without compilations， being an invasive procedure through the abdominal cavity . The ultimate kidney failure threatened his life and necessitated a kidney transplant which is another more invasive procedure resulting in inflammation which challenges the already compromised autoimmune system . A kidney transplant is generally accepted as the optimal treatment for kidney failure with improved quality of life， independent from dialysis and increased life expectancy. It should also be considered that the domino effects of IgA and the associated traumatic events would undoubtedly also have a psychological effect for which various coping strategies have been suggested by those undergoing similar experiences . On returning to a normal life’the post-transplant realization of a second opportunity at life may also put pressure on athletes to achieve， not only for themselves but their donor as well . This athlete had a living donor which has better results in terms of graft function and patient survival， however feelings of guilt towards the donor， perceived responsibility to do well and anxiety may have occurred.\n\n【62】The minor biomechanical changes from the tibial rotation may not have impacted significantly on the athletic performance however the peritoneal dialysis， abdominal surgery on that side and general deconditioning may have predisposed to an asymmetry. The working static posture of this client similarly adds asymmetry with the addition of the one-sided loaded of the racquet sports. The asymmetry may be functional adaptation； however， this will have also contributed to the piriformis overload through sporting activity. Overall the information gleaned from the initial assessment would not have changed the treatment approach although the additional information would have enhanced cultural competence of the therapist to maximize the management of this transplant athlete . Understanding the emotional trauma and physical deconditioning from his life-changing experience， his castration of his sporting activities and efforts to return to previous levels  may enable a deeper understanding of their motivation and rationale for competing .\n\n【63】Athletes in competition situations seek therapy that provides instant relief enabling them to continue to compete which is the primary source of this competition therapy service  however at present in the transplant population it is unknown how many athletes return with the same or similar problems and become a new contact in the therapy statistics. Long term， athletes must be supported out of competition to continue and support their return to sport and/injury management. Although following surgery exercises are frequently given to restore muscle control there were none given to this athlete however this would have been a minor consideration alongside the other life-changing experience?\n\n【64】Limitations\n\n【65】This is only a single case study with limited time for assessment in this sporting arena however this is the reality of working at competitive events both at national and international games is. As with all case studies this cannot be applied to all transplant athletes however may provide some insights as to management of this vulnerable population .\n\n【66】Recommendations and future work： followingCorgan transplantation pilates and yoga could be early suggestions for post-op exercise to improve baseline core control. Additionally， before returning to sport a screening for fundamental movement(for example the Fundamental Movement Screen) would identify vulnerable areas for injury . Possibly preventing the onset of chronic overload conditions. Future developments to improve therapy services provided to transplant athletes should consider tracking the injury/problem to provide a clearer indication to the effectiveness of long-term therapy injury management.\n\n【67】Statement ofEthics\n\n【68】In accordance with institutional ethics procedures and guide-lines， ethical approval was granted for this original piece of research.", "index": 15409, "show": true, "start": 15409, "end": 15566, "province": ["文本干净度", "无关文本"], "isEdit": false}], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:20:29", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:20:58", "cost": 29.007}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:42", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:20:59", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:20:29"}

Its diagnosis is clinical，based on essential criteria ofInternational RLS Study Group. It can be idiopathic or associated with various medical and other neurological disorders. Idiopathic RLS can be sporadic or may have a familial inheritance， with several genetic loci reported. RLS has a strong association with Periodic Limb Movements (PLM)，both during sleep and wakefulness. Very few studies of familial RLS/PLM in sleep and their associations have been reported from India. Nocturnal eating is a non-motor manifestation of RLS with several clinical implications. We report an Indian family with RLS and PLMs as well as dysfunctional nocturnal eating\n\n【2】Keywords： Restless leg syndrome； Familial； Nocturnal eating\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】Ever since the Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) was described by Ekbom in 1945 ， it has been noted with a variable age of onset  and to occur in several members of the same family. Nocturnal Eating (NE) and RLS were initially described as separate sleep disorders . However， recent research shows that these disorders may be more related than previously thought. Presently， no family studies of RLS/NE are available from the Indian subcontinent. Here we present a case with this association and review the available literature.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】Our proband， a 56-year-old married female， presented with complaints of paresthesia， restlessness，tingling and crawling sensations in both legs during the evening hours with an urge to move thelegs or walking for relief， along with intermittent rhythmic movements oflimbs on and off for the last 16 years. These movements usually woke her up after about 1 hto 2 h of sleep， requiring her to walk around the house， engage in activities such as emptying clothes out of the cupboard and rearranging the contents to get some relief. The unpleasant sensations were more common during periods of rest and improved by walking and other activities. This clinical history was suggestive of a diagnosis of RLS with PLMs and a nocturnal compulsive behavior. Along with this， for the last 4years， she had been observed to wake up at night to eat excessive amounts of sweet and cookies in spite of having had dinner a few hours ago. On questioning， the patient explained that the urge to eat prevented her from falling asleep and once food was ingested， she could go back to sleep. She also reported loss ofappetite on the following dayand such symptoms occurred 2 to 3 times in a week. She did not have any psychiatric or medical comorbidities nor was she on anylong-term medications. A neurological examination was unremarkable with no evidence of Parkinsonism or peripheral neuropathy. A complete blood count， biochemicalprofile， thyroid function tests， blood sugar， serum cortisol， vitamin B12 and iron studies were normal. Neuroimaging did not reveal any abnormalities of the brain or pituitary. Nerve conduction studies including Sympathetic Skin Response(SSR) were also normal. Vitamin D levels were found to be insufficient and appropriate supplementation was initiated along with dopamine agonist， ropinirole leading to relief in symptoms of both RLS and NE. A detailed family history revealed that the patient had 6 daughters and 1 son， the elder 5 daughters having symptoms suggestive of RLS with a variable age of onset in late twenties to early thirties. IRLS score for the index case was found to be 24. The age of onset of symptoms and the respective IRLS scores of the affected family members were as follows： 33 years & 14， 33 years &14， 31 years & 10，27 years & 9， and 26 years & 9 .\n\n| Table 1： Definition and Diagnastic Criteria for Sleep-Related Eating Disorder.  |\n| --- |\n| A.

PLMS first described by Lugaresi et al.  in which one or both legs contract rhythmically and intermittently during sleep and can be noted in up to 88% of patients with RLS. The prevalence of RLS in the general population varies between 1.2% to15%. It is twice as common in females in comparison with males. Familial RLS was described in the initial series of Ekbom . Since then， increasing number of families with RLS have been reported with significant heterogeneity both in terms of age of onset and clinical presentations even within the same family. The largest collection of complete family study data on RLS was reported from Canada . This case series survey showed that out of 247 fully investigated probands， 192 had RLS aggregation in their respective families with a familial rate of77%. They also noted a variable range of age of onset in familial RLS (28±15 years) with most of the family members having early onset disease and mild to moderate symptoms to start with， similar to our observation. In another study of RLS patients from Germany， 42% showed a “definite” and 12% showed a “possible”positive family history . They also demonstrated an earlier age of onset with a “definite”compared to “negative” family history (35.45years compared to 47.17 years)， with few patients noting symptoms as early as in second decade. The earlier recognition of RLS symptoms in families with hereditary RLS could be one reason for earlier age of onset reported in studies. This association of age of onset with familial and sporadic forms of RLS also supports the opinion that RLS should be divided into early-onset disease with a clear genetic component and late-onset disease with an unclear etiology. Studies have shown familial RLS to have a genetic etiology with linkage studies identifying several loci including chromosome 12q， 14q， 9p， 20p， 2q， 16p . However， the data from Indian subcontinent is lacking on the same. RLS is associated with non-motor phenomena as well， such as mood and anxiety disorders as well as other nocturnal compulsions like nocturnal smoking that interfere with sleep . However， as noted in our patient，there is some evidence supporting an association between eating disorders and RLS. “They often have to get up and walk， like a caged bear， to quote one of my patients， or they go into the kitchen and get something to eat”-Karl-Axel Ekbom， Neurology. This interesting association of RLS and NE was noted by Ekbom himself in his original series  and later conclusively established by researchers who studied this aspect in detail. NE in RLS can be attributed to several reasonsDrug-related especially zolpidem which is usually co-prescribed for patients with RLS who have insomnia or fragmented sleep.\n\n【13】A behavioral response to reclaim lost sleep and to tide over the disturbing interludes of fragmented sleep and unpleasant leg sensations.\n\n【14】Sleep Related Eating Disorder (SRED) in which there is a certain compulsion to eat where patient is not fully aware of the act and further becomes amnesic of the event. The ICSD-2 criteria .\n\n【15】NE syndrome in which there is a predilection to eat during the night more succinctly described as a circadian phase shift in eating behavior. Although the distinction from SRED is vague， the patient here is fully conscious during the episodes. Diagnostic criteria for SRED was proposed by Birketvedt et al.  .\n\n【16】In a case control study， which examined 100 subjects with RLS with a mean age of 41.7±16.2 years and IRLS score of 14.2± 10.2，33% of them had documented SRED . They also observed a high incidence of obsessive-compulsive behavior in RLS subjects as opposed to controls， which is the probable psychopathological substrate for the eating disorder. A subgroup analysis failed to demonstrate any significant clinical or demographic differences in the profiles of RLS patients with and without SRED. In our report the patient had an unequivocal and invariable urge to eat 2 to 3 times a week. These episodes were associated with other forms of compulsive behavior like arranging her wardrobe. Except for morning anorexia， other cardinal features of SRED were lacking. There was no prior consistent use of zolpidem or dopaminergics to implicate them. So， are these NE episodes merely a method of \"killing time? In a study that explored this question， 88 patients with RLS and 42 patients with insomnia were interviewed elaborately . They found that61% of patients with RLS had NE while only 12% of insomnia subjects reported such behavior. SRED was exclusively found in the RLS group. Patients with RLS who had NE had more pronounced nocturnal awakenings than those without NE， but the insomnia group despite having a higher incidence of nocturnal awakenings had lesser incidence of NE. Furthermore， the RLS patients reported that they felt an urge to eat， the realization of which enabled them to return to sleep. In conclusion， NE should be regarded as a specific type of compulsive behavior， which can be classified as a non-motor manifestation of RLS， and the diagnosis of SRED should be made only when the diagnostic criteria for the same are met.\n\n【17】Conclusion\n\n【18】We report a unique Indian family with RLS with variable age of onset in those affected， and PLMs and dysfunctional NE noted in the proband. A detailed history of these associations in family members of patients with RLS/PLMs should hence be carefully sought. Early recognition and treatment of these disorders and their correlates can markedly improve the quality oflife in these patients.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:35:40", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:36:08", "cost": 27.637}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:42", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:36:07", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:35:39"}

Placental and autopsy investigations confirmed in-utero transmission of disseminated congenital HSV-2 infection without any maternal history of HSV.\n\n【2】Keywords： Congenital HSV； Extreme prematurity； Hydops-fetalis\n\n【3】Case Presentation\n\n【4】An extremely premature male infant was born at 25 weeks gestation by an emergency cesarean section due to fetal distress. The mother was a 23-year-old primigravida. Her prenatal laboratory tests were negative for any sexually transmitted infection including syphilis， gonorrhea， chlamydia， human immunodeficiency virus， and group B Streptococcus. She was immune to rubella. She had no current or past history of genital or oral Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection.\n\n【5】At 17 weeks of pregnancy，the mother was admitted with vaginalleakage of dark amniotic fluid followed by fever (38.9 Co). She was treated with antibiotics including ampicillin，clindamycin， and azithromycin for chorioamnionitis and threatened loss of pregnancy. Expectant management was successful as pregnancy progressed without further leakage of amniotic fluid to 25-week gestation. Mother reported decreased fetal movements during her clinic visit at 25-week of gestation. She was admitted to the hospital for fetal monitoring. She was not in preterm labor and membranes of amniotic sac were intact. Fetal biophysical profile of 3 out of total 10 (1 for heart rate， 2 for amniotic fluid)， indicative of poor fetal well-being prompting delivery by an emergency cesarean section. Membranes were ruptured in operation room at delivery. Apgar scores were l and 3 at 1 and 5min， respectively. Infant required resuscitation at birth with endotracheal intubation， mechanical ventilation，external cardiac compressions and administration of epinephrine.\n\n【6】At birth， the infant appeared hydropic with generalized body-wall edema， protuberant， firm abdomen due to severe hepatosplenomegaly with liver margin reaching 2 cm above the pelvic brim and ascites. The infant was large for gestational age with a birth weight of 1，090 gm primarily because of diffuse edema. Soon after birth， diffuse bullae developed over extensive areas of the skin covering the face， arms， chest， and abdomen that progressed to diffuse sloughing of the skin . These quickly became hemorrhagic. By four hours of life， the infant developed profuse bleeding from the endotracheal tube， orogastric tube and insertion sites of umbilical catheters. Laboratory tests showed disseminated coagulopathy that was treated promptly with infusions of fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate followed by platelet transfusion for thrombocytopenia. Continuous infusion of dopamine and dobutamine were administered to treat hypotension. Broad spectrum antibiotics including ampicillin and gentamicin were administered for suspected sepsis. In view of infant's critical condition， empiric antiviral medication， acyclovir (15 mg/kg/dose divided every12 h) was added despite negative maternal history for HSV. Ancillary laboratory studies revealed thrombocytopenia (platelet count =30，000/mm’)， leukocytosis (white blood cell count =81，600/mm)，and high concentrations of serum transaminases (Aspartate Transaminase，AST>10，000U/L， Alanine Transaminase，ALT=972U/L). Bacterial cultures of blood and fluid specimen from dermal bullae were negative. However， HSV-2 was detected by Polymerase Chain Reaction test (PCR) in specimens obtained from blood， mouth，hemorrhagic skin bullae， rectum and placenta. Despite all supportive treatment， infant did not survive beyond the first day of life.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】HSV infection in neonates has devastating consequences with high mortality and morbidity despite treatment with acyclovir . Advances in medicine have reduced neonatal mortality rates in disseminated HSV infection from 85% to 29% and in isolated central nervous system disease， from 50% to 4% . Primary infection during pregnancy is more severe than in the non-pregnant state with a greater risk of infecting fetus (50%) with primary infection than with recurrent infection (<3%).\n\n【9】Vertical transmission from mother to the neonate can occur in-utero (5%)， during perinatal (85%) or during postnatal period(10%). Ascending infection along the birth canal in the presence of rupture of membranes from active genital lesions is an important mode of transmission . Mother in our case did not experience any genital lesions during the pregnancy or around the time of birth. The epidemiological data do support that 70% of congenital HSV infection cases present with no preceding maternal history of HSV. Furthermore，congenital HSV in extremepremature infants， as in our case， can present in non-classical manner with atypical presentation.\n\n【10】It was unusual in our case that although there was vaginal leakage of two-day duration at 17 wk. of gestation， subsequent fetal ultrasounds indicated that ruptured membranes had sealed with re-accumulation of amniotic fluid. Amniotic membranes remained intact from 17 wk. onwards until theywere ruptured artificially during cesarean section. Amniotic fluid was light yellowish to dark brown in color reflecting in-utero infection. As is usual practice， in most of these cases， includingours，appropriate antibiotics were administered to mother following prolonged vaginal leakage of amniotic fluid at17 wk. of gestation but she was not screened for HSV at that time. Clearly antibiotics can only be beneficial if the intrauterine infection is of bacterial origin. As reported recently， microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity can occur due to microorganisms other than bacteria where viral infection can play a role in pregnancy loss or early neonatal death . We believe that in our case， HSV was inoculated into feto-placental unit at 17-wk. of age when the mother experienced amniotic fluid leakage. Although pregnancy progressed subsequently in asymptomatic manner， congenital viral infection reactivated when the mother began experiencing decreased fetal movements. As described in literature ， this assertion is further supported by the placental pathology in our case which showed areas of focal opacification with degradation ofamniotic membranes and chorionic villi and necrotizing inflammation with stromal cell necrosis of umbilical cord and fetal surface. The HSV DNA PCR was also positive for HSV-2 from placenta that was trans-abdominally delivered in sterile manner trans-abdominally during Cesarean section .\n\n【11】While congenital HSV infection presents most commonly as either Skin， Eyes and Mucosal disease (SEM) or CNS infection ， our case presented with the least common variant， as the disseminated disease with hepatosplenomegaly and hydrops. As in our case， HSV infections can have atypical presentation in premature infants attributable to an immature immunologic response to the virus. Typically， cutaneous HSV is described as vesicular or pustular eruptions with erythematous base . Our case rapidly developed diffuse，large hemorrhagic bullous lesions coalescing together within a matter of few hours of birth， progressing rapidly with sloughing of skin . This was highly unusual and unique presentation. The lesions appeared somewhat similar to infants presenting with scalded skin syndrome， aplasia cutis congenital or congenital bullous dermal disorders . A somewhat similar case of vesiculobullous lesions in a 27-week-gestation preterm neonate with HSV has been reported before but unlike our case， active recurrent genital lesions of HSV were present in the mother prior to delivery in that case . The findings of leukocytosis and hydrops with severe hepatosplenomegaly in our case were also consistent with previous rare reports of neonatal HSV disease and with in-utero transmission .\n\n【12】The presence of fever with premature prolonged rupture of membrane as in our case without any evidence of a bacterial infection highlights the need to investigate an alternative infectious etiology. It is prudent to have a high index of suspicion for HSV in such cases and to screen mothers for HSV-2 in addition to screening for bacterial infection. Although the American Academy of Pediatrics has provided guidelines for the management of neonatal HSV among those with maternal history of HSV and for those with primary and recurrent exposure， screening for HSV during pregnancy is not yet routine practice in the United States specifically in the absence of positive maternal history of HSV infection or in the absence of perinatal exposure. As most cases of neonatal HSV infection occur following cervical viral shedding without any clinically detectable genital lesion， universal maternal screening for HSV serology is warranted . The epidemiologic data suggesting a rise in the prevalence of neonatal HSV infection because more HSV-1 sero-negative individuals are entering sexually active age group combined with the changing sexual practices， the need for universal maternal screening is even more important. In addition， continued adherence to measures preventing vertical transmission from mother to neonate in the presence of known maternal history， including maternal treatment and prophylaxis with acyclovir， may check potential future increase in neonatal herpes infections. Trans-placental passage of acyclovir has been shown to offer protection to the fetus against maternal viremia； however， justification of its use in preventing neonatal HSV in the absence of documented maternal HSV infection remains unclear . Additionally， various prototypes for both therapeutic and prophylactic vaccines are being developed but none has yet been proven effective for mass use. Continued investigations to analyze cost-based efficacy of vaccines against genital herpes maybe justifiable .\n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】In-utero transmission of HSV-2 with absence of maternal history of HSV and with absence of premature perinatal rupture of membrane as in our case is rare. Our case highlights the importance of considering HSV infection in pregnant women presenting with intra-partum fever without a clear bacterial etiology， and screening all mothers for HSV even in the absence of history or in the absence of active genitallesions. Congenital HSV infection continues to exert high mortality and morbidity in neonates. The outcome is even more severe among extremely premature infants often resulting in loss of pregnancy during first or second trimester. Our case also highlights the rare form of cutaneous， systemic presentation with hydrops in extreme premature infants. Empiric and early treatment with acyclovir should be considered particularly in a sick premature infant with unique vesicobullous lesions even in the absence of maternal history and in the absence of history of exposure to HSV because of very high mortality. There is a need for continuing research on identifying newer strategies for screening and treatment of HSV during pregnancy so that in-utero HSV transmission to the fetus can be prevented even in asymptomatic women with subclinical infection.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:56:29", "endTime": "2024/09/20 15:00:20", "cost": 230.82}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:42", "update_time": "2024-09-19 23:00:20", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:56:29"}

This case showed an atypical clinical presentation of mastocytosis，but histopathological results confirmed the diagnosis of cutaneous mastocytosis.\n\n【2】Keywords： Alopecia； Cutaneous Mastocytosis； Urticaria pigmentosa\n\n【3】Background\n\n【4】Cutaneous mastocytosis is a condition characterized by increased numbers of mast cells in the skin. Mast Cells (MCs) are part of the immune system . Mast cell proliferation and accumulation within different organs， most frequently the skin， are symptoms of the disorder mastocytosis . The most common cutaneous forms are generalized Urticaria Pigmentosa (UP)， solitary mastocytoma， diffuse erythrodermic form， telangiectatic macularis eruptive perstans (paucicellular)， and pseudo xanthomatous form. Systemic mastocytosis (with or without skin involvement)， mastocytosis linked to hematological disorders， lymphadenopathic mastocytosis with eosinophilia， and mast cell leukemia are other types . A positive Darier’s sign and typical lesions point to the diagnosis of cutaneous mastocytosis . Atypical presentations may have constitutional symptoms resembling carcinoidsyndrome，eruptivexanthomas，impetigo，Langerhans cell histiocytosis，or other conditions. We present the instance of indolent mastocytosis masquerading as cicatricial alopecia.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】The patient is a 12 years old boy with a 9 years history of alopecia on scalp and body . The lesions were red-brown and itchy. On physical examination he had a positive Darier's sign. There were no signs of involvement of other organs， including digestive， respiratory and blood pressure drop. Pathology report indicates that received specimen in formalin consisted of one fragment of skin tissue measuring 0.3 cm ×0.2 cm in thickness. The skin tissue was with unmarkable epidermis. The underlying dermis revealed mild interstitial edema with a mild infiltrate oflymphocytic inflammatory cells admixed with some eosinophils around small blood vessels with prominent endothelial cells mostly in superficial and mid dermis. There is spindle cell proliferation in dermis that show metachromatic granules in methylene blue stain . According to the clinical suspicion， a skin biopsy was performed for him. Our diagnosis was cutaneous mastocytosis verified by methylene blue staining. The patient has been under FM and supportive care since then and is under control.\n\n【7】About six months ago， he experienced an increase in itching in the scalp area， which in the initial examination was in the form of a scaly macule， followed by an irregular and asymmetric area of scalp alopecia in subsequent visits.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Mast cells are mainly found in the skin and lining of the bronchopulmonary tree and gastrointestinal tract . Mast cells are derived from multipotent myeloid progenitors and mature under the influence of c-kit ligands and stem cell factors， in the presence of diverse other growth factors provided by the tissue microenvironment in which they reside .\n\n【10】Cutaneous mastocytosis is a type of mastocytosis that primarily affects the skin. There are three main forms of the condition： Maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis(also called urticaria pigmentosa)， solitary cutaneous mastocytoma， and diffuse Cutaneous mastocytosis . There is also an extremely rare form called telangiectasia macularis eruptiva perstans. The signs， symptoms， and severity of the condition vary by subtype. Cutaneous mastocytosis is usually caused by alterations in the KIT gene .\n\n【11】As a result of certain stimuli， such as parasites or insect bites， mast cells release various chemicals， including histamine . Histamine dilates blood vessels and can cause soft tissue swelling. Cutaneous mastocytosis is a relatively rare condition. Cutaneous mastocytosis is caused by a genetic mutation . Cutaneous mastocytosis constitutes 90% of cases of mastocytosis that are not associated with a hematologic disorder . Urticaria pigmentosa is the most common variety， occurring in about two thirds of patients with cutaneous mastocytosis. Humans have about 30，000 to 40，000different genes . Some of these genes have defects that can affect body processes and functions . Mastocytosis gene mutations increase the production of mast cells by the bone marrow . They usually occur as sporadic or isolated changes. It is not normally passed from parent to child . Mastocytosis occurs in all races， and there is no sex predilection . The peak incidence is during infancy and early chil dhood， with a second peak occurring in middle age . The disease may be benign， with minor transient symptoms and signs that never cause the patient to consult a physician， or it may belife-threatening . It may be apparent at birth； it may appear during the first few months of infancy or it may have an onset at any age thereafter . About one third of patients first develop the characteristic lesions in adulthood .\n\n【12】Previous studies have shed some light on the causes of mast cell accumulation in skin. Normal epidermal keratinocytes produce mast cell growth factor， also known as stem cell factor and c-kit ligand， which binds to the c-kit receptor on mast cells and probably causes their proliferation and accumulation . Xu et al. have suggested that alopecia and mast cell disease might be associated . Mast cell granules are rich in cytokines， growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor， and vascular endothelium-derived growth factors. The receptors of these growth factors have a role in regulating development and cycling of hair follicle； therefore， it is possible that alopecia may be consequence of mast cell disease . According to the previous reports， CM patients may have mutations of c-kit a receptor of growth factor. The stem cell factor on mast cells， causes unregulated growth factor activation which results in increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis of mast cells . And recently it was also reported that c-kit has a role in hair growth； therefore， upregulated c-kit in the hair follicle cells can trigger AA and androgenetic alopecia . C-kit is also expressed in melanocytic lineage cells， so hyperactivation of c-kit can cause hyperpigmentation of affected skin， and this finding can help to explain tan- to reddish brown-colored maculopapules， which is a typical finding in CM， especially in urticaria pigmentosa. In summary， cicatricial alopecia with increased numbers of mast cells on scalp biopsy guarantees the diagnosis of mastocytosis. This can be confirmed by testing urine for elevated levels of histamine metabolites \n\n【13】Conclusion\n\n【14】The scalp biopsy from this patient revealed mild interstitial edema with a mild infiltrate of lymphocytic inflammatory cells admixed with some eosinophils around small blood vessels with prominent endothelial cells mostly in superficial and mid dermis and increased numbers of mast cells. In conclusion， scarring alopecia with increased mast cell numbers on scalp biopsy justifies the diagnosis of mastocytosis.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 15:06:46", "endTime": "2024/09/20 15:08:26", "cost": 100.088}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:42", "update_time": "2024-09-19 23:08:26", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 23:06:46"}

To our knowledge there are few reports with cardiac involvement in POEMS syndrome， where chemotherapy has shown to reverse such involvement. We report a clinical case with cardiac amvloidosis and POEMS syndrome. On the other hand， amyloidosis turns out to be an infrequent entity that is the product of the deposit of an abnormal protein (Amyloid)， which interferes with the functioning of the affected organ by producing deposit. The patient we present is of particular interest because he has the presence of both pathologies， we consider that the discussion in this clinical case implies a probable better prognosis of amyloidosis if it is associated with POEMS syndrome.\n\n【2】Keywords： Amyloidosis； Paraneoplasic；POEMS syndrome\n\n【3】Introduction\n\n【4】POEMS syndrome was first established in 1980 by Bardwick， referring to the presence of Polyneuropathy， Organomegaly， Endocrinopathy， M protein， Skin changes (POEMS)， as part of a manifestation of an underlying plasma cell neoplasm . POEMS syndrome has evolved， redefining its diagnosis criteria which includes mandatory criteria， major criteria and minor criteria. Mandatory criteria include polyneuropathy， usually demyelinating， and monoclonal plasma cell-proliferative disorder. Major criteria， includes Castleman's disease， sclerotic bone lesions， vascular endothelial growth factor elevation， at least one is required. Minor criteria include organomegaly， extravascular volume overload， endocrinopathy (other than hypothyroidism)， skin changes， papilledema， thrombocytosis/polycythemia， along with other symptoms which are none specific clubbing， weight loss， hyperhidrosis， pulmonary hypertension， thrombotic diatheses， diarrhea， low vitamin B12 values . Ten-year survival is 79% which can vary ， in a Mayo Clinic series during 2003， overall median survival was of 13.7 years， being a bit lower in patients with clubbing or extravascular volume overload having a median survival of 2.6 and 6.6 years . The relationship between amyloidosis with cardiac involvement and POEMS syndrome has not been well established in terms ofprognosis， considering POEMs syndrome has a good prognosis with adequate treatment compared to those patients with cardiac amyloidosis， for this reason we would like to share the following clinical case.\n\n【5】Case Presentation\n\n【6】We present the case ofa 65-year-old male patient who came to our hospital startinghis condition2 years prior to his visit with hair loss， constipation， dry skin， fatigue， and difficulty speaking； being valued by various doctors without reaching a diagnosis. Six months after the onset of the symptoms of the previous ones， the patient presented dysphonia， and dysphagia to solid foods， weight loss of3 kg (unintended)， paresthesias and dysesthesias in the lower extremities； therefore， a diagnostic protocol was started. Physical examination reveals macroglosia ， left cervical lymph node movable and painless 2 cm around area IV of the neck， maculopapular hyperpigmented skin lesions in thorax， holosystolic tricuspid murmur 4/6， ungeal lesion with trachyonychia on both hands ， and lower extremities with pitting edema accompanied with decreased vibratory sensation. Contemplating the manifestations amyloidosis was suspected and periumbilical biopsy was done reporting collagenous homogenous fiber interlaced with fibroblasts staining orange red with red Congo stain making the diagnosis of amyloidosis. Laboratory evaluation revealed a light chain in urine with kappa spike predominance of 290.94 mg/L (0.01 mg/dL to 33 mg/dL)， lambda of 10.89 mg/L (0.45 mg/dL to 4.9 mg/dL)， a kappa/Lambda relation of 26.7， a beta 2 microglobulin of 2195 ng/mL (609 ng/mL to 2366 ng/mL)， a vascular endothelial grow factor of 310.6 pg/mL (31 pg/mL to 86 pg/mL) and N-terminal cerebral natriuretic pro-peptide of 4686 pg/mL. Although hypothyroidism is common in amyloidosis and a thyrotropin (TSH) blood test was obtained reporting TSH of 8.3 IU/mL， rest of profile was normal diagnosing subclinic hypothyroidism. A complete hormonal profile was requested that report hypogonadism with total testosterone of101 ng/dL (181 ng/dL to 772 ng/dL)， a dehydroepiandrosterone of12.1 ug/dL (228 ug/dL to 283 ug/dL)； what allowed us to integrate POEMS syndrome. Due to the data found in the histopathological study of the periumbilical fat， an echocardiogram was performed that reported infiltrative myocardiopathy in racemic grapefruit pattern suggestive of Amyloid infiltration， ventricular hypertrophy， systolic ejection fraction 50%， diastolic dysfunction with restricted pattern， moderate mitral insufficiency， severe tricuspidinsufficiency，moderate pulmonary hypertension PSAP 60 mmHg， biatrial dilatation without thrombi. After these findings N-terminal cerebral natriuretic pro-peptide (NT-Pro-BNP) was obtained reporting a value of 4，686 pg/mL(<900pg/mL)， confirming poor prognosis associated with cardiac involvement. Due to the symptoms that the patient reported in the extremities and the alterations found in the physical examination， an electromyography was performed that reported mixed predominance polyneuropathy with axonal demyelinating damage. And due to the gastrointestinal symptoms， an endoscopy was obtained with a report of chronic esophagitis， alterations in motility due to amyloidosis and chronic duodenitis. Finally， as part of the diagnostic protocol， a complete bone series that did not have osteosclerotic changes， ruling out damage at this level.\n\n【7】Discussion\n\n【8】Since amyloidosis or POEMS syndrome are treated in a similar manner， identifying coexistence between these two entities doesn't see of significant importance and it basically speaks of the presence of a chronic inflammatory process generated mainly by interleukin-6that has been detected present in the germinal centers of the lymph nodes. For the above the treatment is usually started with melphalan plus dexamethasone o bortezomib when there is a monoclonal peak， which is accompanied bythe presenceofremission ofpolyneuropathy， macroglossia and skin lesions . In the case of our patient with cardiac amyloidosis and POEM syndrome， we asked ourselves whether the coexistence of both pathologies had an association linked to a better prognosis， fin ding only that the survival reported in these cases is usually 79% at 10 years . In POEMS syndrome， skin findings (hyperpigmentation， hemangiomas， hypertrichosis， redness， acrocyanosis， white nails， facial atrophy or clubbing) are frequent， so there should be a thorough examination when this entity is suspected， as in the case presented . A Mayo Clinic prognostic model involving NT-pro-BNP plus cardiac troponin has been established in patients with cardiac amyloidosis， where a 5-year survival rate ranges from 8% to 28% compared to a rate of 13.7-year overall survival in patients with POEMS Syndrome； however， in the case of our patient， the elevated levels of NT-pro-BNP in isolation confer a poor prognosis of cardiac function . Cardiac involvement is rarely seen in POEMS syndrome， but it is seen more frequently in the development of amyloidosis， although the most affected organ is the kidney； it usually presents as a restrictive heart disease with predominantly septal concentric ventricular hypertrophy， as reported in the echocardiogram of our patient， and arrhythmias are usually present in up to 30% . Some authors have suggested cardiomyopathy as a manifestation of organomegaly ， which should raise the argument in designing new therapeutic strategies. Tanus T and Miller HJ reported a case of POEMS syndrome and cardiac involvement showing resolution of cardiomyopathy after chemotherapy . This result implies a change in prognosis among patients with cardiac amylosis and POEMS syndrome. It is possible to infer that those patients with POEMS syndrome along with cardiac involvement due to amyloidosis may have a better prognosis compared with amyloidosis without POEMS syndrome. A case series could further clarify this prognosis， probably changing the panorama. A series of cases could further clarify this prognosis， probably changing the panorama， without forgetting that by modifying the inflammatory state of the organism， the presence of Amyloid tends to decrease. In our patient's case， the fact that he does not present sclerotic lesions or disseminated bone marrow is a good prognostic data， although in the literature they are described as one of the most characteristic findings ofPOEMS syndrome.\n\n【9】Conclusion\n\n【10】We consider that the case presented is representative of the affectation of both pathologies， in a patient who began with very general symptoms where the physical examination was a fundamental pillar for the suspicion of the entities involved， which was corroborated by the complementary studies； in the case of the patient， the presence of both pathologies could be demonstrated，on the one hand， with myocardial infiltration and positive Congo red staining， and on the other， meeting the diagnostic criteria， which represented a benefit for patient follow-up.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:14:49", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:14:58", "cost": 8.227}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:42", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:57", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:14:48"}

The angiomyolipoma of the kidney is a benign tumor that often happens along with tuberous sclerosis. Large renal angiomyolipoma's associated with tuberous sclerosis are in danger of fatal hemorrhage. This study reported a case with an unexpected large size of renal angiomyolipoma's associated with tuberous sclerosis.\n\n【2】Case Presentation： We report a girl aged 5 years and 9 months old with tuberous sclerosis who referred to nephrology clinic due to abdominal pain. Physical examination revealed a large mass in the right flank. Kidney ultrasound reported a large mass with approximate size of 90 mmx 60mm in the right kidney， and abdominal CT scan also showed a non-hemogenic solid mass in the right kidney with size of 91 mm x68 mm×67 mm， was highly suspected for Wilms tumor. Since the large size of lesion and subsequent suspension for malignant tumor， partial nephrectomy was performed and through kidney biopsy an unexpected angiomyolipoma was diagnosed.\n\n【3】Conclusion： Considering extended studies in various populations with tuberous sclerosis and renal angiomyolipoma， this case is challenging and intriguing since she was the youngest one among patients with necessity of nephrectomy due to the large size of lesion and radiologic findings suggestive of Wilms'tumor.\n\n【4】Keywords： Tuberous sclerosis； Renal angiomyolipoma； Children； Nephrectomy\n\n【5】Introduction\n\n【6】Tuberous Sclerosis (TS) is an uncommon neurocutaneous and genetic disease， arises from inactivating mutations of either TSC1 (chromosome locus 9q34.3) or TSC2 (16p13.3) genes which encode hamartin and tuberin， respectively. These proteins serve as tumor suppressors by forming complexes that controls proliferation of cells . Benign tumors in patients with TS are identified in various organs including retina，lungs，heart， brain， skin andkidney . In affected infants，cardiac rhabdomyomas，hamartomas， epilepsy and skin lesions are the most common symptoms . The most frequent manifestations in kidneys are unilateral or bilateral renal angiomyolipoma's， which occur in a majority of patients (34% to 80%) . Renal angiomyolipoma's usually appear later in life， and can associate with fatal bleeding， and hypovolemic shock .\n\n【7】Although renal angiomyolipoma’s usually consist of adipocytes， irregular vasculature， and smooth muscle cells， the proportions of each parts of tumor can differ in patients . Renal angiomyolipoma’s with a size more than 40 mm can result in vascular aneurysm and fatal hemorrhage. Vascularity of the lesion can rise with growth of the size . Complications are usually treated with angiographic embolization or surgical removal such as radical nephrectomy. This study reported a case with an unexpected large size of renal angiomyolipoma's (90 mm x60 mm) associated with Tuberous sclerosis. It was so interesting that despite large size of tumor， there were no evidences of bleeding， and kidney ultrasound and abdominal CT scan findings were representative of Wilms tumor.\n\n【8】Case Presentation\n\n【9】The patient was an Iranian girl aged 5 years and 9 months old and referred to nephrology clinic due to abdominal pain and a huge right flank mass. At the age of 9 months， following recurrent seizures accompanied by skin lesions the diagnosis of TS was made for this patient. Her weight was 15 kg (Z score： -2) and systolic blood pressure at first visit was 100 mmHg with no detectable diastolic blood pressure. Pulse rates were normal and there were no evidences of internal hemorrhage.\n\n【10】Although she was old enough (age >5 years)， she had fecal and urinary incontinence and because of intellectual disability she was unable to speak. Physical examination determined different Cafe au lait macules and angiofibroma's lesions on the face， limbs， trunk and borders of the fingers， and Shagreen patch in the region of lumbar vertebrates. She had a history of repetitive hand surgeries for removal of fingers lesions which restricted her movements. Physical examination of abdomen revealed a huge mobile mass in the right flank without tenderness.\n\n【11】Imaging test\n\n【12】Kidney ultrasound findings reported a large mass with a size of90 mm x 60 mm in the right kidney， very closely resembled a Wilms tumor. Abdominal CT scan with intravenous contrast injection defined a non-hemogenic solid mass in the right kidney with a size of91 mm x68 mm x67 mm，highly suspected to Wilms tumor (Figure 1). Thoracic CT scan also performed in multiple sections and their results were unremarkable. Partial nephrectomy was performed and histopathologic examination revealed Pleomorphic Angiomyolipoma as the final diagnosis and there were no histological evidences of Wilms tumor .\n\n【13】Discussion\n\n【14】Tuberous Sclerosis (TS) is an autosomal dominant disease， most commonly caused by TSC1 or TSC2 genes mutation and identified by benign hamartomas in about 34% to 80% of TS patients with renal angiomyolipoma . It is a rare genetic multisystem disorder， presented by benign tumors which can develop in any organ system. It’s prevalence in live-birth is 1 in 5，800 births and prevalence of 1 in 12，500 had been reported in total population . Renal angiomyolipoma’s are benign vascular， smooth muscle tumors and are typically asymptomatic but may induce flank or abdominal pain， hematuria， abdominal mass or distension， fever， nausea， vomiting， or progressive loss of kidney function. Death due to retroperitoneal hemorrhage (Wunderlich syndrome) have been reported in cases with renal angiomyolipoma's .\n\n【15】Growth of angiomyolipoma associated with TSC is faster than those associated withsporadic angiomyolipomaa13， Angiomyolipoma’s with a diameter >3.5 cm have the significant risk for severe hemorrhage and selective embolization should be considered as first treatment . Renal angiomyolipoma lesions are classified as small (<4 cm)， medium (4 cm to 8 cm) or large (>8cm) based on the single largest lesion in each kidney. The severity of complications is mostly related to the sizes oflesions. The mean size of 85 mm (35 mm to 200 mm) and 78 mm (45 mm to 180 mm)renal angiomyolipoma's (sporadic or associated with TSC) referred to selective embolization， have been reported in two studies and the individual risk of bleeding appears moderate， even in TS patients(around 6%).\n\n【16】It has been reported that tumors sized >6 cm are at higher risk of bleeding ， while another study showed that tumors with size of<8cm tend to be asymptomatic . Similar to our case， a recent study reported asymptomatic giant renal angiomyolipoma's (290 mm×215mmx120 mm) in a patient .\n\n【17】In a recently extended study among patients with TS， 1070 of2065 enrolled cases (51.8%) had a history of renal angiomyolipoma. Among patients aged<18 years，34.3% had angiomyolipoma with the size of >3 cm. Totally 498 cases with renal angiomyolipoma (46.5%) needed to treatment， including 11/134 (8.2%) patients who were at age of 5 to 9 years (likely the age range of our case). Nephrectomy was a rare modality used for treatment in cases <18 years (5/498cases； 1%)， while in those aged >18 years， 57/572 patients (9.95%) underwent nephrectomy. The youngest age for nephrectomy was >9years.\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】Our case is interesting since presents a girl with TS and large renal angiomyolipoma which mimicking the Wilms’tumor findings in the imaging studies (renal ultrasound and abdominal CT scan). Despite large size of tumor there was no sign of bleeding. Patient underwent nephrectomy because of the large sized lesion and suspicion to malignant tumor. Nephrectomy rarely needed in children with TS who were at age of<18 years (1%). Considering an extended study in a large population with TS and renal angiomyolipoma， our case had been the youngest one with indispensable nephrectomy.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 13:59:35", "endTime": "2024/09/20 13:59:49", "cost": 13.862}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:42", "update_time": "2024-09-19 21:59:49", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 21:59:35"}

This causes nephritis with hematuria，proteinuria， and progressive renal damage， as well as high-frequency deafness and visual impairment. The prevalence of AS is approximately 1 in 5000， and it leads to End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) in about 0.5% of adults and 12.9% of children. Despite the identification of associated receptors and pathways， the pathophysiology of AS is poorly understood. There is no specific treatment， although inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are often used. Recent progress in molecular biological techniques including next-generation sequencing have facilitated the diagnosis of AS and can assist in the elucidation of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Early diagnosis and therapy of AS is important， especially in children.\n\n【2】Here， we report an AS case resulting from a mutation in COL4A5. The patient was a two-year-old Chinese boy. Clinical examination showed occult blood and protein in the urine，the red blood cell count was 573/ul，and there was impaired urinary function while hearing appeared normal. Imaging examinations showed no obvious abnormalities. A renal biopsy was performed and AS was strongly suspected. Genetic testing showed a hemizygous mutation in COL4A5， c.4003-2a>T， chromosome location： chrX： 107924113 and the patient were diagnosed with X-linked AS. He was prescribed a low-sodium diet with oral chlorine sand treatment， and after three months， the urine red blood cell count showed a clear improvement.\n\n【3】This study reports a case of X-linked AS caused a mutation in the COL4A5 gene. The findings demonstrate the pathogenic role of this mutation in AS and provide insight into the pathological mechanism of this disease.\n\n【4】Keywords： Alport syndrome； Hereditary kidney disease； Collagen； COL4A5 gene； Mutation； X-linked (XLAS) inheritance Alport Syndrome (AS) is a hereditary progressive kidney disease， typified by the presence of blood in the urine， to get with sensorineural deafness and visual impairment， as well as other more rare renal manifestations . It is typified by pathological changes in the glomerular basement membrane . AS is a rare single-gene genetic disease， involving mutations in collagen IV genes， specifically， COL4A4， COL4A4 (2q36.3)， and COL4A5 (Xq22.3) that encode the collagen IV alpha3， 4， and 5 chains， respectively. AS can thus be divided into three genetic models， differing in terms of the responsible gene and the mode of inheritance， namely， X-Linked AS (XLAS)， Autosomal Recessive AS (ARAS)， and Autosomal Dominant AS (ADAS). XLAS is caused by mutation in the COL4A5 gene on the X-chromosome 21-22， and accounts for 85% of AS cases， followed by ARAS and the rare ADAS caused by mutations in COL4A3 and COL4A4 variation on chromosome 2.q35to q37 . AS is second only to Polycystic Kidney Disease (CKD) as an inherited kidney disease， and represents a major cause of end-stage renal disease in children . AS is often misdiagnosed in children， and there is limited therapy for children with end-stage renal disease.\n\n【5】In this study， we discuss a two-year-old Chinese boy with X-linked AS resulting from a COL4A5mutation. The patient was brought to the hospital with hematuria after finding blood in the urine. No abnormalities in immune function， renal function， urinary ions， and hearing and sight were observed. Routine urine examination showed urinary occult blood 3+， urinary protein ±， and red blood cell 573/pl. Genetic analysis found that the proband had a potentially pathogenic mutation in the COL4A5 gene； as this gene is known to be responsible for XLAS， the patient was diagnosed with XLAS.\n\n【6】Case Presentation\n\n【7】A two-vear-old boy was hospitalized after an abnormal urine test； there was no gross hematuria， increased frequency， urgency， or pain associated with urination， nor any cough， rash， and other symptoms present for more than 15 days. The child was a G2P2， and had been born full-term by normal vaginal delivery with no prenatal issues. The child was breastfed with supplementary feeds， was fully vaccinated， and had achieved all normal growth milestones. His parents were not consanguineous and there was no maternal history of stillbirth or abortion. Both the patient's mother and sister， however，had a history of hematuria.\n\n【8】On admission， the blood pressure was 71/50 mmHg， the respiratory rate was 20/min， heart rate was 115/min， and the body temperature was 36.8°C. The child weighed 12 kg and was 90 cm tall， with both measures falling within normal ranges for his age . His heart，lungs， and reflexes all appeared normal.\n\n【9】Laboratory examinations showed normal parameters， including immunoglobulin +C3 +C4 +k +A， erythrocyte sedimentation rate， urine ion content， anti-spectrum and ANCA， Streptococcus， urine ion detection， renal function， ANA spectrum and ANCA， bone metabolism three 25-VD iPT (CT)， 25-hydroxy determination of vitamin D VIT D23.11 ng/ml. The urine was positive for occult blood.\n\n【10】Accessory examination showed normal sonography of the heart， liver， gallbladder， pancreas， spleen， and kidneys. Abdominal probe：the nutcracker (negative). No obvious abnormality was found in the abdominal cavity nor on urinary nucear MRI. Hearing and visual acuity were normal. A renal biopsy strongly indicated suspected Alport syndrome . On the basis of this and the family history， we conducted genetic testing.\n\n【11】The clinical， laboratory， and imaging results strongly suggested AS. Exome sequencing of the patient， his parents， and sibling was performed， and verified by Sanger sequencing. It was found that the patient had a hemizygous mutation in COL4A5， c.4003-2 a>T， chromosome location： chrX： 107924113. The chromosomal position of this variant is chrX： 107924113 ， with the transcript NM 033380， located in exon 44， which came from the patient's mother.\n\n【12】Both mother and sister showed heterozygous mutations. This hemizygous mutation is consistent with a pattern of X-linked dominant genetic disease. The mother and sister of the proband carried this mutation， but X chromosome inactivation may have reduced the severity of the disease . These findings， together with the clinical findings， resulted in a diagnosis of X-lined AS caused by COL4A5 mutation.\n\n【13】Treatment\n\n【14】The patient was treated with oral chlorine sand potassium tablets(10 mg， qd). The urine， renal function， and serum electrolytes were evaluated monthly at first and were then followed up regularly at later stages.\n\n【15】Discussion\n\n【16】AS is a progressive hereditary kidney disease. It is a rare single-gene genetic disease， caused by， the most common form is x-chain Alport syndrome (COL4A5) and autosomal AS (COL4A3 and COL4A4)， accounting for a small number of cases. Clinical with hematuria， proteinuria， progressive renal injury with or without high frequency sensorineural deaf and visual abnormalities for the clinical features of hereditary nephritis . Alport syndrome has various clinical phenotypes and can be divided into three categories according to the genetic mode. Among them， X-Linked Inheritance(XLAS) is the main form of as (mim#301050)， accounting for about80% of cases. Such mutations have a serious impact on male patients. There are mutations in genes encoding the collagen IV alpha chains， specifically， the a3， a4， and a5 chains encoded by COL4A3，COL4A4， and COL4A5， respectively. X-linked AS is the most frequent， representing over 80% of cases. The X-linkage may seriously affect male patients and hemizygous mutations in COL4A5 have been reported in men. Approximately 60% of these patients develop ESRD before the age of 30， with the incidence rising to 90% by the age of40 . Approximately 90% of men with XLAS develop hearing loss before the age of 40 ， while about 30% of XLAS men have impaired vision . Females heterozygous for the COL4A5 mutation may experience mild hematuria or hematuria as severe as men due to random inactivation of the X chromosome in females. About 12%of women with XLAS are estimated to develop renal failure by the age of 40 and 15% to 30% by the age of 60 . The a3， a4， and a5collagen chains are all expressed in the basement membranes of the glomerulus， Bowman's capsule， cochlea， and retina， amongst others； thus， a deficiency in one or more of the chains will affect the kidney， ear， eye， skin， and muscle function . Bilateral Sensorineural Hearing Loss (BSHL) is commonly seen in AS and is usually seen in conjunction with renal symptoms. BSHL reduces hearing in the high- and medium-frequency ranges and develops gradually， with approximately 18% of children below the age of 18 showing hearing loss， rising to 70% of adults. BSHL can thus be used for assessing the prognosis of nephropathy， as earlier onset is associated with higher ESRD risk . In the eye， macular retinopathy and pyramidal lesion are often seen， frequently in combination with hearing impairment. The presence of central and peripheral macular retinopathy is linked to early-onset renal failure. Thinning of the temporal lobe retinal membrane also frequently occurs in AS although this is not associated with vision impairment and may improve. Other more rare ocular manifestations may also occur .\n\n【17】Although overall AS is classified as rare with a prevalence of about1：5000-10000， recent population-based genetic investigations have found that this may be an underestimation， with ADAS being between 5 and 16 times more prevalent than other forms of the disorder . In the past， mild hematuria was usually diagnosed as Benign Familial Hematuria (BFH) or Thin Basement Membrane Nephropathy (TBMN)， both of which resulted from autosomal COLA4 gene mutations and were usually heterozygous. More recent genetic studies have grouped these two diagnoses together as a single entity (collagen nephropathy)， and the prevalence is tough to be considerably higher as it is likely that many cases are either undiagnosed or misdiagnosed . It is second to the polycystic kidney disease is the most common hereditary kidney disease， mainly involving the kidneys， may also show renal symptoms， such as eye problems，such as hearing loss or the severity of the disease according to its genetic and other affected by known or unknown factors and Table 1： Laboratory tests before and after treatment.\n\n| Laboratory examinations  | Before treatment  | After 3 months treatment  | Reference range  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Occult blood  | 3+  | 3+  | negative  |\n| Urine protein  | ±  | negative  | negative  |\n| Red blood cell/ul  | 455  | 121  | 0-7  |\n| Microscopic examination of red blood cells/HP  | 25~30  | 5~10  | <3/HP  |\n| The urine trace albumin mg/L  | 65  | 30.7  | 0.0  |\n| 24 h urinary protein quantitative g/24 h  | 0.29  | 0.09  | 0.15  |\n\n【19】change .\n\n【20】The Glomerular Basement Membrane (GBM) contributes to the filtration function of the kidney. It is formed by an interlocking network of proteins and proteoglycans， including type IV collagen， laminin， and perlecan， amongst others . Structural alterations in these components can disrupt the network and its interactions， altering the function of the GBM andpotentially leading to progressive CKD. However， mutations in type IV collagen may cause a wide variety of phenotypes， resulting from the complex interactions between genotype， sex， and X-chromosome inactivation. Furthermore， the type of mutation may also be a factor. Over 1，500variants have been documented in COL4A5， with more than 500 in COL4A3 and COL4A4 . The most common polymorphism in COL4A5 is a missense mutation， accounting for approximately 43% of the observed polymorphisms， followed by 34% nonsense mutations，23% splice variants， 14% small deletions， 7% rearrangements or copy number variations， together with smaller numbers of repetitions and indels . Male patients with XLAS tend to develop renal failure. A European cohort study showed that a large deletion and nonsense mutation resulted in the likelihood of renal failure before the age of 30， while the risk of renal failure from a splice site mutation was70% and that of the missense mutation was 50% . A cohort study of women with XLAS found a 12% risk of renal failure by the age of 45， rising to 30% by age 60， and 40% by age 80. The reason for this wide prognostic variation is unknown but X-inactivation is a probable cause . ARAS results from homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in COL4A3 and COL4A4 and accounts for approximately 5% of AS cases . These patients， as well as those with ADAS， show a wide variety of symptoms ranging from mild hematuria to renal failure .\n\n【21】Clinical manifestationsaand disease progression differs among AS patients. The current treatment is aimed essentially at slowing the progression of the renal disease to delay renal failure. Nevertheless， most patients require renal replacement therapy . It is thus important to investigate new ways of treating the disease， and investigations into the cellular and molecular functions of the GBM have suggested various possibilities， these include genomic strategies such as gene editing and therapy，RNA therapy， and partner therapy. Current treatment mostly involves the use of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the Angiotensin Aldosterone System (RAAS) and Angiotensin Receptor Blockade (ARB)， which have been found to protect against hypertension， proteinuria， and renal deterioration . While ACE inhibitors are the first-line treatment， AT1 receptor antagonists may be used if side effects are experienced. Increased RAAS axis activity has been linked to CKD progression mediated by both hemodynamic (increased pressure in efferent arterioles) and non-hemodynamic processes (increased cytokine production). Targeting RAAS can mitigate these effects and improve renal function . RAAS inhibitors may also be combined with other therapies that have been found to improve the efficiency of treatment efficacy， although there is an increased risk of side effects.\n\n【22】Ramipril is an ACE inhibitor. It has been shown in the EARLY PROTECT ALPORT clinical trial  to be safe and efficacious for treating children with AS， as have animal studies. In 2020， an updated guide was issued emphasizing the benefits of early initiation of treatment with RAAS inhibitors and the importance of early diagnosis . Renal function is stable in early childhood (normal GFR， no proteinuria). The only signs of disease in young children are that the GBM is thinner and there may be slight hematuria. In older children， the GBM thickens，leading to the development of proteinuria and fibrosis during adolescence . It is thus recommended that men with XLAS and ARAS should receive RAAS inhibitor therapy when diagnosed. However， female patients with XLAS and ADAS should be treated at the sign of the first symptoms (microalbuminuria) .\n\n【23】Recommendations for the use of ACE inhibitors are based on the ESCAPE trial in children with CKD and the EARLY PROTECT trial in children with AS . In men with XLAS (hemizygous COL4A5variant)， we recommend starting ramipril therapy at diagnosis using an initial dose of 1 mg/m²/day for three to four months increasing to 6 mg/m/day， or maximum tolerated dose. Taking lisinopril as an example， it is recommended that the initial dose be 0.2 mg/kg/day (maximum dose 10 mg/day)， titrating upward to 0.6 mg/kg/day (maximum dose 40 mg/day)， or maximum tolerated dose. For both drugs， the dose should be adjusted according to the needs of children's growth to maintain a constant mg/m’or mg/kg dose and reach the maximum recommended or tolerated dose. For female patients with XLAS (heterozygous COL4A5 variants)， we suggest that when microalbuminuria occurs repeatedly detected without in the absence of infection， defined as the proportion where urinary microalbuminuria and creatinine is greater than 30 mg/mg， treatment should beinitiated. Wehypothesizethatthe onset of microalbuminuria identifies those heterozygous women at significant risk of developing CKD and renal failure. At present， there is no reliable method for measuring the balance of X-inactivation balance in the kidney. We recommend that the dose of ramipril and lisinopril be the same as for male XLAS patients. Adult female patients should use contraception to prevent the formation of fetal lesions resulting from angiotensin blockade. For both male and female patients with ARAS， we recommend initiating treatment at diagnosis. Both male and female patients with ADAS that have no infection but show symptoms of microalbuminuria (urinary microalbumin creatinine ratio is greater than 30 mg/Mg) should receive treatment. We hypothesize that the presence of microalbuminuria identifies heterozygous individuals at risk ofprogression to CKD and renal failure .\n\n【24】There are several drugs currently in clinical trials for AS. These include bardoxolone， an anti-inflammatory factor that activates transcription factor Nrf2 and prevents the activation of the NF-kB pathway . In the COL4A3 Alport mouse model (129Sv/J)， artemisinin (paricalcitol) protectedagainst renal disease and fibrosis. Artemisinin was evaluated in combination with ACE inhibitors and was found to delay ESRD onset . The endothelin A receptor agonist Atrasentan has been found to reduce proteinuria without causing fluid retention  and the aldosterone antagonist AS is a chronic disease that seriously affects the quality of life of patients. XLAS and ARAS usually lead to early renal failure， resulting in patients having to receive renal replacement therapy. This emphasizes the important of early genetic diagnosis and early treatment to prolong the health of patients for as long as possible. At present，there is no specific treatment forpatients with AS and the most frequently used treatment is by inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Recently this year， with the continuous progress of second-generation sequencing technology， great progress has been made in diagnosis and this technology offers prospects for fully understanding the pathophysiology of the disease and developing new treatments. The identification of prognostic biomarkers is also important， ideally， a urine marker that does not require invasive investigations. A possible biomarker for progression in children may be uEGF/Cr (urinary epidermal growth factor normalized by urinary creatinine) which is lower in AS patients . Currently，the only way to predict the progression of disease to ESRD is the assessment of risk factors (increased proteinuria or hearing loss) or renal damage(nephrotoxic drugs， renal donors . The more progress we make in disease research and the more we know about this disease， the more innovative it will be， and the closer we will be to a cure.\n\n【25】In the present study， we report a case of X-linked AS caused by a COL4A5 mutation. A hemizygous mutation was found in COL4A5， c.4003-2a>t， chromosome location： ChrX： 107924113. This is a novel mutation. This study expands the human gene database， which is conducive to studying the individualized treatment scheme according to genotyping， and providing personalized treatment for patients with AS caused by different genetic mutations. Therefore， the early diagnosis and treatment of AS are very important. Early diagnosis and early intervention can delay complications such as renal failure and help children live a healthier life.\n\n【26】In conclusion， gene therapy has become a research hotspot and may be a potential treatment for the complete cure of Alport syndrome.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:37:59", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:38:16", "cost": 16.701}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:42", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:38:15", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:37:58"}

The disease was first described and observed in 1961 in kind red living on Tangier Island， Virginia . Yet， more than 170 cases have been reported in literature，emphasizing that the clinical expression of TD may be highly variable . We here in report on a novel ABCA1 mutation in a 50-year old female presenting with features typical of TD， and on a known ABCA1 mutation in both her offspring， associated with a normal clinical， but abnormal laboratory phenotype.\n\n【9】Materialand Methods\n\n【10】Ethic statement\n\n【11】Written informed consent was obtained for the publication of this case. Informed consent was provided by the subjects. The ethics committee of the Medical University of Innsbruck waived the need for ethics approval for the collection， analysis and publication of the obtained and anonymized data for this clinical case-series.\n\n【12】Mutational analysis of the ABCA1 gene\n\n【13】DNA was isolated from patients'EDTA-blood samples using a QIA Symphony kit. Target genes were amplified using Nextera Rapid Capture (TruSight M One Panel，Illumina) and next generation sequencing (NextSeq Illumina) was performed. The GRCh37 (hg19) was used as a reference genome sequence. Obtained data was analyzed using the SeqPilot software package including SeqNext from JSI medical systems . To ensure adequate quality control of resulting ABCA genes reads， a minimum coverage of 20 reads in forward and reverse as well as flanking intronic sequences from -15 to +5 with a minimum coverage of 10 reads was specified. Unclassified variants were called and considered likely pathogenic and pathogenic variants based on a method proposed previously (classes 3 or 5 according to Plon et al.) . Quantitative read analysis regarding Copy Number Variation (CNV) was determined using SeqNext from JSI medical systems. The adenine of the start codon is c.1 (see Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) ).\n\n【14】Isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)\n\n【15】PBMCs of patients and healthy volunteers were isolated using density centrifugation (Biocoll， Biochrom L6115)， followed by magnetic cell separation with CD14 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec 130-05-201). Isolated (CD14 positive) cells were seeded on a poly-L-lysine-coated 12-well plate (7.5 ×10cells/well) in DMEM， supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Biochrom S0615)， 1% Glutamine (Thermo Fisher Scientific 25030-081)， 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific 15140122)， and 50 ng/ml hMCSF (Reprotech 300-25). Later after 5 days， isolated and differentiated monocyte-derived macrophages were subjected to immunoblots or cholesterol efflux analyses， respectively.\n\n【16】Cholesterol efflux from PBMCs\n\n【17】Experimental procedures were performed according to Demetz et al.  Tancevski et al. ， and Duong et al.\n\n【18】Briefly， PBMCs were seeded on a 6-well plate and incubated with5 uCi/ml H]-cholesterol for 24 h in DMEM containing 1% FBS. Then， cells were washed twice with PBS and equilibrated for 16 h to18 h in DMEM containing 0.2% fatty acid free BSA (Sigma Aldrich， A7030)， 0.3 mM cAMP (Sigma Aldrich， C2912)， and 1 ug/mlACAT-inhibitor (Sigma Aldrich， S9318). Subsequently， cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with DMEM supplemented with 10ug/ml ApoA1 (Sigma Aldrich， A0722)， 0.3 mM cAMP， and 1 ug/ml ACAT-inhibitor for 4 h. Supernatant was then collected， cells were washed twice with PBS and harvested in 1 ml 0.1 M NaOH. Both， supernatants and cell lysates were analyzed using a liquid scintillation counter (PerkinElmer). Percentages of cholesterol efflux were calculated using following formula\n\n【19】% efflux=CPMx100/(CPM Lpern133n CPMgupernatant + CPMcells?\n\n【20】Immunoblot analysis\n\n【21】Immunoblot analyses were performed as described . Anti-ABCA1 antibody was from Novus Biologicals (NB400-105)， anti-ACTIN antibody from Sigma Aldrich(A2066). The chemiluminescent reaction was performed using Super Signal West Dura Reagent(Thermo Fischer Scientific， 34076)； blots were visualized by the use of a ChemiDoc (BioRad) device.\n\n【22】Fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC)\n\n【23】Lipoprotein profiles were analyzed by fractionation of pooled plasma using two Superose 6-columns (GE Healthcare 29091596) in series， followed by cholesterol measurement (Roche 42024401).\n\n【24】Results\n\n【25】Case report\n\n【26】A 50-year old female patient (Body-Mass-Index： BMI=24.3) was referred to our clinic due to both elevated plasma triglyceride concentrations (TG=422 mg/dl) and unusuallylow concentrations of HDL-C(<3mg/dl)duringaroutine check-up before an elective surgical intervention. The patient had a history of mild thrombocytopenia， a neuropathy similar to syringomyelia， a severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and a goiter with normal Thyrotrophic Hormone (TSH).\n\n【27】The parental medical history was not retrievable； the patient is mother to two healthy children. Physical examination did not show the characteristic orange tonsils， as the patient underwent tonsillectomy in her chil dhood. Abdominal and carotid ultrasound revealed a mild splenomegaly， cholecystolithiasis and atherosclerotic lesions of the aorta as well as non-stenosing plaques of both carotid arteries. Histological evaluation following elective thyroidectomy revealed areas with aggregation of foam-cells and lipomatous transformation (data not shown). Similarly， histological examination of a surgically resected hamartoma of the chin revealed an elevated lipid content and infiltration with foam cells .\n\n【28】Further laboratory analyses confirmed low concentrations of plasma HLD-C， decreased plasma concentrations of total cholesterol(<100 mg/dl)， reduced plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol(LDL-C=27 mg/dl) and low apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1<10 mg/dl) levels. Her children displayed mildly reduced plasma HDL-C levels， slightly elevated TGs and normal LDL-C as well as total cholesterol. Details are listed in Table 1. Clinical presentation together with changes in plasma cholesterol distribution led to further genetic and functional analyses. c.1824delG) and her heterazygous， asymptomatic offspring.

The analyses of her offspring revealed heterozygous mutations at c.1824delG of the ABCA1 gene. The pedigree analysis highlighting the index patient and her heterozygous， asymptomatic offspring is shown in Figure 2A.\n\n【33】Availableliteraturesuggeststhat c.1776delC may cause a frameshift of the open reading frame at position p.593， leading to a premature stop codon after 15 changed amino acids ， hence inducing nonsense mediated decay. The NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) detected c.1776delC once in 8，246 alleles of European-American background with unclear putative relevance. Importantly， so far this mutation has not been described in other databases like Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD)， Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Database (dbSNP) or Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC).\n\n【34】The probable effect of c.1824delG is a frameshift of the open reading frame at position p.Thr609 as well as a premature stop codon after 26 changed amino acids . This variant has already been described in the dbSNP database (rs387906413) and listed in ClinVar and Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) as a pathogenic variant .\n\n【35】Functional cholesterolanalyses in peripheral blood mononuclearcells\n\n【36】Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) of the index patient， her children and four healthy volunteers were isolated to analyze cholesterol efflux capacity. ABCA1 protein expression was visualized using immunoblot analysis . Cholesterol efflux experiments were performed according to Demetz et al. ， Tancevski et al. ， and Duong et al.\n\n【37】The index patient not only showed decreased plasma HDL-Clevels， but also displayed a 50% lower cholesterol efflux capacity as compared to healthy controls . Both heterozygous children had 39% (daughter) and 58% (son) efflux capacity of healthy controls (100%). The index patient also presented with almost undetectable ApoA1 concentrations in plasma (<10 mg/dl). Of note， her daughter presented with mildly reduced ApoA1 concentrations (107 mg/dl)， whereas her son had normal plasma ApoA1 concentrations (165 mg/dl) . Further immunoblot analyses confirmed the absence of ABCA1 in PBMCs derived from the index patient. Her offspring had a lower expression of ABCA1 as compared to healthy controls . Finally， FPLC analysis of plasma from the index patient and her offspring confirmed pathological cholesterol distribution among different lipoproteins， mainly reflected by reduced HDL-C levels .\n\n【38】Discussion\n\n【39】Tangier Disease (TD) is an autosomal recessive disorder defined by significantly reduced levels of plasma HDL-C， typically leading to an accumulation of cholesterol esters in tissue. Common clinical features include lipid laden tonsils， intestinal lipid storage， recurrent peripherall neuropathy， hypocholesterolemia，and abnormal chylomicron remnants . Patients with TD are expected to have Loss of Function (LOF) mutations in both alleles of the ABCA1 gene.\n\n【40】Here we report on a 50-year old Caucasian patient with features typical of TD including splenomegaly and peripheral neuropathy. Laboratory studies showed undetectable plasma HDL-C， decreased total cholesterol and ApoA11 concentrations， elevated plasma triglycerides and thrombocytopenia. Histological findings of a surgically removed hamartoma of the chin showed deposition of fat droplets and infiltration with foam cells. Genetic analysis of the index patient revealed a compound heterozygosity for a novel mutation(c.1776delC) as well as an already known mutation (c.1824delG) affecting the ABCA1 gene， leading to the above mentioned clinical phenotype typical of TD. The offspring， both heterozygous for the already described c.1824delG， showed no clinical evidence for TD and had normal laboratory findings. Of note， cholesterol efflux from peripheral monocytes was significantly reduced in this family of three， however most markedly in the heterozygous index patient.\n\n【41】The human ABCA1 gene on chromosome 9q22-q31 contains50 exons and spans 150kb ， and at present， over 200 ABCA1mutations have been identified . Variants in the ABCAI gene can result in a broad spectrum of biochemical abnormalities， leading to many different clinical phenotypes in TD patients .\n\n【42】The exact clinical and biochemical significance of this novel mutation at position c.1776delC remains unclear， as both offspring were heterozygous for the previously described mutation at position c.1824delG.Also，unfortunately， no additional medical information is retrievable from the index patient's parents. Our findings suggest that the novel mutation may lead to a premature stop codon， yielding a non-functional protein reflected by absent ABCA1. As a consequence of that， HDL-associated components may be reduced， especially cholesterol and ApoA1， as was observed in the index patient.\n\n【43】Available literature suggests that heterozygous relatives of TD patients may present with an intermediate TD phenotype characterized by aberrant laboratory， but normal clinical findings. Typical laboratory findings may include HDL-C concentrations amounting to 50% of those of healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Of note， impaired cholesterol efflux capacity， as detected in the offspring of our index-patient， might be associated with an increased risk for coronary artery disease even in heterozygous patients . These findings clearly underline the importance of raising clinical awareness towards not only patients presenting with obvious clinical and laboratory aberrations typical of TD， but also towards respective clinically asymptomatic relatives. These patients may present with only mild laboratory aberrations in need of more frequent or thorough follow-up investigations to avoid long-term complications and severe cardiovascular disease.\n\n【44】In summary， this case-study expands the knowledge on mutations causing TD. We were able to characterize the impact of a novel ABCAlmutation on cholesterol efflux capacity， a major pathway in HDL particle synthesis and RCT. The findings of this report suggest that even asymptomatic relatives of patients affected by TD may benefit of thorough work-up and regular follow-up visits to avoid long-term complications.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:33:17", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:33:32", "cost": 15.623}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:42", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:33:32", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:33:16"}

In that hospitalization the coronarography was normal.\n\n【11】He was then fine until he received the first dose of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-1273 vaccine. Based on the clinical history and available data， anti-inflammatory treatment (acetylsalicylic acid1.5 g/day) associated with colchicine (0.5 mg/day) was started. The patient's symptoms subsided over the next 24 h and the ECG showed partial resolution of the ST-segment changes， with the appearance of negative T waves in the precordial leads. CMR was performed 72 h after admission confirmed diagnosis of recurrent myocarditis highlighting the presence of myocardial edema of the apex on T2-weighted sequences with suppression of adipose tissue  and subepicardial late-enhancement  localized in the inferior apical wall. Stroke volume and functional data analysis were normal. Investigations concerning viral serology and PCR screening for the main cardiotropic viruses， as well as for SARS-CoV-2(on a new oropharyngeal sample) were negative. Due to thelow-risk profile and favorable clinical course， the endomyocardial biopsy was not considered. Symptoms resolved completely within three days and the patient was discharged on day 9 on anti-inflammatory therapy with normalized hsTnT and CRP of 20.26 mg/L， and with a scheduled six-month follow-up with a new CMR evaluation.\n\n【12】Vaccine-related myocarditis has been reported since 2003in healthy people after smallpox vaccination . Several cases of myocarditis associated with COVID-19 mRNA vaccines have recently been observed. Most of these cases are described in young males patients， invariably presented with chest pain， usually 2 to3 days after a second dose of mRNA vaccination， with evidence of elevated cardiac troponin levels myocarditis . The mechanism of vaccine-induced myocarditis has not been clearly identified. It seems that the very high levels of antibodies that the second dose of this vaccine generates in young people can lead to an excessive immune reaction that could affect the heart .\n\n【13】In our young patient， the causal nature of recurrent acute myocarditis remains elusive， but the event appears to be very peculiar as it occurred after the first dose of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-1273vaccine in a subject with a history of previously healed myocarditis. Furthermore， the clinical course of our patient was mostly benign(with a spontaneous resolution and a preserved left ventricular function) but limited information is available about the long-term sequela of recurrent myocarditis .\n\n【14】Almost all patients had resolution of symptoms and signs， and improvement in diagnostic markers and imaging with or without treatment. Despite rare cases of myocarditis， the benefit-risk assessment for COVID-19 vaccination shows a favorable balance for all age and sex groups； therefore vaccination remain currently recommended for everyone 12 years of age and older . Studies are needed to elucidate the incidence， risk factors including genetic predisposition， prognosis， potential mechanisms， and reasons for sex differences， clinical course， treatment strategies， and long-term impact of myocarditis following COVID-19 vaccination.\n\n【15】Our case， however， adds practical questions concerning warning and above all on timing about SARS-CoV-2 prophylactic vaccination in young people with a history of myocardial or pericardial inflammatory disease.\n\n【16】Learning Points\n\n【17】1.COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective reduce the risk of people spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 and preventing especially severe illness and death.\n\n【18】2. 2) Myocarditis and/or pericarditis were reported following vaccination with all COVID-19 vaccines especially in young health men who had received their second dose of vaccine.\n\n【19】3.

The murmur was heard loudest at the left sternal edge， radiating throughout the precordium. Despite being clinically well with normal pulses and saturations， an early echocardiogram was arranged as the murmur sounded pathological. Echocardiogram revealed moderate stenosis of the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). Repeat ECHO two weeks later showed dramatic increase in narrowing of the RVOT prompting urgent tertiary referral. Radiological investigations revealed a tumour within the anterior mediastinum compressing the RVOT.\n\n【2】Excision of the tumour showed that it arose from within the myocardium. A histological diagnosis of cardiac fibroma was made.\n\n【3】Primary paediatric cardiac tumours are extremely rare. Much of the information we know is derived from case reports. Here， we aim to add to that reservoir， and draw attention to a very uncommon cause of very a common sign (heart murmurs).\n\n【4】Background\n\n【5】Primary paediatric cardiac tumours are extremely rare with a frequency of0.0017 to 0.02%. Due to their rarity， much of the clinical information we have is derived from case reports. The lack of knowledge in this area combined with the variability in presentation of cardiac tumours makes them a challenge to diagnose.\n\n【6】With this case report we aim to add to the clinical knowledge of cardiac tumours. In addition， we want to draw attention to this very rare cause of heart murmurs.\n\n【7】A term neonate， fit and well， was found to have a heart murmur during a routine neonatal check on day 1 of life. Father was known to have a heart murmur as a child that had resolvedspontaneously.TTherewasnosignificant family history of heart disease. Maternalserologyduring pregrancy and antenatal scans were normal On examination， the child was pink， warm and well perfused with saturations of 98% on air. Heart sounds I+II were normal with a harsh ejection systolic murmur (grade 3/6)，loudest at the left sternal edge but heard throughout the precordium. Femoral pulses were palpable bilaterally with normal character. Respiratory examination was unremarkable with no signs of increased work of breathing. No respiratory distress， sweating or colour change was observed during bottle-feeding. Abdomen was soft， non-tender， no organomegaly， and bowel sounds present. As per unit protocol， the baby was observed overnight on the postnatal ward and reassessed the following morning. Failure of the murmur to resolve over a 24 hour period led to further assessments， in line with hospital guidelines， to identify the aetiology. Pre and post-ductal saturations (98% and 96% respectively) and pre and post-ductal blood pressure (78/52 mm and 97/46 mm respectively) were checked and were normal. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was also done and reported as normal.\n\n【8】The guideline recommends arranging a review in the paediatric clinic in 2 to 3 weeks if the murmur persists but the baby is clinically normal and investigations unremarkable. Although this would have been the recommended action， a clinical decision was made to undertake an echocardiogram in view of the character and grade of murmur， which suggested the possibility of a pathologic murmur secondary to a congenital heart defect.\n\n【9】The echocardiogram revealed normal sitils， normal atrioventricular and ventriculo- arterial connections. Atrial septum and ventricular septum were intact and arterial duct was not patent. No left ventricular outflow obstruction was noted. However， turbulence and acceleration of flow at the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) was detected， suggesting narrowing of the RVOT. The RVOT Doppler was 3.4m/sec leading to a diagnosis of moderate pulmonary stenosis.\n\n【10】Although the echocardiographic diagnosis by itself did not prompt an early review in view of the age of the child， an earlier follow up of two weeks was arranged.\n\n【11】At followup， the patient remained clinically well and asymptomatic. Saturations were 97% on air and cardiac and systemic examinationwas as before. However， repeat echocardiogram revealed that the narrowing of the right ventricular outflow tract had increased significantly with a RVOT Doppler of more than 4m/sec. Moreover， the right ventricular out flow tract was noted to be narrow and elongated with an abnormal squashed appearance . The accelerated change in the degree of stenosis combined with the unusual appearance of the RVOT，led to the patient being referred to a tertiary paediatric cardiology centre for urgent assessment.\n\n【12】Investigations\n\n【13】At the tertiary centre a repeat echocardiogram confirmed the suspicious findings and furtherurgent radiological investigations were arranged. Chest X-ray showed a prominent superior mediastinum. The CT scan revealed a single， discrete mass lesion lying in the anterior mediastinum measuring 17x20x27mm. The mass was seen to be compressing the RVOT and sub-valvar pulmonary trunk . Differential diagnosis for the mass was a thymic cyst or teratoma(although no intralesional fat or calcification was visible). MRI scan was requested for further information however， the origin of the mass was inconclusive. Neither imagining could determine whether the mass was intra or extra-cardiac in origin .\n\n【14】Treatment\n\n【15】In1light of theaccelerated d growthhof the mass and failure to determineits originnandprimary source， surgical exploration and excision of the tumour Was decided with patch repair of the rightventricular outflow tract The procedure involved creating a median sternotomy in order to gain access and visualization. A subtotal thymectomy was then performed. Cardiopulmonary bypass was established between the ascending aorta and bicaval cannulation. Upon establishment， the aorta was cross-clamped and the heart arrested with cold crystalloid cardioplegia administered via the aortic root. The RVOT was identified and the tumour completely excised using sharp dissection and diathermy. Consequently， a large defect remained in the RVOT， immediately beneath the pulmonary valve. This was repaired using a patch of bovine pericardium. Finally， the heart was de-aired and the cross clamp removed with a vent on the aortic root. The heart was weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass， following rewarming， in sinus rhythm. No inotropic support was required.\n\n【16】Findings from the procedure revealed that the thymus was normal in appearance and the mass clearly arose from within the myocardium of the RVOT with the left arterial descending artery to the left and a marginal branch of the right coronary artery to the right of the mass. The tumour was noted to have a bosselated surface， to be well demarcated and closely adherent to the myocardium at the edges with no true plane between them. Histology report revealed that the mass was a cardiac fibroma.\n\n【17】Outcome and follow-up\n\n【18】Surgery was successful and on post-op review the child was fit and well. On examination he was pink and well perfused. Saturations of 98% and heart sounds I+II present with no added sounds. Echocardiogram showed good biventricular function with laminar flow in the right ventricular outflow tract. No compression was detected and there was no evidence suggestive of cardiac tumour or pericardial effusion.\n\n【19】Discussion\n\n【20】Primary cardiac tumours within the paediatric community are rare， with a prevalence of 0.0017 to 0.02%. They are particularly uncommon in infancy with a handful of case reports describing them. Most of the tumours are benign with rhabdomyomas， fibromas and teratomas accounting for the majority of cases .\n\n【21】Due to the rarity and variability in presentation of cardiac tumours， they pose a clinical challenge to diagnose. Heart murmurs on the other hand are verycommon in children and infants (including neonates) and are often innocent or secondary to congenital heart disease. It is not usual for a diagnosis of cardiac tumour to be considered by the clinician who on auscultation discovers that a child has a heart murmur.\n\n【22】Presentation depends on the size and location of the mass rather than the histologic type as they have a tendency to produce obstruction of the inflow or outflow tracts or induce arrhythmias. Cyanosis， breathlessness and ventricular arrhythmias have all been described as presenting features . The symptoms and signs created by the cardiac tumour can also be used to clinically speculate whether it is arising from the right or left hand side ofthe heart. Right-sided cardiac tumours are likely to present with associated syncope， cyanosis， vena-cava shunt syndrome， pulmonary embolisms and/or pericardial effusions . On the other hand， left sided tumours are likely to result in embolisation causing transient ischaemic attacks， seizures， and/or peripheral vascular and/or cerebral vascular accidents with the above mentioned symptoms as it often leads to a thorough assessment including cardiac imaging. It is a much greater challenge in the asymptomatic child where the clinical condition is unlikely to trigger prompt cardiac imaging. Worryingly， sudden death is recognized as a presenting feature suggesting that children with cardiac tumours may have no clinical clues before presenting with Lrecc catastrophic collapse. Certainly fibromas have been recognized to present with significant cardiac compromise including sudden death. A very similar， but symptomatic case (with cyanosis and progressive dyspnoea)， has been described involving an 8-month old infant with RVOT obstruction secondary to a large cardiac fibroma (5x4.5cm).\n\n【23】In our case， although the baby was asymptomatic，the pathologic nature of the murmur and the age at presentation prompted an early echocardiographic assessment and early diagnosis.\n\n【24】Echocardiogram， CT and MRI scans are first line in providing diagnosticCinformationforevaluation of cardiactumours. Echocardiogram allows for a dynamic， structural view of the heart aiding in identifying any masses alongside evaluating the mobility of the tumour. In addition， it allows one to view the effect that the tumour is having upon the surrounding structures . MRI is generally a better imaging modality than CT although both are of value. Diagnosing the type of tumour can be more reliably made with a MRI scan as the T1 and T2 weighted sequences can give clues about the microenvironment within the tumour . PET scan， coronary angiogram and transvenous biopsy are also useful diagnostic tests depending on the clinical context . Histological diagnosis however， remains the gold standard for determining the type of tumour.\n\n【25】Fibromas are the second most common cardiac tumours in infancy but rank first in surgical series . They often arise within the ventricular muscle， most commonly the ventricular septum although can also arise from within the free walls of the ventricles . Unlike rhabdomyomas， they do not spontaneously resolve . They can cause obstruction to blood flow， valvular dysfunction， arrhythmias， syncope and/or sudden death in 10-30% of cases . Of arrhythmias associated with cardiac fibromas， ventriculartachycardia accounts for50% 13. Although for many cardiac tumours， especially rhabdomyomas， watchful waiting is an acceptable management option， surgery， if needed， is usually safe and definitive . However， watchful waiting is not applicable to fibromas which are not known to undergo spontaneous regression . In fact， in the case of cardiac fibromas， surgery should be offered early because of their tendency to grow fast and cause severe haemodynamic complications. Ideally complete surgical resection with chamber reconstruction using pericardial patch should be done and this was achieved in our case. However， excellent midterm results have been achieved even with partial resection and hybrid procedures using BT shunt or bidirectional cavopulmonary connection to offload the right ventricle . In cases with persistent arrhythmias in the setting of a non- resectable tumour，ICD implantation may be needed. Rarely the only treatment option possible may be cardiac transplantation .\n\n【26】Learning Points\n\n【27】1. Although rare， cardiac tumours should be considered in the differential diagnosis of paediatric cases presenting with unexplained murmurs， heart failure or arrhythmia.\n\n【28】2. Once a diagnosis of a cardiac tumour is suspected prompt and thorough assessment using a variety of cardiac imaging modalities including echocardiography， CT and MRI scanning should be arranged in a tertiary cardiac centre. This is important as some of the cardiac tumours can grow rapidly with significant development of cardiac compromise and even sudden death.\n\n【29】3. Cardiac tumours have the potential to cause serious cardiac compromise and death but if diagnosed in a timely manner and managed appropriately with surgical intervention the prognosis is good in most cases.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:08:38", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:08:58", "cost": 19.901}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:42", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:08:57", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:08:37"}

Acute coronary syndrome with ST segment elevation remains the ultimate medical emergency. However， acute coronary syndrome without ST segment elevation (NSTE-ACS) has an equivalent prognosis risk. The major challenge of the emergency physician is the rapid and accurate identification of patients with ACS who would benefit from immediate care.\n\n【2】Objective： Evaluation of our practices according to European Recommendations for management of NSTE-ACS and assessment of short and long term prognosis for Major Cardiovascular Events(MACE).\n\n【3】Methods： This is an analytical study， involving 850 patients treated for NSTE-ACS during a period of 2 years in our emergency department. The data was collected from our local register for acute coronary syndrome： ReSCUS register. The main results were： the different delays for medical care， length of stay in the emergency department， short-term complications and the occurrence of MACE registered at one month， six months， and one year later.\n\n【4】Results： The average age of our patients was 64 ±11 years. The sex ratio was 2.22. Hypertension and diabetes are the two most common risk factors in our population. NSTE-ACS was inaugural in almost the third of the cases. Only 7% of our patients have benefited from medical transport. In16.20% of patients， the initial ECG found no repolarization disorder. The average delay of the first medical contact was 24.42 ±30.25 min. The average delay for the first qualifying ECG was 30 ±0.6min. The average length of stay in the emergency department before admission to the cardiology department was 24.13 ±21.33 h. More than half of our study population (68%) performed their in上angiograms within 48 h. During our follow-up of 500 patients， 12 patients were completely lost.

Ann Clin Case Rep.\n\n【8】Introduction\n\n【9】Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide especially in low-income and middle-income countries. It is now admitted that there is a strong association between CVD morbi-mortality and socio-economic status. This has been attributed both to higher prevalence， poor control of cardiac risk and to unequal access to health care facilities. However， most of these studies were carried out in high income countries and only few studies from low-and middle income countries which have the highest burden of CVD. In Tunisia， an increasing country， acute coronarysyndromes： Both with and without ST segment elevations are the most interesting CVD in emergency practice. But the data according to their characteristics， management and outcomes are lacking. In this paper， we will try to analyze the epidemiological profile of patients， the strategy and the different delays for medical care of NSTE-ACS from our local register as well as their short and long term outcomes.\n\n【10】It is now admitted that adherence to guidelines has been correlated with improvements in patient outcomes in ACS，including reduced mortality， improving short and long-term outcomes and so reduced health care costs .\n\n【11】Materiel and Methods\n\n【12】This is an analytical transversal study，carried out in theemergency department of SAHLOUL，relating to patients treated for NSTE-ACS during the study period from 01/01/2015 to 31/12/2016. We analyzed the data from our local Registry of Acute Coronary Syndrome(ReSCUS). In brief， this registry is a continually ongoing mono-center registry that prospectively collects information regarding all patients presenting with Acute Coronary Syndrome managed in our emergency department (STEMI and NSTE-ACS). Only data of patients with NSTE-ACS were selected for this study.\n\n【13】We included all patients consulting for chest pain and for whom the diagnosis of NSTE-ACS was retained according to the definition established by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC). This definition is based on clinical， electrical and biological criteria.\n\n【14】Non-inclusion criteria\n\n【15】Patients with an STMI or other etiologies of chest pain： Our primary endpoint was to identify predictors of Major cardiovascular events(mortality， recurrence of NSTMI， STEMI， and Acute Congestive Heart Failure) in short and long term. The secondary endpoint was to describe the epidemiological characteristics of these patients and the quality of medical care in emergency department. The data were collected on pre-established sheets.\n\n【16】Statistical analysis\n\n【17】All analyses were performed with the SPSS statistical software.\n\n【18】Results\n\n【19】A total of 850 patients who had presented to the emergency department of SAHLOUL for NSTE-ACS were assessed for eligibility，12 ofwhom were lost to follow-up，and only 500 patients were enrolled because of the incomplete data. The average age of our patients was64±11 years. The majority of our population was over the age of 40(99%) and patients over the age of 65 accounted for 44.8%. The sex ratio was 2.22. Hypertension and diabetes are the two most common risk factors in our population. Acute coronary syndrome without ST segment elevation was inaugural in almost the third of the cases(40.6%). A history of NSTE-ACS is found in (41.8%). Revascularized myocardial infarction was found in 17.6%. Twenty-two patients had a history of chronic kidney disease (4.4%). Five of our patients had a history of ischemic stroke or obliterating arterial disease of the lower limbs. Only 7% of our patients have benefited from transportation by the mobile emergency and resuscitation service team， while the majority： 93% were taken to the emergency department by their own means of transport or by a category B ambulance. In our study population 67%(N=335) of our patients had a chest pain score between 2 and 4， hence considered to be of intermediate risk and 33%(N=165) had a chest pain score ≥5， therefore considered to be ofhigh risk and none of our patients were of low risk (Score <2). Regarding the TIMI risk score， 20.2% were in group 1 (TIMI score： 0 to 2， low risk)， 41.4% were in group 2 (TIMI score： 3 to 4， intermediate risk) and 38.4% were in group 3 (TIMI score： 5 to 7， high risk). For 81patients (16.20%) the initial ECG found no repolarization disorder. The mean initial glucose level was 10.31 mmol/L± 5.2 with a median of 8.5 mmol/L (6.5 to 12.5). The mean initial creatinine level was95.93 meq/l± 60.07 with a median of 81 (.5). For cardiac ultrasound data， all the patients included in the study underwent a cardiac ultrasound after their admission to the cardiology department on the second or third day of their hospitalization. The majority of our patients (95.5%) had an ejection fraction>40% and 12 patients(2.4%) had an ejection fraction ≤ 40% (12 patients were lost to follow-up). All the patients included in this study received triple anti-ischemic therapy： two platelet aggregation inhibitors： 250 mg(Aspirin)， clopidogrel 300 mg or 75 mg for patients over 75 years and Table 1： Clinical and demographic characteristics of the population.\n\n| Age  | 64±11 ans  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Gender  | Male  | 69%  |\n| Gender  | Fe male  | 31%  |\n| Risk factors  | Hypertension  | 56.6%  |\n| Risk factors  | Diabetes  | 50.2%  |\n| Risk factors  | Smoking  | 41.6%  |\n| Risk factors  | Dyslipidemia  | 23.4%  |\n| coronary history  | None  | 40.6%  |\n| coronary history  | ACS non STEMI  | 41.8%  |\n| coronary history  | ACS STEMI  | 17%  |\n| Other antecedents  | Renal failure  | 4.4%  |\n| Other antecedents  | Stroke/ arteriopathy of the lower limb  | 0.2%  |\n| Mode of transport  | The Mobile Emergency and Resuscitation Service  | 7%  |\n| Mode of transport  | Type B Ambulance or by their own means  | 93%  |\n| Chest pain Score  | Between0 et 1  | 0%  |\n| Chest pain Score  | Between 2 et 4  | 67%  |\n| Chest pain Score  | More than or equal to 5  | 33%  |\n| TIMI Risk Score  | Between 0 et 2  | 20.2%  |\n| TIMI Risk Score  | Between 3 et 4  | 41.4%  |\n| TIMI Risk Score  | More than or equal to 5  | 38.4%  |\n| ECG data  | Normal  | 16.2%  |\n| ECG data  | ST segment depression  | 66.8%  |\n| ECG data  | Negative Twave  | 19%  |\n| Biomarkers：Troponin  | Troponin 1  | 0.12(0.5)  |\n| Biomarkers：Troponin  | Troponin 2  | 0.35(0.32)  |\n| Biomarkers：Troponin  | Delta troponin  | 0.1(.85)  |\n| Biology  | Creatinin  | 95.93 meg/l± 60.07  |\n| Biology  | Glycemia  | 10.31 mmol/ ±5.2  |\n| Echocardiographic  | Ejection Fraction >40%  | 95.5%  |\n| data  | Ejection Fraction ≤ 40%  | 2.4%  |\n| Treatment  | DL-LYSINE ACETYLSALICYLATE250mg  | 100%  |\n| Treatment  | Clopidogrel 300 mg or 75 mg  | 100%  |\n| Treatment  | Heparin  | 100%  |\n| Orientation  | Admission to a cardiology department  | 98.2%  |\n| Orientation  | Home discharge  | 1.8%  |\n| Angiographic data  | Monotruncular involvement  | 47.8%  |\n| Angiographic data  | Bitruncular invol vement  | 12.4%  |\n| Angiographic data  | Tritruncular invol vement  | 6.4%  |\n| Angiographic data  | Normal angiography  | 33.4%  |\n\n【21】Table 2： Major cardiovascular events in short and long term.\n\n| Major Acute Cardiovascular Events (MACE)  | 01 month  | 06 month  | 01 vear  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Total rate  | 11.6%  | 22.4%  | 27.2%  |\n| Lost to follow up  | 2.4%  |  |  |\n| Mortality at one month  | 0.8%  | 2.3%  | 3.4%  |\n| Myocardial infarction  | 4.4%  | 3.2%  | 1.2%  |\n| Anginal reccurence  | 5%  | 10%  | 15.8%  |\n| Acute congestive heart failure  | 1.4%  | 5.6%  | 6.8%  |\n\n【23】Table 3： Time delay of in hospital care.\n\n| Time from the occurrence of chest pain to arrival at the  |  | 248.7±212.09mn  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| first care facility  |  | 248.7±212.09mn  |  |\n| Time of first time contact  |  | 24.42±30.25 min  |  |\n| Time to qualifying ECG  |  | 30 min ±0.6  |  |\n| length of stay in emergency department  |  | 24.13 hours ±21.33  |  |\n| Time to perform angiography/angioplasty  |  | <48 h (68%)  |  |\n| Time to perform angiography/angioplasty  |  | 48h-7h(24.4%)  |  |\n| Time to perform angiography/angioplasty  |  | >7 h (7.6%)  |  |\n\n【25】an anticoagulant： Unfractionated heparin (NFH) 50 mg， then Low Molecular Weight Heparins (LMWH) 1 mg/kg (twice a day) with systematic adjustment of doses according to age and renal function.\n\n【26】Most of our patients (98.2%) were transferred to the cardiology department， (1.8%) were referred to the outpatient cardiology department. The average time between the onset of pain and the patient's arrival at the first medical care was 248.7 ±212.09 min. In our study， 51% consulted between 2 and 6 h and only 26.6% consulted within 2 h after the start of chest pain. The average delay between the time the patient arrived in the Emergency Room (ER) and the first medical contact at the triage unit was 24.42±30.25 min (ranging from0 minto 295 min). The average time to have the 1st qualifying ECG was30±0.6 min. The average length of stay in the ER before admission to the cardiology department was 24.13±21.33 h and a median of 18 h. The coronary status of patients undergoing angiography was： Mono-trunk involvement in 47.8%， bi-trunk involvement in12.4%， tri-trunk involvement in 6.4% but in 33.4% the angiography was normal (or infiltrated networks without significant stenosis). The MACE rate at 30 days 6 and 12 months is shown in the Table 2. During our follow-up of 500 patients 12 patients were completelylost to follow-up. At 1 month， 58(11.6%) patients presented with MACE， four (0.8%) patients had died，22 (4.4%) patients had an MI， anginal recurrence was observed in 25 (5%) patients and seven (1.4%) of the patients had an acute edema of the lung/a congestive heart failure. At 6 months， 112 (22.4%) had MACE， only 14 (2.8%) patients had died， 16 (3.2%) patients had suffered from a myocardial infarction. The most common MACE was recurrent ACS ST-， from which 54(10.8%) patients had suffered and 28 (5.6%) of patients presented acute heart failure. At 1 year， 136 (27.2%) patients had MACE， 17(3.4%) patients died，6 (1.2%) patients had a myocardial infarction，79 (15.8%) patients had recurrent acute coronary syndrome and 34(6.8%) patients presented acute heart failure. The main risk predictors for the occurrence of MACE was TIMI Risk SCORE >3， chest pain SCORE， age ≥65 years and a history of coronary artery disease . The rate of MACE according to time from the occurrence of chest pain to arrival at the first care facility is represented in Table 5. Table6 represents the rate of MACE according to time of first medical contact. And finally the rate of MACE according to time to perform angiography/angioplasty was represented in the Table 7.\n\n【27】Table 4： Predictors of MACE in one year of follow-up.\n\n| Predictors of MACE  |  | P  | OR CI %]  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Age≥ 65 years  |  | <0.001  | 2.514   |  |\n| Renal failure  |  | 0.007  | 3.783|  |\n| Diabetes  |  | 0.011  | 1.592   |  |\n| Dyslipidemia  |  | 0.009  | 1.745|  |\n| Hypertension  |  | 0.050  | 1.423   |  |\n| History of bypass/ Angioplasty  |  | 0.002  | 1.771  |  |\n| TIMI Score >3  |  | <0.001  | 2.745   |  |\n| Chest Pain Score  |  | <0.001  | 3.014  |  |\n| History of coronary disease  |  | 0.001  | 1.819|  |\n\n【29】Table 5： Rate of MACE according to time from the occurrence of chest pain to arrival at the first care facility.\n\n| MACE  |  |  |  | No MACE  | P  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Duration (min)  | Average  | 239.9±197.9  |  | 258.6±225.2  | 0.335  |\n| Duration (min)  | Median  | 180   |  | 195.5  | 0.335  |\n| Delay (min)  | <120 min  | 63  |  | 66  |  |\n| Delay (min)  | 120-360 min  | 108  |  | 141  | 0.587  |\n| Delay (min)  | >360 min  | 51  |  | 59  |  |\n\n【31】Table 6： Rate of MACE according to time of first medical contact.\n\n| MACE  |  |  | No MACE  | P  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Duration (min)  | Average  | 20.83±20  | 26.71±35  | 0.029  |\n| Duration (min)  | Mecian  | 15  | 15  | 0.029  |\n| Delay  | <10 min  | 71  | 94  | 0.011  |\n| Delay  | 10-30 min  | 115  | 105  | 0.011  |\n| Delay  | >30 min  | 36  | 67  | 0.011  |\n\n【33】Table 7： Rate of MACE according to time to perform angiography/angioplasty.\n\n| MACE  |  |  | No MACE  | P  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Duration (days)  | Average (DS)  | 3.29±5.83  | 2.89±5.66  | 0.447  |\n| Duration (days)  | Median (IQR)  | 2  | 1  | 0.447  |\n| Delay  | ≤48h  | 152  | 181  | 0.920  |\n| Delay  | >48h  | 70  | 85  | 0.920  |\n\n【35】Discussion\n\n【36】The average age， in the French FAST-MI 2015 register， was 68 ±14 years. According to Eisenmann et al.  age is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The epidemiology of our population is also similar， in our study the average age is 64±11 years. In western countries， hypertension is the first cardiovascular risk factor found in patients suffering from coronary disease： 24% in the USA while in our results this prevalence was 56.6%. For diabetes， numerous studies have concluded that patients with diabetes presented more frequently tritruncular involvement with an often poor quality downstream bed. In our series， 50.2% of patients were diabetic. Thus，the majority of Tunisian studies indicate the high prevalence of this risk factor. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) was the largest study interested in diabetic patients. In this study， conducted between 1977 and 1991， including 5，102 patients aged from 25to 65 years with type 2 diabetes， according to the criteria of the American Diabetic Association， have been followed for 20 years. It has thus been shown that coronary artery disease is the main cause of death in type 2 diabetes and 11% ofpatients developed myocardial infarction or angina over a median of 8 years . In our study， the average consultation time was 249 min. This delay is relatively long compared to those observed in the European， North American and Middle Eastern registers. We found a delay of 145 min in the European Heart Surveys 2，150 min in the SPACE register ， and180 min in the PRAISE-UK register . This can be improved by raising public awareness so that they consult as soon as possible in the event of chest pain， especially in the presence of cardiovascular risk factors. The HAS recommends a delay less than thirty minutes . In our study， the average time for triage was 24.42 min. There was a significant difference between the group with MACE and the group without MACE during one year of follow-up with a P=0.029 but no significant difference between the group of survivors and the group of non survivors. It is recommended to do an ECG within 10 min of the first medical contact . In our study， this delay is 30 min.\n\n【37】In our study 68% of patients had their angioplasty done in less than 48 h. Experts noted that the decision to invasive or conservative strategy of NSTE-ACS and the timing of angiography is based on the patient's risk stratification.\n\n【38】According to the AHA recommendations， an invasive strategy is indicated within 72 h after the onset of symptoms in the presence of a criterion of high risk and/or recurrence of symptoms (Grade I-A). In case of very high ischemic risk (refractory angina， acute heart failure， threatening ventricular disorders， hemodynamic instability)， a coronary angiography must be performed within 2 h (Grade I-C). In addition， an early invasive strategy (<24 h) is recommended in the event ofa GRACE score>140 or in the presence of atleast one high risk criterion (Grade I-A) . If we follow the ESC recommendations，an invasive strategy， when decided， should be completed within 72 h. By comparing ourselves to the recommended deadlines， our results are generally satisfactory， regardless of the risk of our patients.\n\n【39】Conclusion\n\n【40】The obiectives of this work were the assessment of our practices compared to those recommended and the assessment of short and long-term prognosis regarding major cardiovascular events. The statistical analyzes carried out in our study do not allow us to establish a causal link between most of the risk factors and mortality or MA CE. There is an urgent need for a national register to generalize our results and compare them with international registers for evaluation. Efforts remain to be made to improve our overall management of NSTE-ACS and to further improve the long-term prognosis of our patients.\n\n【41】Interests and Limitations\n\n【42】Our study is subject to several limits： It is a single-center study， not consecutive. Our observations relate to the practices observed， within the Emergency Department of Sahloul University Hospital and a large group of patients were excluded because incomplete data.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:46:04", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:46:39", "cost": 34.406}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:42", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:46:38", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:46:03"}

Some frequently associated complications include UPJ obstruction， recurrent urinary tract infections， lithiasis and tumors. The occurrence of nephrotic lesions in horseshoe kidneys is extremely rare with a very few reported and biopsy proven cases. We report a case ofan 18 year old boy who was initially diagnosed with hydronephrosis associated with horseshoe kidneys and then 3 years later developed Nephrotic syndrome， with biopsy findings of Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】Initial presentation\n\n【4】In this case report， a 14 year old Asian male child presented to us in September， 2017 with the complaints of pain in the left lumbar region for the last 1 month. With the lab workup unremarkable and an ultrasonographic scan was obtained which revealed a grade 3 hydronephrosis. An IVP performed suggested of horseshoe renal anatomy with grade 2 hydronephrosis on the right side and dilated renal pelvis on the left side with bilaterally normal excreting kidneys. A non-contrast CT scan was obtained which suggested presence of horseshoe kidneys with bilateral hydronephrosis(Right more than Left) along with UPJ obstruction.9mTc scan was suggestive of slow draining right kidney. The child was managed for his symptoms and advised follow up after 6 months.\n\n【5】First diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome\n\n【6】The child presented 3 years later (August， 2020)， at 17 years of age with the complaints of periorbital edema for the past 1 week and abdominal dissension for the last 5 days. Physical examination showed a blood pressure of 130/90 mmHg， with the other vitals being stable.\n\n【7】Laboratory work up was ordered and revealed the following： Hemoglobin 13.5 g/dL，TLC 7.2 m/mm， Fasting Blood Sugar 100 mg/dL， Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate 55， Blood Urea Nitrogen19 mmol/L， Serum Creatinine 0.8 mg/dL， Serum Na+ 133.6 mEq/L， Serum K+ 4.33 mEq/L， Uric Acid 5.5 mmol/L， SGOT/SGPT 38/26， Total protein 3.3 g/dL， Albumin 1.3 g/dL， Cholesterol 341mg/dL， Triglycerides 193 mg/dL， LDL 255 mg/dL， HDL 74 mg/dL， Urine Protein+++， Urine Culture Sensitivity-Sterile，ANA-Negative， C3 & C4-Normal Levels， [HIV， Hep B， Hep C]-Non Reactive. Chest X-ray -NAD， Montoux-Non reactive， CBNAAT for Mycobacterium tuberculosis-Not Detected. The blood coagulation function ofthe patient was normal.\n\n【8】A diagnosis of Nephrotic Syndrome was established after infections and secondary causes were ruled out. An ultrasonography was performed， revealing gross ascites and horseshoe kidneys with parenchymatous band and bilateral hydronephrosis. Patient was initiated treatment with prednisolone at 60 mg/kg/mand within 3 days the patient responded adequately. He was discharged on 6 weeks (daily 60 mg/kg/m²) + 4 weeks (alternate 40 mg/kg/m)regimen. The patient defaulted at around 5 weeks into the treatment.\n\n【9】Relapse and biopsy confirmation\n\n【10】The child presented again in July， 2021 with similar complaints of periorbital edema and abdominal dissension. Investigations again revealed hypoalbuminemia， hyperlipidemia and +++proteinuria， suggestive of nephrotic syndrome. The blood pressure was recorded tobe 136/90 mmHg with other vitals being stable. Under ultrasound guidance， a renal biopsy was performed using a Renal Biopsy Gun. H&E， PAS，MT， Silver Methenamine and Congo red sections were studies.\n\n【11】Multiple sections included renal medulla and cortical parenchymal area containing up to 21 glomeruli. None globally sclerosed. The glomeruli revealed focal dilation and congestion of capillary lumina. 6 glomeruli revealed segmental tuft sclerosis with intraglomerular foam cell change . On immunostaining， IgA， IgG，IgM4，、 CC33。 C1q， Kappa Light Chain or Lambda Light Chain depositions were not found. There was no evidence of crescent formation， capillary wall thickening， tuft necrosis， congophillic deposits in the visualized glomeruli. The findings were suggestive of Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis involving 6/21 of sampled glomeruli.\n\n| Authors  | Sex  | Age  | Serum Creatinine  | Urine Protein  | Pathological Findings  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Chen et al.   | M  | 20  | 0.9 mg/dL  | 300 mg  | Membranous glomerulonephropathy  |\n| Abson et al.   | M  | 52  | 1.5 mg/dL  | 7.4 g/24h  | Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis  |\n| Fujimoto et al.  | M  | 48  | 0.7 mg/dL  | 0.6 g/24h  | Membranous glomerulonephropathy  |\n| Matyus et al.  | M  | 38  | 210 pmal/L  | 9 g/24h  | Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis  |\n| Alagozlu et al.  | F  | 18  | 0.8 mg/dL  | 8-14 g/24h  | Membranous glomerulonephropathy  |\n| Kavukcu et al.  | M  | 8  | 0.8 mg/dL  | 50 mg/m2/h  | Mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis  |\n| Kayatas et al.  | M  | 23  | 0.9 mg/dL  | 9.2 g/24h  | Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis  |\n| Kayatas et al.  | M  | 28  | 0.8 mg/dL  | 5.8 g/24h  | Renal amyloidosis  |\n| Rivera et al.  | M  | 38  | 1.6 mg/dL  | 18 g/24h  | Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis  |\n| Hu et al.  | F  | 15  | 66.9 pmol/L  | 1.7g/24h  | Henoch-Schonlein purpura nephritis  |\n| Hu et al.  | M  | 26  | 108.2 pmal/L  | 1.4 g/24h  | Immunoglobulin A nephropathy  |\n| Chaabouni et al.  | M  | 22  | 95 pmol/L  | 22 g/24h  | Minimal Change Disease  |\n| Shi SS et al.   | M  | 48  | 75 pmol/L  | 7.54 g/24h  | PLA2R-Positive Membranous Nephropathy  |\n\n【13】The patient was re-initiated on daily prednisolone therapy at 60mg/kg/m² and went into remission after 8 days. DVT prophylaxis， Rosuvastatin and Enalapril were also prescribed and the patient was discharged.\n\n【14】Discussion\n\n【15】One of the most frequent fusion malformations is horseshoe kidneys (1：400 people； twice as common in male as in females). Although it has been observed among monozygotic twins and siblings within the same family， no genetic factor has yet been found. Horseshoe kidneys are indolent in and of themselves， but because to their embryogenesis and anatomy， they are prone to a greater rate of illness than regular kidneys. It is characterized by fusion at the lower poles by parenchymatous or fibrous isthmus， resulting in malrotation. Midline fusion occurs in up to 42% of instances， with lateral fusion occurring in 58 percent of cases， of which 70% are left dominant. This further leads to incomplete cephalic migration of the kidneys as during ascent， the fused lower poles become trapped under the inferior mesenteric artery. Hence， the isthmus lies at L3-L4vertebral level， at the origin of IMA from the abdominal aorta. The pelvis and ureters are usually anteriorly/anteriomedially placed with the calyces pointing posteriorly. Associated ureteral compression is common(>35%) occurring due to anteriorly displaced ureter or from aberrant vessels leading to hydronephrosis， calculi formation and increased propensity for infections.\n\n【16】A horseshoe kidney with nephrotic syndromes is extremely rare. Primary causes of nephrotic syndrome include minimal change disease， focal segmental glomerulosclerosis， membranous glomerulonephritis； it can also be due to secondary causes such as drugs， vasculitis， amyloidosis， diabetes， allergens and toxins.\n\n【17】In our patient， a renal biopsy was performed and studied by experienceddoctors revealing multiple non-global segmental sclerotic changes in the glomeruli. A diagnosis of Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis was made and the patient was started on prednisolone，to whichhe respondedadequately. Further Rosuvastatin and Enalapril were also prescribed to manage hyperlipidemia and proteinuria respectively .\n\n【18】Conclusion\n\n【19】Previous studies were unable to elucidate the specific mechanism between the two pathologies and there is no evidence in the literature that horseshoe kidneys have a high rate of glomerulonephritis. The co-occurrence of two renal disorders in this patient could be just coincidental， but a study by Rivera F. et al， concluded that horseshoe kidneys could be associated with renaladenocarcinoma and nephrotic syndrome with FSGS， secondary to hyper-filtration that progresses to chronic renal failure. Further studies are needed to be certain； meanwhile one should keep in mind the possibility of renal disorders other than reflux nephropathy in patients with horseshoe kidney.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:30:28", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:31:20", "cost": 51.995}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:42", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:31:19", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:30:26"}

His inpatient stay was complicated with hematochezia on the background of a short history of watery diarrhea. An area of deep distal rectal ulceration was demonstrated on his colonoscopy which was later shown to be secondary to CMV infection. Although CMV co-infection with COVID-19 has been reported previously this is the first case describing a patient presenting with overt hematochezia.\n\n【2】Case Presentation\n\n【3】A 78 year old man presented to hospital in October 2020 with 24 h of worsening shortness of breath and 3 days of watery diarrhea. He had a history of hypertension and previous excision of a benign vocal cord lesion but took no regular medications. The gentleman lived in an apartment with his wife. He walked unaided and enjoyed regularly exercising at the gym. He had a Clinical Frailty Scale score of 2.\n\n【4】At admission he was hypoxic requiring 2 L/min of oxygen to maintain saturations ≥92%. Hematological and biochemical investigations showed raised inflammatory markers (CRP 178mg/L WCC 13.8×10/L Neutrophils 11.7×10/L). His CXR showed bilateral infiltrates suggestive of COVID pneumonitis. A SARS-CoV-2 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was positive. He was started on 6 mg daily of dexamethasone along with famotidine， benzylpenicillin and doxycycline. He was also started on remdesivir on day 2 of his admission.\n\n【5】On the 3d day of his admission he developed significant hematochezia with associated hemodynamic instability (BP 82/60 mmHg) and a hemoglobin drop from 149 g/L to 82 g/L. CT abdominal angiogram did not reveal a bleeding point at the time but did show blood in the rectum. He was treated conservatively with a blood transfusion and tranexamic acid. He had no further bleeding during his admission.\n\n【6】Urgent outpatient colonoscopy and showed a well demarcated area of almost circumferential deep ulceration situated around the anal margin suspicious for a neoplasm. Biopsies showed inflamed mucosa with granulation tissue. Immunohistochemistry showed scattered enlarged nuclei identified within the granulation tissue were strongly positive for CMV immunomarker， indicating CMV colitis .\n\n【7】On review 2 weeks after his colonoscopy his symptoms had resolved without any specific CMV targeted therapy.\n\n【8】Discussion\n\n【9】Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a member of the Herpesviridae family. Its seroprevalence in the population has been reported as over 70%. In immunocompetent individuals only a minority will present with clinical symptoms， in these cases mononucleosis like illness can be seen . Severe CMV infection or re-activation such as colitis or pneumonia is seen in immunocompromised adults.\n\n【10】CMV colitis can present with diarrhea and hematochezia， endoscopic appearances range from mucosal inflammation and edema to severe ulceration . CMV colitis in immunocompetent hosts is rare but documented in case reports . When seen there is often relative immunosuppression in some other form such as critical illness or diabetes .\n\n【11】Large systematic reviews have shown that 9% of patient with COVID-19 will experience diarrhea . CMV colitis has been reported in a critically unwell patient in COVID-19 in the intensive care unit with multi-organ failure . This patient developed abdominal distension in the absence of hematochezia； CMV was confirmed on colonic biopsy and responded to IV Ganciclovir. Our case is the second reported in the literature of CMV and COVID-19co-infection； the significantly different presentation and course is noteworthy.\n\n【12】Moss et al.  described an increased mortality in CMV seropositive patient with COVID-19. Although this may be related to the effects of CMV on the immune system，CMV re-activation was raised as a possible mechanism.\n\n【13】0ur patient's gastrointestinal symptoms predate the administration of steroids. Wehhypothesize that COVID-19infection has precipitated reactivation of CMV colitis which was then further exacerbated by administration of dexamethasone resulting in the presentation with hematochezia. With increasing use of immunomodulation in COVID-19 we hope this case will alert others to this observed association and there may be a potential role for using anti-viral agents in non-resolving cases. We suggest CMV should be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with lower GI bleeding in the context of COVID-19.", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 14:40:46", "endTime": "2024/09/20 14:40:53", "cost": 7.562}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:42", "update_time": "2024-09-19 22:40:53", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 22:40:44"}

Albendazole 400 mg is given once daily for 4 weeks with monthly follow up for 2 months. There was complete resolution of symptoms and complete disappearance of pleural cyst and serial hydatid antibody titer decline from 12.44 NTU to 2.6 NTU.\n\n【9】Discussion\n\n【10】Hydatid cyst is endemic in some part of world and is more common in rural area because of close contact with dogs and sheep. Hydatid cyst present more commonly in liver (75%) and followed by lung (15%) and other anatomical location (10%) . Hydatid pulmonary cyst are more common in posterior lower lobe than that in anterior location. Hydatid pleural cyst develops inside the parietal pleura but are outside visceral pleura. The unruptured one (uncomplicated) is diagnosed accidentally and has minimal or nil symptoms. Complicated one present with symptoms either because of enlargement or rupture of hydatid pleural cyst. Rupture may occur either in pericardium， lung， mediastinum， pleural cavity or in peritoneal cavity. Rupture of cyst either because of trauma or spontaneously may produce symptoms like chest pain， cough， hemoptysis， fever， breathlessness. Rupture of cyst in pleural cavity may cause empyema， pneumothorax， and effusion. Pleural effusion may get infected most commonly with Haemophilus influenzae . Diagnosis depends upon imaging procedure and is well supported by serological and histopathological investigation. Contrast enhanced computed tomography is the best technique to evaluate the location and extent of cyst with nearby structure and additional cyst if present which is not diagnosed in chest X-ray. Density of cyst wall is an important factor to differentiate it in between parasitic and non-parasitic. Hydatid cyst can be simple， complicated and ruptured one. On contrast enhanced computed tomography inverse crescent sign， signet ring sign are seen. Ruptured or complicated cyst in computed tomography appears as detached or collapsed endocytic membrane， collapsed daughter membrane ， calcification rarely occur in pulmonary hydatid cyst which is a common feather of liver hydatid cyst. For postsurgical residual lesions and recurrence magnet resonance imaging is better than computed tomography defined cystic lesian in right lower labe causing collapse of right upper &middle lobes with mediastinal shift towards left. scanning . Percutaneous aspiration of hydatid cyst fluid is not recommended because of risk of anaphylactic reaction and spillage of hydatid cyst content. Anaphylactic reaction occurs only there is direct contact of hydatid fluid and systemic circulation or only ifthe person is allergic to hydatid fluid. Characteristic of pleural fluid include eosinophilic predominance and hydatid cyst should be included in differential diagnosis in endemic areas. Surgical treatment is mandatory for ruptured or large cyst which includes complete excision of cyst with maximum preservation of lung parenchyma. Medical treatment includes Albendazole in a dose of 10 mg/kg of body weight for 3 to 4 weeks in specific cases. Depending on location of cyst in thorax various approaches has been postulated posterio-lateral approach is commoner one. One stage surgery is better than two stage surgery because of decreased morbidity， hospital stay and cost. Gold standard is radical removal of germinative membrane and pericyst through appropriate thoracic incision .", "tags": {}, "lang": "en", "attr": {}, "ext": null, "dataset": "accr", "batch_name": "20240422", "version": "version1"}, "result_info": {"text": [], "startTime": "2024/09/20 15:37:32", "endTime": "2024/09/20 15:58:46", "cost": 1273.919}, "finished": true, "dropped": false, "create_time": "2024-09-19 00:28:42", "update_time": "2024-09-19 23:58:46", "grab_time": "2024-09-19 23:37:32"}
